HEARING IS BELIEVING; DESPITE THEIR 'SUBURBAN CALIFORNIA WHITE CHICKS' IMAGE, 
THE SCARLETTS HAVE FOUND THEIR GROOVE IN A SOUL SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BARRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because four of the five Scarletts are women, the second thing you notice 
about them is their superb musicianship, which immedi ately marks them as 
seasoned pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the first thing you notice is that they're female (except for the 
drummer) and strikingly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentioning gender and looks in connection with professional skill is asking 
for trouble from the political correctness police, but not from the Scarletts, 
who casually refer to themselves as "chicks" or "girls" on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys come in when we're playing and order drinks," says keyboardist / singer 
Susie Davis, who is tall and slender with flowing black hair and a Vogue cover 
girl face. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start bouncing to the music," says Davis, 31, of North Hollywood, "then 
glance at us, and then go 'whoa!' -- like they can't believe what they're 
hearing is coming from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The incongruity of the band members' glamour, and their absolute, studio-grade 
mastery of their instruments, is unsettling. Except for drummer Kevin Austin, 
the Scarletts simply do not look like people who can flawlessly render the 
1960s soul sounds of Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye 
that dominate their repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scarletts enjoy the apparent contradiction between their looks and their 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not bad for a bunch of 'suburban California white chicks, huh?' " Davis jokes 
through the applause for the driving Wilson Pickett classic "Somethin' You Got" 
on a Saturday night at Residuals, the Studio City bar where the group plays 
alternate weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The point behind Davis' quip is that the industry is accustomed to all-girl 
rock bands whose playing, at best, is adequate. It is not used to hearing 
females tackling the highly challenging turf of soul music, which is most often 
played by males. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Being so close to the studios, our clientele is pretty musically hip," says 
Residuals owner Craig Tennis, "and they love the Scarletts." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone way beyond them being a girls' band who can play," says Tennis, "to 
being perceived as a great band of really terrific musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 A direct measure of the group's credibility as a white-girl soul band is the 
caliber of the pros they draw to listen and sit in. At Residuals, they have 
attracted former Tower of Power singer Hubert Tubbs, Stevie Wonder bass player 
Alvino Bennet, session guitar legend Dean Parks and drummer James Gadson, whose 
lengthy resume includes gigs with Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Booker T and 
Bill Withers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recorded 'Use Me' with Bill Withers," Gadson says of the 1972 hit that the 
Scarletts play, "and of all the groups I've played it with, the Scarletts come 
closest to the right feel of the original. That's saying a lot, because it's a 
difficult song, with a lot of syncopation." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year old in its present configuration, the San Fernando 
Valley-based Scarletts are a group that combines diverse ambitions and 
backgrounds. Susie Davis, originally from San Francisco, joined the Scarletts 
after several years touring as keyboard player and backup singer with such 
artists as Prince, Van Morrison, Deborah Harry, Melissa Etheridge, Billy Idol, 
Mick Jagger and Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Gia Ciambati, 31, of Studio City, spent 18 months touring as a backup 
singer for Bruce Springsteen before joining the Scarletts. Lauren Ellis, 32, of 
Glendale, played guitar and sang as a teen-ager with Susie Davis in Marin 
County, played bar bands in Oregon and toured Japan with ex-Monkee Peter Tork 
before joining the Scarletts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Lynne Davis, 31, of Hollywood, pursued classical piano study from 
childhood in Wilmington, Del., to the Austro-American Institute in Vienna 
before chucking classical piano for a rock bass career. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the rock bands formed to seek collective stardom through original 
material, the Scarletts set out to play their own renditions of their favorite 
soul records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved soul music," says Ellis, who cites Memphis guitar legend 
Steve Cropper as a musical role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the gospel-type harmonies," she adds, "the specific rhythms and the 
simplicity of the playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally an all-female band, the Scarletts gave up on girl drummers after 
several disappointments and enlisted Kevin Austin, who does not consider gender 
an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the same as playing with guys," says Austin, a thirtysomething 
ex-New Yorker who spent 14 years playing in bands in Europe after his discharge 
from the Army. "Once we're playing, I'm thinking of them as musicians, not as 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, Ciambati and Ellis write original songs and split the lead vocal work, 
sometimes passing it back and forth within a single song and serve as their own 
backup chorus. Two or three original songs are performed each set. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in an evening at Residuals, Ciambati mesmerizes the crowd with a searing 
version of her ballad "Underwater." 
</P>
<P>
 With a style that evokes the tortured, hoarse-edged intensity of Joe Cocker, 
Ciambati's singing is a reminder that the blues, from which soul and R & B 
derive, is music of pain and despair, entertaining people by celebrating 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a respectful silence after the applause.  
</P>
<P>
 "For me, Gia's got the quality to be a star," says Gili Mizrahi of Valley 
Village, at the bar with her friend, Laurie Frazer. "You feel her presence very 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 The moment of reverie is short. This is a bar, and the Scarletts are a rowdy, 
wise-cracking group, with frequent double- and triple-entendres tossed out by 
Susie Davis and Lauren Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of the male customers who crowd the stage suggest there is more than 
music on their minds when they listen to the Scarletts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're a sexy group," says Residuals regular Phil Morgan of Van Nuys. 
"Susie Davis is stunning, and she's also a phenomenal keyboard player. That 
girl Gia sings like nobody else, and drives practically every guy in the place 
crazy with her gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're all terrific, extremely talented musicians," Morgan says, "and 
their original songs are fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Being the part of their listeners' sensual fantasies doesn't bother the 
Scarletts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're allowing yourself to be a fantasy factor for the guys when you're 
playing," says Susie Davis, "and they're welcome to it. That's what you're 
there for, as long as they respect us, and I know they do, because they talk to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 While their primary purpose is to have fun playing, the Scarletts hope the 
focus they put on the gender issue will help break down sexist stereotypes in 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoy dispelling the notion, as much as we can, that women can't play this 
kind of music," says Lynne Davis. "It's also a super-huge bang standing on 
stage, and seeing all those people smiling. It's nice to make people happy."

HITTING A FESTIVE NOTE; JAZZ MUSICIANS WILL PLAY OLD HITS AND CONTEMPORARY 
FAVORITES IN NEW YEAR'S EVE SHOWS AT SEVERAL VALLEY LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 New Year's Eve and music -- they go hand in hand. For jazz fans, there's a 
variety of entertainment on tap at San Fernando Valley establishments for this 
year-end celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Frank Capp is one of these artists. Long known for his playing with 
his Juggernaut big band, Capp has been an esteemed small group player since the 
1950s and enjoys fronting a quartet. "In a small band, there's more freedom 
than in a big band, where your playing is dictated by the arrangements," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 This New Year's Eve, Capp will lead a foursome at Legends of Hollywood in 
Studio City that features renowned tenor saxophonist Pete Christlieb, pianist 
Jon Mayer and bassist Richard Reid. The tenor man, who also plays in the 
Juggernaut, is a personal favorite of the drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays with a lot of fire and excitement. He has a lot of technique on the 
instrument, he has a real solid sound and a great concept for jazz. He has his 
own identity. You can pick him out of a crowd of tenor players," Capp says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I intend to do Saturday is entertain the people with what they came 
expecting to hear, which is straight-ahead jazz. Otherwise, they wouldn't be 
coming there. We're not playing for dancing, since it's a not a dance gig," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The drummer will offer a variety of material, from such staples as the blues 
and variations on "I Got Rhythm" to songs "that are out of my era, the '50s, 
like 'Stablemates,' 'Nica's Dream' and 'Parisian Thoroughfare.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At Chadney's on New Year's Eve, saxophonist-singer Jimmy Maddin also will 
investigate the '50s, but in a more Vegas mode. Leading his Happy Blues Jazz 
Train, Maddin will do such numbers as "I'm Confessin,' " "Old Black Magic" and 
"Just a Gigolo," which were made hits by singer-trumpeter Louis Prima and his 
wife, singer Keely Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louis was a good friend of mine, and so was his saxophonist, Sam Butera, so 
I'm kind of bringing his songs back," says Maddin. "They appeal to young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Maddin does the Prima-Smith numbers with singer Terry Hunter. He 
originally did the act in the '50s with singer Beverly Adlin, who "was Errol 
Flynn's girlfriend then" at the Sundown, a club Maddin owned in Hollywood. (He 
also owned The Summit, another Hollywood nightspot that is now the popular rock 
venue, Club Lingerie.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz is definitely part of a Maddin performance, which includes songs from the 
'40s associated with Louis Jordan -- "I like him. He did a 'happy-type' blues" 
-- and such classics from the '50s as "Four," by Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainstream jazz -- that's my bag," Maddin says. 
</P>
<P>
 But New Year's Eve calls for a more eclectic mix, says Maddin, who at previous 
year-end event has performed on bills with rock stars Jerry Lee Lewis and the 
Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll play jazz and blues," says Maddin, whose band at Chadney's includes 
guitarist Bruce Lofgren. "People will be in a festive mood, and I like to work 
hard to entertain them and put on a show." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Baked Potato in North Hollywood, club owner/pianist Don Randi's New 
Year's Eve show will be more contemporary, with many tunes outfitted with a 
rock-based beat. "And, these days, people seem to be liking Latin music a lot 
more, so we'll play a lot of that," says the man who opened the Baked Potato in 
1969. (The room of the same name in Pasadena is a franchise.) 
</P>
<P>
 On tap will be Randi's band Quest, with Chuck Camper featured on saxophone, 
and he'll have a guest singer. New Year's Eve is either "fantastic, or it 
stinks. There's no in-between," Randi says. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, he's had wonderful New Year's Eves, "with great audiences 
in a great mood, wanting to be entertained," he says. "It's been fun."

SHAKING AND MOVING; THEATERS ARE GRAVITATING TO THE NOHO DISTRICT AFTER THE 
NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 17 earthquake approaches, a number of 
theaters in the San Fernando Valley's theater com munity are still shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theater companies were silenced for a time and some still haven't 
recovered, while others just seem victim to the general unrest the quake 
caused. But the theater community has been pulling itself together and 
generally, as always, forging ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the results is a sort of geographical spin, a centrifugal force that 
seems to be pulling theaters into and around the NoHo district of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Road Theatre, which for a few years has been tucked away in a commercial 
complex in Van Nuys, is moving to a new long-term space at the Lankershim Arts 
Center, 5081 Lankershim Blvd. Along with Estelle Busch's Synthaxis Theatre and 
several other performance and arts groups, the Road will occupy the space 
sometime after the beginning of March. "Idle Wheels," its final production in 
Van Nuys, opens Feb. 17. Brad Hills, the Road's artistic director, describes it 
as a "drama about Texas trash living in Alaska." The production, written by 
actor James Morrison, will be directed by Richard Herd. In its new space, the 
Road will continue its policy of producing world premieres by local 
playwrights, providing community-based workshops along with regular Monday 
evening play-reading series. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Ed Gaynes had long operated the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys, which 
closed last spring due to lingering plumbing problems. Gaynes has taken over 
the Two Roads Theatre at 4348 Tujunga Blvd. in Studio City, just a few blocks 
south of NoHo. The opening production at the theater will be a revival of the 
one-man show about writer Brendan Behan, Michael L. Kavanaugh's "Bein' With 
Behan," which runs for four weeks beginning Jan. 27, prior to a March 3 opening 
off-Broadway in New York. Gaynes will follow "Behan" on Feb. 19 with the Los 
Angeles premiere of "Lovesong," a new musical based on lyrics by famous poets, 
including Keats and Shelley. Michael Valenti wrote the music for "Lovesong," 
which had a successful six-month run at New York's Village Gate, and played for 
a year in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Forum, a theater that has been a landmark on Ventura Boulevard for 20 
years, also has moved. Co-artistic directors Audrey Marlyn and Shawn Michaels 
say they're "looking at another 20 years" in the new space at 10655 Magnolia 
Blvd., North Hollywood. Following the usual dance with inspectors, the first 
production, a French murder mystery called "Monique," is expected to open in 
February. It will be followed by a suspense drama, "Earth and Sky." 
</P>
<P>
 In late April or early May, one NoHo theater will shift a couple of blocks 
east on Magnolia from its current location a few steps east of Tujunga. Till 
then, American Renegade Theatre, which helped foster the idea of the NoHo 
theater district, will continue its run of the hit production of Jane 
Anderson's "Baby Dance" in its Stage Two. Artistic director David Cox also will 
direct the January world premiere of Martin Perrini "Martin's Place," a drama 
about a man who finds in midlife that his world is crumbling, followed by the 
premiere of "Tallulah," a new musical about Tallulah Bankhead's court case with 
an embezzling maid. After the move, Cox plans to direct a production of "Desire 
Under the Elms," but says his main thrust will still be toward new plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hollering distance of NoHo, a relative newcomer to the Valley and an 
old established playhouse have plans for active seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the longstanding Theatre Exchange building, where cattle were once bought 
and sold, the Interact Theatre company has extended its immensely successful 
production of Elmer Rice's "Counsellor-at-Law," with John Rubinstein in the 
role created by Paul Muni on Broadway. Artistic director Kevin Kelly says the 
production will continue through the end of January and may be extended 
further. Beginning in February, Interact will once again present its early-week 
"Interactivity Festival," which like last year, will present about 15 to 20 
bare-bones workshop productions of new plays. After "Counsellor-at-Law," the 
group will stage a Shakespeare play, either "Julius Caesar," "Timon of Athens" 
or "Much Ado About Nothing." Many familiar faces from stage and screen appear 
in the productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Managing director Mary Van Arsdel of Theatre West on Cahuenga Boulevard West, 
says that the venerable company will be closing its production of "Home Fire" 
on Jan. 15. Opening Feb. 17 will be the world premiere of Leslie Caveny's 
"Impact This," a black comedy about a rape victim taking back her life. Caveny 
is the author of Theatre West's popular "Love of a Pig" a few years ago. 
"Impact" also came out of the company's writers' workshop. Following that play, 
the company will stage what Van Arsdel refers to as a "reworking of 'Working.' 
" The Studs Terkel musical about the work force will have a smaller cast than 
previous productions and will contain new material provided by Terkel for this 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lionstar Theatre, over Jerry's Deli in Studio City, plans Jan. 20 openings 
of Alan Gross' "La Brea Tarpits" in Stage 1 and Sharon Burke's "Flipside" in 
Stage 2. On March 23, Kevin Mills' "Square One" will follow in Stage 1. Company 
of CharActors, which formerly controlled the spaces, will continue to produce 
there, said Anthony Leonardi, Lionstar's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most beleaguered theater in the Valley is Actors Alley, whose new 
home at the El Portal Theatre on Lankershim was seriously damaged by the quake. 
The company's summer/fall season was presented in a 99-seat tent at the 
Television Academy across the street. The company eventually plans to have 
three stages at the El Portal complex: The Mainstage, with between 300 and 600 
seats, will present the company's subscription series; the Arena Theatre and 
the Storefront Theatre, both 99-seaters, will showcase new works. The 
Storefront Theatre will be the first to open, probably in April, said John 
Shaw, associate artistic director.

THEATER REVIEW; LACKING IN LAUGHS; SOPHOMORIC GAGS AND SIMPLISTIC PLOT SMOTHER 
THE HUMOR IN TODD CARR'S 'DEAD DOGS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somerset Maugham once said that a writer usually doesn't have much to say 
until the age of 30. Even in comedy, you have to have something to say to make 
it work. Maybe it's more important in comedy than in any other field. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer, writer, director and actor Todd Carr, whose "Dead Dogs and Other 
Tales" is playing at NoHo Studios, doesn't have much to say in his evening of 
comic sketches. Even the one section he describes as "a play in one act" is 
little more than another sketch stretched to its utmost limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of what Carr has written for the debut of his Todd Carr Players in this 
totally unfunny show is pretty juvenile at that. He has a fascination with 
bodily functions (and non-functions) that most people left behind in junior 
high. In a bare-bones production, the biggest special effect is a whoopee 
cushion. Actors playing dogs sniff each other, one belches loudly and another 
comes on in great pain and complains of his doctor's large fingers. 
Knee-slapping stuff, right? 
</P>
<P>
 More intellectual material features a teacher who shoots his students when 
they can't answer a question, a bit about how funny it is to fool a blind man 
and a here-come-de-judge bit about a man suing a woman for sexual harassment 
(one more disclosure not worth the effort). 
</P>
<P>
 The "play" concerns a man with a dead dog on his porch and no inclination to 
do anything about it. That's the whole plot, and it's as sophomoric as the rest 
of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 As a director, Carr has little conception of what makes an evening of theater. 
What he does have is an ability for vocal characterization, a positive 
advantage that he shares with fellow cast members Jerry Goble and Brian Rosen.

 Don't go 'round tonight It's bound to take your life There's a bad moon on the 
rise. -- John Fogerty * 
</P>
<P>
 Angela the psychic adviser had just returned from three days of gambling, 
drinking and no sleep in Las Vegas. If that won't put you in touch with the 
spirit world, nothing will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the Valley in the coming year," she said, burning a pot of 
green and yellow incense, the green for money and the yellow for protection. 
"Things are going to get better. They can't get any worse, can they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Amen, sister. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Year of the Shakes. The earthquake rearranged more than just real 
estate -- perhaps our sense of well-being, our faith in the cosmic machinery 
crumbled in the process. At the same time, the economy continued to limp along. 
There was less money to go around and fewer malls to spend it in. 
</P>
<P>
 A year like that can irk the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with 1995 fast upon us, we went looking for reassurance. We wanted 
information on the big issues, like survival and property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard political promises and economic indicators would not suffice. 
Science lost its ability to assuage by failing to predict the Nearly Big One. 
So we took the big leap to the hidden world, the wisdom of the universe. We 
squinted our beady eyes and peered into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest began with Angela. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sign outside the Sherman Way storefront said: "Fay the Psychic Adviser." But 
Fay wasn't in, so we settled for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin and olive-skinned, of Yugoslav descent, Angela explained that she burns 
incense and ponders over questions, reaching a state of meditation that, after 
15 or so minutes, inspires various insights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes or no, positive or negative," she said. "That sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 People most often want to know if they will win the lottery or if their 
sweetheart is cheating on them. In this instance, Angela had been asked to 
meditate upon the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 With several aftershocks rumbling through the Valley earlier this month, the 
first topic was seismic activity. Angela foresaw another earthquake -- a 
"humongous one," she said -- sometime after the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, people are going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, her outlook was rosy. "I like to focus on the positive," she said. 
Shattered neighborhoods will be rebuilt. The economy will improve and the real 
estate market will rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about money for anyone," she said. "It's going to be easy 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing. Angela received celestial vibrations concerning the 
Northridge Little League team, the ones who narrowly missed winning the World 
Series last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very positive," she said. "They've got a streak of good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, our photographer, Scott, professed to feeling equally bullish about 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 His confidence, however, sprang from a different source. Seems that Honda will 
manufacture an updated version of its popular sport bike, the CBR 600 F2. That 
means the 1994 model should become available at greatly reduced prices. 
Six-hundred cubic centimeters and a top speed of more than 150 m.p.h. A 
Saturday morning monster on Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott could barely contain himself. 
</P>
<P>
 We, however, remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the Constitution, American colonists used the Bible to 
predict coming events. On New Year's Day, they would choose a passage at 
random, then apply the words to specific concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Willing to try anything, we stumbled upon a passage from 1 Kings 7:51. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the Lord was finished. 
Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, the silver, 
the gold, the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the 
Lord.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, 
the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in 
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of 
David, which is Zion. All the people of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the 
festival in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these words presaged the reopening of the Northridge Fashion Center, a 
matter of great concern. Sure enough, a mall official verified that when the 
quake-damaged mall reopens, "there's going to be a big ceremony and a lot of 
celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be difficult to imagine civic leaders and local politicians in 
attendance, along with crowds of shoppers and plenty of merchandise on sale 
(for example: gold, silver and vessels). 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the mall were supposed to be completed last month. Current 
estimates call for a spring reopening. But the month of Ethanim, from the old 
Canaanite calendar, translates to September-October. 
</P>
<P>
 You read it here first. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic consumer information notwithstanding, we wanted more. The big questions 
remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ouija board -- consulted at the stroke of midnight -- provided meaningless 
letters: T, L, H, S, P. We asked to buy a vowel but came up empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ann, our personal consultant at the Psychic Friends Network, offered the 
expertise of her Tarot cards and psychic abilities which, she promised, "are 
usually right on." All this at a cost of $3.99 per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel tremors from the last earthquake," she explained from the security of 
a long-distance telephone line. "I feel that you are going to be having these 
tremors for a year, maybe two." 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltech seismologist had mentioned the same thing on the evening news. Only 
a coincidence? Ann also suggested that we hang onto our condominium until the 
real estate market rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you rent it out?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Our father wondered the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with time running out on 1994, we had specific questions that demanded 
specific answers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, we turned to the Magic 8-Ball. Given to us as a gift, this 
plastic, liquid-filled contraption boasts of cosmic powers. Concentrate on a 
question, turn the ball upside-down and an answer appears in the magic window. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the really, truly Big One hit in 1995? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, definitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will crime increase in the Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, as I see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will property values rise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Better not tell you now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the Valley ever get a subway? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Signs point to yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the Northridge Little League team return to the World Series? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ask again later. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspense is killing us.

MAKING A PLAY FOR WESTSIDE; ACME COMEDY THEATRE IS LEAVING THE VALLEY FOR A NEW 
VENUE. ITS NEXT SHOW OPENS JAN. 20 AT THE LA BREA AVENUE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The critically acclaimed Acme Comedy Theatre is leaving the San Fernando 
Valley for a new venue on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 In its three years in North Hollywood, critics have called the company's work 
"refreshing, chiseled, clever and imaginative." In July, The Times' Ray Loynd 
declared the group "superior to the L.A.'s famed Groundlings." But, 
unfortunately, that wasn't enough, said M.D. Sweeney, the Acme's artistic 
director and founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't draw the crowds, even with the critical acclaim. It's 
unfortunate, but there is a mind-set against the Valley that nothing hip or 
cool is happening out there," Sweeney says. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's off to the more fashionable Westside. The company's new theater at 135 
N. La Brea Ave., a former synagogue, will open Jan. 20 for the company's latest 
show, "Acme Collector's Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 "We found a great place, and we're very excited about it," says Sweeney, who 
hopes the new theater will allow the company to reach a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The new theater is being designed by John Fisher, whose other projects include 
the Los Angeles Theatre Center and the Tiffany Theatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had planned to use the North Hollywood venue at 5124 Lankershim 
Blvd. for its theater school, but Sweeney is now looking for another group to 
take over the old theater. 
</P>

 FIGHTING WORDS: Southland professional wrestling fans will soon have a radio 
program devoted entirely to their sport. "Squared Circle," a weekly talk show, 
will premiere at 10 p.m. next Friday on Glendale's KIEV-AM. The one-hour show 
will allow fans to call in and talk to featured guests. 
</P>
<P>
 James Boone, 28, the producer and host of "Squared Circle," certainly knows 
his subject. He is a professional wrestler who has performed locally as "Shadow 
Man" since 1987. Boone says there is great fan interest in pro wrestling in 
Southern California and that local wrestling matches are drawing crowds. Boone 
says wrestling is especially popular in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of shows are in San Bernardino and in East L.A.," Boone says. "There 
are about 10 independent wrestling leagues. One of the reasons I started this 
show is to give the wrestling community an outlet. No one has tapped into this 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the East Coast, you can watch wrestling on TV every day," Boone says. "But 
here, it's only on the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 The featured guests on Boone's debut show will be wrestling commentator Bill 
Anderson and wrestler Jesse Hernandez, who run a wrestling school in San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone dismisses criticism that professional wrestling is entertainment and not 
sport. He says those critics do not understand the concept of wrestling or the 
athleticism involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the stamina of wrestlers," Boone says. "Some matches last an hour, 
you have to be an athlete to do that. You have to learn to protect yourself and 
you have to get a character that people like and can relate to. That's the 
entertainment part, but that's also the part that grabs the kids." 
</P>

 NEW SHAKERS: John Edwin Shaw, who had been the literary manager of Actors 
Alley theater company, has been named associate artistic director, and Gene 
Freedman and Lou Felder have been appointed co-literary managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw says the reason behind the changes is the anticipated increased workload 
for artistic director Jeremiah Morris once the company's three acting spaces 
are operational sometime in 1995. Shaw, who has been an actor with the company 
since 1987, will help Morris select material for the company's productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Portal Theater, a 1,200-seat movie house, had just been renovated when 
the earthquake severely damaged it. Since then, the company has performed in a 
tent, but plans to complete construction on at least part of its new complex 
this spring.

OPEN SEASON AT BRAND; THIS YEAR'S ART SHOW AT THE LIBRARY FEATURES 61 WORKS, AN 
ECLECTIC MIX OF SUBJECT MATTER AND TECHNIQUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Since the Brand Library in Glendale opened its art galleries 24 years ago, the 
Associates of Brand Library and Art Center have sponsored an annual juried art 
exhibition at the end of each year. 
</P>
<P>
 During several of those years, this library's support group has limited 
entries to a particular medium, such as watercolor or ceramics. But this year's 
"Brand XXIV" was, like last year's competition, opened to artists working in 
various mediums, including ceramics, drawing, graphics, painting, photography, 
sculpture, textiles, watercolor and mixed media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was the first year in multimedia. We do think it's useful to stay 
with the same choice of medium for at least three years," said gallery director 
Joe Fuchs, because the continuity attracts more artists to enter the 
competitions. "But it's also fun to do multimedia. The caliber of work that was 
submitted was very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Any artist residing in the United States could enter as many as three slides 
of works that were executed within the past two years and had not appeared in 
any major juried show. More than 1,000 slides were submitted for "Brand XXIV," 
an exhibit co-sponsored by the library associates and the Library Division of 
the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California artist Laddie John Dill was asked to jurythe show. From 
the entries, he selected 61 works that are now on display. Among them, Dill 
awarded cash prizes -- courtesy of the associates, other community groups, 
businesses and individual sponsors -- to 16 works. Prize money totaled more 
than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past few years that I have been jurying shows I have found that, 
recently, the criteria of the work is at a very high level," Dill wrote in his 
juror's statement. "Draftsmanship and sheer mastery of paint, combined with 
solid concepts, have become more of the norm rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is gratifying to see this, yet it becomes increasingly more difficult to 
jury shows of this caliber. I find that I must resort to personal bias and 
subjective reactions in the face of a body of exceptional work that was 
presented to me for the Brand Library exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 Dill's personal bias and subjective reactions have still left plenty of room 
for an eclectic mix of subject matter and techniques. Abstract sculpture shares 
space with assemblages, prints and representational paintings. Karen Jollie's 
award-winning watercolor, "Leaves of the Silver Mountain Gum," vies for 
attention with Andrea Zuill's haunting oil-on-canvas portrait of the "Ordinary 
Man," which also received an award. There is something here for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Hy Farber's gigantic laminated plywood sculpture, "The Baseball Player," 
stands at the gallery entrance, ready to belt a fast ball out of the park. A 
short video that shows Farber at work in his studio accompanies his slugger, 
which won a Patron Cash Award. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Connie Mississippi's birch plywood and rubber "Black Hole," a 
conical-shaped abstract sculpture. It draws one's eye into its nicely textured 
interior and then beyond to the opening in back, which could take viewers 
anywhere they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Voyagers will also find the sky is not the limit in Denise Carson's painting, 
"Thru the Looking Glass." Through her skillful use of paint, we sense movement 
and mystery in deep space. In this universe of hers, there are at least some 
bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Kreiden's colorful, jaunty "Virtual Painting" received the Associates 
Purchase Award. The large oil-on-canvas work, in which abstract figures mingle 
with umbrellas and floating hats, becomes part of the Brand Library's permanent 
art collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Dore conveys a more penetrating slice of life in her painting, "Vox 
Populi, Vox Dei." The image depicts a neglected urban street corner with piles 
of trash. But life continues on here, where people go about their business and 
the Owl Cafe beckons. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp knife that stands about as tall as the larger-than-life figure in 
Saak Pogossian's "Figure With Knife" attracts and repels simultaneously. The 
figure is cloaked in what appears to be a clergyman's robe and sprouts burned 
wood beams in place of a head. The piece brings various scenarios to mind 
regarding the institutional use of force and power.

 Over the years of putting out the "E" Ticket, Leon and Jack Janzen have 
learned many Disneyland facts and secrets, including these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Besides a growling snow beast, the Matterhorn also hides in its peak a 
basketball half-court for Disney "cast members," as the employees are called at 
Disneyland. Seriously. "I played hoops in it," says Leon Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
 * The turn-of-the-century buildings lining Main Street U.S.A. are hollow and 
connected over their first-floor shops and eateries, and that connection forms 
a continuous corridor, through which cast members may travel from one end of 
the street to the other.  
</P>
<P>
 * During the park's early years, children could rent bamboo poles and fish off 
landings at Tom Sawyer's Island. Waters were stocked with fish kept in place by 
underwater netting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Engine cars of the Disneyland Railroad are named for executives of the Santa 
Fe Railroad, an early park sponsor. The trains are the E.P. Ripley, the C.K. 
Holliday, the Fred Gurley and the Ernest S. Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dark water that flows through the Jungle Cruise, the Rivers of America 
and the moat of Sleeping Beauty's Castle is all part of an interconnected 
network that travels downhill and is recirculated via a pump at Tom Sawyer's 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to current Disney lore, the burning cabin on Tom Sawyer's Island 
was ignited by a careless settler. "Hostile Indians" were originally blamed for 
the blaze, and a later revisionist account pinned it on a moonshiner turf war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although now synonymous with something wild and wonderful, the E ticket did 
not exist when the park opened. Tickets went as high as D until 1959, when more 
elaborate rides like the Submarine Voyage, the Monorail and the Matterhorn 
opened. SYLVIA L. OLIANDE

TICKET TO DISNEY HISTORY; BROTHERS' MAGAZINE DEDICATED TO THE PARK HAS GROWN 
UP. IT NOW HAS 2,000 READERS FROM ALL OVER.

<P>
 At a time when men outgrow the things that boys hold dear, two brothers have 
created a magazine that chronicles the beginning and development of one of 
childhood's magical memories -- Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Each issue of the "E" Ticket highlights certain elements of the park's past -- 
from the evolution of veteran attractions to a glimpse of eras that have come 
and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look real close at one ride at a time, one artist at a time," says 
48-year-old Leon Janzen of Saugus. "We don't care if it takes 20 years; we're 
going to do the park of the '50s and '60s and probably the '70s, and do it 
slowly and closely."

 Adds brother Jack Janzen, 43, of Granada Hills, "If we live long enough, we're 
going to cover all the rides, probably a lot of them twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Through vintage photographs and interviews with the park's original craftsmen, 
the "E" Ticket offers a nostalgic look at the early years of the Magic Kingdom 
after its July 17, 1955, opening. The magazine was named after the type of 
ticket required for a fast-action ride during the era of ticket booklets at 
Disneyland. It was created in 1986 as a free Disney collectible fanzine, but 
was truly born with the seventh issue, the brothers say. That one featured an 
interview with artist Marc Davis, a longtime Disney animator and one of the 
park's original "imagineers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to Issue 7, it was for collectors, fans," Leon says. "With the Davis 
interview, we had new material that was bigger and more important than anything 
we had before." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to mining the memories of the men and women who helped design the 
park, the Janzens also rely for their research on the Walt Disney Co.'s files. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Smith, director of Disney's archives, says the magazine has been a useful 
source of information for the company as well as a repository for facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have interviewed in detail some people that we haven't," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they have the time to do it, and we don't. We're pleased when we can have 
someone else do the work," he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fun for the people that are intense about Disneyland and want to 
know all the minute details and history of the rides and attractions." 
</P>
<P>
 The "E" Ticket subscribers number more than 2,000, and a look at the 
publication's letters page reveals that readers come from all over -- from 
California to Florida and even Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Kari Hendler, 32, of North Hollywood, has been a subscriber since 1988, when 
her husband brought home a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I locked myself in my office for hours and just couldn't believe someone had 
actually designed a magazine for me," she says, noting that she has been a fan 
of the park from an early age and worked there during her late teens as a 
"merchandise hostess." 
</P>
<P>
 The Janzens' magazine pays tribute -- in words and pictures -- to many of the 
original attractions that have been revamped or removed, such as the Skyway, 
which closed Nov. 9 after 38 years of shuttling park-goers between Tomorrowland 
and Fantasyland in brightly colored gondolas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Leon says. "We knew it was going to be closed, and went and rode 
it. Jack and I took a lot of pictures that we normally wouldn't have, like of 
the pillars, because we knew that this was the last time it would look that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of Disneyland's changes have improved on the original, the 
brothers stress that they and other collectors fear the park Walt Disney 
created is disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't run a theme park on a handful of people like me -- fans, nostalgic 
preservationists -- and we recognize that," Leon admits. "So we're not a 
critical voice of what's going on now. We're a voice to remember and preserve 
what the facts were." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime subscriber Scott Javine says that is what attracted him to the 
magazine. Originally from Oklahoma, he said he recalls visiting the park for 
the first time when he was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember as much as I wish I remember," the 32-year-old Burbank 
resident says. "And now there are things that are gone. That's what Jack and 
Leon try to do; they talk about things that aren't there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for two men who had no prior publishing experience. They both have 
families and day jobs -- Leon is a bank manager, and Jack manages a Los Angeles 
city department. The pair shares the writing, photography and interviewing 
tasks equally, spending one or two nights a week working on the more-or-less 
quarterly publication. 
</P>
<P>
 With Leon's input, Jack illustrates the covers for the magazine to represent 
each issue's theme. They often look to vintage attraction posters for 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do our interviews, we do our research, we get our photos, we get as much 
original artwork as we can," Jack says. "If there's something missing in the 
overall telling of the story -- usually it's a map -- we do our artwork." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As boys living in Panorama City during the 1950s, the Janzens were fascinated 
by Walt Disney and his amusement park. Its effect is evident in their sparkle 
as they discuss the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the brothers still visit the park several times a year, often without 
their families. Because of the time they spend together on the magazine, Leon 
admits they often act like "an old married couple." They finish each other's 
sentences and manage to talk to a visitor at the same time without really 
interrupting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a terrible relationship," jokes Jack. "We do have our 
disagreements, but really the payoff is so strong in terms of the satisfaction 
we get." 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration wasn't always so easy. After competing with each other at 
swap meets and collectors' shows to be the first to buy a rare item of 
Disneyland memorabilia, the brothers eventually decided to pool their energy, 
creating a common collection. 
</P>
<P>
 With the "E" Ticket, the Janzens say they have been handed a torch of sorts, a 
responsibility to carry on the Disney magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about Disneyland, very much so," Leon says, "but every single page and 
what we do is about Walt Disney and the final segment of his career. With every 
issue, we're thanking Walt for creating that feeling of wonder in us as kids."

CLUB SCENE: INTO THE UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERIE SAUNDERS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may get a little cramped, but Club Dump at The Blue Saloon every Thursday 
and Saturday offers local, alternative rock bands a chance to do their thing 
before a receptive crowd. Five dollars gets you into the club, hosted by a dude 
named Yowsah; if you bring a can of food for his food drive, you get a $1 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: By midnight, the tiny venue is in full gear. People are squeezing 
by each other and standing on tippy toes to see the band located in an area 
that resembles a room more than a stage. The performance area is not elevated, 
forcing patrons to peek in-between and peer around heads to see. There are 
games going at both pool tables, which barely fit between the entrance and a 
small seating area. The bar has two TVs overhead, one on each side, and roughly 
150 people make the place standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
 CROWD: Club Dump is a 21-and-over melting pot of T-shirts, flannel, bandannas, 
tennis shoes, boots, goatees, tight blouses, tattoos, Harley Davidson-wear, 
nose rings, shorts, enough black leather jackets to make a cow nervous and hair 
of all kinds -- long, short, shaved, dyed, permed and severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC: These bands would have Beavis and Butthead in the middle of the floor 
bobbing their heads. Kiss the Monkey -- who could give Whale a serious run for 
its money -- and Dazed Pigs were the featured bands this particular Saturday. 
Although people seemed genuinely into the music during the early hours of the 
evening, the crowd was low on energy, opting for hearty yelps, whistles and 
Homer Simpson-like "woohoos," rather than the more taxing practice of clapping. 
Madison, the lead singer of Kiss the Monkey, took this personally and began to 
vent her frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 MADISON (after fourth song): "You can make some noise, we did!" 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD: Raffi Agopian, a member of the underground rock/punk band Capital Radio, 
likes the fact that Club Dump hires local bands to play without too many 
questions. "All other bars care about is how many people you can draw. Club 
Dump cares more about the music, so they get better underground bands." About 
the atmosphere, Hollywood resident Johnny Szary, 27, said, "People are young 
and usually eager to talk to you. There's no attitude here." MADISON (after 
sixth song): "You can clap now . . . I hope you're liking it as much as me!" 
</P>
<P>
 BAD: "There's not enough seating," said Kathee Schneider, 28, of Hollywood, 
lucky enough to find a seat at the bar. "The stage needs to be higher so people 
can see," added Agopian. 
</P>
<P>
 MADISON: (before the last song): This has got to be the most fun in the world, 
man. My suggestion, get your ass a band, man, 'cause this rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Club Dump at The Blue Saloon, 4657 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, offers 
live alternative rock, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thursdays and Saturdays. $5 cover. 
Live music from blues to rock is offered Wednesday to Saturday. Hours are 11 
a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday to Saturday, noon to 2 a.m. Sunday. Call (818) 766-4644.

A TRUER TEST OF SKILLS; GREAT WESTERN USES A HIGH-TECH SCREENING PROCESS TO 
ACHIEVE A MORE LASTING FIT OF WORKER TO JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray is a 
regular contributor to The Times.

<P>
 Job interviewing has gone high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just talking with a manager, job-seekers sit down at an interactive 
computer with CD-ROM, a touch screen and a microphone, and are tested for what 
the employer has identified as the basic and essential skills for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Job candidates can rewind the job interview -- go back over a question and 
answer it in a new way, rerecording their audio response. They also get a 
chance to ask a variety of preset questions of people already in the job about 
the realities of the role and the responsibilities for which they are applying. 
</P>
<P>
 At Great Western Bank in Chatsworth, such a multimedia interview was 
successfully piloted last year to select tellers, and is being expanded 
nationally to other branches, said Michele Maddock, a first vice president with 
the bank. The systems are designed to provide employers more consistent, 
job-relevant information about candidates, reduce interviewing costs and 
diminish turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Every job-seeker gets exactly the same questions, hypothetical situations, 
teller-relevant math problems -- even the same ornery and demanding mock 
customers to calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a level playing field for applicants," Maddock said. "And the pilot we 
did showed we reduced teller turnover within the first 90 days after hire by 
26%." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute automated job interview opens with a computer greeting: "Welcome 
to the interactive assessment aid." 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, the applicant touches a label on the screen, and is then warned that 
the computer will be keeping track of response time and mistakes. Then the 
computer tests the interviewee's money and computation skills -- asking, for 
example, how to cash a check for $192.18, including at least three $5 bills and 
$2 in quarters. The computer confronts the job candidate with tough customers, 
including an angry man and a frustrated woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The system used by Great Western Bank was designed by Learning Systems 
Sciences in North Hollywood, a producer of multimedia training systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage of the computer interview is that it is blind to age, color, 
ethnicity, religion, and it shows whether the applicant has the basic skill set 
to be likely to succeed," said John King, vice president of Learning Systems 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 A big benefit of the multimedia interview is that it allows job seekers to ask 
risk-free questions about the work that they might be hesitant to pose in a 
live interview, King said. "What's the toughest part of the job? What is 
working in a bank really like? It gives the candidate a chance to ask the hard 
questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Great Western's multimedia screening system, the answers about the work are 
honest, King said. "It was hard to get the script approved by the bank, but our 
argument was: Why deceive people into thinking the job is always terrific?" To 
reduce turnover and get a good fit of worker to the job, questions have to be 
relevant and the candidate has to have a realistic understanding of daily work, 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being interviewed by a computer could seem daunting, impersonal, even cold. 
Scott Michalek, a financial services representative at the Van Nuys branch, 
well remembers his own 1993 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in and started to talk with them, and they told me I'd be taking a 
test on the computer. I had done nothing like it before, and I was a little 
scared at first," he said. But he found he could work at his own pace and 
gradually the video customer experiences seemed real enough. 
</P>
<P>
 King's advice for succeeding is simple: Apply past experiences, stay calm, 
pretend the mock situations are real and don't hesitate to rewind and redo a 
question to improve the response. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddock sees one big downside for job-seekers to the multimedia interview. 
"Typically, a lot of people get hired because they interview well. With this 
system, traditional interviewing skills will not be enough."

94: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; VALLEY ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT REBOUND AFTER A SHAKY

<P>
 The west San Fernando Valley is beginning to show concrete signs of the rush 
to build more movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are demolishing the old Saks Fifth Avenue building at The Promenade 
mall in Woodland Hills, making room for an AMC 16-screen multiplex that is 
scheduled to open by fall of next year.Within a mile, Pacific Theatres hopes to 
open its new 20-screen complex at roughly the same time, while the General 
Cinema at Fallbrook Mall will expand from seven to 10 screens. And United 
Artists is pondering changes to its six-screen complex in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the construction is limited to the West Valley. A new Mann complex 
opened in the fall in Granada Hills. The Calabasas City Council has given at 
least preliminary approval for new Mann and United Artists complexes. In 
Agoura, the developer of a proposed commercial center has signed a lease with 
Mann Theatres to build an eight-screen complex down the street from the 
existing Mann 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The new AMC complex in Woodland Hills, meanwhile, promises more than just 
movies. Half of its 120,000-square-foot building will be devoted to restaurants 
and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's entertainment-oriented," said Dick Walsh, a senior vice president for 
the theater chain. "We are looking for bookstores and record stores to go along 
with the food court." DAVID WHARTON

 Valley designers have been busy this fall building name recognition in the 
film and television world. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the designers profiled earlier this year is Maggie Barry, who, along 
with Ty Moore, designs urban street-wear fashion under the Van Buren label.The 
two have been selected to outfit daytime talk show host Maty Monfort of ABC's 
"Mike and Maty." Nominated for the 1994 California Designer of the Year award, 
the duo was also chosen to make over Tammy Faye Bakker, who recently was a 
guest on "Leeza," Leeza Gibbons' syndicated daytime talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry enjoys outfitting Bakker and other "high-profile" women. "We appeal to 
the powerful," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow designer Leslie Niskar of T. T. Mar has also been gaining recognition 
on the small screen. Niskar's signature floaty print dresses attracted the 
interest of several television costumers when The Times' story appeared. Her 
designs have been featured on ABC's "My So-Called Life," NBC's "Seinfeld" and 
ABC's "All-American Girl." She also was a featured designer and showed her 
fashions in a style segment of "Good Morning Dallas," a Texas talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Niskar: "A lot of really exciting things have been happening this year, 
and we're enjoying the attention." CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS

 The guy who has terrorized thousands with his makeup and special effects in 
movies and on television will soon be giving his parents the willies: Josh 
Brezner is taking driving lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brezner, who is perhaps the youngest makeup artist working in Hollywood today, 
is now a junior at Van Nuys High School's Theatre and Fine Arts Magnet.His free 
time is spent creating bloody wounds and monsters for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of his work is murder and mayhem. He worked as a makeup assistant 
on a recent NBC special, "Angels 2, Beyond the Light" (although his job mainly 
consisted of giving extras bloody noses and black eyes), and he continues doing 
makeup and effects for student films. He was also profiled in a recent edition 
of the magazine Disney Adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Life imitated art for the Brezner family Jan. 17 as their Granada Hills home 
ended up looking like a set in a disaster flick after the Northridge 
earthquake. Their house was too damaged to repair. The family has moved three 
times since the quake, although they're back now in Granada Hills -- for good, 
they hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the family has settled down, Josh has been able to concentrate on 
picking up the rules of the road rather than packing boxes. "He'll be a good 
driver," says his dad, Michael. "But putting your child behind the wheel is 
scary." JOHN MORELL

<P>
 Arecent flurry of additions to CityWalk appears to be slowing, but the 
Universal City mall has saved the biggest addition for last. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, workers will begin construction of a Hard Rock Cafe at the eastern 
end of the hilltop promenade.The two-story, 18,000-square-foot restaurant will 
be the largest in the well-known chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to look like any other Hard Rock," said Jeff Wagner, vice 
president of marketing. "The architect calls it 'Jeffersonian traditionalism,' 
whatever that means. I can tell you that the complex has an 85-foot domed 
ceiling. It has a balcony and a patio, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The trademark Cadillac bar has not been forsaken. Nor have the autographed 
guitars that line the walls. At CityWalk, such memorabilia will come mainly 
from current bands like Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe, scheduled to open by Nov. 1, will take its place among two other 
musical newcomers. The Country Star Hollywood restaurant opened at the opposite 
end of the promenade in August, followed closely B. B. King's Blues Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner hopes that the newest Hard Rock Cafe will attract CityWalk's steady 
clientele of tourists as well as those closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Valley residents just don't make it into the city to go to the Hard 
Rock," he said. "We want to give them the chance." DAVID WHARTON

 Juxt, the anti-Generation X magazine published by two San Fernando Valley 
natives, is marking its first anniversary with a special December edition 
reflecting on the best and worst of 1994. (Best shock value news story: Dan 
Quayle's '96 presidential bid.Worst: flesh-eating bacteria.) 
</P>
<P>
 The publication is aimed at those born between 1961 and 1981 who reject the 
apathetic stereotype given their generation. It was created by Hillarie Waadt, 
26, and Jon Peters, 29, both of Studio City, as an alternative to mainstream 
media offerings targeted at their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is validating that people are asking for our magazine at places where they 
got it before," said Waadt, referring to the coffeehouses, nightclubs and 
college campuses where she has left stacks. "But then reality comes back and we 
still need to get the issue out with little money." 
</P>
<P>
 Although two big distributors, including Barnes & Noble, recently ordered Juxt 
for national distribution, Waadt and Peters have yet to see a profit. Any money 
made goes back into production. Contributing writers, photographers and artists 
are still paid in sweets -- this Christmas, each was given Waadt's homemade 
candy. 
</P>
<P>
 But they hope that won't be for long. Although the magazine is still free in 
Los Angeles, across the country it sells for $2.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a long and slow process, but I think the magazine was meant to be," 
Waadt said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

 Jay Liebowitz's business is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 After an article featuring his prodigious programming skills appeared in The 
Times in November, the 12-year-old Chaminade Intermediate School student said 
he has seen about a 10% increase in his $24,000-a-year software business. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebowitz uploads his homemade software to CompuServe, an on-line computer 
service that features several forums through which users can buy and sell 
programs. His $35 WinDOS program is a file manager package geared to help users 
learn to use a computer, and his $15 Batch Edit helps organize computer files. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was a guest on a Tampa-based syndicated radio program, "The 
Entrepreneur Opportunity Show," through which he sold additional software. And 
he may have found an agent for his just-completed book, "A Twelve-Year-Old's 
View on America." 
</P>
<P>
 But Liebowitz isn't content to rest on his laurels. He is pursuing an interest 
in history. And he has just resumed golf lessons to try to reduce his 13 
handicap. BARBARA BRONSON GRAY

 Il Salotto -- the name is the Italian for "living room" -- is a sweet little 
Ventura Boulevard cafe specializing in home-style Italian cooking. Owner Pietro 
Zaretti comes from a restaurant family. His brother Gianni has the estimable 
Caffe Zaretti in Northridge; Pietro's wife, Rossana, is responsible for many of 
Il Salotto's top-notch recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that makes Il Salotto stand out from other Italian eating places on 
the boulevard is an incredible $4.95 lunch buffet. This buffet is a deal, all 
right: two pastas, homemade soup, pizza, a variety of appetizers, salads, 
terrific polpetti (veal meatballs) and dessert. Zaretti admits that he is 
taking a loss on this buffet, as anyone with a sense of the restaurant business 
might reasonably conclude. "Lunch has been slow," he confides. 
</P>
<P>
 I can easily imagine being a regular at lunch here. Two of us filled small 
plates with antipastos such as little slices of zucchini topped with baked 
bread crumbs, mozzarella Caprese with a dollop of pesto, delicate polpetti in a 
superbly light marinara, two slices of the thin-crusted pizza Margherita and a 
couple of grilled onions . . . and later we went back for pasta and sauteed 
calamari. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, a waiter brought out a steaming basket of hot, puffy focaccia 
bread, while my friend insisted that I try a bowl of the deliciously filling 
pasta e fagioli soup. It's a specialty of Zaretti's native Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is a buffet, complete with steam table. But unlike many a buffet, it 
consists of food made in small quantities and is continually replenished. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinners are on an even higher plane, although the menu rarely strays from the 
simple. Zuppa di pesce is about the fanciest dish Il Salotto puts out. It's the 
priciest, too, if $13.50 for an iron kettle chock full of assorted fresh 
seafood can be called pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaretti pulls no punches with this one. It contains large, soft chunks of 
swordfish and sea bass, mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari rings, whole scallops, 
a piquant marinara and a hot, crusty bread lining the inside of the kettle. I 
couldn't resist it, and found myself scooping out the bread crust to get at the 
remnant flavors of the seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of gnocchi will be pleased to know that these little potato-flour 
dumplings are yielding and tender. You get a huge plateful served a piacere , 
meaning with your choice of sauces. I've had them with creamy Gorgonzola here 
and also with a rustic, heavy meat sauce, which I preferred. Order the pasta 
spirals called fusilli and they come with lots of porcini mushrooms and cream 
-- maybe even too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Only cannelloni alla Fiorentina really fails to live up to expectations. This 
cannelloni is a long pasta tube stuffed with spinach, ricotta cheese and fresh 
mushrooms. Maybe I'd like it better if it weren't covered with a commercial 
grade of provolone before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Veal dishes are only $11.95, made with good medallions of white veal and the 
usual toppings. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and have the house 
specialty, osso buco . This marrow-filled veal shank is firm, tender and meaty. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to choose between soup or salad, an option you have with all entree 
and pasta selections. One evening the soup was a hearty lentil with a delicate 
homemade taste. Both the house vinaigrette, made with red wine vinegar, and the 
Caesar dressing, subtly tangy with anchovy, were good enough to make you 
temporarily forget Mama. 
</P>
<P>
 A few desserts come from the hand of Signora Zaretti, though not, naturally, 
the commercially made ice creams: spumone or the chocolate confection called 
tartufo . The one called casalinga , made of ladyfingers and an 
amaretto-flavored custard, is a cousin to tiramisu.

 Terrazza Toscana restaurant in Encino is offering diners complimentary 
pre-dinner tastings of such Italian staples as cheeses, prosciuttos, olive 
oils, Tuscan-style breads and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Agostino Sciandri says the wine, vino novelli, is a light red, the 
Italian equivalent of a French Beaujolais nouveau. It's imported from Italy and 
has a fruity flavor that goes well with pasta and other dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty types of olive oils will be offered. Patrons will be able to compare 
oils from Tuscany, such as Tenuta San Guido Bolgheri and Ornellaia, to olive 
oils from other regions of Italy. Restaurant personnel will answer diners' 
questions regarding the different regions, and the consistencies, aromas and 
flavors of the oils. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazza Toscana will offer the pre-dinner tastings from 5:30 to 9 p.m. 
Sundays through Thursdays only. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazza Toscana, 17401 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 905-1641. MORE FISH 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Head Cafe is adding more seafood entrees to its menu. After the 
first of the year, the Encino restaurant will add five or six fresh "fish of 
the day" items plus some seafood pizza and pasta dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel that it's time to add some other things," co-owner Gerri 
Rothschild said. "In this area, our seafood plates went over very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothschild said although most of the restaurant's menu is less than $10, the 
new seafood items will be priced at about $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Head Cafe, 17200 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 501-7600. LESS OIL 
</P>
<P>
 Chin Chin, the Chinese restaurant chain, is offering a lighter menu featuring 
dishes made with little or no oil. The new "Chin Chin Lite" menu includes dim 
sum, salads, noodles, moo shu , rice and entrees the restaurant calls "banquet 
specialties." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Diana Foutz says no fats, including lard or oil, are used, except 
for those noted on the menu. Dim sum appetizers are steamed or boiled and 
contain only a small amount of sesame oil for flavor, while sesame oil has been 
removed from the salad dressings, according to the menu. The restaurant says 
its blanched vegetable dishes are tossed in oil-free sauces. Dishes such as 
kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, garlic chicken, cashew shrimp, shrimp with 
lobster sauce, and sweet and sour orange chicken are prepared with no oil. 
These entrees range from $7.75 to $8.95. The moo shu , rice and noodle dishes 
are $4.75 to $7.95 and are prepared with no oil, according to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chin Chin's crispy rice noodles are fried in peanut and a combination of corn 
and canola oils, and they can be withheld from dishes upon request. 
</P>
<P>
 Foutz says the new menu is a response to customers' requests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, Chin Chin is at 16101 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 
783-1717, and 12215 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 985-9090. LESS MONEY 
</P>
<P>
 Milano Ristorante in Sherman Oaks has lowered menu prices by about $2 per 
entree and, for the first time, is offering beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner prices now start at $9.95, and half of the menu items are less than 
$12, spokesman Ray Rosenbaum said. Lunches start at $6.95. Entrees include 
pizza, pasta, seafood, veal and chicken. Italian-style steak dinners have been 
reduced from $15.95 to $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant will feature three imported beers, Peroni Messina from Italy, 
Maccabee from Israel and Bass from England, plus Italian, French and California 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, owned by Rocco Coluccio, is not affiliated with any chain. 
</P>

HAS PASSED THEM BY.

<P>
 For 58 years -- an eternity in this town -- Chasen's was the quintessence of 
Hollywood, as sublime as the expensive caviar that is on the menu and as 
low-brow as the world-famous chili that is not. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the spot where fans could find President Ronald Reagan with his boiled 
beef in Booth No. 2. Alfred Hitchcock routinely fell asleep at his table. 
Humphrey Bogart and his third wife fought raucously at theirs. Howard Hughes 
once rose from his and asked to use the house phone for a second. He was still 
gabbing like a wild man at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when everyone who was anyone in Hollywood could have been 
found in one of the deep, dark banquettes at Chasen's, on the dance floor at 
the Cocoanut Grove, in the foyer of Cafe Trocadero or tucking into a Cobb salad 
at the Brown Derby. But those were the days when a star was a star and a 
restaurant was not just a hangout or a plate of food but an establishment in 
which to see and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for reasons sociological and otherwise, neither stars nor their 
backdrops, no matter how dazzling, seem quite what they used to be. And in a 
city where the bon mot of the moment is, "That is soooo five-minutes-ago," 
there isn't much room for institutions anymore, either of the human or the 
brick and mortar variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea in Hollywood is to be in the prow," said Neal Gabler, who has 
written extensively about Tinseltown history. "The idea is to be at that place 
that is the center of the center. And Chasen's became an anachronism." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler and other historians say the closing this spring of Dave and Maude 
Chasen's sprawling ersatz chateau will mark the latest -- and nearly the last 
-- nail in the coffin for Old Hollywood. Its owners promise that the West 
Hollywood eatery will someday return, in a new and "streamlined" incarnation, 
but restaurateurs and other observers of Los Angeles' social culture contend 
that it is more likely that it will join such bygone glamour spots as Perino's, 
Romanoff's, Scandia, the Mocambo and the Zebra Room in that big back booth in 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the time it takes to read this article, the latest Hollywood in-spot will 
probably be on its way out -- part of the inevitable rhythm of doing business 
in modern Los Angeles. House of Blues, Viper Room and Tatou are at the cutting 
edge of a subculture that may be more fickle than any in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the Los Angeles of the 1990s, today's "institution" is tomorrow's 
commercial-space-for-lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to live with the realization that this town changes a lot," said 
Jerry Prendergast, general manager of Sanctuary, a currently hip restaurant in 
Beverly Hills that previously housed the once-hip Cafe Morpheus and before that 
the also-hip Asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone comes here to get away from tradition," he said. "I'm surprised that 
there's actually a Brooks Brothers here." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always this way. There was a time, it seemed, when icons had more 
than 15 minutes of fame, and a place that could last for 58 years might stand a 
shot at immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Chasen's moved past its prime in the late '70s, historian Gabler 
noted, "the action moved on to Ma Maison, to Spago. To be at Chasen's was to 
mark yourself as a dinosaur, it was to be in the past with the Brown Derby or 
Romanoff's. They're all gone now because Hollywood is a place where the object 
is to be in vogue. . . . Sometime it will be Spago's turn. They all have 
built-in obsolescence. They are all dependent on being on the very edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler, who did research on Chasen's for his 1988 book "An Empire of Their 
Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood," said the trend reflects not only the 
fast-forward nature of '90s L.A., but the evolution of Hollywood stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 With the collapse of the tightly controlled studio system, glamour was 
transferred from a few special settings to a constantly changing cast of 
individuals, he said. So hot places today do not have to be designed for luxury 
because the spark comes "from the people who are there, not that notion of the 
restaurant as stage setting," Gabler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Film archivist and historian Marc Wanamaker can rattle off the obituary list 
of restaurants and nightclubs that once were synonymous with traditional 
Hollywood glitz. With Chasen's soon to join them, only Musso & Frank on 
Hollywood Boulevard will remain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 'It represents the typical lack of interest in supporting the old places," 
Wanamaker said "The old people are dying off or are not going there anymore. 
The newer people have no cultural roots here, nothing that relates them to 
Chasen's or Musso's and they couldn't care less. The crux of the problem is 
that most people have no cultural or emotional ties to any of these landmarks." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last year, another beloved institution -- Nickodell Restaurant -- was 
shuttered. The Melrose Avenue eatery had been a hangout for actors and 
technicians from Paramount Pictures, its next-door neighbor, since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a martini and club steak kind of place in a town increasingly hooked on 
bottled water and tuna tacos. Business fell into decline and the neighborhood 
got rougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, the landlord for three years, at first insisted that it had no 
immediate plans for the site after the restaurant closed. But a few weeks 
later, Nickodell and its towering blue-and-white sign were gone. In an example 
of Hollywood wizardry, the Paramount parking lot fence was extended around the 
property and mature bushes lined the perimeter as if nothing else had ever been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the Northridge earthquake in January further weakened the 
boarded-up and fire-damaged Brown Derby restaurant building on Vine Street in 
Hollywood, property owners opted for demolition of that once-proud 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists insisted that the 1929 building where Clark Gable proposed 
marriage to Carole Lombard could have been saved. But a parking lot emerged and 
the protesters were reduced to holding a mock funeral. (The Original Brown 
Derby on Wilshire Boulevard -- an informal lunch counter that spawned the 
fancier Derby on Vine -- was ripped down in the mid-'80s and its signature hat 
crowns the mini-mall on the site.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Cocoanut Grove Club, once the epicenter of movieland social life and the 
scene of several Academy Awards ceremonies, closed in 1988 after 67 years in 
business. The fate of the building is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Perino's, the elegant eatery that fed the likes of Cole Porter, Eleanor 
Roosevelt and Bugsy Siegel, suffered a lingering death. It opened in 1932 on 
Wilshire Boulevard and later moved to another spot on the street where it 
survived until a 1985 bankruptcy; an attempted revival did not succeed although 
the structure still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. has never been a place to revere its history or respect its history," 
said Greg Williams, a preservation activist with the Hollywood Heritage 
organization, which tried to save the Brown Derby. "We always like the fresh 
and new, build it up and tear it down. But I don't find a lot of it is an 
improvement. We tear too much of it down and wind up with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood old-timers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the business change and Chasen's is a symbol of what once was," 
said 69-year-old Danny Arnold, producer of such shows as "Barney Miller," "My 
World and Welcome to It," "Bewitched" and "That Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, the industry was interested in the classics, there was a 
great deal more charm," he said. "Today, I think everything appeals to raw 
emotions and it's a reflection of the times we live in." 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, is apparent even in the movies themselves. "If you don't blow 
up five buildings and kill 30 people in the first 40 feet of film, you're going 
downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its first incarnation, Chasen's hardly had the look of a Hollywood glamour 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The place had six tables, an eight-stool counter and sold chili at 25 cents a 
bowl. Bar drinks ran about 35 cents. About 15 people attended the restaurant's 
opening night, Dec. 13, 1936, but they were the kind of people who in those 
days could set a restaurant for life: Frank Capra. Jimmy Cagney. Pat O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Chasen's joined the Hollywood pantheon and became the sort of 
place that would evoke vivid memories decades hence -- of the escapades that 
occurred there, the famous faces, the deals, the setting, the owners 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Chasen's when it was just a barbecue pit," sighed Lita Grey 
Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's second wife, who is 86 and living in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years it grew and grew until it became one of the most popular 
restaurants in town, for film luminaries and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Seltzer, the veteran producer and a former Hollywood public relations 
man, said he will never forget Dean Martin's bachelor party when another 
well-known star "got very drunk and managed to shock even the most 
sophisticated friends of Dean by (relieving himself) into the potted plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Shenanigans and gimmicks were the order of the day, and restaurateurs who were 
willing to play along were part of what made the industry run. Ciro's became 
legendary as the spot where contract players were sent on fake dates arranged 
by studio publicists. 
</P>
<P>
 The people caricatured at the Brown Derby, and the placement of their 
cartoons, could make or break careers. The eatery also gave 50% discounts to 
gossip columnists simply for showing up and eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 In a town that lives on its own P.R., Chasen's ranked with the best of them. 
When a movie star -- any movie star -- got admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, Chasen's would ship some chili over so the celebrity would not have to 
eat hospital food. When Shirley Temple sobbed one night for a cocktail like the 
ones her mother and father had, the bartender purportedly invented a concoction 
of ginger ale, grenadine and fruit that still bears her name. When a pregnant 
Dorothy Lamour was uncomfortable at Table 12, Dave Chasen had a portion of it 
cut out to comfortably accommodate her. 
</P>
<P>
 The place, Seltzer said, "instilled the feeling that you were in a private 
club, populated by your colleagues and by your peers and by your bosses. It was 
a social event." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday night, he added, was the prime time at the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dress code was strictly observed, a coat and tie," he said. "And (they had) a 
marvelous conceit even when credit cards were available, a house account. If 
you had a Chasen's account, that was a badge of belonging, of importance. That 
was a sociological phenomenon of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday of the restaurant stretched on through the decades, through change 
upon change in fads, food and philosophy. Through the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, 
Chasen's flourished, maturing from its humble origins to a sumptuous, gated 
mansion of a place, with soft lighting and expensive furnishings and solicitous 
waiters and -- the selling point that would one day contribute to its demise -- 
an emphasis on old-fashioned class and old-fashioned food and lots and lots of 
elbowroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represented the era when the studios ran the town . . . when the star 
system was in its glory," said Herb Steinberg, former vice president of MCA 
Recreation Division and a Chasen's regular since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "You went, you dressed up, you wore a shirt and tie. It was a great 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 But what once seemed like great atmosphere came increasingly to resemble 
stultifying boredom as the old Hollywood haunts gave way to the new, and 
tuxedos and cocktail frocks were replaced by Armani jackets and jeans, 
regardless of gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chasen's out-aged the new generation," Steinberg lamented. "They don't have 
the formality, they like to go to places where you don't have a tie. They like 
to go to places where you don't have to make a reservation. At Chasen's, you 
always had to make a reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, economics took over. Although Chasen's made it through the 1970s 
to a Reagan-era renaissance in the 1980s, the recession hit all Los Angeles 
restaurants, especially the big places like Chasen's that had high overheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Time took its toll as well. Dave Chasen, an ex-vaudevillian who had more luck 
with his chili than with his comedy, died in 1973 and Maude, once an inveterate 
table-hopper, is in her 90s. She reportedly has scarcely gone to the restaurant 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 And for today's trendies -- the GenX-ers who make and break fashion -- old age 
made Chasen's and places like it irrelevant. Who wanted to spend an evening 
rubbernecking at, say, ninetysomething George Burns when Johnny Depp might be 
at the Viper Room five minutes away? 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Chasen's site is being sold to a developer who plans to put up a mall 
with a supermarket, a chain drugstore and perhaps even a scaled-down version of 
Maude and Dave's place. 
</P>
<P>
 But a comeback restaurant might find it tough going in a world where younger 
stars scoff at the aura of formality that Old Hollywood adored. "The last few 
years, it's been all grunge and jeans," said Pamela Anderson, a co-star of the 
hot TV series "Baywatch" and a restaurant investor herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Janklow, editor of Mouth2Mouth magazine, which caters to readers in 
their 20s, said Chasen's is in a "rarefied realm of restaurants where you would 
make a plan to go there, you would have to dress up, and your dreams the night 
before would be of a Hobo steak." 
</P>
<P>
 She, personally, has not been to Chasen's since her last big family gathering, 
"a grand, ceremonial evening with Gramps."

SUDDENLY, O.C. POLITICIANS ARE ON THRESHOLD OF POWER; GOVERNMENT: GOP SWEEP IN 
NATIONAL ELECTIONS HAS SHIFTED LOCAL LAWMAKERS FROM FRINGE TO LEADERSHIP.

<P>
 To outsiders, Orange County's brand of Republican politics has seemed like 
nothing short of right-wing nuttiness. 
</P>
<P>
 When judged collectively, the county's representatives in Sacramento and in 
Washington have been seen as a band of tightly wound, vitriolic politicians who 
reveled in the media spotlight that followed some of their more controversial 
comments on such issues as gay rights, federal funding for the arts and illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the political fallout of the Nov. 8 election, during which the GOP 
gained control of Congress and is on the verge of capturing the state Assembly, 
some observers now argue that the Republican sweep not only shifted the policy 
debate to the right, it also placed Orange County politicians on the threshold 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what? In the aftermath of their '94 victory, can the Republicans make 
something of this long-awaited opportunity to seize the reins of power as 1995 
unfolds? Will their pugilistic instincts be transformed into legislative 
pragmatism? 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on them. And what it depends upon is turning what has historically 
been a negative agenda into a positive one," said Mark Petracca, a UC Irvine 
political science professor. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who has steadily 
focused on budgetary issues, the Orange County congressional delegation has 
been considered by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as "lightweight" or 
"negative," Petracca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not pretend that within the Republican (congressional) delegation, even 
when it was the minority delegation, that Orange County was being given much 
attention, because it was not," he said, adding that the same could be said for 
the county's state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real challenge for the party as a whole to go from naysayers -- and 
transforming yourself in a very short period of time without undergoing a 
series of lobotomies -- to a productive party of change," Petracca said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the state Assembly paralyzed by a battle over which party will take 
control and elect the next Assembly Speaker, it is still unclear whether Orange 
County delegates will assume the committee leadership positions they are now 
poised to take. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Congress, the task of assuming new responsibilities has been made 
easier by the Republicans' takeover in the House that ended the Democrats' 
40-year reign, said John J. Pitney Jr., a government professor at Claremont 
McKenna College, who recently co-authored a book on House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats used to say, '(Orange County Republicans) are just a bunch of gnats 
swirling around your ear. You can't ignore them but they can't do anything,' " 
Pitney said. "Now you have to take them seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, members of the local delegation will have the titles when the next 
session of Congress is gaveled to order Wednesday. Four of the six members of 
Orange County's delegation will ascend to top leadership positions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cox, with his election to head the GOP Policy Committee, will be the 
fifth-ranking Republican in the House -- the highest position for any 
Californian -- and in the small circle of leaders who meet daily with House 
Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach congressman also has a seat on the powerful Energy and 
Commerce Committee, where he will sponsor hearings on proposed securities 
reforms in light of the Orange County financial crisis, and will serve on a 
House GOP task force on California, which was created by Gingrich to improve 
communications with the state government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), as a member of the money-dealing 
Appropriations Committee, will head the legislative branch subcommittee and 
will also serve on the Foreign Operations and Transportation Appropriations 
subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who sits on what is now known as the 
Armed Services Committee and on the Intelligence Committee, expects to head a 
subcommittee on each panel, a rarity if it occurs. His top choice is the 
military forces and personnel subcommittee, which will take on lightning-rod 
issues such as military pay, gays in the military and the role of women in 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), although he did not get his 
first choice to head the space subcommittee, will chair the energy and 
environment subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 The two remaining members of the Orange County delegation, Rep. Ed Royce 
(R-Fullerton) and Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), are just beginning their 
second terms, but they promise to be behind-the-scenes players. Kim has been 
named a sophomore class whip, and Royce, like others in the delegation, is a 
"Friend of Newt." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the titles, both Kim and Royce immediately felt the power 
bestowed upon Republicans after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Royce said he felt it in the way he was addressed by Democratic colleagues who 
used to turn up their noses at Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the elevator the other day with other Republicans, and one of the 
Democratic members said to the Republicans, 'I certainly hope you will treat us 
the same way we treated you,' " Royce recalled. "You can certainly count on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he got a taste of that power the day after the election. On election 
eve, his office experienced a major computer breakdown and his staff was told 
by the repairman that it would take one a week to fix the problem. The morning 
after the GOP victory, "the very same technician solved the problem in a matter 
of hours," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said he used to telephone his parents to advise them of an upcoming 
television appearance. Now, he's too busy to keep track of his media 
interviews. "I turned down (CNN's) 'Crossfire' tonight because there's just too 
much work to do," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Rohrabacher had battled with the Pentagon for release of $35 
million for a reusable rocket developed by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in 
Huntington Beach -- funds that had been approved last year. Within days of the 
election, the Clinton Administration announced the funding would resume. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dornan said he was treated with reverence while in Europe for the recent 
anniversary celebration of the Battle of the Bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sensed the difference. They were dealing with a chairman from the 
majority," Dornan said. "This is power city, and when you are a chairman, you 
can feel as though they are looking at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking and listening. 
</P>
<P>
 What once seemed like the meaningless rhetoric of powerless conservative 
Republicans could now become the mantra of the GOP-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitney, the government professor, said he believes that because the Republican 
conference has become more conservative, "the Orange County delegation is very 
much in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 But from his unique position as the highest-ranking Republican in the Clinton 
Administration, former Orange County businessman and now General Services 
Administrator Roger W. Johnson suggested that the November election was not an 
endorsement of conservative ideals, but a call for substantive changes in how 
the federal government is run. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the local delegation should steer toward the center and focus on 
"substance, not ideology" to gain credibility and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This county's delegation will have to change their approach to be effective," 
Johnson said. "I think Chris Cox will have to change it the least." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Dornan, the hero of the Rush Limbaugh crowd, is any indication, a line will 
be drawn between those conservative causes that are "substantive" as opposed to 
"symbolic." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's early support for school prayer, for example, was not espoused by 
Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's other cultural battles to fight," Dornan said. "Let that one come up 
way at the end of (next) year. If we have a big contentious debate on the House 
floor, it is going to eat away from what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 What he would like to do, should he become chairman of the military personnel 
subcommittee, is advance other conservative principles, such as his opposition 
to married recruits, and his belief that "muscle strength" should determine the 
roles of women in combat. 
</P>
<P>
 A government ban on gays in the military, Dornan added, would send a message 
that would "make people think about whether this is a destructive lifestyle. 
That is a significant impact on the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Political watchers also remind the Republicans that they are coming into power 
at a point in history when voters have little regard for them, and with the 
increasingly popular idea of a third political party. 
</P>
<P>
 After criticizing Democrats for "pork barrel" politics, the Republicans now 
have to avoid the temptation of measuring success by the amount of bacon they 
bring home. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's early refusal to seek a federal bailout for Orange County in 
light of its historic bankruptcy exemplifies the prevailing Republican 
philosophy against federalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the federal government can do anything to help them out," 
Packard said. "I don't think they should have any special dispensation. 
Besides, we don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 So, as Congress moves to cut government spending, funds for the Santa Ana 
Courthouse project, the proposed El Toro airport (assuming it survives the 
bankruptcy debacle), and even Rohrabacher's space rocket contract, will have to 
be delivered to the delegation's districts without the appearance of a 
contradiction in philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cuts both ways," said Jim McConnell, Orange County's lobbyist in 
Washington. "I am glad that our delegation is going to have increased 
responsibility and increased opportunity. However, there could be a downside in 
thinking that because they are there now, we are going to get . . . more money, 
because there's not going to be more money available."

COLUMN ONE; WHERE THE STARS WENT OUT AT NIGHT; CHASEN'S. PERINO'S. THE COCOANUT 
GROVE. OLD HOLLYWOOD'S ROYALTY HELD COURT IN GLAMOROUS RESTAURANTS WHOSE TIME 
HAS PASSED THEM BY.

<P>
 For 58 years -- an eternity in this town -- Chasen's was the quintessence of 
Hollywood, as sublime as the expensive caviar that is on the menu and as 
low-brow as the world-famous chili that is not. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the spot where fans could find President Ronald Reagan with his boiled 
beef in Booth No. 2. Alfred Hitchcock routinely fell asleep at his table. 
Humphrey Bogart and his third wife fought raucously at theirs. Howard Hughes 
once rose from his and asked to use the house phone for a second. He was still 
gabbing like a wild man at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when everyone who was anyone in Hollywood could have been 
found in one of the deep, dark banquettes at Chasen's, on the dance floor at 
the Cocoanut Grove, in the foyer of Cafe Trocadero or tucking into a Cobb salad 
at the Brown Derby. But those were the days when a star was a star and a 
restaurant was not just a hangout or a plate of food but an establishment in 
which to see and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for reasons sociological and otherwise, neither stars nor their 
backdrops, no matter how dazzling, seem quite what they used to be. And in a 
city where the bon mot of the moment is, "That is soooo five-minutes-ago," 
there isn't much room for institutions anymore, either of the human or the 
brick and mortar variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea in Hollywood is to be in the prow," said Neal Gabler, who has 
written extensively about Tinseltown history. "The idea is to be at that place 
that is the center of the center. And Chasen's became an anachronism." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler and other historians say the closing this spring of Dave and Maude 
Chasen's sprawling ersatz chateau will mark the latest -- and nearly the last 
-- nail in the coffin for Old Hollywood. Its owners promise that the West 
Hollywood eatery will someday return, in a new and "streamlined" incarnation, 
but restaurateurs and other observers of Los Angeles' social culture contend 
that it is more likely that it will join such bygone glamour spots as Perino's, 
Romanoff's, Scandia, the Mocambo and the Zebra Room in that big back booth in 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the time it takes to read this article, the latest Hollywood in-spot will 
probably be on its way out -- part of the inevitable rhythm of doing business 
in modern Los Angeles. House of Blues, Viper Room and Tatou are at the cutting 
edge of a subculture that may be more fickle than any in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the Los Angeles of the 1990s, today's "institution" is tomorrow's 
commercial-space-for-lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to live with the realization that this town changes a lot," said 
Jerry Prendergast, general manager of Sanctuary, a currently hip restaurant in 
Beverly Hills that previously housed the once-hip Cafe Morpheus and before that 
the also-hip Asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone comes here to get away from tradition," he said. "I'm surprised that 
there's actually a Brooks Brothers here." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always this way. There was a time, it seemed, when icons had more 
than 15 minutes of fame, and a place that could last for 58 years might stand a 
shot at immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Chasen's moved past its prime in the late '70s, historian Gabler 
noted, "the action moved on to Ma Maison, to Spago. To be at Chasen's was to 
mark yourself as a dinosaur, it was to be in the past with the Brown Derby or 
Romanoff's. They're all gone now because Hollywood is a place where the object 
is to be in vogue. . . . Sometime it will be Spago's turn. They all have 
built-in obsolescence. They are all dependent on being on the very edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler, who did research on Chasen's for his 1988 book "An Empire of Their 
Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood," said the trend reflects not only the 
fast-forward nature of '90s L.A., but the evolution of Hollywood stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 With the collapse of the tightly controlled studio system, glamour was 
transferred from a few special settings to a constantly changing cast of 
individuals, he said. So hot places today do not have to be designed for luxury 
because the spark comes "from the people who are there, not that notion of the 
restaurant as stage setting," Gabler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Film archivist and historian Marc Wanamaker can rattle off the obituary list 
of restaurants and nightclubs that once were synonymous with traditional 
Hollywood glitz. With Chasen's soon to join them, only Musso & Frank on 
Hollywood Boulevard will remain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents the typical lack of interest in supporting the old places," 
Wanamaker said. "The old people are dying off or are not going there anymore. 
The newer people have no cultural roots here, nothing that relates them to 
Chasen's or Musso's and they couldn't care less. The crux of the problem is 
that most people have no cultural or emotional ties to any of these landmarks." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last year, another beloved institution -- Nickodell Restaurant -- was 
shuttered. The Melrose Avenue eatery had been a hangout for actors and 
technicians from Paramount Pictures, its next-door neighbor, since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a martini and club steak kind of place in a town increasingly hooked on 
bottled water and tuna tacos. Business fell into decline and the neighborhood 
got rougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, the landlord for three years, at first insisted that it had no 
immediate plans for the site after the restaurant closed. But a few weeks 
later, Nickodell and its towering blue-and-white sign were gone. In an example 
of Hollywood wizardry, the Paramount parking lot fence was extended around the 
property and mature bushes lined the perimeter as if nothing else had ever been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the Northridge earthquake in January further weakened the 
boarded-up and fire-damaged Brown Derby restaurant building on Vine Street in 
Hollywood, property owners opted for demolition of that once-proud 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists insisted that the 1929 building where Clark Gable proposed 
marriage to Carole Lombard could have been saved. But a parking lot emerged and 
the protesters were reduced to holding a mock funeral. (The Original Brown 
Derby on Wilshire Boulevard -- an informal lunch counter that spawned the 
fancier Derby on Vine -- was ripped down in the mid-'80s and its signature hat 
crowns the mini-mall on the site.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Cocoanut Grove Club, once the epicenter of movieland social life and the 
scene of several Academy Awards ceremonies, closed in 1988 after 67 years in 
business. The fate of the building is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Perino's, the elegant eatery that fed the likes of Cole Porter, Eleanor 
Roosevelt and Bugsy Siegel, suffered a lingering death. It opened in 1932 on 
Wilshire Boulevard and later moved to another spot on the street where it 
survived until a 1985 bankruptcy; an attempted revival did not succeed although 
the structure still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. has never been a place to revere its history or respect its history," 
said Greg Williams, a preservation activist with the Hollywood Heritage 
organization, which tried to save the Brown Derby. "We always like the fresh 
and new, build it up and tear it down. But I don't find a lot of it is an 
improvement. We tear too much of it down and wind up with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood old-timers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the business change and Chasen's is a symbol of what once was," 
said 69-year-old Danny Arnold, producer of such shows as "Barney Miller," "My 
World and Welcome to It," "Bewitched" and "That Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, the industry was interested in the classics, there was a 
great deal more charm," he said. "Today, I think everything appeals to raw 
emotions and it's a reflection of the times we live in." 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, is apparent even in the movies themselves. "If you don't blow 
up five buildings and kill 30 people in the first 40 feet of film, you're going 
downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its first incarnation, Chasen's hardly had the look of a Hollywood glamour 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The place had six tables, an eight-stool counter and sold chili at 25 cents a 
bowl. Bar drinks ran about 35 cents. About 15 people attended the restaurant's 
opening night, Dec. 13, 1936, but they were the kind of people who in those 
days could set a restaurant for life: Frank Capra. Jimmy Cagney. Pat O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Chasen's joined the Hollywood pantheon and became the sort of 
place that would evoke vivid memories decades hence -- of the escapades that 
occurred there, the famous faces, the deals, the setting, the owners 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Chasen's when it was just a barbecue pit," sighed Lita Grey 
Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's second wife, who is 86 and living in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years it grew and grew until it became one of the most popular 
restaurants in town, for film luminaries and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Seltzer, the veteran producer and a former Hollywood public relations 
man, said he will never forget Dean Martin's bachelor party when another 
well-known star "got very drunk and managed to shock even the most 
sophisticated friends of Dean by (relieving himself) into the potted plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Shenanigans and gimmicks were the order of the day, and restaurateurs who were 
willing to play along were part of what made the industry run. Ciro's became 
legendary as the spot where contract players were sent on fake dates arranged 
by studio publicists. 
</P>
<P>
 The people caricatured at the Brown Derby, and the placement of their 
cartoons, could make or break careers. The eatery also gave 50% discounts to 
gossip columnists simply for showing up and eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 In a town that lives on its own P.R., Chasen's ranked with the best of them. 
When a movie star -- any movie star -- got admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, Chasen's would ship some chili over so the celebrity would not have to 
eat hospital food. When Shirley Temple sobbed one night for a cocktail like the 
ones her mother and father had, the bartender purportedly invented a concoction 
of ginger ale, grenadine and fruit that still bears her name. When a pregnant 
Dorothy Lamour was uncomfortable at Table 12, Dave Chasen had a portion of it 
cut out to comfortably accommodate her. 
</P>
<P>
 The place, Seltzer said, "instilled the feeling that you were in a private 
club, populated by your colleagues and by your peers and by your bosses. It was 
a social event." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday night, he added, was the prime time at the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dress code was strictly observed, a coat and tie," he said. "And (they had) a 
marvelous conceit even when credit cards were available, a house account. If 
you had a Chasen's account, that was a badge of belonging, of importance. That 
was a sociological phenomenon of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday of the restaurant stretched on through the decades, through change 
upon change in fads, food and philosophy. Through the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, 
Chasen's flourished, maturing from its humble origins to a sumptuous, gated 
mansion of a place, with soft lighting and expensive furnishings and solicitous 
waiters and -- the selling point that would one day contribute to its demise -- 
an emphasis on old-fashioned class and old-fashioned food and lots and lots of 
elbowroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represented the era when the studios ran the town . . . when the star 
system was in its glory," said Herb Steinberg, former vice president of MCA 
Recreation Division and a Chasen's regular since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "You went, you dressed up, you wore a shirt and tie. It was a great 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what once seemed like great atmosphere came increasingly to resemble 
stultifying boredom as the old Hollywood haunts gave way to the new, and 
tuxedos and cocktail frocks were replaced by Armani jackets and jeans, 
regardless of gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chasen's out-aged the new generation," Steinberg lamented. "They don't have 
the formality, they like to go to places where you don't have a tie. They like 
to go to places where you don't have to make a reservation. At Chasen's, you 
always had to make a reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, economics took over. Although Chasen's made it through the 1970s 
to a Reagan-era renaissance in the 1980s, the recession hit all Los Angeles 
restaurants, especially the big places like Chasen's that had high overheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Time took its toll as well. Dave Chasen, an ex-vaudevillian who had more luck 
with his chili than with his comedy, died in 1973 and Maude, once an inveterate 
table-hopper, is in her 90s. She reportedly has scarcely gone to the restaurant 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 And for today's trendies -- the GenX-ers who make and break fashion -- old age 
made Chasen's and places like it irrelevant. Who wanted to spend an evening 
rubbernecking at, say, ninetysomething George Burns when Johnny Depp might be 
at the Viper Room five minutes away? 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Chasen's site is being sold to a developer who plans to put up a mall 
with a supermarket, a chain drugstore and perhaps even a scaled-down version of 
Maude and Dave's place. 
</P>
<P>
 But a comeback restaurant might find it tough going in a world where younger 
stars scoff at the aura of formality that Old Hollywood adored. "The last few 
years, it's been all grunge and jeans," said Pamela Anderson, a co-star of the 
hot TV series "Baywatch" and a restaurant investor herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Janklow, editor of Mouth2Mouth magazine, which caters to readers in 
their 20s, said Chasen's is in a "rarefied realm of restaurants where you would 
make a plan to go there, you would have to dress up, and your dreams the night 
before would be of a Hobo steak." 
</P>
<P>
 She, personally, has not been to Chasen's since her last big family gathering, 
"a grand, ceremonial evening with Gramps."

 North Korea today released an American helicopter pilot shot down 13 days ago, 
ending a crisis that threatened a fragile peace in one of the world's most 
dangerous corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, looking serious and tense, was escorted by 
North Korean army officers to the truce village of Panmunjom at 11:16 a.m. 
(6:16 p.m. Thursday PST). After a pause, he took a single step across the 
border into South Korea, saluted the U.S. military officer who received him, 
then shook his hand. He appeared to be in good health. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, shot down with co-pilot David Hilemon on Dec. 17, was whisked by 
helicopter to Seoul for a medical examination and military debriefing. He was 
due to fly home to Brooksville, Fla., today to join his family. Hilemon died 
when the helicopter crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 28, quickly spoke by telephone with his parents and with President 
Clinton, who expressed pleasure at the release but criticized Pyongyang for not 
acting more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Warrant Officer Hall was held for too long after his helicopter strayed 
off course on a routine training mission," Clinton told reporters at the White 
House. "But we are very glad that he . . . is now in freedom. . . . His medical 
condition is currently being evaluated. But we had a good visit, and he said he 
is feeling well." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's father, Bobby Hall Sr., told reporters that his son sounded "tired, 
upbeat, ready to come home." 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was doing good," the elder Hall said. "He's well and in good 
physical shape, and we look forward to seeing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the agreement on Hall's release contained nothing to compromise 
any U.S. commitments. Some observers have felt that Pyongyang was trying to 
draw Washington into contacts that might undercut American commitments to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The terms of the agreement are clear from their own words. We were faithful 
to all of our commitments to our allies and to our commitments to our own 
policies," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's release followed two weeks of denunciations by the North Korean regime, 
which had called the flight a spy mission and demanded an American apology. But 
the written statement containing the final deal with State Department envoy 
Thomas Hubbard, who spent three days in Pyongyang negotiating Hall's freedom, 
reflected the U.S. view that the aircraft had "accidentally strayed" across the 
demilitarized zone and into hostile territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States expressed "sincere regret for this incident" and promised to 
work to prevent similar occurrences, said State Department spokesman Mike 
McCurry. But that pledge fell far short of the apology that the North Korean 
regime had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only U.S. concession seemed to be in language that said the United 
States and North Korea would work to find a forum for preventing such 
occurrences in the future. That language opened the possibility that the two 
countries would begin communicating directly on such issues, as the North 
Koreans have wished, rather than through the 40-year-old multilateral Military 
Armistice Commission or the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Koreans believe such direct channels would give their regime added 
legitimacy. But U.S. officials stressed that the possibility of direct talks -- 
sure to upset the South Koreans -- has not been resolved. They said they intend 
to press to have such disputes handled through existing channels rather than 
through new direct contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean Foreign Ministry issued a statement welcoming Hall's release 
and expressing hope that it might lead to increased South-North dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incident has reaffirmed the reality of military confrontation in the 
Korean peninsula," the statement noted. "We urge North Korea to remove this 
abnormal situation by resuming South-North dialogue and improving the 
South-North relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's official announcement of the deal came in a radio broadcast in 
which the regime said Hall would be returned because the United States had 
"accepted our demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called Hall's wife late Thursday afternoon and said, "We've been 
successful." Donna Hall was "a little bit teary," another official said. "You 
could hear shouting with delight." 
</P>
<P>
 News of Hall's impending release also brought tears and huzzahs from 
supporters in Brooksville and across the country, where sympathetic Americans 
had begun displaying yellow ribbons, just as they did in hostage incidents 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release agreement, the Clinton Administration seemed to have narrowly 
eluded a variety of calamities. As it nearly dragged on into a third week, with 
hopes rising and then falling, the situation had begun to look like the kind of 
long-running hostage crisis that can do terrible damage to a presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more immediately, the incident threatened the $4-billion nuclear deal 
under which the North Koreans agreed to stop producing plutonium and halt 
nuclear weapons research, and instead to use less-dangerous Western 
technologies for civilian nuclear power. That accord's critics, led by newly 
powerful congressional Republicans, had begun to question openly whether the 
United States should deal with the unstable regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher had also warned that continued detention 
of Hall could have threatened the accord, which is to give the North Koreans 
huge stores of fuel, as well as nuclear technology. The agreement still 
requires congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the efforts of Hubbard, who is a deputy assistant 
secretary of state, met a firm rebuff when he met with a lower level North 
Korean Foreign Ministry official on Wednesday. As some Americans had expected, 
the North Korean official "squawked . . . and things went nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials interpreted that brusque treatment as a device to placate 
hard-liners, including those from the military, who oppose the nuclear accord 
and want to show the United States that North Korea will not be pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the second day, Hubbard met with Kang Sok Ju, first vice minister of 
foreign affairs, and talks began to move swiftly toward an agreement. The final 
deal was approved by what the North Koreans called "the supreme leadership" -- 
an entity that U.S. officials believed included Kim Jong Il, son of longtime 
dictator Kim Il Sung, and others who were not identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming throughout the crisis was the question of whether the North Korean 
regime was directed by a coherent leadership group, or whether it consisted of 
no more than feuding factions. The episode seemed to show, U.S. officials said, 
that, while there were clearly different groups with bitter disagreements, a 
leadership group is making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. strategy had been to acknowledge that an error had been made, but to 
give no sign that they were willing to make concessions for Hall's release. In 
the final negotiations, North Koreans sought to win more concessions than they 
got, including an apology and direct talks with the United States, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Koreans did not, however, try to renegotiate any terms of the 
nuclear accord, U.S. aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's release came one day after the North Koreans released a long, 
handwritten statement that they described as a confession by Hall asking 
forgiveness for "a flagrant violation of international law." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials took the statement as a sign the North Koreans were ready to 
release Hall but wanted to save face with a public statement that would seem to 
acknowledge mistakes by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials noted that details of the navigational route included in Hall's 
purported confession seemed to corroborate American claims that the pilots were 
under instructions to stay away from North Korean airspace and had simply 
strayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the co-pilot, Hilemon, 29, of Clarksville, Tenn., was returned 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's supporters across the country were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, retired Army Sgt. Ken Knox had decided to keep his Christmas 
lights burning until Hall was released. That set off a chain reaction 
throughout his neighborhood that eventually drew the attention of the national 
television media. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fantastic," Knox said Thursday when he heard news of the release. "I 
just think it's great it all ended so well." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Publix supermarket in Brooksville, where Hall once rang up sales, the 
cash registers were adorned with yellow bows, and each cashier wore a yellow 
ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Jenkins, who knew Hall when he was a young bag-boy at the Publix Store, 
said she was "just shaking. I'm so happy -- it's beautiful to hear this." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Cable News Network, Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who 
brought Hilemon's remains out of North Korea last week, said of Hall: "I think 
he's a real American hero for the way he took this . . . with a lot of grace 
and fortitude."

NEWS ANALYSIS; YELTSIN TAKES GAMBLE WITH CRACKDOWN IN CAUCASUS; RUSSIA: 
PRESIDENT'S FORMER ALLIES ARE NOW AMONG HIS HARSHEST CRITICS. THEY BRAND HIM A 
KREMLIN HARD-LINER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With his decision to storm the rebel Chechen capital of Grozny, Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin's transformation from populist reformer to Kremlin 
hard-liner is complete, the Russian president's many critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeltsin is at the point of no return," political analyst Alexei G. Arbatov 
said. "He has decided to go all out. He thinks he needs no allies because the 
army and police are on his side. He spits on the democrats' love." 
</P>
<P>
 As bombs fell on a Grozny orphanage, making a mockery of Yeltsin's promise to 
halt the bombing of civilian targets, democrats who once embraced the former 
Sverdlovsk Communist Party boss as the symbol of Russian reform said they can 
no longer support the Russian president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the feeling that we and the president are living in two separate 
information fields," said liberal economist Yegor T. Gaidar, referring to the 
growing and sometimes absurd divide between Russian government statements about 
the conflict in Chechnya and the footage that Russian citizens see on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has made a fatal mistake," Gaidar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin jettisoned Gaidar in January after the liberal economist, the first 
architect of Russia's free-market reforms, led the only party that campaigned 
under Yeltsin's banner to a humiliating defeat in last year's parliamentary 
elections. But Gaidar stayed loyal to Yeltsin, even when the president stopped 
returning his telephone calls once Gaidar spoke out against the intervention in 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two days, Gaidar, former Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov and 
human rights activist Yelena G. Bonner, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize-winning 
dissident Andrei D. Sakharov, have all broken publicly with the president over 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "A democratic country cannot keep by armed force an ethnic group that does not 
want to remain in it," Bonner wrote in a letter to Yeltsin. Claiming that 
Russia was turning back to totalitarianism, she resigned from the president's 
human rights commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberal Fyodorov had initially supported the crackdown, arguing that 
multinational Russia must defend its territorial integrity or risk becoming an 
ethnic Humpty Dumpty. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, he blasted the government for causing needless bloodshed 
through gross military incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov and Gaidar said the war in Chechnya threatened to bust the Russian 
budget, send inflation skyrocketing and shackle this new democracy's fragile 
political freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar said he will not seek Yeltsin's impeachment, as some have demanded, but 
hinted that the democrats will be looking for an alternative to Yeltsin in 
presidential elections scheduled 18 months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must pay for your mistakes if you are president," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Yeltsin has lost the support of not only the democrats but 
also most of Russia's intellectuals, journalists, members of Parliament and 
many of his own senior advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 One Russian newspaper on Thursday dubbed the president "Bombeltsin." 
</P>
<P>
 Far more damaging, at least five army generals have publicly criticized the 
Russian attack on the tiny Muslim republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the purpose of killing people?" Lt. Gen. Alexander I. Lebed, 
commander of the Russian 14th Army in Tiraspol, Moldova, asked in an interview 
with the news agency Interfax. "Are there no other ways to resolve the problem? 
Or would Moscow lose too much merely by talking to (Chechen President Dzhokar 
M.) Dudayev?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The blitzkrieg has failed," said Deputy Defense Minister Boris V. Gromov, who 
faces possible dismissal for criticizing the intervention, which he warns could 
split the armed forces and lead to civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts saw the renewed bombardment of Grozny as a watershed for Yeltsin, who 
has now thrown in his lot with the most hawkish of his Kremlin advisers and 
staked his political future on a quick victory in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a populist from the very beginning, not a democrat," Caucasus scholar 
Sergei A. Arutiunov said. "He is turning into a puppet of the hard-line 
generals surrounding him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who appear to have Yeltsin's trust are the powerful Security 
Council Secretary Oleg I. Lobov, Nationalities Minister Nikolai D. Yegorov and 
the mysterious head of Yeltsin's security service, Maj. Gen. Alexander V. 
Korzhakov. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yeltsin met with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to discuss how 
to restore Chechnya's economy, Chernomyrdin seems distanced from his boss of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Kremlinologists -- who are making a comeback as the decision-making process 
inside the red brick fortress becomes ever more opaque -- whisper that 
Korzhakov has been especially influential on Chechnya policy. Yeltsin once 
described himself as "inseparable" from Korzhakov, who was the KGB bodyguard 
assigned to Yeltsin when he joined the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadowy Korzhakov's powers have come under intense scrutiny since the 
leaking of an eyebrow-raising letter in which Korzhakov instructed Chernomyrdin 
to review agreements made with the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is running the country -- Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin or Gen. Korzhakov?" a 
recent headline in the newspaper Izvestia asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the hawks clearly have the president's ear, they may be saying exactly 
what Yeltsin wants to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that Yeltsin is merely continuing the political 
metamorphosis he began one year ago, when ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky and the Communists trounced Gaidar and other democrats in elections 
to Russia's first post-Communist Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals who clung to the comforting thought that the 1993 election results 
were a fluke have been disabused of the notion this year, when nationalists and 
Communists triumphed in local by-elections across Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the shrewd politician, Yeltsin began redefining himself as the 
authoritarian "strong hand" that poll after poll say some Russians long for. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years ago, when Zhirinovsky was generally dismissed as an 
extremist crank, the tireless orator stood up on a platform in Gorky Park and 
promised his sparse but zealous crowd that Russia would soon regain its former 
Caucasian and Black Sea possessions, along with its battered prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Zhirinovsky is one of the few lawmakers who support Yeltsin's Chechnya 
policy, along with such "national patriots" as Sergei N. Baburin and Alexander 
G. Nevzorov, and a coalition of conservative regional officials headed by 
former Soviet Politburo member Alexander S. Dzasokhov. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, Yeltsin has already embraced Zhirinovsky's line," Arutiunov said. 
"What he is doing in Chechnya is exactly what Zhirinovsky would do. So it has 
happened already." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, Yeltsin has also adopted a more stridently nationalist 
tone on such questions as Bosnia-Herzegovina, NATO membership for Eastern 
Europe and an early lifting of the trade embargo against the former Soviet 
Union's best client, Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Russian Foreign Ministry once again said Moscow wants changes 
in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which limits the number of troops 
it can station in "flank" areas such as Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that the Soviet-era treaty is discriminatory toward Russia in light of 
its post-Soviet borders, spokesman Grigory B. Karasin complained that the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization has dragged its feet on agreeing to allow more 
Russian troops to be stationed in the Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karasin hinted that Russia might have to take unspecified measures to protect 
its national interests if the treaty is not revised soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey is lobbying NATO against allowing Russia to move more troops southward, 
concerned that Russia is steadily re-creating its Soviet-era military presence 
in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloodier Yeltsin's crackdown on Chechnya, the less likely is the West to 
accommodate Russian demands on such sensitive issues as troop limits and the 
expansion of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing that 75% of Russians no longer support him, Yeltsin is 
clearly gambling that a quick victory in Chechnya will revive his authority and 
his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that the Chechen war will cost more money and political goodwill 
than Yeltsin expects. Most wars do. Russia's first freely elected president 
could wind up jeopardizing both economic progress and the support of the West. 
That could hurt even a Kremlin hard-liner.

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL RUN FOR A SECOND TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Putting to rest speculation that he might not seek a second term, President 
Clinton declared emphatically on Thursday that he would run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 He professed not to care whether he is challenged from within the Democratic 
Party or faces a third-party candidate in 1996, saying: "I'm not worried about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to seek reelection, but that is not uppermost in my mind," Clinton 
said in a year-end press interview. He said his chief motivations were to 
better the lives of citizens and improve the operation of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was asked if there were any circumstance under which he would not seek 
a new term. "No," he answered quickly. "As long as I have my health and I'm 
doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's intention to seek reelection comes as little surprise. He has 
indicated ever since the Democratic debacle in November's midterm elections 
that he had no intention of walking away from the White House, despite the 
obstacles he faces in trying to govern with Congress firmly in Republican 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The President is putting together a new political team that will include many 
of those who engineered his 1992 victory, but will add some new faces. He has 
been described as furious at those aides whose bad advice contributed to the 
GOP landslide and determined to serve as his own campaign manager in his 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's tone was upbeat on Thursday, despite the difficult political road 
ahead and the continuing turmoil within his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey surprised the White House 
earlier this week by announcing his resignation, adding to the long list of 
vacancies Clinton must fill as he enters the second half of this term. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's interview with wire service reporters, the President said he 
anticipates conflict with the Republicans on budget and tax matters, social 
issues such as gun control and some appointments to Administration jobs. But he 
expressed hope that the White House and the GOP Congress could reach 
accommodations on such issues as welfare reform, efforts to restructure the 
government and the line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be divisions, there will be differences, there will be hard 
fights. There ought to be, there will be. I can assure you there will be," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some times when I will not be able to be where they are. But 
there will be a lot of things we can do together, and it will be an exciting 
and productive time for America if we really try to help the country instead of 
to help ourselves in the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 The President said his top priority would be enactment of his "middle-class 
bill of rights," a $60-billion package of tax cuts for families, education 
incentives and tax breaks for retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said government "cannot create opportunity, but it can expand it. 
Government cannot force people to be responsible. They can reward 
responsibility and give incentives. Governments can strengthen partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "So where would I be different (from the Republicans?)" he asked rhetorically. 
"I don't think that we ought to get into a bidding war over tax cuts and ignore 
the important need to keep restraint on the (federal budget) deficit. And we 
have restrained this deficit. We have now taken $10,000 in debt off every 
family in this country since I've been President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would continue to 
play a central role in the Administration, despite the failure of her health 
care reform plan. He said the public was frightened by the plan because it was 
misrepresented by opponents as a government takeover of the nation's health 
care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinary voters were convinced -- wrongly -- that we want the government to 
run their health care and take their choice away," Clinton said. But he added: 
"I'm not discouraged or despondent" that the initiative collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was asked whether the ethics and legal investigations involving a 
number of friends, allies and Cabinet members was taking a toll on him 
personally and constraining him politically. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a judge in Little Rock, Ark., ruled that while the trial on a 
sexual-harassment suit filed against Clinton by a former Arkansas state 
employee would have to wait until after he leaves office, fact-finding could go 
forward beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not worried about it. It just takes a lot of time and costs a 
lot of money," the President replied. "I'm just going to cooperate and roll on, 
do my job."

NEWS ANALYSIS; EPISODE POINTS TO LIMITATIONS OF NUCLEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The detention of American helicopter pilot Bobby Hall demonstrated in stark 
fashion the benefits and many limitations in the far-reaching nuclear deal the 
Clinton Administration recently worked out with North Korea, the world's most 
isolated regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, the 13-day episode showed that the agreement has done nothing so 
far to ease tensions raised by conventional military forces on the Korean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea still has more than 1 million soldiers north of the demilitarized 
zone, which remains one of the world's most volatile regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deal signed in October, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear 
weapons program and, over the next decade, dismantle all its nuclear 
installations in exchange for energy supplies and progress toward diplomatic 
recognition from the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covered only nuclear issues and did not try to address the many 
other problems caused by massive troop deployments in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to begin to defuse the DMZ," former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea 
James R. Lilley told The Times last week. "We ought to exchange observers (with 
North Korea), have hot lines, arrange a pullback of forces and work out 
notification of flights. This episode is an opportunity to try to make sure 
this never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials can point to Hall's release as a sign that, in the 
end, North Korea wants to reach at least some minimum form of accommodation 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not sound like much. But it is more than was commonly believed 
possible three years ago, when many in the West believed that North Korea was 
implacably hostile and totally unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the helicopter episode also underscored just how shaky the North Korean 
leadership is and how often it is willing to push a situation to the brink. 
</P>
<P>
 For the U.S. government, which over the next decade faces a series of 
deadlines in the complex nuclear deal with North Korea, Pyongyang's willingness 
once again to test American patience and resolve can only be ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By detaining Hall, North Korea tried -- as it did in the earlier nuclear 
negotiations -- to draw the United States further into direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, thus diminishing the role of South Korea, America's longtime ally. 
</P>
<P>
 These direct negotiations with the United States help give North Korea 
legitimacy, internationally and in the battle with Seoul for stature among the 
Korean people. 
</P>
<P>
 As both North and South Korea begin to think about the possibilities of 
reunification, each government hopes to portray itself as the embodiment of 
Korean nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 What better way to do so than to stand up to the world's leading superpower? 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea held Hall just about as long as it could before its nascent 
relationship with the United States would have been permanently damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Congress convenes in Washington next week, and if Hall were still in 
North Korean captivity then, there could have been a rush on Capitol Hill to 
invalidate the nuclear deal between the United States and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (the North Koreans) made a point of not releasing him (Hall) 
before Christmas," one State Department official observed this week, pointing 
out that the episode showed Pyongyang's continuing eagerness to show that it 
can't be pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What accounts for North Korea's behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall episode -- and the negotiations for his release by Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard -- have reinforced the view in Washington 
that the leadership in Pyongyang is divided between two factions. 
</P>
<P>
 One faction, involving the Foreign Ministry and perhaps economic ministries, 
seems to want to develop a relationship with the United States, Japan and other 
major powers. The aim is apparently to bring North Korea out of its isolation 
and, through tough bargaining, obtain economic benefits that may bring the 
country out of its current poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The other faction, apparently centering on the Korean People's Army, favors 
preserving the country's isolation. This faction's members seem to fear that 
any opening to the West will undermine North Korea's self-reliance, and they 
probably fear that, if Pyongyang comes out of its isolation, the United States 
and its allies will try to undermine, if not overthrow, the current leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, any dramatic reduction in military tensions on the Korean peninsula 
might lead to a drawdown in the size of the North's army and a cutback in the 
huge percentage of North Korean resources that now go to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the (North Korean) army's point of view, it is unclear that they will 
get any of the benefits of this deal with the United States," observed one 
Administration official this week. In this sense, the factional feud is a 
battle for influence and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when the North Korean Foreign Ministry urged the Administration to 
send an official to Pyongyang, North Korean officials suggested to their 
American counterparts that such a mission would help strengthen the hand of the 
civilian, soft-line faction in Pyongyang in dealing with the North Korean 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials say privately that this was at least the third time 
this year that they have seen signs of this factional dispute in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when the Administration decided to dispatch Hubbard to North Korea, 
North Korean officials warned American officials that he might be greeted by 
bellicose rhetoric. That was a sign, again, of the intense divisions in North 
Korea over dealing with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear where Kim Jong Il, North Korea's putative leader, stands in 
the factional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost six months after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung -- the founder 
and longtime president of North Korea -- the younger HKim still has not been 
formally named head of state nor head of North Korea's ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the time being, many Administration officials believe that the mystery 
of who rules North Korea is much less important than the policies the 
government pursues. And the bottom line is that North Korea signed the nuclear 
deal and, after a long delay, released Bobby Hall.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON'S BEST DEFENSE MAY BE HIS WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In April, 1993, then-Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron warned a county 
official -- in writing -- of the risks of doing a complicated parlay in 
Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron was advising the Orange County Sanitation District official of the pros 
and cons of a deal the district had asked him to handle: a reverse-repurchase 
in which the district would put up as collateral some of its government 
securities in order to borrow money for further investing. 
</P>
<P>
 If interest rates happened to rise, Citron warned, the district might have to 
put up millions of dollars to buy back the bond or might have to sell it at a 
loss.  
</P>
<P>
 That was an accurate warning, as far as it went. But Citron then added: "The 
likelihood of this happening is minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, by the end of the year, rates began their steepest rise in a quarter 
of a century, devastating a county investment portfolio filled with 
transactions of the kind whose dangers Citron had carefully laid out for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from Citron's standpoint, the important thing is not the assurances he 
made that rates would stay low, but the warning he gave of what might happen if 
they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 For as prosecutors, regulators, and lawyers begin considering whether the 
management of the Orange County investment pool warrants civil or even criminal 
charges, the outlines of Citron's legal defense are becoming clear: Not only 
did all his investments comply with rules laid down by state legislation, he 
will contend, but in document after document, including annual statements to 
the Orange County Board of Supervisors, he made full disclosure of the risks of 
his investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's warnings of market risk to participants in the pool are certain to 
end up in the center ring of the legal circus that is about to pitch a tent 
over the pool's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-page questionnaire sent by the Securities and Exchange Commission to the 
pool's 187 municipal investors, for example, focuses on what and by whom the 
investors were told about the risk of loss of investment principal, the pool's 
sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and its strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators are also believed to be looking into whether Citron as treasurer 
used the proceeds of county bond issues to make cash distributions to pool 
participants who thought they were receiving interest -- a maneuver to mask a 
cash crisis in the pool that could become the core of a civil case against 
officials involved in arranging the bond issue, Citron included. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, at least 12 civil suits to recover lost money have been filed and 
scores more are sure to materialize, naming the former county treasurer, his 
investment advisers and others as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's management is also being investigated by county, state and federal 
agencies with the power to bring criminal charges, although none have yet been 
brought and no evidence of illicit personal enrichment by Citron has surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that there were no material omissions" of fact in disclosure 
statements made to investors in the county pool or buyers of county bonds 
backed by funds in the pool, said Citron's lawyer, David Wiechert, in an 
interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever inadequacies appear, he added, should be blamed on the information 
Citron received from such professional advisers as Merrill Lynch & Co., the 
investment firm that underwrote a large amount of the riskiest securities he 
purchased for the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob was relying in good faith on professionals," Wiechert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, the municipal finance officers who were placing their 
public funds under Citron's management in the county pool -- many of them 
voluntarily -- should have been sufficiently well-versed in market economics to 
know that the pool's above-market yield came packaged with higher risk.  
</P>
<P>
 "The question that should be asked of the investors is why did they think they 
were getting 200 basis points (2 percentage points) or more higher than they 
would if they invested in 90-day Treasuries?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, lawyers experienced in securities and criminal defense law say that 
Citron faces a long ordeal in fending off prosecutors and plaintiffs' lawyers. 
Orange County's collapse into bankruptcy is so spectacular that the entire 
spectrum of law enforcement agencies is constrained to at least investigate 
Citron's investment management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he's in the middle of a political cyclone, they're under enormous 
political pressure to do something," said Stanley Arkin, a prominent securities 
counsel with offices in New York and Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert agrees that the political environment may represent Citron's biggest 
hazard.  
</P>
<P>
 "Criminal exposure is a possibility because it's not difficult to get an 
indictment," he said. But obtaining a conviction would be much harder because 
it would require "proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Bob Citron intended to 
defraud investors," and no evidence of that has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance of civil charges is greater because the standard of proof is lower 
than in criminal proceedings and the cases might revolve around the murky issue 
of what facts Citron was required to disclose to his investors and which of his 
statements they relied upon when deciding to place their funds in his care. 
Case law is far from clear on how much information public officials must 
disclose when they invest money or borrow it in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Wiechert suggests, Citron in his public statements generally did 
note that his investment strategy carried higher risks than normal for a public 
fund. But documents show he usually counterweighted such statements with 
wishful, if not willful, expressions of market opinion that would turn out to 
be misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 In a September 10, 1993, report to the pool investors, for instance, he wrote 
that the pool's high yield was produced by reverse repurchase agreements and 
"inverse floaters" -- securities designed to produce a higher yield when market 
interest rates remain low or decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "If rates were to rise materially, it is reasonable to expect that the overall 
performance of the portfolio would decline," he wrote. Furthermore, he said he 
had stopped buying inverse floaters over the previous six months precisely to 
hedge against the possibility of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But he then assured his investors: "Interest rates could rise 100 basis points 
(1%) tomorrow, because of some temporary phenomena happening in the world. But 
higher interest rates are not at all sustainable." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, rates rose more than 2 percentage points in the year following 
his prognostication and remained stubbornly high throughout 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he did not stay out of the inverse-floater market for long. 
Beginning in January and February, 1994 -- just before the Federal Reserve 
Board signaled its determination to push rates up with three quarter-point rate 
hikes in three months -- Citron bought hundreds of million of dollars in such 
exotic securities, all of which have since been heavily discounted in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were so complex that they resembled the creation of alchemists. The 
interest payout of a $25-million purchase on Jan. 10, for instance, was based 
on the interrelationship of trading in German marks, Italian lira, Swedish 
krona and British pounds. (It was a bad bet: Between the purchase date and the 
end of 1994, the payout dropped by half, to 2.31% from 4.72%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also overstated to investors his ability to unwind his complicated 
transactions once market conditions rendered them unprofitable.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Orange County treasury currently has over $900 million (in) securities 
reversed against themselves," he told the sanitation district in April, 1993, 
"so we are well versed in monitoring this kind of investment." However, the 
reverse transactions could not be unwound without producing a loss when rates 
headed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet securities and defense lawyers note that Citron may be able to defend his 
own judgment by showing that he had plenty of company among the nation's 
biggest and most sophisticated investors in suffering derivatives-based losses 
in 1994. Such well-known Wall Street names as George Soros and Michael 
Steinhardt suffered enormous losses from leveraged wrong-way bets on interest 
rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He could also plead that the securities he bought were issued by agencies 
sponsored by the federal government -- as such they were safe to the extent 
that their risk of default was almost nil, although the way Citron invested 
magnified their exposure to adverse changes in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron may also contend that he was simply not responsible for the investment 
fund's estimated $2.02-billion loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some analysts say the paper losses were becoming so great that a cash 
crunch would eventually have forced Citron to sell some holdings at a loss, 
"the question is to what extent does he avoid exposure, because the damages 
were really created by the precipitate selloff (by his successors) and not 
holding to maturity," said one Washington-based securities lawyer who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that Citron might successfully deflect civil liability onto other 
defendants, such as his professional advisers -- investment firms that have 
much deeper pockets for plaintiffs to mine. As Arkin put it, "Going after 
Merrill Lynch is going to be one of the great games in town." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Citron's Disclosures 
</P>
<P>
 Former Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron maintains that he made 
adequate disclosures about the nature and risks of his strategy in managing the 
county's now bankrupt investment pool. The following are examples of what he 
said--and what actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 * From an Apr. 12, 1993, letter to the Orange County Sanitation Districts 
(which wanted to purchase $50 million in reverse repurchase agreements): 
</P>
<P>
 (text of graphic:) The negative side of this transaction is that if interest 
rates rise, it is possible not to have a "positive carry." Where the bid or the 
interest rate paid for borrowing the money would be more than the coupon on the 
treasury note. In this event the District would need to come up with $50 
million to buy outright these securities, or what would likely happen is to 
sell them at a price that is lower than originally paid for the securities. A 
principal loss would occur. The likelihood of this happening is minimal; 
particularly if the investment is closely monitored. If interest rates start 
rising the security could be sold and/or swapped for a like security with a 
higher coupon. The Orange County Treasury currently has over $900 million 
securities reversed against themselves, so we are well versed in monitoring 
this type of investment. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT HAPPENED 
</P>
<P>
 What Citron termed an unlikely scenario is exactly what occurred. Rising rates 
reduced the value of the collateral he put up for loans in the county's 
investment portfolio, eventually forcing the county to take losses and spurring 
its bankruptcy filing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a Sept. 10, 1993, annual report to the county Board of Supervisors: 
</P>
<P>
 (text of graphic:) If rates were to rise materially, it is reasonable to 
expect that the overall performance of the portfolio would decline. Athough we 
strongly believe that future interest rates will remain low, to insure against 
the eventuality of materially rising interest rates, for the last six months we 
have not been buying structured/floating interest rate instruments but have 
been purchasing fixed interest rate coupon instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT HAPPENED 
</P>
<P>
 Rates would not remain low indefinitely. In fact, they began rising two months 
later. Moreover, Citron again started buying structured notes in January, 1994, 
as the rise picked up steam.

FINANCIAL FIASCO BRUISES MONTEBELLO'S UPBEAT SPIRIT; DEBT: STUNG IN ORANGE 
COUNTY DEBACLE, CITY WORKS OUT EMERGENCY PLAN. IT HAS WEATHERED MONEY TROUBLE 
BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Orange County's bankruptcy is a financial train wreck, then modest 
Montebello -- for years a suburban steppingstone into the middle class of 
Southern California -- is one of the most badly injured passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 The ethnically mixed community of 60,000, which some locals call the "Beverly 
Hills of East Los Angeles," now is struggling to sidestep its own fiscal 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, anxious officials won the go-ahead from seven lenders for an 
emergency plan, engineered in hundreds of hours of discussions, that gives the 
city more time to make a $25.6-million loan payment that was due today. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has averted default for now, the aftereffects of Montebello's 
misadventure in high finance will linger for years, from the tonier hillside 
neighborhoods in the north of town to the hardscrabble industrial landscape 
near the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax hikes and service cuts are long-term possibilities. Meanwhile, more debt 
payments will be coming due. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really going to be difficult," said Kathy Salazar, a longtime resident 
who served on the City Council from 1987 to 1991. Still, said Salazar in the 
spirit of a town that has endured other financial ups and downs in recent 
years, "We will survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, whose name means "beautiful mountain" in Italian, conforms to few 
stereotypes of the Los Angeles area.  
</P>
<P>
 Its main boulevards are lined with unpretentious businesses such as Stevenson 
Hardware (72 years old) and Sid's Camera Shop (48), rather than chichi 
boutiques or trend-setting restaurants. (To be fair, some style-conscious 
clothing shops have popped up of late, with names like Cool Jerk and Green 
Envy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the local flavor is, well, local. "There are a lot of old family 
businesses in town," observes Gene Neer, board chairman of the Chamber of 
Commerce. "Whoever started them, their son or daughter is running them now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask folks about Montebello's high points and they may mention the Town Center 
mall, which opened in 1985 on the north border with Rosemead, or a new complex 
of 10 AMC movie theaters, bringing movies back to the city for the first time 
in 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The down-at-the-heels Taylor Ranch community center remains a hub of cultural 
activity, even though citizens have been known to share the space with a family 
of squirrels. "People say the only reason it's still standing is because all 
the termites are holding hands," Salazar jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Montebello is neither all humble nor all provincial. City officials have 
dished out millions of dollars on public safety and education, at one time 
bankrolling their schools so generously that they offered the highest teacher 
salaries in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello is a "firmly grounded, middle-class, conservative community," 
maintains City Administrator Richard Torres, 39. "We have two or three 
generations of many families living here. My parents still live here, I live 
here and my children are going to the same elementary school that I attended." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all its middle-class normalcy, embarrassing financial crises have been 
the source of media attention for Montebello since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 First came a bond fiasco in 1984, which has some superficial parallels to the 
current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The city invested in something called "stripped U.S. Treasury bonds" that 
proved startlingly volatile and ultimately cost the public $4.4 million. Local 
government was temporarily paralyzed as 16% of its budget went down the drain. 
Ultimately, Treasurer Thomas C. Wong was defeated for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the early 1990s, the Montebello Unified School District suffered a 
harrowing brush with bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district had supported a range of top-notch services, from librarians and 
registered nurses to programs in bilingual education and nutrition that became 
increasingly unaffordable as the economy dipped. It took $9 million in spending 
cuts and a public bond issue to dodge that bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's controversy has its roots in investments dating back to September, 
1991, when Montebello first plunked down $7.8 million in Orange County's 
high-flying investment fund. City officials kept adding more and more, until 
the stake soared to $47 million -- the most deposited by any community outside 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 All the money was borrowed in what now appears a risky game of chance, betting 
that the fund would pay more interest than the city was paying on its loans. 
But city leaders were pleased with the strong returns and incorporated the 
investment income into their budget plans.  
</P>
<P>
 And then the bottom fell out of Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron's 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others tangled up in the county's bankruptcy, Montebello officials are 
quick to point out that professional advisers described the fund as safe. And 
the officials get very touchy if one tries to find some underlying element 
linking the three recent bouts of financial woe. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not emphasize some of the positive things going on in Montebello, they 
ask, such as its expanded police force and Fire Department? "There's a lot of 
good things happening here, but we don't get noticed until we have financial 
problems," complains Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Montebello has been a beacon for blue-collar households striving to 
scale the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 The city long has been home to an Armenian immigrant community and has drawn 
upwardly mobile workers from neighboring unincorporated territory. Many of the 
less well-heeled are clustered in the working-class neighborhoods south of 
Whittier Boulevard, while the more affluent tend to live in newer communities 
in the northern half of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing consultant Larry Salazar, originally from neighboring unincorporated 
territory, explains his move to Montebello in down-to-earth terms: "It was just 
that I was finally able to afford a house, and I didn't want to go too far away 
from my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents such as Shirley Stearns, who has lived in the city for 46 
years, have watched Montebello transform from "a sleepy little town" of avocado 
and orange groves, run by a governing elite, into a busy, ethnically varied 
city where people have few compunctions about speaking their minds on public 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the current fiscal mess, Stearns isn't losing sleep: "Montebello has 
been in financial binds before; I'm sure they're going to come out of it all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems are not likely to vanish soon. Even with the emergency rescue 
plan, Montebello faces deadlines for payments of at least $11.5 million in June 
and another $6 million in September that are unrelated to the $25.6 million due 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, officials say they can pay the city's bills through next year. But 
what happens in 1996 and beyond is anyone's guess. The city will explore the 
possibility of selling some of its assets -- primarily small, scattered parcels 
of land. In addition, service cuts or tax hikes will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, administrator Torres characterizes the city more as a victim 
than a participant in the financial debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think of us as passengers on a bus," he said. "We made the decision 
to get on the bus, but none of us knew the driver -- in this case (Robert L.) 
Citron -- was reckless. We ran an intersection, and Wall Street crushed us."

CITIES, FIRMS TO PAY $63 MILLION TO CLEAN UP LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a landmark agreement that advances efforts to clean up one of the nation's 
worst hazardous waste dumps, 14 Los Angeles County cities and a host of waste 
haulers and other public agencies agreed Thursday to pay more than $63 million 
to clean up the landfill in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the 
U.S. Department of Justice, brings to more than $268 million the amount of 
money dedicated to the cleanup of the Operating Industries toxic waste site 
after nearly a decade of litigation over who is responsible for the 190-acre 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement filed Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles, the 
cities, Los Angeles County and Caltrans, which used the landfill to dump tons 
of municipal trash, would be freed from any future liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes this a big deal is that it resolves the liability of the municipal 
contributors, and leaves us to focus on what the remaining remedy is for the 
site," said Katherine Shine, assistant regional counsel for the EPA, which is 
directing the cleanup of the closed landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump was added to the national Superfund priority list of toxic sites in 
1986. "This site is basically a 300-foot-tall, 190-acre mountain of every kind 
of disposable item in the world," Shine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed consent decree resolves a 1989 lawsuit filed by more than 100 
companies and public entities, including Mobil, Exxon and General Motors. Those 
corporations have given the EPA $205 million to clean up the dump and sued the 
cities, county, state Department of Transportation and 18 waste-hauling firms 
to force them to share the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the 14 cities and the county tentatively agreed to pay $32 million 
to those companies, but the final settlement goes further. Instead of 
reimbursing the companies that sued them, the municipalities now must give the 
money to the EPA directly for cleanup of the site, Shine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also joined the settlement since March by agreeing to pay $14.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that the money from this lawsuit is cleaning up the site, 
instead of going to Fortune 500 companies," Shine said. "This is really good 
news. It is really a good thing for the companies, the cities and the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the primarily small San Gabriel Valley cities were unavailable 
for comment. But when the tentative agreement was reached earlier this year, 
attorney Timothy Gallagher, who represented the cities, said they were 
"ecstatic" because the potential liability could have been much higher. The 
corporations originally sought $312 million in their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities and county had no choice but to settle the case after a federal 
judge ruled last year that they could be found liable under environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is debating various cleanup options for the site and investigating the 
scope of ground water pollution under the mound of toxic trash. The cost of the 
project depends largely on the extent of subterranean contamination. 
Large-scale cleanups often exceed $300 million, and EPA officials have said the 
work at Operating Industries could cost $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 170 companies dumped industrial waste at the Monterey Park landfill, 
which operated from 1948 through 1984. About 22 to 31 million tons of solid 
waste as well as more than 300 million gallons of liquid waste were dumped 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities that signed the settlement were Alhambra, Monterey Park, 
Montebello, South Gate, Compton, Lynwood, San Gabriel, Rosemead, Temple City, 
Bell, Maywood, City of Commerce, South Pasadena and Cudahy. Each city council 
endorsed the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the $14.8 million from Caltrans, the city of Alhambra is paying the 
largest amount, $8.5 million, followed by Montebello at $4.8 million and 
Monterey Park at $4.6 million. Los Angeles County and two sanitation districts 
agreed to pay about $62,000, while several private waste haulers will pay a 
total of $10 million. Six sanitation districts also agreed on payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although three other lawsuits over the Operating Industries site have been 
resolved, Shine said that some cases are pending against other parties that 
used the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution of the dispute among the hundreds of corporations and public 
entities that used the landfill was negotiated by the EPA and the Justice 
Department, which became involved at the request of the private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "By entering into this settlement, U.S. EPA turned a contentious lawsuit 
between the industrial waste generators and the cities into a win-win 
situation," said John Wise, deputy regional administrator for EPA's western 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 A site is placed on the Superfund list when the EPA determines that it poses a 
substantial long-term threat to public health or the environment, usually 
through contamination of ground water, soil or air. Many sites linger on the 
list for more than a decade while the EPA struggles with litigation and 
technical problems over cleanup.

RUSSIA BOMBS CHECHEN OIL PLANT; DUDAYEV SEEKS TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Russian bombers hit a giant petroleum complex in Chechnya on Thursday, 
striking at the oil industry that is this breakaway republic's economic 
lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Russian warplanes and troops using laser-guided missiles intensified 
their attacks on the besieged city, Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev 
reportedly told the Kremlin that he is ready for peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was unclear whether Dudayev was making another of the empty offers that 
Moscow and Grozny have repeatedly exchanged since Russia sent troops to crush 
Chechnya's 3-year-old campaign for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen officials said Dudayev sent a telegram to Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, saying he is willing to negotiate at any level with no 
preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
 After representatives in Chernomyrdin's office said they had not received the 
telegram, Dudayev reportedly sent a similar one to President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chechen capital of Grozny, a great black cloud loomed in the bright 
blue sky from the explosion at the oil refinery complex in the Karpinsky Kurgan 
district, on the southwestern outskirts of the city. Heavy bombing and shelling 
made it impossible to get close enough to the refinery to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, however, flames could be seen shooting out of the refinery, and there 
were unconfirmed reports that a bomb had landed on an oil tank. Russian Human 
Rights Commissioner Sergei A. Kovalev reported from Grozny that the blaze 
threatened to spread to nearby tanks of chlorine, ammonia and hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 The information war continued Thursday as Chechen authorities claimed that 
they had shot down three Russian aircraft, and Russians insisted that no planes 
had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian military officials said they had begun using laser-guided missiles to 
attack pro-Dudayev forces that brought tanks and heavy artillery out from the 
city center to confront the Russians. A Russian Defense Ministry official 
assured the Interfax news agency that these "smart bombs" would cause 
"virtually no civilian casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a morning of ominous quiet, Russian warplanes roared repeatedly over the 
city. The thunder of their bombs reverberated against the largely deserted 
presidential palace, sending even hard-core Chechen guards scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev was reported to be pinned inside a bomb shelter under the palace, and 
aides told reporters by telephone that they could not get out. Still, in the 
face of the overwhelmingly superior Russian force, the Chechen commandos 
remained defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the Russians bomb us all they want, they can't kill all of us," said 
Imran Abzuyev, commander of a Chechen unit. "We have no way back, we'll stand 
to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Abzuyev was patrolling the central open-air market in Grozny to enforce a new 
ban on once lively weapons sales there. Chechens were allowed only to exchange 
their arms for others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban appeared aimed at preventing Chechen deserters from selling their 
weapons and running off with the money -- a crack in the usual facade of united 
anti-Russian defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Grozny too, 10 days of Russian bombing was taking its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 With the water system knocked out, residents lined up at street-side pumps 
with buckets that they had to lug back to their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines for bread spilled into the street. With most women and children 
evacuated, the majority of residents left in town appeared to be elderly 
Russians with nowhere else to go. Their slow, stoic progress through Grozny's 
streets to line up for water or bread never wavered, even as bombs landed 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I built the whole city," said Nikolai Yefremov, a 68-year-old construction 
engineer who remained in his fourth-floor apartment in central Grozny while his 
family was sheltered in the basement. "Now, before my eyes, it's all being 
destroyed, and my tears flow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the snowy courtyard of his building, where pigeons and dogs picked at 
spilled garbage, history professor Mikhail Parkhomenko was returning with two 
full buckets from the water pump at a nearby stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The refinery bombing had scared him badly, he said, because the smoke 
resembled the mushroom cloud of a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 But all in all, his mood was not bad. When the bombing gets bad, he said, he 
and his ethnic Chechen friends sit in the basement and talk about life in 
general and women in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone we talk to says they are for a peaceful political resolution of the 
problem," said Parkhomenko, a bright-eyed man in a black fedora. 
</P>
<P>
 Others met the bombing with less equanimity.  
</P>
<P>
 Magomed Khashiyu, a gold-toothed man of 55, declaimed in full voice at the 
central market that "Yeltsin is not a man, he's a prostitute." 
</P>
<P>
 Khashiyu was referring to Yeltsin's promise Tuesday that Russia would stop 
hitting civilian targets in Chechnya -- a vow that was followed by two days of 
relentless bombing of central Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen soldiers did say, however, that most of the Russian bombing was aimed 
at concentrations of Chechen fighters in what resembled a semi-civilized "war 
of position" of the 19th Century more than the internecine conflicts of the 
20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we are bombing, but only a group of armed militants," Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel S. Grachev told reporters at the Russian base in Mozdok, 
Northern Ossetia. "I will fire a thousand shots to their one shot, a thousand 
shells to one shell of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians had left open the road southeast from Grozny to Dagestan to 
accommodate refugee traffic and to encourage less-than-enthusiastic Chechen 
youth to leave rather than fight. Russian officials said flyers had been 
dropped over Grozny promising safe passage out of the city for anyone holding a 
leaflet, but they insisted that Chechen fighters are not allowing anyone with a 
weapon to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia has bombed Chechen targets, it has also announced aid packages to 
help with the human cost of the war -- as though providing bandages for wounds 
it has inflicted.  
</P>
<P>
 Kovalev, the human rights commissioner who has remained in Grozny to protest 
the Russian attack, begged for antibiotics to prevent the many wounded from 
developing gangrene or peritonitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Humanitarian organizations began asking for canned food, warm clothing, money 
and medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatiana Regent, head of the Federal Migration Service, said 37,000 officially 
registered refugees are now scattered across Dagestan, Ingushetia and in 
outlying regions of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 She said more than 105,000 people have fled Chechnya in the last two weeks. 
Many are being sheltered by relatives or friends, but 2,000 to 2,500 new 
refugees have been appealing to Russian officials for help every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency estimates that 200,000 ethnic Russians have also fled Chechnya in 
the three years since it declared a unilateral independence from Russia that 
has never been recognized by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 These people, propelled from their homes by growing anti-Russian sentiment, 
will probably never go back and will require resettlement, Regent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has requested U.N. refugee assistance for the thousands who have fled 
the fighting, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Thursday. He 
said he has asked the U.N. refugee agency to field a mission in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 As the war entered its 19th day, Russian officials also began to count the 
financial toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the intervention wondered where the cash-strapped government would 
get the money to rebuild Chechnya without triggering a catastrophic rise in 
inflation, now running about 15% per month. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee service said $9.8 million in additional funding will be needed in 
the next four weeks alone. The Railways Ministry said restoring the republic's 
blown-up and much-robbed railroad will require $30 million. The Finance 
Ministry calculated defense expenditures at $987 million in 1995 if hostilities 
continue at the current level. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Economics Ministry presented a $203-million list of repairs 
needed to restore Chechnya's oil industry -- and that was before the bombing of 
the refinery complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In Soviet times, Chechnya each year refined up to 18 million tons of Caspian 
basin oil pumped in by pipeline from Azerbaijan, but almost nothing was 
produced in 1994 because of a Russian economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 The republic's own oil reserves are estimated at 50 million tons, considered 
modest by Russian standards. 
</P>

 DEJA VU: Polly Ward has seen it all before. Four years ago, developer Ira 
Smedra overcame neighborhood opposition to replace the landmark Studio City Car 
Wash with a shopping mall, and now he will do the same with legendary Chasen's, 
the famous West Hollywood restaurant (A1). . . . "I feel very sorry for that 
community," says Ward, vice president of the Studio City Residents Assn. "I 
know what they are going through."

 NEW LAWS: You can raise a potbellied pig in Lancaster, but don't set any 
coyote traps in Los Angeles. From the practical to the peculiar, new laws for 
the new year in the San Fernando and neighboring valleys would confuse even 
Judge Wapner. . . . We can thank Mother Nature for parts of the list. Many of 
the new laws, on issues from emergency lighting to gas shut-off valves, were 
inspired by damage caused by the Northridge earthquake. New local laws are 
listed on B10.

 FUTURE SCHLOCK: Could 1995 be worse for the Valley than 1994? This week's 
Valley Life! gazes into the future with Angela, the psychic adviser, above, and 
other mystical methods. . . . But Chaytor Mason, USC psychology professor 
emeritus, says soothsayers are more soothing than psychic: "If they're really 
able to see the future, why aren't they playing the stock market?" 
</P>
<P>
 SUBURBAN SOUND: They don't sound like the stereotypical Valley girls. But the 
band known as Scarlett is just a "bunch of suburban California white chicks," 
says keyboardist-singer Susie Davis. . . . Four of the five band members are 
women, and they are stunning audiences in the Valley by playing the soul music 
dominated by males. See Valley Life! Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 MALL FALL: Burbank police are investigating why a North Hollywood woman fell 
two stories at the Media City Center. . . . Nelly Carson, 42, suffered a 
fractured pelvis Thursday after she apparently lost her grip on the handrail of 
a moving escalator, police said (B2).

PARENTS RECRUITING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION; SCHOOLS: VALLEY COUPLE LEADS DRIVE 
AWAY FROM PRIVATE CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Down the hill from her Tarzana home, Kande Grabiner sees a gold mine. A small 
neighborhood school offering a full academic and enrichment program to students 
who don't need interviews or connections for admission. And it's free. 
</P>
<P>
 To Grabiner, all Wilbur Avenue Elementary needs is a few more committed 
parents like herself who are willing to give public schools a chance. In the 
past few months, Grabiner and her husband, Len, have turned their living room 
into a recruitment office, trying over coffee and dessert to persuade friends 
and neighbors to shun pricey private schools in favor of their neighborhood 
school down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In launching their Wilbur School drive, the Grabiners join a group of parents 
and principals throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District and a growing 
effort by parent groups nationwide who are trying to recruit families back to 
public education with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents are fearful that their children won't get a quality 
education at the public school, but that's just not true," said Kande Grabiner. 
"I also had incorrect information. I thought my daughter would get a far better 
education in private school, but I don't believe that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles educators are unable to put a number behind such recruitment 
efforts in the district. However, Deputy Supt. Dan Isaacs said, "Heck yes, this 
is happening all over the district, especially in schools where the leadership 
has a vision for (recruitment efforts) to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabiner's efforts and others' mirror those of parent recruiters for public 
education throughout the country. A nonprofit organization called Parents for 
Public Schools began three years ago in Jackson, Miss., to combat the 
middle-class -- and mostly white -- flight from the public schools. The 
nonprofit group includes 35 chapters and about 10,000 members in a dozen 
states, including Arkansas, Texas and Colorado. There is not yet a chapter in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is recruitment of middle-class parents, many of whom left (public 
schools) as a result of desegregation," said Kelly Butler, the group's interim 
executive director. "We are of the firm belief that public schools are the best 
place for our children to learn to live and work in a pluralistic society. Many 
people are sending their children to private and parochial schools without even 
considering the public school as an option." 
</P>
<P>
 Just six months ago, public schools weren't an option to the Grabiners, who 
worried about low test scores, crowded classes and how their child's education 
would be affected by the many Spanish-speaking students at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Kande Grabiner heard other parents talking about competitive 
kindergarten interviews, applications and tuition at private schools, she 
realized they needed another option. "I felt like it was all about class and 
money -- who can afford the so-called best schools," Grabiner said. "It didn't 
feel right." 
</P>
<P>
 So she took a tour of Wilbur, a small campus of just 400 students, two fairly 
active parent groups, an after-school program and even a computer lab. Wilbur 
has 64% white students, 18% Latino students and 12% African American students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grabiners find themselves in an uphill battle, however, trying to unravel 
a tangle of misperceptions and honest concerns about racial issues, class, 
poverty and crime that have prompted thousands of parents to leave public 
schools over the last two decades. Principals and parents in various parts of 
the sprawling district -- including Westchester, East and West Los Angeles and 
the west San Fernando Valley -- say they face similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grabiners have so far received a commitment from four other families. They 
are trying to work on about 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Abbott, a parent who attended a recent meeting at the Grabiners, was 
persuaded to enroll his son at Wilbur. "Meetings like this have opened our eyes 
to an alternative to spending $8,000 to $10,000 a year," Abbott said. "Maybe 
the public school system is getting an unfair shake. At age 5, I think you can 
take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Domine is not so sure. Domine, who attended Los Angeles Unified 
schools and whose mother taught in the system for 30 years, said he is worried 
about crowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I personally would prefer public schools," Domine said. "My problem is 
with the numbers. Thirty kids to one teacher, I think, is a tough learning 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since thousands of families fled the system during the busing era of the 
late 1970s, school officials say they have battled a tarnished public image. "I 
think there's a gap between what our schools are offering and what some parents 
believe we're offering," Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while desegregation sparked "white flight" 20 years ago, parents now say 
their disinterest in public education stems more from their perceptions of the 
schools. They worry about overcrowded -- and hot -- classrooms, outdated 
textbooks, few enrichment courses and a bureaucratic school system that is 
removed from the teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified faces all the problems of a large, urban school system, 
struggling to provide an education to a population of increasingly poor, 
immigrant children. Of the district's 636,400 students, 66% are Latino, 14.4% 
are African American and 12% are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Class sizes are among the highest in the nation, test scores typically dip 
below state and national averages and labor strife occurs almost annually. 
</P>
<P>
 For some parents, the school district doesn't offer the same nurturing 
environment they have seen in private schools. Nancy Kaczenski, a parent who 
attended the Grabiners' meeting, said she is turned off by the instability of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Unified is always on the brink of bankruptcy," said Kaczenski, who has 
not yet decided whether she will pull her child out of private school. "It has 
a terrible reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades High School Principal Merle Price, who recently held a special 
meeting with parents and their children who attend private schools, agrees that 
families lack confidence in the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Price, who has opened the doors of his campus to private school parents 
and students, launched a successful recruitment drive this year, enrolling 100 
new students. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see the climate of the school and the level of the educational 
program, that diffuses the rumors and misconceptions," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a new state law allowing parents to choose campuses, principals 
say they now are finding more private school families willing to consider 
public education. Under the open-enrollment policy, about 500 students 
districtwide left private schools for Los Angeles Unified campuses this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But often, when parents choose public schools, educators say they sometimes 
try to create a separate -- and unequal -- education for their children. Amy 
Stewart Wells, an assistant professor of education at UCLA, said some schools 
in more affluent areas are experiencing "second-generation desegregation" in 
which parents find ways to put their children into separate tracks -- honors 
classes, for example -- in which they create homogenous and segregated groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always talk about parent involvement as inherently good," Wells said. "But 
if they (parents) are resegregating schools, it could be educationally 
detrimental to the other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you buy into the concept of the neighborhood public school with 
diverse students and varying socioeconomic levels, you have to be aware of the 
kind of power you bring to it," Wells said. "I think parents need to look 
carefully at the whole school and the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
 That point is not lost on the Wilbur group, who all are parents of preschool 
children. At a recent meeting in the Grabiners' home, parents talked about 
paying for an aide in the kindergarten class to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden we change a kindergarten class; next year, we change a 
first-grade class and in three to four years, you have a metamorphosis," said 
Len Grabiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur Principal Richard Hickcox, who said he welcomes the Grabiners' 
recruitment efforts, said the entire school would benefit from more involved 
parents with time and money to donate. Hickcox said parents would be allowed to 
donate money for specific purposes, including an aide for one class.  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents hear bad things about the school district and then people apply that 
to their local neighborhood school and bad things really are not happening at 
the school," Hickcox said. "That's a problem of the reputation of the school 
district that, I think, we have to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent leaders at Wilbur say they applaud the Grabiners' efforts and believe 
any donations would be welcomed by the entire school. "You do it for all the 
kids," Karen Schreiber, the PTA co-president, told parents assembled in the 
Grabiners' living room the other night. "You're there, obviously, for your own 
child, but you are helping all the children. It's very worthwhile."

 STATE VISIT: The state community college board usually meets in Sacramento. 
But next month, the panel is expected to accept an invitation to hold its 
September meeting at Ventura College. . . . "We're not inviting them down so we 
can wine and dine and lobby and get more money out of them," insists Timothy D. 
Hirschberg, president of the local community college board. "We just want to 
show the state leaders what we're doing so that (our) district isn't just a 
name among a list of others." 
</P>
<P>
 RADIO DAYS: Cal Lutheran University's public radio station, on the air since 
October, is gearing up to go after the big-name guests. . . . Among the first: 
singer Peggy Lee, who will star on the 'Ventura Talk" radio show at 6 p.m. 
Monday. . . . Although the Thousand Oaks station doesn't measure ratings 
scientifically, it's been "getting lots of positive phone calls" from listeners 
who previously couldn't pick up public radio signals, Program Director Mike 
West said. . . . The apparent rise in popularity could help the station snag 
future guests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 PIER REOPENS: The Ventura Pier -- closed temporarily to repair damage from a 
recent ocean pummeling -- has reopened (B1). . . . But keep your fingers 
crossed. The 122-year-old pier may have to weather more abuse before the winter 
is over. January will bring normal temperatures and rainfall to the county, but 
the months after that could be colder and wetter than usual, said meteorologist 
Dean Jones of WeatherData Inc. "A continuous pattern of storm after storm" 
could increase vulnerability to oceanfront structures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE MOTORING: Thousand Oaks' newest device to catch speeding motorists is 
being put to use just in time for the year-end crackdown against unsafe drivers 
(B4). . . .. In Simi Valley, officers are stepping up patrols in an effort to 
keep the year's drunk-driving arrests lower than in 1993, when intoxicated 
drivers caused 74 of the city's 995 traffic accidents.

 After weeks of holding up welfare reform as a prime area for bipartisan 
compromise, the Clinton Administration launched a frontal attack Thursday on 
the leading GOP proposal, calling it a "cruel hoax" that would eventually knock 
5 million children off the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said at a press conference 
that the GOP plan would dump millions of poor children abruptly into the hands 
of states, cities and charities unequipped to deal with them, causing extensive 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The "human consequences would fall on children, and (the) financial 
consequences would fall on state taxpayers and private charities," a 
battle-ready Shalala told reporters. "The solution to the welfare crisis is not 
to send children to orphanages -- it's to send their parents to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans shot back in a statement put out by the House Republican 
Conference, calling Shalala's statements a "hysterical assault" that has to 
"make many people wonder whether the Clinton Administration is serious about 
reforming the broken system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shalala onslaught was timed to coincide with a scheduled television 
appearance by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), introducing the 
1938 Mickey Rooney classic "Boys Town" on TNT as his favorite movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Gingrich suggested that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
watch the movie instead of criticizing his advocacy of orphanages in those 
cases in which parents cannot take care of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 While both the Administration and congressional Republicans are committed to 
reforming the welfare system, they have strikingly different visions of what 
the new safety net for families with children should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican proposal would deny some benefits to children born to unwed 
mothers, children whose paternity has not been established and children whose 
mothers fail to get jobs after two or five years on the rolls -- depending on 
which time limit states select. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan, which was introduced into Congress during the last 
session, offered a balance of carrots and sticks, including making the 
government an employer of last resort for welfare recipients who reached the 
two-year limit for cash benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has scheduled a bipartisan summit on welfare reform for mid-January to 
try to reach consensus with Republican governors and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But this first major skirmish between the Administration and congressional 
Republicans on welfare reform stripped away the very thin veneer of cooperation 
on the issue. The debate over the issue seems sure to escalate into a 
full-scale war once Congress convenes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's first strike, which was Shalala's idea but approved by 
the White House, showed the Administration digging in to defend some key 
elements of its approach to welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration is expected to lose a lot of ground to Republicans 
on some parts of welfare reform, Shalala's statements reflected the White 
House's determination to shine a spotlight on the possible negative 
consequences of the GOP plan in an attempt to preserve protections for 
children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new HHS analysis determined that if the GOP plan were currently in place, 5 
million children whose families are receiving Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children -- the main cash welfare program for families -- would be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans countered that the provisions of the Personal 
Responsibility Act, the welfare reform legislation attached to their "contract 
with America," would not immediately affect those on AFDC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one child currently receiving AFDC today will have his or her benefits 
cut off upon enactment of the GOP bill," said Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they could run up against a time limit in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehner stressed that mothers who would eventually be denied benefits would be 
eligible for food stamps, Medicaid and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary Shalala would have everyone believe that the GOP solution to 
welfare reform is to place children in group homes," Boehner said, adding that 
"this is a total mischaracterization" of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the department's analysis, the Republicans would leave the states 
without adequate funding to care for the children who would be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 While at least half of the 10 million children now receiving AFDC would be 
dropped, only $293 million would be returned to the states for orphanages or 
foster care, which could finance 8,029 places in orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, 1 million of the 1.8 million children on the rolls would be 
excluded, but only $64 million would be made available to care for the 
children, which would pay for 1,758 children in orphanages, according to the 
Administration's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration relied on the Child Welfare League's estimate that the 
average group home costs $36,500 per child per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the Administration's analysis echo an earlier report on the GOP 
plan by the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Other welfare experts agreed with Republicans that those estimates were 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have exaggerated the numbers so much that they've undermined their 
case," said Doug Besharov, a welfare specialist at the conservative Enterprise 
Institute. "If you're going to attack the idea (of orphanages), you want to be 
very careful about your numbers. They've created a static analysis. They assume 
no change in behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, however, defended their analysis, saying they used 
the least onerous version of the Republican welfare plan.  
</P>
<P>
 An Agriculture Department analysis of the GOP plan to combine the food stamp 
and other nutrition programs into one bulk grant to states would force 6 
million low-income Americans from the food stamp rolls in 1996 and cut $30 
billion from federal nutrition programs by the year 2000.

AGENCIES URGE COURT TO LET THEM SUE O.C.

 As Orange County disposed of $634 million of its riskiest holdings Thursday, 
disgruntled public agencies took their boldest steps yet toward parting ways 
with the county's recovery plan, going to Bankruptcy Court to demand the return 
of property taxes frozen in the fiscal debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest sale yet of its most troublesome investments, the county resold 
$634 million in so-called derivatives to their original issuer, the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. The price paid -- about 91 cents on the dollar -- 
appeared to delight county officials, who said it was more than the complex 
securities would have brought in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Yorba Linda and Santiago County water districts asked the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court to lift its ban on all legal actions against the county. That 
would allow the districts to sue the county in state court for return of about 
$100,000 in property taxes collected on behalf of each district before the 
county's Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight part-time county employees were fired in the first step of what is 
expected to be a drastic reduction of the county's 18,000-member work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is important," said Ernie Schneider, the county's top administrator, 
who laid off the five staff members and three interns from his own office. "But 
. . . we have to cut costs where we can. And the first cuts are the extra help 
and temporary people. That is the first cut we make. It is a very difficult 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * The cash-poor county fell into technical default when it chose to suspend 
payments on $169 million of bonds sold in June, a move signaling the county's 
deteriorating financial position. County leaders, worried about their cash 
flow, say they will not set aside $53.4 million in regularly scheduled 
principal payments due on the notes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county informed a dozen cities that $2 million in promised park grants 
will be indefinitely postponed because of the bankruptcy filing. The move 
jeopardized park projects from Yorba Linda to Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Board of Supervisors turned over box loads of documents subpoenaed by 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators. Among the items 
subpoenaed were the supervisors' calendars, diaries and personal bank 
statements. The SEC has launched a broad investigation into the relationship 
between supervisors and brokers who did business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan approved a request by Orange County 
and Bank of America to sell $277 million in securities that lawyers and county 
officials said will pay some of the county's debt to the bank and provide the 
county with $4 million to $5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county's bankruptcy attorney approved Supervisor William G. Steiner's 
request to release an additional $921,048 to nonprofit organizations for 
services -- such as mental health care for cancer patients and shelter for the 
homeless -- provided before the county filed for bankruptcy. The latest round 
of payments brings the amount paid to nonprofit contractors to nearly $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a major bond ratings agency decided not to downgrade the investment 
pools of Solano and Monterey counties, whose holdings had come under scrutiny 
in the wake of Orange County's massive bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's concluded that "no rating action is warranted at this time," 
even though the two counties have pursued an aggressive investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal challenge by the two water districts could lead the way for other 
special districts, school districts and cities to sue for their share of 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the districts) are saying is: Property taxes and special assessments 
that were collected by the county on their behalf never became the property of 
the county," said Ronald Rus, a lawyer for the two water districts. "Those 
monies . . . should be turned over." 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, the Huntington Beach City Council voted to sue Orange County if 
an agreement for releasing tax revenue is not reached by Jan. 6. Costa Mesa 
officials have said they may do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it this way," Rus said. "There are a number of municipalities and special 
districts who are similarly poised, but are waiting to see if the county can 
solve this problem in the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 The county layoffs, meanwhile, follow an announcement last week by top 
managers that the county would need $40.2 million in cutbacks and savings in 
the wake of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. County leaders 
have since revised that estimate, saying the budget deficit could be triple 
that amount in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight people laid off Thursday were part-time workers, earning $9 to $17 
per hour. The person with the longest tenure had been in Schneider's office for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee union leaders said the county had unfairly targeted workers with the 
least protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody in management screws up, instead of starting at the bottom they 
ought to start at the top and work their way down," said Bill Fogarty, 
executive secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Central Labor Council, 
AFL-CIO. "Laying off extra help is not taking responsibility for it, it's 
blaming the workers who had nothing to do with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Another measure of the county's financial adversity was its announcement that 
it would not set aside $53.4 million in principal payments due this June on 
bonds, known as tax and revenue anticipation notes. The Board of Supervisors 
said it would omit December and January payments that were to be set aside 
until June, when the county is required to pay off the $169 million of bonds 
sold last June to meet its annual operating needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The uncertainty we face with regard to the current financial crisis makes it 
impossible to commit funds for all but essential short-term operating needs," 
said Gaddi H. Vasquez, chairman of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A technical default is a warning to bond holders that the county is not 
setting aside funds to pay off the bonds when they are due. A true default 
occurs when the county misses a payment. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a more positive move, officials elected to make interest payments due 
in just four days on $815 million of other county bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some good news today and some bad news for the county's bondholders," 
said Jane Eddy, a director with Standard & Poor's. "But the most profound 
signal and most promising sign to us is that they are making the January 
interest payments."  
</P>
<P>
 While the Board of Supervisors voted to make good on $3.9 million in interest 
payments due Jan. 3, the payments must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. And 
rating officials said time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear to us whether the wheels of the Bankruptcy Court will turn 
fast enough to make the payments on Jan. 3," said Barbara Flickinger, an 
assistant director with Moody's Investors Service, another bond rating agency. 
"It's cutting it pretty close. And it makes things pretty shaky." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's financial 
consultant, said the county has "successfully completed about one half of the 
restructuring" of its beleaguered investment portfolio -- "which is much faster 
than we've anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is sticking to his estimate that the county will lose about $2 
billion on the sale of the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the board's actions Thursday, Hayes said it was going to be 
difficult to go to the credit markets because of the bankruptcy. But "by paying 
the interest payments . . . we're saying the county wants to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 How much the county intends to borrow is uncertain, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum we will be doing cash flow financing that's done every year and 
we'll be looking at other alternatives as well. This does not mean that the 
county is going to borrow its way out of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Orange County financial crisis ended its fourth week, the committee 
that represents a cross-section of investors intensified discussions of just 
how members want the bankruptcy resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee of seven of those investors is expecting to review a skeletal 
disbursement plan drawn up by the county's bankruptcy attorney, Bruce Bennett, 
as early as next week and will offer suggestions then, said Patrick Shea, the 
committee's lead attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Wally Kreutzen, financial director of the Transportation Corridors Agency, 
said his agency had not yet taken a formal position on the plan, but "clearly 
the committee's interest is the return of 100 cents on the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said the county's plan may not be drafted until the middle of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated requests for data from Arthur Andersen & Co., the accountants 
retained by the county, investors have become increasingly frustrated. 
Committee members will work over the weekend to formulate a list of the 
information they need from the county, one attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, county officials scrambled to correct an accounting blunder 
that is holding up disbursements to about 50 agencies with money in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Andersen left the agencies off a Bankruptcy Court-approved list that is 
crucial to distributing emergency funds, said Stan Oftelie, executive director 
of the Orange County Transportation Authority and chairman of an investor 
committee charged with reviewing requests for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bankruptcy Court rules, Oftelie said, the investment committee can only 
approve payments to investors on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said the missing investors and the amount they contributed to the fund 
were somehow consolidated with others whose names appear on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers still add up, but the irony of it is we can't pay them," he said. 
"We can't give them funds unless we know how much they have in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee found out Monday that some agencies had been left off the list 
when those agencies requested funds, Oftelie said. Arthur Andersen officials 
and county representatives were trying to correct the mistake, he said, but it 
could take a week before funds can be distributed.

<P>
 A woman who has worked in the county administrative office for the past 13

co-workers. She declined to discuss the situation but said she had been let go. 
She said that she had been hired as extra help and had been working hard to 
become a full-time employee.

<P>
 He said he is sticking to his estimate that the county will lose about $2

</P>
<P>
 Hayes also said the board's action Thursday was an important move to try and 
boost confidence on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access to credit is absolutely essential," he said, noting that the county 
will eventually need to borrow for cash-flow purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't borrow for cash-flow purposes then you cannot match your 
expenditures, which go out on a relatively even keel and the revenues, which 
come in with property tax and sales tax around Christmastime. There's a 
mismatch. So if you can't get to the credit markets to cash-flow borrowing then 
you're not going to be able to pay your bills during the slow revenue times of 
the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the board's actions Thursday, Hayes said it was going to be 
difficult to go to the credit markets because of the bankruptcy. But "by paying 
the interest payments . . . we're saying the county wants to work with them."

</P>
<P>
 "This committee has been successful in channeling the interests and 
perceptions of a very diverse group of constituents through the committee and 
presenting them to Bruce Bennett. That is a colossal benefit to the debtor and 
a tremendous show of good will," Shea said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It can only last so long," he said. "It's clear to me that we only have a few 
weeks left of goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said the county and investors are mulling a handful of approaches to the 
settlement, and several investors have already gone directly to Bennett with 
their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Kreutzen, financial director of the Transportation Corridors Agency, 
said his agency had not yet taken a formal position on the plan, but "clearly 
the committee's interest is the return of 100 cents on the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said the county's plan may not be drafted until the middle of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated requests for data from Arthur Andersen & Co., the accountants 
retained by the county, investors have become increasingly frustrated. 
Committee members will work over the weekend to formulate a list of the 
information they need from the county, one attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, county officials scrambled to correct an accounting blunder 
that is holding up disbursements to about 50 agencies with money in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Andersen left the agencies off a Bankruptcy Court-approved list that is 
crucial to distributing emergency funds, said Stan Oftelie, executive director 
of the Orange County Transportation Authority and chairman of an investor 
committee charged with reviewing requests for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bankruptcy Court rules, Oftelie said, the investment committee can only 
approve payments to investors on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said the missing investors and the amount they contributed to the fund 
were somehow consolidated with others whose names appear on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers still add up, but the irony of it is we can't pay them," he said. 
"We can't give them funds unless we know how much they have in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee found out Monday that some agencies had been left off the list 
when those agencies requested funds, Oftelie said. Arthur Andersen officials 
and county representatives were trying to correct the mistake, he said, but it 
could take a week before funds can be distributed.

 OFF THE WALL? Ex-Dana Point Councilwoman Eileen Krause and her husband, 
Robert, told Mother Jones magazine this month it was happenstance that the 
house they wanted was in gated, walled Monarch Bay. Now they like its reduced 
noise and traffic. . . . But the writer, Stanford University journalism 
professor Dale Maharidge, decries walled communities in his eight-page piece on 
Dana Point: "The isolation of walled communities will only increase as 
generations of children grow up in them and accept their reality."

 NO DOC HOLIDAY: Most high-stakes poker tournaments start out with a 
combination of amateurs and professional players, but the handful at the end 
are all pros. . . . Not so at the recent Hall of Fame tournament at Binion's

 ORANGE & ROSE: How can Orange County not get caught up in Rose Bowl fever, 
with one team called the Ducks? . . . Fans of the Oregon Ducks and the Penn 
State Nittany Lions are filling up many of the hotels here -- the Penn State 
football team itself is at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. (D1) And both 
schools have students from here. . . . Says Angie Tyson of Fountain Valley, an 
Oregon sophomore who will play in its band at the Rose Bowl game plus the 
Tournament of Roses Parade on Monday: "Growing up just around the corner, to 
finally have this opportunity is fantastic."

SCIENCE / CANCER RESEARCH; PROGRESS CITED IN CUTTING OFF BLOOD TO TUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists Thursday reported progress in cutting off blood supply to a wide 
variety of tumors in laboratory animals, a finding that could lead to new ways 
of making human cancers shrink and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to oversell this -- we're not saying we have the magic bullet, 
there's a lot more research to be done. But so far, we have green lights," said 
Dr. David A. Cheresh, one of the lead scientists on the project at the Scripps 
Research Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 The research by Cheresh and Scripps colleague Peter Brooks is being published 
in today's edition of the journal Cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scripps team was able to block growth of new blood vessels that feed 
tumors without causing any damage to blood vessels in normal healthy tissue in 
laboratory animals. They accomplished this with a single injection of a 
monoclonal antibody named LM609 or with a small synthetic peptide. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a blood supply, the tumor shrinks and vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The team got encouraging results in an array of solid tumors -- including 
lung, colon, breast and brain cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antibody tricks these newly forming vessels into self-destruction, or 
programmed cell death, by interfering with their survival signal," Cheresh 
said. "When the signal is blocked, the cells think they are in the wrong place 
and commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Cheresh is excited about his findings and believes that they hold 
promise, he stressed that approaches that work well in laboratories can turn 
out to be disappointments in human trials. Studies will have to be completed on 
the antibody's toxicity or possible harmful side effects in humans before 
clinical trials can start, probably in about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 It is customary for the first human trials to involve severely ill people, 
whose cancer is advanced and who have not responded to other treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the research with chicken embryos, described in Cell, as well as more 
recent studies on laboratory mice, has been very encouraging, Cheresh told 
Reuters in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's having an exciting and powerful impact on cancer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scripps team used human tumor fragments placed in chicken embryos. Within 
a few hours, the pieces of tumor began attracting new blood vessels, just as 
they would in human beings. Within 24 hours, they were injected with the 
antibody or with a control antibody. 
</P>
<P>
 In those injected with LM609, the blood vessels to the tumors shrank and 
disappeared in the pancreas, breast, brain, lung and larynx. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal blood vessels were unaffected. And once the tumor vanished, the chicken 
embryos developed normally. 
</P>
<P>
 In those with the control substance, the blood vessels proliferated and the 
tumors thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier attempts to starve tumors have failed because cancer can use more than 
one method to grow blood vessels. Experts hope that the new approach interferes 
with a process that is essential to all these methods of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Judah Folkman, a pioneer in the study of cancer blood supply, called the 
Scripps work "a remarkable achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related study, still in progress, the LM609 injection also shows promise 
in treating eye disease, including macular degeneration and diabetic 
retinopathy, which are caused when new blood vessels form in the back of the 
eye. Both diseases can cause blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego-based company, Ixsys Inc., has licensed the LM609 antibody and has 
created a humanized form of it. The goal is to begin clinical trials within the 
next 18 months, first for cancer and then for eye disease, Cheresh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further down the road, the approach may also hold promise for treating various 
inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, that also prompt the body 
to grow new blood vessels.

RECORDING THE STONE; CULTURE: RESEARCHERS PLAN TO DOCUMENT THE ROCK ART PAINTED 
ON SAN NICOLAS ISLAND BY ANCIENT INDIANS. EROSION IS ERASING THE PICTOGRAPHS OF 
WHALES AND FISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pounding surf and buffeting winds slowly chip away the sandstone walls of a 
cave on San Nicolas Island, erasing the only rock art left by a tribe of 
mysterious ancient islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the whales or fish icons chiseled into the stone are no longer 
visible. The black painted pictographs can barely be distinguished from the 
blue-green algae that cling to the crumbling surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists want to protect the artwork from further deterioration at the 
remote site they call Cave of the Whales. But they cannot figure out how to 
halt the forces of erosion that have scooped the cave out of the sandstone 
along the island's south shore. 
</P>
<P>
 So researchers again plan to lug their equipment this week to the Navy-owned 
island 61 miles off Point Mugu to resume documenting the fading sea creatures 
that once danced boldly on the cave walls. 
</P>
<P>
 They will photograph the grooved petroglyphs, measure the artwork and plot the 
location of each whale, shark or zigzag line. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, they may try to capture the faint images with infrared 
cameras, sample the paint or conduct other tests to glean what they can from 
the images before they are lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole cave was covered with rock art," said Navy archeologist Steve 
Schwartz, tracing the outline of a dorsal fin with his finger. "I wish we could 
have seen it in its splendor." 
</P>
<P>
 Most archeologists agree that rock art by Southern California Indians was more 
than mere doodling. They believe it chronicled a historic event or a celestial 
phenomenon or portrayed something of religious importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My take is that the art in the cave had something to do with their belief 
system," said Kathleen Conti of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. An 
artist and rock art researcher for 20 years, Conti is leading the first 
complete documentation of the 40 drawings that can be found in the dimly lit 
cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the artwork is thoroughly recorded, she said, researchers can continue to 
look for clues that might provide insight into the rituals, ceremonies or 
spiritual beliefs of the Nicoleno Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the Nicolenos, who spent thousands of years on San 
Nicolas until their numbers were diminished in the 1800s during battles with 
sea otter hunters from the Aleutian Islands and by recruiters for Spanish 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Nicoleno, a woman left stranded on the island, was brought to the 
mainland in 1853. Her 18 years of solitude on the island inspired the fictional 
children's book "Island of the Blue Dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nicolenos scratched out a living on the semidesert island by eating mostly 
shellfish, some roots, sea lions and small fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz points out that none of the usual prey appear in the rock art in the 
Cave of the Whales. Instead, the petroglyphs outline the features of whales, 
killer whales, dolphins or sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be some important connection to those animals, either 
spiritual power or that they were more valued than the shellfish which is so 
much more abundant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a whale washed ashore, it would be quite an event on the island, he said. 
Possibly the artwork depicted such an event or was created to lure more such 
creatures to its shores. "We think it is hunting magic, connected with the 
spiritual world," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1960 study of the cave, UCLA researchers asked a zoologist to help them 
identify specific species among the petroglyphs. Other studies also have tried 
to label each creature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fun game to play which animal is which," Schwartz said. "But I don't 
know if any are that successful. It is art, after all." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, researchers found a small slab of rock bearing petroglyphs that had 
slipped off the wall. In 1978, a larger piece fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 Both panels are at the Southwest Indian Museum in Highland Park. The smaller 
panel is on display, clearly showing three grooved petroglyphs of marine 
creatures. Assistant curator George Kritzman said the cramped museum has no 
room to display the larger panel, a 2-by-5-foot slab of rock kept in a storage 
room crowded with other artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The petroglyphs on both panels are in better shape than those in the rest of 
the cave because they have been sheltered from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the erosion, little else seems to have disturbed the rock art on San 
Nicolas, the most remote of the eight Channel Islands off Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to San Nicolas is tightly controlled by the Navy, which uses the island 
as a platform for radar and other instruments to track missile testing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some initials carved in the walls. Researchers have 
attributed them to Navy personnel stationed on the island before 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the cave and surrounding beaches -- used by sea elephants during their 
pupping and breeding season -- are off limits to the 200 Navy personnel who 
live and work on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the cave is not easy to find. No trail or markings lead to it. 
And its entrance cannot easily be seen by anyone walking along the short 
sandstone cliffs that rise from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 A grooved petroglyph resembling a shark guards the opening of the cave, which 
stretches 19 feet across and 9 feet high at the center. The main chamber 
extends back 35 feet where the walls behind pinch in and the ceiling drops. A 
narrow passage only a few feet high continues back another 150 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave had a sandy floor until about a decade ago when a big storm flushed 
the sand back to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 A large boulder blocks the surf from flowing freely into the cave. But patches 
of seaweed litter the rock floor, carried by waves that manage to slop over the 
rock during the highest tides. 
</P>
<P>
 The seaweed also draws swarms of kelp flies and thousands of spiders to feed 
on them. Black widows lurk in every crack of the cave's walls and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Webs dangle from the ceiling and egg sacs are stuffed into crevices. The cave 
is filled with the sounds of waves crashing onto the rocks. The sea spray blows 
into the dank space. Over time, the moisture seeps into the soft sandstone, 
loosening its sloughing surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't seem to be much we can do to stop the erosion," Schwartz said. 
"But at least we can record all of the rock art before it disappears."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FANNIE MAE BUYS BACK $634 MILLION IN RISKY 
SECURITIES; INVESTMENTS: SALE PRICE OF $577 MILLION APPEARS TO DELIGHT COUNTY 
OFFICIALS. REDUCTION IN INVESTMENT POOL SHRINKS COUNTY'S POTENTIAL LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest sale so far of its troubled "derivative" securities, Orange 
County on Thursday sold $634 million in so-called structured notes back to 
their original issuer, the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-sponsored agency, known as Fannie Mae, paid $577 million to 
repurchase and retire the package of seven securities, the county said. That 
price -- about 91 cents on the dollar -- appeared to delight county officials, 
who said it was more than the complex, hard to sell securities would have 
fetched on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real pleased with this," said Thomas Hayes, the county's financial 
adviser. Fannie Mae said through a spokesman that it had paid a "fair and 
economic" price. 
</P>
<P>
 To stanch the losses in the portfolio it manages for itself and 186 other 
municipalities and government agencies, Orange County is liquidating its 
holdings, which were valued at $7.8 billion shortly after the county sought 
bankruptcy protection early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the proceeds from the Fannie Mae transaction, $92.2 million will go to pay 
off investment loans; the balance of $484.8 million will go to the county, 
which will reinvest it in short-term U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate transaction, Bank of America on Thursday sold $307 million in 
government agency securities owned by the county but held on behalf of the 
investment pool's lenders. B of A received $286.7 million for the package; all 
of that will go to pay investment loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's sale of the Fannie Mae derivatives significantly reduces the 
exposure of its remaining $4.53-billion portfolio to adverse changes in 
interest rates, Hayes said. After the sale, every percentage point rise in 
rates will reduce the portfolio's value $145 million. That figure was $220 
million a week ago and $300 million on Dec. 13, when the portfolio liquidation 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale also reduces the percentage of derivatives in the portfolio to a 
little more than 75%, down from nearly 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said the latest sale kept the county on track to hold its loss on the 
portfolio to $2.02 billion, or 27% of the investors' principal. But he 
cautioned that the holdings are still far too exposed to interest rate-related 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If interest rates move higher, the county could still lose money," Hayes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Fannie Mae notes included some of its more elaborately structured 
"inverse floaters" -- securities designed to pay higher yields as market 
interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rates this year have risen sharply, and the dividend payouts on the 
securities plummeted. For one Fannie Mae note on which the county held $100 
million as recently as Nov. 23, the interest paid plunged from 7% in February 
to 3.93% in November. The payout on another Fannie Mae note in the portfolio 
was based on an arcane measurement of rates in the German currency market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and officials at Salomon Bros., the county's financial advisory firm, 
originally believed that their best chance of unloading such exotica might lie 
in returning the notes to their issuers in a swap for more conventional, less 
volatile notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fannie Mae agreed to take the notes for cash, possibly because the agency 
is increasingly sensitive to the need to assist buyers of its more volatile 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best possible solution for all parties," Hayes said. "We got cash 
proceeds rather than another security to market."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FUND CRISIS IS TYING UP COURT AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For less than 1,200 bucks, it's hardly been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed Schaum believes there is a principle involved here. The way he sees it, 
he won a judgment, fair and square, in an Orange County small claims court. 
County officials helped him collect his money from the company he had sued. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing he knew, the county was holding onto the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just stunned when I learned they had appropriated money that was never 
theirs to begin with," said Schaum, 52, a mortgage broker in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach resident is among an unknown number of plaintiffs awaiting 
perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars in court judgments that were frozen as 
a result of the county's bankruptcy filing, a county official said. The money, 
seized from defendants by the county marshal's office, is not being paid out by 
the auditor-controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Such awards range from "small claims fender-bender judgments" to Superior 
Court judgments against large corporations, said Don Spears of the Orange 
County marshal's office. Spears, whose office enforces court orders authorizing 
seizure of the money from bank accounts and elsewhere, said the vast majority 
of judgments are well under $100,000. The orders for seizure can come from 
courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears did not know how much money was being withheld or how many plaintiffs 
are affected. No one in the auditor-controller's office could be reached for 
comment. But Spears said he learned late Wednesday that the office is planning 
to start releasing money collected after the bankruptcy was filed -- including 
Schaum's -- early next week. The fate of awards collected before Dec. 6 remains 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no hue and cry" among plaintiffs yet, Spears said. In fact, 
before a reporter made an inquiry, Spears thought that the judgments were being 
paid as usual. Apparently, checks to plaintiffs were being issued immediately 
after the Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing but were stopped sometime later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum learned the bad news a few days before Christmas when he called the 
auditor's office to inquire about his money. He had wanted the extra cash for 
the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just astounded," he said. "I said, 'What do you mean you're not writing 
any checks?' They said, 'We're broke.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, this has not been an easy quest for Schaum. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the company that owed him a commission for work he did as a contractor 
had its accounts frozen by court order as a result of a lawsuit by the state 
attorney general. Then, he pursued a small claims action against the company, 
Nationwide Mortgage Group, in Harbor Municipal Court to recover $5,015 he was 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum said he won the case Oct. 12 and the county marshal's office seized the 
only funds it could from a company bank account -- $1,146 and change. The money 
was forwarded Dec. 15 to the county auditor's office for processing, but the 
bucks stopped there. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum believes his money should have been held in a separate account so that 
it would not have been affected by the county's financial misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if an attorney or a real estate agent or somebody in the private 
sector did this, it would be looked upon as a criminal offense," he said.

 The hallways of the Cannon House Office Building resembled a vast junk yard. 
Piles of assorted institutional furniture lined the corridors, a banged-up desk 
here, a worn file cabinet there. A green St. Patrick's Day hat formed a still 
life with a half-full plastic highball glass, amber with cigarettes. A 
gooseneck lamp lay stricken in an apparent lethal back flip. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the way, the friendly face of Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) peered up 
from a dozen or so playing-card-size photos scattered rudely on the worn marble 
floor. The flip side listed Horn's vital Washington statistics: his committees, 
his academic degrees, his D.C. and district office addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Horn needs a new set because he, along with 263 other House members, is 
moving into new Capitol Hill office spaces -- a biennial bout of musical chairs 
in which members vie for the choicest office accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With every new Congress, House members shuffle among the three office 
buildings that flank the south side of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a bumper crop of 110 freshmen descended on the Hill and 
precipitated about 300 moves. But changes in leadership and committee offices 
-- caused by the Republican takeover -- plus an influx of 86 new members will 
produce close to 400 moves, making this year the most frenzied relocation derby 
in decades, said Robert R. Miley, the House Building superintendent, who 
oversees the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is going crazy over here," said Miley, sounding not at all 
perturbed by his assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Miley's crews of movers, painters, electricians and computer installers have 
been working virtually around the clock since Dec. 15 -- six suites a shift, 18 
a day -- to ensure that every new member can pick up his or her keys on 
Tuesday. "We pretty much have it down to a science," Miley said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some critics who say the whole thing is a gigantic waste of money 
and effort. Although Miley budgets only $460,000, mostly for contract painters, 
other costs kick the price tag to about $1 million, others estimate. Sen. 
Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) introduced a bill this year to abolish the practice. But 
the measure dropped from sight, along with Wofford, who was whisked from office 
in the Republican surge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tsunami, as they like to call it here, carried away some Democratic barons 
whose longevity had earned them some of the best addresses. And the prospect of 
landing one of the prime locations spurred some veteran members to overcome 
their hate-to-move inertia. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the new Congress' emblematic office swaps, Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), the vociferous Orange County conservative, is moving into the 
quarters of vanquished House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 The most coveted offices are those that have commanding views of the Capitol. 
Visitors, meek and mighty alike, can't help but be impressed by the soaring 
dome, and it makes a great backdrop for publicity photos of legislators, pen in 
hand, poring over some difficult but essential government text. 
</P>
<P>
 From an aerobic fitness standpoint, proximity to members' committee rooms is 
certainly important, as are nearby restrooms and elevators. But plain old 
square footage is perhaps the most powerful attraction, as the making of laws 
produces an ungodly amount of supporting documents, reports and correspondence, 
the great majority of which are never again referred to by anyone but must be 
archived. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most dispensing of goodies around here, seniority rules. Among groups 
of lawmakers of equal rank, a lottery determines the order in which they can 
choose. For freshmen, a bad draw can lead to some pretty dismal digs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono wound up in what most members consider 
the least desirable neighborhood -- the fifth floor of the Cannon House Office 
Building, the oldest of the six buildings where members of the House and Senate 
set up their administrative headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetically, the fifth floor is a disaster. Offices occupy only the inner 
loop while floor-to-ceiling storage bins, more appropriate for a cellar, line 
the outer wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Served by fewer elevators than the other floors, fifth-floor denizens often 
have to navigate the stairs to get to the Capitol across the street for votes 
-- reportedly the longest trek from anywhere in the House complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bono is taking it all in stride, so to speak, saying through a spokesman 
that he's glad to take whatever space is available and is just happy to be 
here.

UC STUDY LINKS SPINAL DEFECT TO ABNORMALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine researchers report that they have identified a genetic abnormality 
they believe causes spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of 
death in infants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long-anticipated finding that should quickly improve accuracy in 
diagnosis of the forms of SMA," said Donald S. Wood, director of science 
technology for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. "Most important, it will accelerate 
our continuing search for a form of treatment for SMA." 
</P>
<P>
 No treatment for the disease now exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder, which in its most severe form is uniformly fatal before the age 
of 2, affects an estimated 20,000 Americans, making it the second most common 
lethal genetic disorder after cystic fibrosis. Although the disease affects one 
in 10,000 births, it is estimated that one in 40 adults carries the defective 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification of the gene is reported by a team led by UC Irvine 
molecular biologist John J. Wasmuth in the January issue of the journal Nature 
Genetics, released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth's team believes that the disorder is caused by the loss of segments of 
a gene called XS2G3 on chromosome 5, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that 
make up the human genetic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 They studied DNA from 29 patients with the most severe form of the disease, 
called Type I SMA, and compared it to DNA from 235 healthy people. They found 
that 17 of the 29 patients were missing fragments of XS2G3 in both copies of 
the gene (one from each parent). In contrast, only two of the 235 healthy 
people -- both of them known carriers of the disorder -- were missing fragments 
of the gene, and only in one copy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s Wood speculated that fragments are missing in 
all 29 patients but that researchers were unable to detect them in 12 cases 
because of the extreme complexity of that area of chromosome 5. He added that 
several other teams are expected to report soon on research that may verify the 
UC Irvine team's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four distinct forms of SMA, varying in severity. Type I, known as 
Werdnig-Hoffman disease, is characterized by generalized muscle weakness, 
trouble swallowing and sucking, breathing distress and paralysis of legs and 
arms within three months after birth. It is usually fatal by age 2. Type II 
strikes in the first six months to three years and is usually fatal during 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Types III and IV strike later in life. Although they are crippling, they do 
not affect life span. The researchers speculate that the severity of the 
disease is controlled by the amount of DNA missing from the gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the team included molecular biologists Arthur H.M. Burghes of 
Ohio State University and Louise R. Simard of the Hopital Sainte-Justine in 
Montreal.

DOLE CRITICAL OF GINGRICH'S DEAL FOR BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), opening a new rift with the incoming 
House Speaker, on Thursday warned that Rep. Newt Gingrich's reported 
$4.5-million book deal "does raise some questions" that could dog Republicans 
at a time when they are slashing programs that help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview with a small group of reporters, Dole called the news 
of Gingrich's lucrative contract to publish two books with HarperCollins 
Publishers "not too popular" among voters, and suggested it could hurt the GOP 
unless it is "addressed" quickly by the Georgia Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of money," said Dole, speaking from Bal Harbour, Fla., where he is 
resting and plotting his next move in an expected bid for the presidency. "I 
can already see, when you start cutting programs that are going to affect 
low-income Americans, (that) that could be an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The first book, tentatively titled "To Renew America," is to be a series of 
essays by Gingrich on the GOP agenda. The second is to be a compendium of 
essays on government by historical figures, with commentary by Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's rebuke has come amid mounting criticism of Gingrich for striking the 
deal with the New York publisher, which is controlled by communications mogul 
Rupert Murdoch. Last week, Democrats accused Gingrich of taking part in a 
"sweetheart deal" in which the Speaker would try to change the law that 
prevents Murdoch, an Australian citizen, from buying U.S. TV stations with 
foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole stopped short of suggesting that Gingrich should refuse the money for the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get in a quarrel with Newt, but I think it is a concern," 
Dole said. A Gingrich spokesman said he interpreted Dole's remarks as "entirely 
friendly" and added, "I'm sure that was how it was intended." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there were news reports Thursday night that Gingrich was 
considering giving up a substantial portion of the $4.5-million book advance.

YOUNG DOESN'T SEE POLITICAL MOVE TO RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former U.N. ambassador and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young on Thursday dismissed 
oft-repeated suggestions that the political difficulties facing President 
Clinton and his party stem from a growing conservatism in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Young said, the GOP takeover of Congress is the result of the 
Democratic Party's failure to communicate with its most likely supporters and 
is not a judgment against its or Clinton's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organized labor didn't feel any allegiance to Clinton or anybody else 
(Democratic) running because they felt like they'd been betrayed" by White 
House and party support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT, 
Young said during an interview with reporters and editors at The Times' 
Washington bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks were confused (about Democratic policies in general) and because they 
haven't known how to read what's going on. . . . So they didn't rally around 
anyone," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect was "a loss of energy" that caused low voter turnout among 
Democrats and higher turnout among Republicans, who Young said borrowed the 
organizing tactics of civil rights activists to rally conservative white 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as any dramatic move to the right" on the part of the 
nation, he said. "I see it as part of the confusion of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt Gingrich ran an old-fashioned labor union, Democratic campaign," Young 
said of the incoming Republican House Speaker. "He took these kids on college 
campuses, just like we used to do in the civil rights movement, and he invited 
them off to weekend retreats. They rallied around and they learned how to 
crunch numbers and how to organize precincts and how to conduct campaigns. Then 
they picked the districts they were going to work in and they ran good 
campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 The disarray within the Democratic Party provides an opening for Gingrich, 
whom Young described as a "demagogue."  
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans want to create more confusion and polarize the public into 
thinking that the federal government can do nothing right, he said, and that 
was the purpose of its "contract with America" -- a set of political reforms 
that many Republicans signed and promised to enact if they won congressional 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically want to use this as a steppingstone to take the White House in 
1996, so they would like to see (Democratic) failure," he said.

PRESIDENT MUST BACK NEXT CIA CHIEF, OBSERVERS SAY; INTELLIGENCE: SUPPORT FROM 
WHITE HOUSE IS SEEN AS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN REVIVING THE BELEAGUERED AGENCY. 
NAMES OF POSSIBLE NOMINEES SURFACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Glickman, the departing chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Intelligence, was musing the other day about what it would be like to run the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a red flannel shirt and surrounded by boxes and emptied desks in 
his Capitol Hill office, he made it clear he never expected the current 
director of central intelligence -- R. James Woolsey -- to be leaving any time 
soon. Still, he toyed with the idea of someday being the nation's top spy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think to myself: 'What if they did come and ask me to be director 
of the CIA?' " he said. "But I don't know if the challenges that lie ahead and 
the changes that need to be made are possible without having the White House 
really behind it. You'd need to have the very, very active support of the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 As fate played out, Glickman, a Kansas Democrat, was tapped for secretary of 
agriculture on Wednesday, the same day the White House announced the surprise 
resignation of Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 In two short years at the helm as CIA director, Woolsey fought Congress for 
increases in his budget while other government agencies, including the 
Pentagon, were downsizing. He sought to reassure the public that the Aldrich H. 
Ames espionage case was an aberration, and yet at the same time, he issued 
reprimands -- rather than more serious punishments -- for those who allowed the 
spy scandal to go undetected for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 And he seldom, if ever, seemed to have the open support of the Clinton White 
House as he attempted to maneuver the global spy network as it monitored the 
internal machinations of other countries in the years after the Cold War. It 
has never been clear what caused the perception of distance between the White 
House and Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that last point -- a heavy dose of public support from the White House 
-- that may well be the key ingredient in whether the new CIA director is able 
to pick up the demoralized agency and get it moving again. So far, the White 
House has given no indication of when a nominee might be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see somebody who's smart, experienced and has good judgment and 
is tough," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the incoming chairman of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got to be tough enough to take on the old boy's network at CIA 
and confident and resolute in his relations with the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," said Specter, whose committee will hold confirmation hearings on the 
CIA nominee, "he's got to be tough enough to demand and get access to the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 One intelligence official, who asked not to be identified, agreed that many 
inside the agency did not feel Woolsey enjoyed the full backing of the 
President. But he said it was unclear whether it was just another example of 
President Clinton's seeming disinterest in foreign policy -- as some of his 
critics have alleged -- or that he has been preoccupied with other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Woolsey lacked 
Clinton's confidence. "That's a straw man," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House said the search for a successor is just beginning, 
several names already are surfacing as possible nominees. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Deputy Secretary of Defense John M. Deutch, long a friend of Woolsey's who 
has won high marks at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Sen. Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican who served on the 
Senate intelligence panel and now sits as vice chairman on the President's 
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, created to recommend changes for improving 
intelligence gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outgoing Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), despite the fact that he has 
criticized Clinton's performance in the White House as one of the reasons he 
lost a bid to the Senate this fall. He was once a chairman of the House 
intelligence panel.

ISRAEL; EFFORT TO CURB ARAB POLITICS LIKELY TO ROIL '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Israeli officials are starting the New Year armed with a new law, one they say 
will put an end to Palestinian political activity in the Holy City. 
</P>
<P>
 As 1994 drew to a close, Israel's Parliament voted in favor of the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement Implementation Law. Both the government and the 
opposition Likud Party touted the legislation as a tool that will strengthen 
Israeli rule in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your excuses are finished now," Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu lectured the 
government after the bill passed Monday. "Now you have the law you asked for to 
take action on behalf of a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 (The Likud abstained in the voting, because it opposes the Israeli-Palestinian 
accord the law refers to.) 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which takes effect New Year's Day, restricts activities of 
the Palestinian Authority to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho 
-- areas that Israel handed over to the Palestinians in May. 
</P>
<P>
 It bars the Palestine Liberation Organization or the Palestinian Authority 
from carrying out any activity "of a political or governmental nature . . . 
which does not coincide with respect for Israel's sovereignty" in Israel 
without Israeli government permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis informally tagged the legislation the "Orient House law" because its 
primary purpose is to stop Palestinian diplomatic, political and bureaucratic 
activity at Orient House, a building in mostly Arab East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis annexed East Jerusalem in 1967. That annexation has never been 
recognized by the international community. Palestinians warned that any effort 
to enforce the law will jeopardize Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passing a law like this puts pressure on the Palestinian Authority and 
reduces the credibility of the peace process and the Palestinian leadership," 
said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian negotiator who often criticizes 
implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is enforced, Khatib said, "then the Palestinian Authority should 
reconsider its agreement to postpone the issue of Jerusalem to the final phase 
of negotiations with Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians and Israelis started scuffling over Jerusalem almost as soon as 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in Gaza in July to take over the newly 
formed Palestinian self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of both sides' concerns is their peace accord's language, which 
says that Jerusalem's status will be resolved only in the final phase of 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, scheduled to begin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians assert that the Israelis are using that time to strengthen their 
hold on Jerusalem by building thousands of homes for Jews in East Jerusalem. 
They say the Israelis also are trying to separate Jerusalem from the rest of 
the occupied West Bank by restricting access of West Bank Palestinians to the 
city and by forbidding Palestinian Authority officials from conducting 
political business in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The city not only is home to sacred shrines of all three monotheistic 
religions but has a mixed population of Arabs and Jews. Israel claims it as the 
historic capital of the Jewish state. Palestinians say they want it to also 
serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials retort that the Palestinians are trying to bolster their 
claims to mostly Arab East Jerusalem by using Orient House, a lavishly 
appointed onetime hotel, as a quasi-embassy and office building for Palestinian 
Authority ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Orient House is owned by Faisal Husseini, a minister-without-portfolio in the 
Palestinian Authority responsible for Jerusalem. He spent his own money to 
restore the 19th-Century structure, built by one of his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orient House history of the building describes it as "an official 
Palestinian guest house." Since 1992, after its restoration was completed, a 
stream of foreign dignitaries have met with Palestinian officials at the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Husseini also has allowed Saeb Erekat, minister of municipalities in the 
Palestinian Authority, to keep an office on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said that Erekat's activities will be 
immediately investigated to see if they violate the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued after the legislation was enacted, Husseini said the law 
restricting Palestinian political activity here "represents a serious violation 
of the Palestinian-Israeli accords and international resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Orient House confirms that its political activities will continue unabated as 
they always have been since 1992. The new Israeli law will not hinder nor stop 
any of these activities," he said, almost certainly setting the stage for 
another Israeli-Palestinian confrontation in 1995.

BRITAIN; FEW FEELING BLUE AS SUNDAY SHOPPING RULES ARE RETIRED; AS CHURCHGOING 
DWINDLES, FAMILIES ENJOY SABBATH AT THE MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Britain, Sunday once was sacrosanct. There were restrictions on the 
operation of shops, movie theaters, pubs, restaurants, sports events. The rules 
narrowed the options of people here on Sundays to churchgoing, prayer-reading, 
long walks and dining on the traditional roast meat, often with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Britain's blue laws are going the way of bowler hats and winning cricket 
teams -- much to the delight of a large majority of the populace. 
</P>
<P>
 And if evidence was needed, this holiday season has provided it: Many stores 
opened on Christmas and will do so New Year's Day -- both Sundays -- and on the 
national holidays the Monday after. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores throughout Britain now bustle on Sundays -- with the Holy Day one of 
the busiest shopping days of the week. Even "never-on-Sunday" bastions such as 
Harrods and Marks & Spencer have gone along with Sunday openings during the 
holidays -- and have been surprised by the volume of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 While churchgoing has dwindled markedly in Britain, Sunday shopping has become 
a family activity. Families march off together to main street stores and 
suburban malls from Inverness in Scotland to Dover on the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessity shopping," says Sue Sadler at Marks & Spencer, Britain's 
leading chain store. "It's leisure shopping. We have found that families tend 
to come along together, which means it is a day for quite large family 
purchases." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Parliament, in the past year it has liberalized Sunday opening laws in 
recognition that about 11 million people partake of the new shopping times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the busiest of the week in terms of sales per hours," said a spokesman 
for Sainsbury's, a supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, public holidays are called "bank holidays" to signify that 
commercial and financial activity ceases. But in the past month, the largest 
banking chain, National Westminster, has tried experimental Sunday openings. 
"Customers appreciated the service," says Anthony Frost, a NatWest bank 
official, who added that seven-day banking "may happen in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken years for the British to junk their Sunday blue laws, which have 
been severe, especially compared with more liberal Continental countries. 
Curiously, though, hundreds of years ago, Sundays for most people in Britain 
were festive -- holidays for music, dancing and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Puritans, after winning the Civil War in the 17th Century, took an 
inflexible view of the Fourth Commandment: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep 
it holy." Puritan-minded authorities decreed the Lord's Day should be devoted 
to churchgoing, Bible-reading and meditation; they banned work, trade, sports, 
play and any other non-religious pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, British society suffered under the tension of how strictly to 
observe the Christian Sabbath. What was actually allowed often depended on the 
liberality of the local minister and justice of the peace. The Victorians 
continued the tradition. Novelist Charles Dickens complained about the rigidity 
of strict observance, particularly for children. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the move toward more Sunday openings was led first by small 
shopkeepers, then larger retailers who ignored closing laws, revised in 1950 
but left ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, blue Sundays were supported by clerics and unions, the latter 
because they feared employees would be forced to work excessive hours. But both 
groups have become reconciled to changing circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, as 1995 dawns, the old-fashioned British Sunday is dead -- and 
unlamented. So much so that, come the New Year, horse and greyhound racing will 
be legal on Sundays, leading one wag to exclaim, "The British Sunday is going 
to the dogs."

PANEL PROPOSES NO REMEDY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 'NOTCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress should take no action on behalf of the "notch" generation, several 
million elderly Americans who believe that they are being cheated out of their 
fair share of Social Security benefits, a bipartisan commission recommended 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress created the 12-member commission in 1992 to investigate claims that 
Americans born between 1917 and 1921, the so-called notch years, were being 
treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said benefits paid to those in the notch generation -- about 6 
million Americans now between ages 73 and 77 -- are equitable and that no 
changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that disparities in benefit levels do exist, they exist not 
because those born in the 'notch' years received less than their due; they 
exist because those born before the 'notch' years . . . continue to receive 
substantially inflated benefits," the commission said. "This disparity has 
created an understandable perception of unfairness." 
</P>
<P>
 The notch refers to a dip in a graph representing retirement benefits to 
seniors born between 1917 and 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 The notch has its origins in the 1970s, when Congress changed the way it 
calculated Social Security benefit levels. Lawmakers made a flawed decision 
that allowed people born between 1910 and 1916, just before the notch, to 
collect unduly large benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission confirmed that many in the notch years receive lower benefits 
than many of those born a few years earlier or later. 
</P>
<P>
 For many notch retirees, the statistics are bolstered by personal knowledge of 
large inconsistencies between their benefits and those reported by friends, 
neighbors and relatives with similar wage histories, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also recommended against reducing benefits for recipients now 
between the ages of 78 and 84, those born before the notch.

CLINTON TAKES THE OFFENSIVE ON WELFARE; REFORM: THE ADMINISTRATION CALLS GOP 
REFORM PROPOSAL A 'CRUEL HOAX' THAT WOULD PUT 5 MILLION CHILDREN AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN and MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of holding up welfare reform as a prime area for bipartisan 
compromise, the Clinton Administration launched a frontal attack Thursday on 
the leading GOP proposal, calling it a "cruel hoax" that would eventually knock 
5 million children off the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said at a press conference 
that the GOP plan would dump millions of poor children abruptly into the hands 
of states, cities and charities unequipped to deal with them, causing extensive 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The "human consequences would fall on children, and (the) financial 
consequences would fall on state taxpayers and private charities," a 
battle-ready Shalala told reporters. "The solution to the welfare crisis is not 
to send children to orphanages -- it's to send their parents to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans shot back in a statement put out by the House Republican 
Conference, calling Shalala's statements a "hysterical assault" that has to 
"make many people wonder whether the Clinton Administration is serious about 
reforming the broken system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shalala onslaught was timed to coincide with a scheduled television 
appearance by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), introducing the 
1938 Mickey Rooney classic "Boys Town" on TNT as his favorite movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Gingrich suggested that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
watch the movie instead of criticizing his advocacy of orphanages in those 
cases in which parents cannot take care of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 While both the Administration and congressional Republicans are committed to 
reforming the welfare system, they have strikingly different visions of what 
the new safety net for families with children should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican proposal would deny some benefits to children born to unwed 
mothers, children whose paternity has not been established and children whose 
mothers fail to get jobs after two or five years on the rolls -- depending on 
which time limit states select. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan, which was introduced into Congress during the last 
session, offered a balance of carrots and sticks, including making the 
government an employer of last resort for welfare recipients who reached the 
two-year limit for cash benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has scheduled a bipartisan summit on welfare reform for mid-January to 
try to reach consensus with Republican governors and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But this first major skirmish between the Administration and congressional 
Republicans on welfare reform stripped away the very thin veneer of cooperation 
on the issue. The debate over the issue seems sure to escalate into a 
full-scale war once Congress convenes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's first strike, which was Shalala's idea but approved by 
the White House, showed the Administration digging in to defend some key 
elements of its approach to welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration is expected to lose a lot of ground to Republicans 
on some parts of welfare reform, Shalala's statements reflected the White 
House's determination to shine a spotlight on the possible negative 
consequences of the GOP plan in an attempt to preserve protections for 
children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A new HHS analysis determined that if the GOP plan were currently in place, 5 
million children whose families are receiving Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children -- the main cash welfare program for families -- would be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans countered that the provisions of the Personal 
Responsibility Act, the welfare reform legislation attached to their "contract 
with America," would not immediately affect those on AFDC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one child currently receiving AFDC today will have his or her benefits 
cut off upon enactment of the GOP bill," said Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehner stressed that mothers who would eventually be denied benefits would be 
eligible for food stamps, Medicaid and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary Shalala would have everyone believe that the GOP solution to 
welfare reform is to place children in group homes," Boehner said, adding that 
"this is a total mischaracterization" of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the department's analysis, the Republican plan would leave the 
states without adequate funding to care for the children who would be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 While at least half of the 10 million children now receiving AFDC would be 
dropped, only $293 million would be returned to the states for orphanages or 
foster care, which could finance 8,029 places in orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, 1 million of the 1.8 million children on the rolls would be 
excluded, but only $64 million would be made available to care for the 
children, which would pay for 1,758 children in orphanages, according to the 
Administration's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration relied on the Child Welfare League's estimate that the 
average group home costs $36,500 per child per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some welfare experts agreed with Republicans that the estimates were 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have exaggerated the numbers so much that they've undermined their 
case," said Doug Besharov, a welfare specialist at the conservative Enterprise 
Institute. "If you're going to attack the idea (of orphanages), you want to be 
very careful about your numbers. They've created a static analysis. They assume 
no change in behavior."

SCIENCE / GENETIC RESEARCH; STUDY LINKS ABNORMALITY TO SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine researchers report that they have identified a genetic abnormality 
they believe causes spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of 
death in infants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long-anticipated finding that should quickly improve accuracy in 
diagnosis of the forms of SMA," said Donald S. Wood, director of science 
technology for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. "Most important, it will accelerate 
our continuing search for a form of treatment for SMA." 
</P>
<P>
 No treatment now exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder, which in its most severe form is uniformly fatal before the age 
of 2, affects an estimated 20,000 Americans, making it the second most common 
lethal genetic disorder after cystic fibrosis. It affects one in 10,000 births, 
but an estimated one in 40 adults carries the defective gene. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification of the gene is reported by a team led by UC Irvine 
molecular biologist John J. Wasmuth in the January issue of the journal Nature 
Genetics, released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth's team believes that the disorder is caused by the loss of segments of 
a gene called XS2G3 on chromosome 5, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that 
make up the human genetic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 They studied DNA from 29 patients with the most severe form of the disease, 
called Type I SMA, and compared it to DNA from 235 healthy people. They found 
that 17 of the 29 patients were missing fragments of XS2G3 in both copies of 
the gene (one from each parent). In contrast, only two of the 235 healthy 
people -- both of them known carriers of the disorder -- were missing fragments 
of the gene, and only in one copy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s Wood speculated that fragments are missing in 
all 29 patients but that researchers were unable to detect them in 12 cases 
because of the extreme complexity of that area of chromosome 5.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY HALTS CITIES' PARK GRANTS; RECREATION: 
FUNDS FOR EQUESTRIAN TRAILS AND BASKETBALL COURTS -- AMONG OTHERS -- HAVE BEEN 
SUSPENDED BY BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County officials have informed more than a dozen cities that $2.7 
million in urban park grants they were promised this year will be suspended 
indefinitely because of the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The move places in jeopardy park improvement projects from Yorba Linda to 
Costa Mesa and was described Thursday by city officials as another sign of the 
magnitude of the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disappointment, and it hurts," Brea Mayor Bev Perry said. "(But) given 
the magnitude of the county crisis, it's not unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will now try to determine if they will have to delay or cancel 
some of the projects, which range from the repair of equestrian trails to the 
installation of basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county informed agencies about the grant delays this week. Cities affected 
by the move include Brea, Costa Mesa, Cypress, Fullerton, La Habra, La Palma, 
Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Orange, Placentia, Santa Ana, Stanton and Yorba 
Linda, as well as several local youth groups. The grants ranged from $5,000 to 
$385,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth W. Scattergood, chief of program support for the county's Harbors, 
Beaches and Parks Department, said the grant money is frozen in the county 
treasury because of the bankruptcy and cannot be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money came from the Harbors, Beaches and Parks District, a special 
district that is funded through property taxes. Cities applied for the grants 
earlier this year, and county officials selected recipients in the fall, 
Scattergood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest-hit cities is Yorba Linda, which expected to use $385,000 in 
grants for a variety of projects at parks and other recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has placed in limbo the Adventure Playground at Hurless Barton 
Park. City officials had hoped to use $150,000 to relocate the playground, 
according to Parks and Recreation Director Steve Rudometkin. The city plans to 
build a gymnasium where the playground is. The city also planned to use grant 
money to build an access road at Arroyo Park and improve equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Another community feeling the pinch is Rossmoor, which was set to receive 
$300,000 in grants that officials intended to use to help convert a vacant 
school site into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those plans are on hold, said Jim Alexander, a board member of the 
Rossmoor Community Services District. "We're sitting in a very precarious 
situation," Alexander said. "We can't (spend money on the park) unless it's an 
absolute necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos city officials planned to use $239,000 in grants to improve five 
parks and install lights at the McAuliffe Middle School athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek said the city cannot afford to finance the work 
on its own and will have to delay the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa planned to build outdoor basketball courts at TeWinkle Park with 
its $216,000 grant. Officials said that they were still trying to assess the 
impact of the county's action. 
</P>
<P>
 In Placentia, the delay of a $55,000 grant has jeopardized plans to repair the 
edge of a lake at Tri-City Park. City Manager Bob D'Amato said he put the 
project on hold even though the city has not been officially notified that the 
grant was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were on the verge of awarding the contract" when the county filed for 
bankruptcy Dec. 6, D'Amato said. "We decided on our own to go into a hold mode. 
I'm assuming the grant will be canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 A $90,000 project to put up lighting and resurface a basketball court at Brea 
Junior High School has been suspended indefinitely, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The frozen grant money has prompted Los Alamitos' Dunek to order a review of 
all grants the city receives through the county, including Community 
Development Block grants, which are used to improve blighted neighborhoods and 
finance programs for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the review is intended to determine how much money the city is owed 
and what the city would do if the county cannot turn over the money. Parks On 
Hold 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; $634 MILLION IN NOTES SOLD TO FANNIE MAE; 
INVESTMENTS: SALE PRICE OF $577 MILLION APPEARS TO DELIGHT COUNTY OFFICIALS. 
REDUCTION IN INVESTMENT POOL SHRINKS COUNTY'S POTENTIAL LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest sale so far of its troubled "derivative" securities, Orange 
County on Thursday sold $634 million in so-called structured notes back to 
their original issuer, the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-sponsored agency, known as Fannie Mae, paid $577 million to 
repurchase and retire the package of seven securities, the county said. That 
price -- about 91 cents on the dollar -- appeared to delight county officials, 
who said it was more than the complex, hard-to-sell securities would have 
fetched on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real pleased with this," said Thomas W. Hayes, the county's financial 
adviser. Fannie Mae said through a spokesman that it had paid a "fair and 
economic" price. 
</P>
<P>
 To stanch the losses in the portfolio it manages for itself and 186 other 
municipalities and government agencies, Orange County is liquidating its 
holdings, which were valued at $7.8 billion shortly after the county sought 
bankruptcy protection early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the proceeds from the Fannie Mae transaction, $92.2 million will go to pay 
off investment loans; the balance of $484.8 million will go to the county, 
which will reinvest it in short-term U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate transaction, Bank of America on Thursday sold $307 million in 
government agency securities owned by the county but held on behalf of the 
investment pool's lenders. B of A received $286.7 million for the package; all 
of that will go to pay investment loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's sale of the Fannie Mae derivatives significantly reduces the 
exposure of its remaining $4.53-billion portfolio to adverse changes in 
interest rates, Hayes said. After the sale, every percentage point rise in 
rates will reduce the portfolio's value $145 million. That figure was $220 
million a week ago and $300 million on Dec. 13, when the portfolio liquidation 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale also reduces the percentage of derivatives in the portfolio to a 
little more than 75%, down from nearly 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said the latest sale kept the county on track to hold its loss on the 
portfolio to $2.02 billion, or 27% of the investors' principal. But he 
cautioned that the holdings are still far too exposed to interest rate-related 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If interest rates move higher, the county could still lose money," Hayes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Fannie Mae notes included some of its more elaborately structured 
"inverse floaters" -- securities designed to pay higher yields as market 
interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rates this year have risen sharply, and the dividend payouts on the 
securities plummeted. For one Fannie Mae note on which the county held $100 
million as recently as Nov. 23, the interest paid plunged from 7% in February 
to 3.93% in November. The payout on another Fannie Mae note in the portfolio 
was based on an arcane measurement of rates in the German currency market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and officials at Salomon Bros., the county's financial advisory firm, 
originally believed that their best chance of unloading such exotica might lie 
in returning the notes to their issuers in a swap for more conventional, less 
volatile notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fannie Mae agreed to take the notes for cash, possibly because the agency 
is increasingly sensitive to the need to assist buyers of its more volatile 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best possible solution for all parties," Hayes said. "We got cash 
proceeds rather than another security to market." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining to be sold are $1.12 billion in conventional securities and $3.41 
billion in derivatives. The county owes $1.24 billion to lenders and other 
holders of collateral, according to the latest portfolio status report provided 
by Salomon Bros.

 Chris Harris, whose arduous gavel-to-gavel coverage of the first Rodney G. 
King beating trial helped KTTV win Peabody and duPont Columbia awards for 
community service while making him Broadcast Journalist of the Year for the Los 
Angeles chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 51 when he died Wednesday night at his Newbury Park home of a heart 
condition that first became dramatically evident in June, 1992, when he 
suffered an attack while on the air for "Fox News at 10." The anchorman 
underwent quadruple-bypass surgery but later returned to the air and most 
recently had been a senior correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the attack his doctors speculated that his two-month, 
16-hour-a-day coverage of the King trial had contributed to his health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said after the trial that the ordeal "was the high point of my career. 
I wouldn't change any of the stuff I did or we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Awards were not new for Harris, even before his work on the King case. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nominated for a local Emmy for coverage of the Universal Studios fire 
in 1990 and again for KTTV's team coverage of the 1993 Southland blazes. As a 
reporter he had won two Los Angeles Emmys for spot news reporting on a 1985 
schoolyard shooting and the 1987 Cerritos plane crash. He also earned Golden 
Mike awards for documentaries dealing with drug trafficking and a five-part 
series on transvestites. 
</P>
<P>
 He also covered the John DeLorean drug trafficking case and the McMartin child 
molestation trials. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined KTTV in 1981 as a reporter and anchored the weeknight Fox news from 
November, 1990, to May, 1993. Earlier he had worked for KHJ Channel 9 (now 
KCAL) in Los Angeles, winning two Emmy awards there for best news reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Los Angeles from Sacramento, where he had worked for two TV 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris told The Times in 1992 that local news was "the most fun . . . it's 
where you really connect with a community because you're part of it. . . . I 
invest in the community and the community invests in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Martha, three sons and his mother.

JULIE HAYDON; ACTRESS ACHIEVED FAME IN 'GLASS MENAGERIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Haydon, whose poignant portrayal of the crippled Laura in Tennessee 
Williams "The Glass Menagerie" turned her into a star and the playwright into 
an enduring literary presence, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported in its Thursday editions that Miss Haydon -- who 
never again achieved the fame showered on her after Laura -- was 84. She died 
Saturday in La Crosse, Wis., of abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, 
executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon had married the drama 
critic -- 28 years her senior -- in 1955. He died in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been a stage actress since 1927, appearing with Shakespearean 
companies and other drama troupes around the country. But it was not until 
"Menagerie" opened in Chicago in 1944 (it moved to Broadway a year later) that 
Miss Haydon -- daughter of the publisher of a country weekly newspaper and his 
wife, a music critic -- attracted shining notices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the play marked the return to the theater of the famous Laurette 
Taylor, who portrayed Laura's dominant mother (a character based on Williams' 
own mother), Miss Haydon was singled out for her stage presence as the shy, 
forlorn Laura. Williams said he patterned her character's personality on his 
sister's. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Haydon had made her film debut in 1931 in "The Great Meadow," been seen 
in several early film Westerns and supplied Fay Wray's horrifying scream in 
"King Kong." Another featured role had been as the eldest sister in "Andy Hardy 
Gets Spring Fever" in 1939, one of the early Hardy Family pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other stage credits, both on and off Broadway, included the prostitute in 
William Saroyan's "The Time of Your Life," Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees," 
"Springboard to Nowhere" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965-66 she toured the country in "Menagerie," this time as Amanda, the 
mother always trying to find her handicapped daughter a "gentleman caller."  
</P>
<P>
 Miss Haydon remained delicate looking and fair-haired, with the earthy 
gentleness that endured her to audiences, well into old age. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nathan's death she continued her stage career, primarily on college 
campuses and in community theaters. She published two books based on the 
writings of the legendary critic and author: "George Jean Nathan, Realm of a 
Critic" and "Profiles of a Critic."  
</P>
<P>
 She also wrote a book, "Every Dog Has Its Day," and wrote magazine articles on 
the actors she had worked with over the years, including Laurette Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently she had been actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa 
in Winona, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 A sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler, survives.

IMMIGRANT SCAM OPERATOR GETS 2ND JAIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Alhambra woman previously convicted of running a fraudulent immigration 
services business was sentenced Thursday to three years in County Jail for 
violating probation by resuming the scam, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo-Li V. Gregor, 48, ran a business that sold Chinese immigrants documents 
that purported to be green cards and work visas, according to Los Angeles 
Deputy City Atty.Greg Parham. But those documents were worthless, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregor advertised her services in the local Chinese-language press and had 
offices in Alhambra and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Gregor was sentenced to one year in jail after being convicted of 
immigration fraud. Authorities said she was released after serving four months 
because of overcrowding at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gregor's probation required that she refrain from working as an 
immigration consultant, prosecutors claimed that shortly after her release 
Gregor again began advertising her business. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said document fraud is a significant problem in immigrant 
communities because of ignorance about U.S. laws.

MASS RESIGNATION IN BANGLADESH IS BID TO FORCE PREMIER FROM OFFICE; POLITICS: 
STRIKE SHUTS DOWN CAPITAL AFTER 147 OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS QUIT. STANDOFF HAS 
PARALYZED PARLIAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, reborn parliamentary democracy in Bangladesh, one of the world's 
poorest and most densely populated countries, has been plunged into crisis by 
the mass resignation of the opposition from Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest, most desperate bid by hostile lawmakers to force Prime 
Minister Khaleda Zia from office. For 10 months, opposition parties had been 
boycotting proceedings in the chamber, accusing Zia and her Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party of vote-rigging and corruption, and demanding that she quit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, an anti-government strike virtually shut down the major cities of 
the low-lying country on the Bay of Bengal. Militants marched by the thousands 
through the streets of the capital, Dhaka, to demand Zia's ouster. Shops and 
banks closed for eight hours, and cars, trucks and rickshaws stayed off the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a manifestation of an increasingly common style of political struggle 
that Bangladesh can ill afford. Each day of a general strike costs the country 
an estimated $50 million in lost production -- equivalent to the annual wages 
of 250,000 Bangladeshis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh, home to 122 
million people, is in the throes of economic reforms that include the 
liberalization of government regulations and the energetic wooing of foreign 
capital. Zia, elected in 1991, has voiced fears that the persistent political 
turmoil is torpedoing her government's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic no-win situation for the country," Mahfuz Anam, editor of 
the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper, said. "Right now, the people are 
despondent." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, in an attempt to force the 50-year-old Zia's hand, 147 of 
the 154 opposition members resigned from the 330-seat Parliament. Their 
supporters plan three more nationwide strikes next week, further imperiling the 
economy and the legitimacy of Zia, the second leader in Bangladesh's brief but 
tumultuous history to have been elected freely and fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very unfortunate and shows the failure of both government and 
opposition," said Serajul Islam Choudhury, a professor at the University of 
Dhaka. "The government has failed to govern the country. . . . But the 
opposition also has not behaved in a very responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition leader Hasina Wajed of the Awami League claims it is the prime 
minister who constitutes the danger. "Our struggle is a fundamental one," she 
said recently. "We want to restore the people's right to choose a government by 
free exercise of franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers think the struggle has become first and foremost a clash of the 
steel wills of Zia -- widow of a Bangladeshi military ruler and president -- 
and of the fiery-tongued Wajed -- daughter of the country's first president. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the opposition began boycotting Parliament on March 1, when a minister 
made a crack impugning their Muslim credentials, the breach became irreparable 
when the government apparently used vote-rigging to win a parliamentary 
by-election. Zia's enemies demanded that she step down. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff has paralyzed the Parliament, leading to the delay of important 
laws. The economic impact has been calamitous, with the Metropolitan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry estimating that political strife since Zia came to office 
has cost the nation's business community more than $250 million.  
</P>
<P>
 A 40-day mediation mission to the former British possession by a Commonwealth 
mediator, Sir Ninian Stephen, flopped last month. Stephen, an Australian, left 
Dhaka saying the suspicion and mistrust were too intense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning independence from Pakistan in a 1971 blood bath, overwhelmingly 
Muslim Bangladesh has experienced two military takeovers, 19 reported coup 
attempts and two assassinations of supreme leaders. Parliamentary democracy was 
restored in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In an eleventh-hour search for a compromise on Wednesday, the government and 
the loose opposition coalition of Wajed's Awami League, the fundamentalist 
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jatiya Party almost closed a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Zia drastically altered her stance to say she was ready to step down 30 days 
before the next scheduled election in 1996, sources in Dhaka said. Power would 
have been vested in the hands of a temporary caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Zia reportedly balked when her opponents refused to accept an 
additional demand that they promise not to organize strikes or other forms of 
political protest before people go to the polls. The opposition lawmakers then 
tendered their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangladesh's government now faces a tough choice upon which its survival may 
depend. Zia's party, which controls 54% of the parliamentary seats, is entitled 
by law to remain in office until the lawmakers' five-year terms expire in 1996. 
So Zia is not obligated to call an early general election, as the opposition 
now is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But if she does not, she would have to hold 147 partial elections within the 
next three months to replace the legislators who resigned. If she does that, 
the opposition has made it clear that it will try to disrupt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Zia publicly repeated on Thursday the offer to leave office a month early. In 
exchange, she asked opposition lawmakers to reconsider their resignations. But 
Wajed insisted that the president dissolve Parliament immediately to prepare 
for elections.

ALGERIA ADMITS SECURITY LAPSE IN HIJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Algeria promised to fix a security lapse that allowed four hijackers to take 
control of an Air France jetliner, but wary foreign firms were not taking any 
chances Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of a French tanker refused to enter an Algerian port, French 
passenger transport links have been cut, a Spanish airline has canceled 
flights, and insurers in London were considering putting Algeria on a war-risk 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Muslim militants, wearing the uniforms of airport workers, penetrated the 
Algiers airport on Christmas Eve, skirting security measures in place since 
nine people were killed in a 1992 bomb attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport limits access to people with tickets, police check passengers with 
metal detectors, and baggage is scanned and searched. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere, government spokesman Ahmed Attaf acknowledged, the process 
broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lapses and failures in the exercise of responsibilities," Attaf 
was quoted as saying in Algerian newspapers. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers executed three passengers before flying to Marseilles, where 
commandos stormed the jet Monday, killing all four hijackers and freeing the 
remaining 170 hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking was claimed by the Armed Islamic Group, which is also blamed for 
the deaths of many of the 75 foreigners slain since September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third hijacking this year from the Algiers airport. The others 
ended peacefully when the hijackers surrendered in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim extremists have been fighting to install Islamic rule since elections 
that fundamentalists were sure to win were canceled in January, 1992.

EX-ENVOY OAKLEY TO PAY $5,000 FINE IN AIRLINE LOBBYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ambassador Robert B. Oakley, State Department counterterrorism chief 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration, agreed Thursday to pay a $5,000 civil 
fine to settle allegations that he improperly lobbied the U.S. government on 
behalf of Lebanon's airline. 
</P>
<P>
 While head of the counterterrorism office in 1985, Oakley played a role in 
Reagan's decision to prohibit Middle East Airlines from flying to or from the 
United States. The ban, still in effect, was imposed because Beirut 
International Airport -- where the airline is based -- was frequently a 
departure point for terrorists, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the State Department in 1992, Oakley and his company, C&O 
Resources, were hired by the airline to help persuade the government to lift 
the ban. In that capacity, Oakley made written and oral presentations to 
government officials that year and the next on the airline's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal conflict of interest law bars former officials for life from trying 
to influence government action on a matter in which they participated 
personally and substantially while in government. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley was paid $100,000 in fees by the airline over two years, some of it for 
"improper lobbying activities," according to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley's lawyer, Joel Cohen, denied that his client's activities constituted 
improper lobbying. He noted that the $100,000 was divided between C&O Resources 
and another unnamed firm that Oakley brought in as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said Oakley paid the fine "to resolve the matter and let him go along 
with his life." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court filings in the case, Oakley told U.S. government officials 
whom he contacted that he was representing Middle East Airlines and he did not 
recommend lifting the ban unless Middle East Airlines and the Beirut 
International Airport significantly improved security. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, Oakley agreed not to seek or accept any 
indemnification for the fine and waived for himself or his company any "success 
fee" provided for if the ban on the airline were lifted by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley also served as ambassador to Pakistan and as special envoy to Somalia.

UCI STUDY TIES INFANT-KILLING DISEASE TO GENE; MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS HOPE THE 
RESULTS WILL HELP IMPROVE DIAGNOSES AND LEAD TO TREATMENTS FOR SPINAL MUSCULAR 
ATROPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine researchers report that they have identified a genetic abnormality 
they believe causes spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of 
death in infants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long-anticipated finding that should quickly improve accuracy in 
diagnosis of the forms of SMA," said Donald S. Wood, director of science 
technology for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. "Most important, it will accelerate 
our continuing search for a form of treatment for SMA." 
</P>
<P>
 No treatment now exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder, which in its most severe form is uniformly fatal before the age 
of 2, affects about 20,000 Americans, including between 200 and 300 currently 
in Orange County, making it the second most common lethal genetic disorder 
after cystic fibrosis. It affects one in 10,000 births, but about one in 40 
adults carries the defective gene. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification of the gene is reported by a team led by UC Irvine 
molecular biologist John J. Wasmuth in the January issue of the journal Nature 
Genetics, released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth said Thursday that discovery will allow couples with a family history 
of the disease to determine if their offspring would have a likelihood of being 
stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples can now have a prenatal test that can determine fairly accurately 
whether another child will have the disease," said Wasmuth, 48, a Mission Viejo 
resident whose team has been working on this project for about three years. He 
estimated the accuracy of the testing at about 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be to develop a test that identifies carriers of the gene, 
Wasmuth said. Unfortunately, "most people don't know they are a carrier until 
they have a child who dies from the disease," Wasmuth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wasmuth called the finding a "very, very big step," he said 
discovering a cure for SMA is still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is only a first step. It really says nothing about a cure," Wasmuth said. 
"When we completely understand what goes wrong in the disease, we might be able 
to do something to correct the abnormality." 
</P>
<P>
 His team believes that the disorder is caused by the loss of segments of a 
gene called XS2G3 on chromosome 5, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that make 
up the human genetic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 They studied DNA from 29 patients with the most severe form of the disease, 
called Type I SMA, and compared it to DNA from 235 healthy people. They found 
that 17 of the 29 patients were missing fragments of XS2G3 in both copies of 
the gene (one from each parent). In contrast, only two of the 235 healthy 
people -- both of them known carriers of the disorder -- were missing fragments 
of the gene, and only in one copy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s Wood speculated that fragments are missing in 
all 29 patients but that researchers were unable to detect them in 12 cases 
because of the extreme complexity of that area of chromosome 5. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that several other teams are expected to report soon on research that 
may verify the UC Irvine team's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four distinct forms of SMA, varying in severity. Each are 
degenerative in nature, affecting the nerve cells of the spinal cord and 
preventing them from working properly, Wasmuth said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the disease progresses, all muscle function eventually is lost, including 
the diaphragm, and children typically die from suffocation, Wasmuth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signals are not sent to the muscle cells properly, and the cells then 
begin to waste and degenerate," Wasmuth said.  
</P>
<P>
 Type I, known as Werdnig-Hoffman disease, is characterized by generalized 
muscle weakness, trouble swallowing and sucking, breathing distress and 
paralysis of legs and arms within three months after birth. It is usually fatal 
by age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 It made headlines in the sports world last spring when the 9-month-old son of 
California Angels pitcher Mark Leiter died on the opening day of the season of 
the Type I version, considered the most severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Type II strikes in the first 6 months to 3 years and is usually fatal during 
childhood. Types III and IV strike later in life. Although they are crippling, 
they do not affect life span. The researchers speculate that the severity of 
the disease is controlled by the amount of material missing from the gene.

 Other members of the team included molecular biologists Arthur H. M. Burghes 
of Ohio State University and Louise R. Simard of the Hopital Sainte-Justine in 
Montreal.

DANA PARSONS: THE GOING GETS TOUGH FOR EASYGOING COUNTY LABOR UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

<TEXT>
<P>
 The association representing 11,000 Orange County employees is 57 years old. 
You could call it a union, but it doesn't mind if you don't. You've probably 
never heard of its leaders. It has never gone on strike. It has snubbed 
overtures to affiliate with larger unions. It doesn't call news conferences to 
vent against management. It's been about as visible as Casper and just about as 
friendly. While metropolitan-area unions in other parts of the country have 
historically viewed their management counterparts with suspicion, the Orange 
County association has seen its as partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Employees Assn. now is wondering whether it's been played 
for suckers. All of a sudden, the "in-your-face" tactics of the traditional 
big-city unions may not sound like such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the association isn't worrying about hurt feelings with 
the county of Orange. The county's decision to rescind part of its contract 
with the union -- so that it can expedite employee layoffs after the bond 
market fiasco -- has the association furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shocks you into an awareness of what people can do to other people," 
association General Manager John H. Sawyer said Thursday. 'We had such a 
trusting relationship, and we now find that destroyed. Even between 
individuals, when that happens, it's a very destructive kind of thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer didn't have to think long when asked if there's been anything like this 
in the association's history with the county: "Never anything even close." At 
most, he said, employees have taken one-day actions to protest something here 
or there, but never with this level of rancor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years, the OCEA has always been very protective of the rights of 
its members," Sawyer said, "but it thought the most effective way to do that 
was to be cooperative and supportive of county government and management. 
Throughout all these years, we've worked very successfully with that theme in 
mind. Our board has always insisted we handle ourselves like ladies and 
gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, the association learned that the county was invoking an 
"immediate emergency" and rescinding the parts of its negotiated agreement that 
involve layoffs. Sawyer points out that the contract provides for layoffs in 
certain situations but that the county has circumvented those provisions and 
didn't come to the association to make its case. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional big-city labor supporters would chuckle over any employees 
association being so historically trusting toward its employers. But labor 
strength is bolstered by public support -- a major stumbling block in Southern 
California. And the truth is that even many of the association's rank-and-file 
and board members will never be mistaken for Samuel Gompers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, we're in conservative Orange County," said another association 
official. "There isn't a lot of support for labor organizations, so we just 
felt it was more beneficial (over the years) to have a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, though, the union actually liked county government. "We just get 
along," Sawyer said, "and the groups have just liked each other over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now the union considers itself "fighting for our lives," Sawyer said. While 
not attributing the motive to Orange County, he noted that "in some parts of 
the country, private corporations have gone into bankruptcy because that's a 
convenient way of throwing out the union contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The union plans to sue the county. It has sued the county before, but without 
rancor and mainly to protect its interests or to force a legal opinion. This 
will be different, Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the outset, county employees had the attitude of being cooperative with 
management," Sawyer said. "They regretted the situation and were grieving that 
bad things were happening, but they were supportive of management. This has 
turned into an attitude of almost shock and hostility now against the county 
for canceling their contract. If it doesn't abide by its agreements with its 
employees, how are the people on Wall Street and the banks who deal with them 
on big money issues going to feel about the sanctity of their contracts with 
the county?" 
</P>
<P>
 In another place and another time, a union would try to shut down an operation 
if it felt this aggrieved. The prospect of management blowing the public's nest 
egg and then laying off employees to make up for it would strike the public as 
inherently unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 But with no history of playing hardball, you wonder whether the local 
employees association is up to it. Will it have to be content with just 
learning a lesson about trust? 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer sounds as if he's already learned it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the very best, county employees are going to be very wary from here on," 
he said. "At worst, this hostility will exist until the last current employee 
is long gone from the county." 
</P>

DEADLINE EXTENDED ON AGENT ORANGE CLAIMS BY VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THAO HUA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Edward W. Medvit of Anaheim, the Vietnam War isn't over. Every day, he 
experiences pain he believes was caused by Agent Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 21, Medvit joined thousands of veterans filing last-minute claims for 
compensation from the Agent Orange Settlement Fund, which was set up by seven 
companies responsible for manufacturing the chemical defoliant the United 
States used during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to apply for compensation, originally set for midnight Saturday, 
was extended Thursday by a U.S. District Court judge to Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Vietnam War veterans have been inundating insurance company phone 
lines to claim their share of $22 million left in the fund, which was 
established in 1985 with $184 million. About 40,000 U.S. veterans and their 
families have received money from the fund since the program began sending out 
checks in 1989, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medvit hopes to receive a portion of that money to help pay his medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old veteran served as a chief petty officer from 1964 to 1971 in 
the Mekong Delta, where Agent Orange was widely used to kill vegetation so that 
it would be difficult for the enemy to hide and find food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever told us what that was," Medvit said. "All they ever put on the 
drums (of chemicals) were serial numbers. We thought it was to kill the bugs in 
the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 About six years after then-President Richard Nixon ordered the troops back 
home, Medvit began breaking out in severe rashes that his doctor couldn't 
explain. Recurrent internal infections required surgery to remove 80% of his 
stomach, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Post-traumatic stress syndrome hit him "like firecrackers."  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't go into movie theaters," he said. "The kids would be eating 
popcorn, and I would hear a round going off."  
</P>
<P>
 Maria Martinez, administrator for Aetna Insurance Company, which is in charge 
of distributing the fund, said that, too, is a symptom of Agent Orange 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Medvit quit working for the Veterans Administration in Montana 
because of the illnesses. Medvit now lives on Social Security benefits and "a 
lot of medications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aetna decides in his favor, Medvit will receive a lump sum anywhere from 
$256 to $12,800, depending on factors such as how long he might have been 
exposed to Agent Orange, according to Aetna statistics. Veterans' survivors who 
also have been affected by Agent Orange usually receive from $340 to $3,400. 
</P>
<P>
 To be considered for the payments, Vietnam veterans must be disabled and 
unemployable for at least the past year, be under the age of 60 and have served 
in Vietnam between 1961 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in New York said Thursday that he was 
extending the deadline because of the large number of applications submitted in 
recent weeks and because of a flood of inquiries this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein established the fund as part of a settlement reached after veterans 
brought a class-action lawsuit against the makers of Agent Orange. Participants 
are Dow Chemical, Uniroyal, Monsanto, Hercules, Agricultural Nutrition, Diamond 
Shamrock and Thompson Chemical.  
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who might have suffered from Agent Orange will be filing a claim, 
said Jim Shaffer, a post commander for Veterans of Foreign Wars who served in 
Vietnam for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're already dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer, who will not be filing a claim, said a good friend of his died from 
cancer of the blood, which has been linked to Agent Orange. His friend, Dennis 
Russell, served in Vietnam for two years where Agent Orange was used. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not here with us today because of that stuff," Shaffer said. "And 
nobody will have to pay for it, except him." 
</P>

OFFICE TO STAY IN USE DESPITE SEISMIC RISK; SAFETY: STATE ORDERED ITS DOWNTOWN 
GARAGE CLOSED, BUT A CALTRANS BUILDING RATED AT THE SAME HAZARD LEVEL WILL 
REMAIN OPEN PENDING RETROFITTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While state officials earlier this week ordered a Downtown parking garage shut 
because of concerns that it could collapse in an earthquake, they chose not to 
close a nearby Caltrans office annex with 800 workers that is officially rated 
as posing the same risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has triggered outrage among some who work in the Caltrans 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is a Fiat convertible more important than a human life?" asked D.T. (Doc) 
Maloney, chief of Caltrans' office of business management. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue raises a question about the inexact science of quake-proofing 
buildings across the state: How do officials decide which facilities should be 
shut? During a time of scarce state funds, how much risk is acceptable? 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say the answers entail an elaborate balancing of various 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like driving on the freeway," said Joel McRonald, head of 
seismic safety for the state architect's office. "The state says the acceptable 
risk of driving on city freeways is no more than 55 m.p.h. So 65 or 90 m.p.h. 
are unacceptable but still, a lot of people do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Caltrans office annex and the state employee parking garage were both on a 
list of the 20 most seismically unsafe state buildings in California released 
in April. Both were assigned the same grade of unacceptable risk. But the 
office annex at 120 S. Spring St. was kept open because Caltrans officials 
expect to begin retrofitting the 37-year-old building by February, as employees 
continue working there. 
</P>
<P>
 McRonald said his office did not shut the office annex because no earthquake 
is considered imminent, and it would be too costly and inconvenient "to move 
the employees elsewhere during the short period (while) the retrofit is done." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials ordered the 905-car garage at 145 S. Broadway shut after today 
when a structural engineer found that the facility could collapse from shaking 
during an earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 A building next door, the Junipero Serra State Office Building at 107 S. 
Broadway, although rated as a possible failure in a severe earthquake, is being 
kept open without retrofitting because it is considered stronger than either 
the Caltrans annex or the parking garage.  
</P>
<P>
 State officials rated the state garage and the Caltrans annex as "Category 6" 
buildings on a risk scale of 1 to 7, with 1 indicating the safest structures 
and 7 indicating that a severe quake would pose "imminent threat to occupants," 
according to a report by the office of the state architect. The Serra building 
was rated 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The report lists no Category 7 buildings. It does, however, list seven 
Category 6 structures, located in Los Angeles, Norco, Norwalk and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a severe quake, Category 6 buildings would cause "extensive but not 
imminent" risk to occupants, whose extrication would be "protracted and 
difficult," according to the report. These buildings would suffer extensive 
structural damage and are likely to collapse, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report on the 20 most unsafe state buildings in California, 
"these buildings should receive the state's immediate and highest priority for 
correction of seismic deficiencies by retrofitting and/or replacement. These 
few buildings . . . have been determined to have the highest potential risk to 
life safety." 
</P>
<P>
 However, with little funding available to retrofit or replace these 
facilities, little has been done except for shutting the garage and planning 
the retrofitting of the Caltrans annex, a $4.5-million project that is expected 
to take 90 days, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Caltrans, officials hired structural engineers last spring to inspect their 
main Los Angeles building and the slightly newer, more problematic annex. Based 
on those findings, Caltrans decided to proceed with retrofitting as an interim 
measure to strengthen the annex, making it significantly safer for workers 
until a planned move to a new facility within five years, Caltrans official 
Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report on unsafe government buildings has placed state officials in the 
uncomfortable position of having publicly identified potential problem 
buildings without necessarily having the money to fix them, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are stuck between a rock and a hard place," Maloney said. "They came up 
with a report and may not be able to deal with the outcome. . . . It's a real 
mind-boggling task." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Baxter, who recently stepped down as director of Caltrans, said he 
fought to get funding for retrofitting as soon as he learned in February of the 
annex's status. The money was finally allocated from Caltrans' budget earlier 
this month -- after Baxter's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baxter -- now a deputy director for construction management at the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- learned that the Downtown parking 
garage had been shut while the Caltrans building would remain open, he was 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found the garage was in so much jeopardy they closed it down, when we've 
got a building full of people that's an equal hazard and that's still there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved $250 million in bonds in 1990 to strengthen state buildings -- 
a measure requiring the seismic evaluation of the state's 14,000 buildings. 
Today, half have been inspected. Of those, 106 were viewed as questionable 
enough to warrant structural engineers' closer investigation, McRonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, last summer the Legislature refused to approve appropriation of the 
$200 million in bond money that remained available -- an action that halted 
progress on other buildings, said Kevin Eckery, deputy secretary of the state 
Consumer Services Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 "It left a lot of the state employees at risk," McRonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 McRonald noted that there is no requirement for such inspections in the 
private sector. "I'm sure if they used the similar type of methodology we've 
utilized, you would find there are many (private) buildings around the state 
that are deficient." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, McRonald cited a Times Mirror parking garage, examined for 
possible rental for state employees who could no longer park at the South 
Broadway facility. He said engineers concluded that the private structure posed 
as much risk as the one officials ordered shut.

DISCORD SURROUNDS COUNCILMAN HARMONY; POLITICS: CRITICS ARE MOUNTING RECALL 
EFFORT OVER ALLEGED PHYSICAL AND VERBAL ATTACKS. HE SAYS HE WAS ONLY DEFENDING 
HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With his quaint name, genteel demeanor and neatly trimmed mustache, Diamond 
Bar City Councilman Clair Harmony seems to have just stepped out of a 
barbershop quartet.  
</P>
<P>
 But to hear his critics tell it, Harmony may be better suited for the boxing 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest round of insults and recriminations among officials of the small 
San Gariel Valley city, the first-term councilman was served last week with his 
second recall notice for alleged abuses that include physical assaults on 
citizens and other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony said the recall campaign is an attempt to derail his investigation of 
what he calls "an Orange County-style financial debacle" in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But recall proponents and other council members say Harmony, 54, has shown a 
pattern of violent behavior that is out of place for a public official. Members 
of the recall campaign charge that during several fits of rage in and out of 
City Hall, Harmony body-slammed Councilwoman Phyllis Papen, picked fistfights 
with Councilmen Gary Miller and Gary Werner, and struck a citizen with a 
sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Harmony nor the other council members deny that the fights took place; 
they just disagree over who started them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's irrational, he's abusive and he's dangerous," Miller said. "There's a 
place they used to put people like that, and it's not on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges have been filed as a result of the alleged attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive against Harmony is the third attempt to recall a council member 
since Diamond Bar, a city of 55,000 mostly affluent residents near Pomona, was 
founded five years ago. A recall campaign this year against council members 
Papen and Miller on grounds of financial conflict of interest failed when the 
number of signatures gathered fell just short of the amount needed. A later 
attempt to recall Harmony and Councilwoman Eileen Ansari over their votes on 
development never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony said he is confident that the recent accusations against him will be 
proved false. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all lies and misinformation," Harmony said. "These people have 
drawn their ranks together because I have exposed their whole operation as a 
good old boy network." 
</P>
<P>
 Once organizers formally begin their campaign in January, they will have 120 
days to qualify the recall for the ballot by gathering signatures of 6,000 
registered Diamond Bar voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall notice against Harmony cites a long list of complaints, including 
an unauthorized endorsement on city stationery of Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher 
(I-Diamond Bar). But topping the list are the allegations of physical and 
verbal assaults on citizens, city staff and three council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's conceivable that Mr. Harmony could have a violent disagreement with a 
single person," said Nick Anis, a former City Council candidate and supporter 
of the recall effort. "But to have it with five people: women, private 
citizens, council members; kicking, shoving, punching, coming after people with 
sledgehammers, choking someone -- is beyond reason. This man's a bully and a 
maniac." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony maintains that he never provoked a fight, and only defended himself. 
He said the accusations of violence are retaliation for his efforts to correct 
what he said is a corrupt city accounting system. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Harmony released a report on the city's finances that documented 
what he said were "literally tens of thousands of dollars being spent without 
council authority and public review, companies hired without bids (and) regular 
budget overspending . . . in once case by as much as 171%." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Harmony's criticisms were confirmed by an independent auditing firm. 
However, the firm also found "no material weaknesses" in the city's accounting 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights occurred in a particularly venomous political climate in which 
Diamond Bar council members and their constituents routinely accuse each other 
of everything from incompetence to extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The first confrontation involving Harmony occurred in October, 1993, when 
Diamond Bar resident Scott Lovell said he found several of Harmony's campaign 
signs on a city street and -- believing they were abandoned plywood -- loaded 
them on the back of his truck.  
</P>
<P>
 Harmony, who said many of his signs had been stolen during that campaign, said 
he approached Lovell and began trying to pull the signs out with a 
sledgehammer. Lovell said a struggle ensued in which Harmony struck him on the 
hand with the hammer.  
</P>
<P>
 But court records cite several witnesses who said Lovell appeared to be the 
aggressor, and that he choked Harmony, pushed him onto a car and kicked him in 
the groin area. Lovell admitted in testimony that he kicked Harmony in the 
groin but said he did so to push him away. The officer who took Lovell's 
complaint against Harmony said there was no visible injury to his hand. Lovell 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovell was charged with petty theft for attempting to steal Harmony's signs, 
and was found not guilty. He sued Harmony for defamation for publishing false 
accusations against him in a newsletter. The case was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrangle with Miller took place early in the year during a closed City 
Council session that Harmony said involved litigation against Papen and Miller. 
A dispute between Miller and Harmony erupted into a nose-to-nose argument, and 
ended with Miller hurling Harmony across the conference table and off the other 
end, according to both men's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony said he was the one assaulted in that case, but Miller said Harmony 
provoked his action. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody gets three inches from your face and is bumping you with their 
chest, and you ask them three times to step back, you remove them," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari, who so far has remained outside the fray, was at the meeting when the 
fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was equal, to tell you the truth," the councilwoman said. "What 
(Harmony) was doing was badgering Gary Miller, so both of them got up at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not a one-time event, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clair has a tendency, when he gets angry, to get in people's space," she 
said. "I think that when you become a councilperson you have to curtail your 
anger a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, Councilwoman Papen said, Harmony slammed his body against 
her during an argument in City Hall until staff members intervened. She refused 
to disclose the nature of the conversation, saying it was private. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Werner said he witnessed the confrontation. Shortly after, during a 
meeting between city officials and visiting Chinese officials across the 
street, Werner said, Harmony asked him to go outside. An argument followed. 
Werner said Harmony, whom he described as being upset over his conversation 
with Papen, pulled on his jacket and tie until Werner slugged him in the chest 
to stop him.  
</P>
<P>
 Harmony tells a different version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Werner struck me twice," he said. "I grabbed his arm to stabilize him and 
hold him away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Capt. Larry Waldie said there were no charges filed, or even reports 
of any of the incidents involving council members. Werner and Harmony said they 
discussed the incident with Waldie, who persuaded them not to file reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the sheriff's office, and was going to file a report, but he said 
that because (Harmony) would just file one, the two would cancel each other 
out, and it would make the city look silly," Werner said.

ROBOTIC EYE TO WATCH SIMPSON TRIAL; COURTS: A UNIQUE, REMOTE-CONTROLLED STILL 
CAMERA IS INSTALLED IN THE COURTROOM. IT WILL GIVE NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS A CLOSER SHOT OF THE ACTION.

 Borrowing a little from NASA -- and a lot from Nintendo -- they rolled out a 
news-reporting robot Thursday in a Downtown Los Angeles courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a one-of-a-kind, remote-controlled news camera that will chronicle the J. 
Simpson murder trial for newspaper and magazine readers throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual camera was bolted to the wall of Judge Lance Ito's ninth-floor 
courtroom and connected by wires to video game-style joysticks that newspaper 
photographers will operate from the hallway outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The device will get press photographers -- known for noisy cameras and loud 
shirts -- out of the of the way of jurors as opening arguments in the trial 
draw closer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the remote-controlled camera works, experts in newsrooms and courtrooms 
alike say similar robots could start popping up at high-profile trials 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Remote-controlled television cameras have been used for years for surveillance 
work in places such as parking lots and Las Vegas casinos. But until now there 
has never been equipment that could remotely aim and click pictures with a 
still camera that uses a 36-exposure roll of film. 
</P>
<P>
 Local newspaper photographers say they got the idea for their remote camera 
from television technicians who installed a remotely run video camera near the 
front of Ito's courtroom. The still photographers had been given permission 
only to shoot pictures from the back of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ito himself who suggested a robot camera. He told photographers that he 
had seen a remote-control photo device, used for wildlife surveillance, 
mentioned in an outdoors catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographers built a soundproof box from pieces of an underwater camera 
housing and a used telephoto lens case. They rented the joystick equipment and 
tiny motors that will move the camera and its auto-focus zoom lens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A finger-size video camera stuck to the rear of the boxed camera's viewfinder 
shows the operator in the hallway what the camera is aiming at. But the 
photographer at the joystick has to be judicious when it comes to snapping 
pictures: After the 36-exposure roll is gone, film cannot be changed until the 
court goes into recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot 30 rolls of film just at the first preliminary hearing alone," said 
Richard Mackson, a Sports Illustrated photographer who helped build the device, 
as he watched Associated Press photographer Reed Saxon operate the joysticks 
for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Hom, a Times photo editor, said some photographers fear that a robot 
camera could replace human news photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Nelson, a photographer for Agence France-Presse, agreed, saying, "If 
it works, they'll use it for other cases and kick us out. It could lessen our 
access to the courtroom." But in the Simpson trial, the robot will give 
newspaper readers a perspective they would otherwise miss. As long as Ito -- 
and the robot -- don't object. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it starts smoking, turn it off right away," counseled Ron Taniwaki, a 
Nikon representative who helped install it Thursday.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; THOUGH 
BEHIND BARS, NOLAN KEEPS IN TOUCH; POLITICS: EX-GOP ASSEMBLY LEADER CONVICTED 
OF RACKETEERING PUBLISHES A PERSONAL NEWSLETTER AND ADVISES CAMPAIGNS BY PHONE.

 Not long before he went to prison for political corruption last March, former 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan defiantly told a crowd of supporters at a Burbank hotel 
that although he would be locked up, "they are not going to shut me up." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 With a barrage of newsletters and phone calls from his prison digs, Nolan has 
stayed in close touch with Republican activists in the Glendale-Burbank area he 
formerly represented, offering political advice and divulging chatty tidbits 
about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the powerful Assembly GOP leader, Nolan is now inmate No. 06833-097 at 
the Dublin federal prison camp, east of Oakland. He is serving a 33-month 
sentence after being convicted of racketeering for taking $10,000 in campaign 
contributions from an undercover FBI agent who said he was seeking legislative 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many prisoners, Nolan has become a critic of the federal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent article in a conservative political magazine published in the San 
Fernando Valley, he attacked the government's "war on crime," saying 
prosecutors, prison builders and social workers don't really want to win it 
because they would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He called himself and other inmates at the Dublin camp victims of the crime 
war, saying they were overzealously prosecuted for "bureaucratic" crimes 
usually involving mere paperwork disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also has kept his hand in Republican politics, although his conviction 
bars him from holding state and federal elected office in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Brandstater, a GOP political consultant and longtime friend, said Nolan 
phoned him "unendingly, incessantly" when Brandstater helped run former 
prosecutor Jim Simpson's campaign to become a Glendale Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was elected in November, replacing James Rogan, who won Nolan's 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his phone tips, Nolan distributes a personal newsletter to about 1,800 
friends and supporters including lawyers, judges and city council members in 
the Glendale-Burbank area. Among the recipients are Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, state Sen. Newton R. Russell (R-Glendale) and 
former Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about how he's doing, some insights on politics, sharing the glad news 
of Republican victories, how often the kids visit him, the food at the camp," 
Brandstater said. "It's just kind of chatty and newsy and talky." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater said friends and supporters have poured $60,000 to $70,000 into a 
trust fund for Nolan's wife, Gail, and three small children to pay household 
expenses until Nolan -- an attorney who works as a clerk in the prison law 
library -- is released. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not living grandly, but they're not starving," Brandstater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was indicted on six counts of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and 
money laundering but pleaded guilty to a single count of racketeering rather 
than face a trial, which could have led to a prison sentence of up to eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed a sworn statement saying he used his Assembly office to extort 
campaign contributions in 1988 from those wanting legislative favors. But in an 
emotional speech to supporters at Burbank's Holiday Inn, he implied that the 
statement was false and he signed it only to avoid risking a much longer prison 
term that would keep him away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that despite his conviction, the energetic, outspoken Nolan is 
likely to return to politics in some capacity when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Pat says, "There's a lot of roar left in this lion,"' said Brandstater. "I 
think when he's out, he'll find a niche somewhere, in Sacramento or Los 
Angeles, and he'll still be involved in politics."

STUDENT, 20, TRUCKER DIED IN FOG; CRASH: 'THESE THINGS ALWAYS SEEM TO HAPPEN TO 
THE NICEST PEOPLE,' SAYS THE BOSS OF 34-YEAR-OLD MAN KILLED. CHP SAYS PILEUP 
OCCURRED IN TWO STAGES.

 Stacey Lynn Long loved cars -- including the Honda Civic she regularly drove 
from her father's home in Claremont to her boyfriend's apartment in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for an upcoming local auto show, she was driving the car south 
Wednesday on her way to buy new tires in Upland when a heavy fog suddenly fell 
on the Golden State Freeway in Tejon Pass. The fog triggered a massive pileup 
involving at least 30 cars and more than a dozen large trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car was hit repeatedly. Long, 20, was identified Thursday as one of the 
two people who died in the massive wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very outgoing, had an excellent sense of humor and was a very caring, 
loving person," said Robert O'Connor, a friend of the family, speaking from the 
home of Long's mother in Helendale in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who was a part-time student at Mt. San Antonio Community College in 
Walnut, shared her interest in cars with her boyfriend and stepbrother. "It's 
something they've done all the way since high school," said her stepfather, Jim 
Falk. 
</P>
<P>
 The other person killed in the pileup was Miguel Angel Leanos, 34, of Chula 
Vista, whose trailer truck slammed into the back of a milk truck. The cab of 
his truck was so badly damaged that it took rescue workers several hours to 
remove his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanos had worked for the past two years for J & J Trucking Co. of Chula 
Vista. "He was quiet," said company owner Juan Fernandez. "These things always 
seem to happen to the nicest people." 
</P>
<P>
 Leanos' wife and two children suffered only minor injuries in the crash, even 
though, according to co-workers, they were also riding in the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Thursday it could take several days to determine the exact 
sequence of events that led to the chain-reaction pileup that began about 12:30 
p.m. in Tejon Pass, about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol major accident investigation team arrived on the 
scene Wednesday evening from its Fresno headquarters to coordinate the inquiry. 
Information was still being gathered Thursday from various points across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still getting phone calls trickling in that someone was involved in the 
accident and they just couldn't remain at the scene, and they drove off," CHP 
Officer Mark Ehly said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were actually two accidents, he said. An unknown number of vehicles were 
involved in the first collision, and there was a 15-second delay before a 
second group slammed into the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about 10 cars collided on the northbound side of the freeway 
about one-half mile south of the larger collision, and several smaller 
accidents were reported on the freeway near the Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers closed all southbound lanes for about nine hours, causing a 
15-mile backup, Ehly said. The northbound side was also jammed, with motorists 
reporting delays of up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 28 people was reported injured in the collisions, although that 
number could rise because of the reports still coming in, Ehly said.

A VOW TO SERVE AND PROTECT; SLAIN PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER DIED WHILE FULFILLING 
PATRIOTIC DUTY, BROTHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robert Worley looked out from a church pulpit Thursday at hundreds of police 
officers who had come to mourn his son, a Los Angeles County Safety Police 
officer slain just days before Christmas in a gun battle with a robber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope you can join us in hope," he said at the funeral of Thomas 
Benton Worley. "Because death will not have the last word here. Life will have 
the last word here." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, police officers from all over Southern California lifted their 
hymnals in unison and belted out "On Eagles' Wings" -- a vibrant tribute to 
Thomas Worley, who had dreamed his whole life of being a police officer, and 
died living out his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 33, was shot Dec. 21 in the crowded parking lot of a Canoga Park strip 
mall after confronting Jesus Valenzuela, 44, who witnesses said had just held 
up a discount shoe store in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worley identified himself as a police officer, investigators said, 
Valenzuela shot at him. The officer returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who was off duty and not wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the 
chest and groin and died about 90 minutes later. Valenzuela, an ex-convict with 
three prior robbery convictions, was hit in the liver and died within the hour 
from internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's services at the First United Methodist Church of Santa Monica, 
family, friends and law enforcement officials sought to understand how it was 
that Worley and Valenzuela came to square off in a suburban mini-mall parking 
lot, with both ending up mortally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom is my brother and right now, as with everyone else in this room, I can 
make no sense of this," said Charles Worley, 23. "It's tugging at my ability to 
make sense of much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 What was particularly difficult to accept, mourners said, was that Worley died 
so young -- leaving a wife, Pam, 29, and two children, Christina, 6, and 
Matthew, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Pam when she walked in," said Clifton Williams, president of the 
400-member Safety Police Assn. "I saw her face and I saw all the police 
officers ever killed haunting her eyes -- it (was) all written across her 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was solace to be found, mourners said, it was in the fact that Worley 
had a lifelong passion for police work. His brother called it "a huge love in 
his heart" that elevated police work to a patriotic duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man had a love for his country I don't even begin to understand," Charles 
Worley said. From the day in grade school that he first recited the Pledge of 
Allegiance, the younger brother said, Worley "took it as a vow" to serve and 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley served as a police officer in the Air Force, worked when he got out as 
a private security guard and then, 18 months ago, was accepted into the Safety 
Police, sworn officers who provide security at such county facilities as office 
buildings and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matthew was so proud that Daddy was a policeman," said Dorothy Bimber Worley, 
an ordained minister who helped the Rev. Donald J. Shelby lead her son's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 That Wednesday evening, when Pam Worley crawled out of the Payless ShoeSource 
on all fours and whispered to her husband in the parking lot that the store was 
being robbed, Worley "had no choice" but to intervene, said Walter Gray, 
assistant director of the county's Department of Health Services, which 
oversees operations of the Safety Police. 
</P>
<P>
 At the pulpit, surrounded by Christmas trees, bouquets of flowers, a color 
photograph of his smiling and mustachioed son and the son's flag-dropped 
coffin, Robert Worley said, "Tom had a calling to law enforcement. He knew it, 
he said it, he fulfilled it. This is why Tom died. I hate it but I understand." 
</P>
<P>
 As the years go by, the father said, there will be "pain anew" each Christmas 
season. "But we must remember that he gave his life for a great cause, no less 
a cause than the age-old battle between good and evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Like-minded mourners expressed similar sentiments in a sympathy card passed 
around before the service, an oversized card featuring a Cezanne still-life of 
flowers. "Heroes never die," wrote one. 
</P>
<P>
 When the service ended, Worley was given a hero's procession to burial at a 
Chatsworth cemetery. The California Highway Patrol temporarily closed the San 
Diego and Simi Valley freeways to allow the motorcade to pass -- a single-file 
line so long it took 11 minutes to go by at highway speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief service at Oakwood Memorial Park, the chief of the Safety 
Police, Ricardo Cotwright, gave the flag on the coffin to the officer's widow. 
And, as church bells chimed in the distance, mourners turned to leave -- 
several pausing to touch the mahogany-colored coffin, heads down in prayer.

OXNARD BRACES FOR A YEAR OF CHALLENGES; GOVERNMENT: CITY FACES DECISIONS ON 
RELIEVING TRAFFIC CONGESTION, BUILDING LOW-COST HOUSING AND ADDING POLICE 
OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with balancing its budget amid pressure to fix traffic-clogged roads, 
build low-cost housing and hire more police officers, Oxnard must confront 
difficult challenges in 1995, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers are pushing plans to build everything from 5,000 residences around 
the wetlands of Ormond Beach to a massive entertainment complex in the Wagon 
Wheel area that backers hope will rival anything in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oxnard's leaders will try to relieve the congestion caused by the 
residences and retail complexes they have already allowed -- such as Shopping 
at the Rose and the Oxnard Factory Outlet -- while hoping to attract more 
businesses along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things going on," Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "We should try 
to focus on having a more livable climate and a more attractive place to do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements needed to repair Oxnard's dilapidated streets, sidewalks, 
bridges and highway interchanges are expected to cost $57 million over the next 
10 years, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a major project and I think we have to really work on it, because some 
intersections are just too crowded," Councilman Tom Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, advocates for the poor are pressing the City Council to 
build housing that low-income families can afford, citing overcrowding and 
unsanitary living conditions plaguing parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, in turn, are looking to assist developers who offer to build 
low-cost housing -- including a 716-unit project that would be built on 
farmland the city had banned from development until 2020. Residents and 
landowners in east Oxnard have vowed to start a letter-writing campaign to 
protest the project -- Channel Islands Estates -- as it moves through the 
planning process in the coming year. The builder, Affordable Homebuilders Inc. 
of Ventura, argues that the development would provide 159 low-cost houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating the affordable-housing problem, city leaders must look for a new 
solution to the plight of the 1,100 poor residents of the Oxnard Mobilehome 
Lodge, one of the county's worst slums. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council said last week it could not deliver on years of promises to 
move the trailer park residents to a housing project that had been intended for 
them. Council members said the residents -- mostly farm workers -- are too poor 
to buy houses, even with steep subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council pledged to improve living conditions for park residents by 
building new mobile homes for them or finding them another place to live. The 
new attempt to deal with the decade-old problem will begin in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's utterly impossible for someone making $20,000 a year to buy a house," 
Councilman Bedford Pinkard said. "But they are still entitled to decent 
housing."  
</P>
<P>
 Amid Oxnard's pro-growth rush, council members are considering abolishing the 
city's Planning Commission, arguing that it is slowing progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Tom Holden and Andres Herrera have said the five-member 
commission, made up of appointed city residents, is not working the way it 
should and that its purpose needs to be redefined if not scrapped altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, however, argues that the board should remain, saying it serves an 
important function by involving residents in government. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on the Planning Commission will greatly affect the way 
development is scrutinized in Oxnard. Under the proposal, a hearing officer 
would replace the commission, but critics of the plan say that person would 
have unchecked power. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's streamlining proposals -- a series of budget slashes, 
department shuffles and layoffs that have occurred in recent years -- 
apparently have put council members in a position to easily balance the city's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is expected to spend $61.4 million in the 1995-96 budget year, up from 
$60.2 million this year. But since the city will take in about $61.3 million, 
balancing the budget will not be a problem, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 That estimate, however, does not include the funding needed to fix city roads 
and intersections, money to match federal funding for new police officers, or 
money it would take to move the residents of the Oxnard Mobilehome Lodge, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, Oxnard has pared its work force from 1,100 to 913, and the city 
will continue to rearrange city departments and privatize municipal duties to 
save money, city leaders said. But they added that few if any jobs will be cut 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, council members say they will be looking to add officers to the 
understaffed Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a mode where we feel that we're a very low per-capita Police 
Department and we need more police officers," Lopez said. "We're going to do 
everything we can to add more officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard also said Oxnard leaders need to create more activities for young 
people to deter them from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not enough recreational opportunities for young people in Oxnard," 
said Pinkard, a former Oxnard recreation official. "After those policemen have 
left, the parks . . . will still be there." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Ventura County's wealthiest men, Martin V. (Bud) Smith, wants to turn 
the Wagon Wheel -- his fading motel, restaurant and bowling alley -- into a 
complex that could include housing, a high-rise office building and theaters 
for both live performances and film. 
</P>
<P>
 But details of the plan -- prompted by a project to upgrade the Ventura 
Freeway-Oxnard Boulevard interchange -- have yet to be presented to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's recent rash of freeway development has brought much-needed sales tax 
money into the city, Lopez said, and the council will continue to work on other 
projects. Among them is Shopping at the Rose Too, a 16-acre retail complex 
planned by the developer of Shopping at the Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pinkard and Lopez said the city is working with the owner of The Esplanade 
mall to add another large store and possibly a second story to the aging 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen some plans, and it looks very positive," Pinkard said. "Expanding 
The Esplanade would be a plus-plus."

 State Medfly eradication officials, meanwhile, announced that the 
malathion-laced bait will be sprayed over Camarillo every three weeks instead 
of every two weeks in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura County's public health officer, said a statement 
made earlier this week by Terri Gaishin, a member of Group Against Spraying 
People, inaccurately depicts the health risks of spraying malathion over 
populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Feldman challenged the opponents' use of a 1987 Yale University 
study that looked into possible links between malathion byproducts and 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaishin, a Camarillo mother who organized a protest outside Feldman's Ventura 
office on Tuesday, told reporters and others gathered there that the Yale study 
concluded that "malathion has been shown to cause leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feldman said Gaishin's assertion is flat-out wrong. He read the same 
study, Feldman said, and found that the Yale researchers reached a far 
different conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, scientists drenched human cells drawn from bone marrow with 
malathion and observed what happened to them, Feldman said. The replicating 
property of the cells was depressed for about 14 days before returning to 
normal, the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists speculated that there is a possibility that exposure to massive 
doses of malathion could cause anemia, or depression of the body's ability to 
make red blood cells. That effect, however, has never been observed in clinical 
practice, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no evidence at this point that would link malathion to 
cancer or human birth defects," he said. "There is nothing in the literature to 
support that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said the statement by Gaishin "lowers the credibility of the GASP 
folks, who I think have genuine concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman had agreed to review medical research into malathion after Gaishin and 
about 30 other GASP members picketed outside his office for two hours. The 
group targeted Feldman because he is charged with warning the community about 
possible health dangers, members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he decided to go public with his criticism of Gaishin and GASP 
because he has fielded calls from several Camarillo residents concerned for 
their families' health after reading Gaishin's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gaishin admitted that she may have incorrectly stated the study's 
findings. She said she will forward the research paper to Nachman Bratbar, a 
toxicologist at USC-Medical Center, to ask for his interpretation of its 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaishin also said she will keep fighting for a halt to spraying in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if this leukemia study does not bear out for us, it does not change the 
fact that there are so many other studies that show this is not a safe 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion spraying began shortly after the first Medfly was found Sept. 29 in 
a Camarillo orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth spraying was successfully completed Wednesday night, a day after the 
scheduled application was delayed because of fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperative Medfly Project officials said the next spraying over a 
16-square-mile section of east Camarillo will begin at 9 p.m. Jan. 17. The next 
two treatments will take place in three-week intervals, on Feb. 7 and Feb. 28, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-week schedule will be reinstated in March, officials said. Fewer 
applications are needed in January and February because the cooler weather 
lowers the Medfly's ability to reproduce, said spokesman Doug Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action Thursday, the Board of Supervisors extended a proclamation 
of local emergency due to potential crop losses from the Medfly infestation for 
two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proclamation ensures that the county will be eligible for reimbursement 
for Medfly eradication costs from state and federal government programs.

THORNTON'S LAWYERS SEEK DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, working to spare convicted murderer Mark Scott Thornton 
from a death sentence, want to delay the penalty phase of his trial at least 
one week so they can have more time to prepare, lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, a jury that will decide whether Thornton should be executed for the 
kidnaping and murder of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan is tentatively 
scheduled to begin hearing evidence Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But public defenders would like Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. 
McGrath to postpone that hearing until Jan. 23, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Thursday that they oppose the request for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things being equal, we would prefer not to wait too long," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said. "The longer you wait, the more chance you have of 
losing a juror." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the jury found Thornton guilty of first-degree murder and a 
special circumstance that allows the death penalty to be considered as 
punishment in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton kidnaped O'Sullivan after she left a Thousand Oaks pet store Sept. 
14, 1993. Following a seven-week trial, the jury convicted him of taking the 
33-year-old nurse to the Santa Monica Mountains and shooting her once in the 
chest and twice in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial, attorneys speculated that the break between any conviction 
and the start of the penalty hearing would last only about two weeks. Now, 
however, defense attorneys have told the judge they need more time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for a delay was made to allow more time to contact the large 
number of witnesses expected to be called for Thornton's defense, his attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said that the judge will also need more 
time to determine which witnesses can testify during the hearing, which is 
expected to last four to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thornton camp wants to put on the witness stand family and friends of the 
defendant, former teachers, clinical psychologists and other experts in the 
area of criminal behavior. His lawyers claim Thornton has a mental deficiency 
and comes from a dysfunctional family. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are expected to counter by presenting testimony about the impact 
O'Sullivan's death has had on her family, including her mother and her 
6-year-old son. It is not clear whether the mother, Sharlene Cunningham, or the 
boy, Cliff O'Sullivan Jr., will testify directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris said he could appreciate the defense team's desire to delay the 
proceedings, but said he is more concerned with keeping a promise to the jury 
that the trial would not stretch into March. If the delay is granted, the jury 
probably would not begin to deliberate Thornton's fate until late February or 
early March, Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some (extra) time also, but I would still rather start sooner than 
later," Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asher said that the defense might not be able to schedule all its 
witnesses without the delay or at least some break in the penalty trial, 
whenever it starts.

SEAWORTHY AGAIN; VENTURA: PIER REOPENS AFTER 14 STORM-DAMAGED PILINGS ARE 
REPAIRED. DOZENS VISIT DESPITE COLD TEMPERATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Denizens of the Ventura Pier braved ear-numbing and finger-freezing cold 
Thursday, returning to the structure the city closed earlier this month after a 
storm pounded loose 14 pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Tidd, who has fished on the pier for 20 years, said he came down at 6 
a.m. Thursday to see if the repairs were completed. When he saw they were and 
that the structure was back in operation, he telephoned two friends who also 
fish there regularly to tell them the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here every day waiting for it to open up," Tidd said. "Why? Because 
I'm a crusty old fisherman." 
</P>
<P>
 Tidd was just one of many plying the pier's planks Thursday. As beach-goers 
ashore flew kites in the brisk wind, the pier teemed with fishermen, 
bicyclists, stroller-pushing parents and promenaders who were glad to see that 
their familiar haunt had reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials closed the pier Dec. 19 after a powerful storm packing waves as 
high as nine feet wrenched loose 10 pilings. Four additional pilings washed 
ashore in the days after that initial destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 When repairs started a week ago Wednesday, authorities resolved to have the 
pier open before New Year's. City Engineer Mark Watkins said a fast-track 
schedule was necessary to protect the pier from further damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Oxnard Harbor District was able to supply Ventura with 10 60-foot 
pilings, and city officials had in reserve four 70-foot pilings that were used 
to replace several lost near the farthest bend of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins praised the Santa Barbara contractor hired to make the repairs for 
completing the job in seven working days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly indebted to Cushman Construction for getting out there and 
getting it finished as quickly as they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said the repairs cost Ventura about $40,000, which came from a city 
maintenance fund. The expenditure comes on top of $3.5 million the city paid 
Cushman in 1993 for a 1 1/2-year reconstruction project. During the 
reconstruction, Cushman replaced 100 of the pier's 600 pilings, based on the 
city's directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said Thursday that city workers examined the pilings that washed up on 
the beach last week, and only one looked rotted. "That one broke and probably 
took out a few of the others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction project closed the pier for a year, and the structure's 
extreme end was closed for several years before that. Watkins acknowledged that 
the pier was damage-prone and admitted that future shutdowns are inevitable in 
view of its age and wooden construction. The pier is the longest in California, 
and Watkins believes it may also be the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 Pier users, though, expressed frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we hear from everybody is, 'We just spent all that money!' " said Don 
Smith of Ventura as he waited for fish to bite on the pier's breezy tip. His 
fishing buddy, Mike Leslie of Ventura, noted that the Hueneme Pier never 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the idea was this time it would withstand," said bicyclist Olaf 
Wolff. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tidd was also dismayed that the pier had closed so soon after 
reconstruction, he praised the city for reopening it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a good job," Tidd said. "I've got to pat them on the back for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers today will find slightly milder temperatures, according to the 
National Weather Service. Forecaster Ed Wentworth said temperatures were only 
in the upper 50s Thursday because of a pocket of cold air passing over Southern 
California, but should reach at least the low 60s today, with wave conditions 
returning to normal.

DISABLED MOTORISTS PRAISE CAR PHONE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to walk very far because of multiple sclerosis, Rebecca Maxwell of Port 
Hueneme was virtually stranded after her car broke down three years ago on a 
freeway shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after a good Samaritan pulled over and gave her a lift was the 
37-year-old woman able to leave the dangerous shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a predicament that long haunted Phyllis Ellis of Thousand Oaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know when something's going to happen," said Ellis, 67, who uses a 
wheelchair because of post-polio syndrome. "If I (did) break down . . . I would 
be at everybody's mercy on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Ellis, Maxwell and 233 other disabled motorists in Ventura County, the 
situation has changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1993, the county Transportation Commission has spent about $70,000 
to distribute portable telephones to physically disabled motorists who, in 
response to a recent survey, have given glowing praise to the only program of 
its kind in California. The free cellular phones enable those who cannot 
readily use roadside call boxes to instead call 911 from their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This service saved my life by giving me freedom to go out of the house and 
feel secure and safe," an anonymous respondent wrote to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone is like insurance," another wrote. "You hope you never need it but 
it's reassuring to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the program, the county assesses drivers a $1 vehicle registration 
surcharge whose funds are earmarked for call boxes and other emergency highway 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's proven to be a program that isn't terrible costly and is very easy to 
administer," program manager Christopher Stephens said. "It didn't create 
another bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since circulating its questionnaire in September, the Transportation 
Commission has received about 160 responses from disabled recipients throughout 
the county. More than 20% indicated they had used their phones to seek personal 
roadside assistance. Another 20% called 911 to report incidents or emergencies 
they had witnessed while driving. 
</P>
<P>
 As many people used the phones within the county as beyond its limits, 
particularly in the San Fernando Valley, Agoura Hills and other Los Angeles 
County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming response is tremendously positive," said commission 
Executive Director Ginger Gherardi, whose agency instituted the program to 
conform to what the county sees as the spirit of the 1990 Americans With 
Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal law, whose specific applications are still being debated, mandates 
that people with disabilities be able to use transportation services that are 
available to the general public. But whether such services include call boxes 
is not yet clear, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of how it shakes out, we will have had a program in Ventura County 
that has been helping people for a number of years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The cellular phones, which cost the commission about $275 each, are available 
only to disabled motorists who live in Ventura County and can be used only to 
call 911, unless the user pays for more extensive service. About 10 are 
distributed each month by the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Martin Heyneman, 43, who uses a wheelchair 80% of the time 
because of multiple sclerosis, said cellular phones are vital because cars 
typically break down so far from call boxes that most disabled people could not 
reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, who now uses a wheelchair, said of her cellular phone, "I don't know 
what I'd do without it. It's extremely helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she has twice used the portable phone, once to call for help 
when her car would not start and another time to call emergency crews to remove 
a stalled vehicle that blocked traffic on a Ventura street.

ASIAN MAN'S CASE TRIGGERS OUTCRY; ACTIVISTS CONTEND MANY WRONGFULLY HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Community activists said Thursday that the case of Tu Anh Tran, a college 
student charged with the murder of a friend who was shot by an off-duty 
security guard during a fight, epitomizes a growing trend in Orange County of 
police wrongfully identifying Asian Americans as gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tu's case focuses on a number of college students whose dreams were disrupted 
by being at the wrong place at the wrong time," said Dan Tsang, a co-founder of 
the Alliance Working for Asian Rights for Empowerment. "There's a growing 
problem of Asians being wrongfully put in jail because they were labeled as" 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, 22, of Garden Grove, pleaded guilty Wednesday to voluntary manslaughter 
in connection with the death of Kinh Van Chu, 37, a friend who was shot by the 
guard during a fight at a Westminster restaurant last April. In exchange for 
his plea, Tran was sentenced to three years' probation and released from Orange 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran originally was charged with murder, attempted murder and attempted 
robbery and faced a possible life sentence if convicted. Police alleged that he 
was part of a group of men who attacked the security guard and tried to steal 
his handgun. Authorities ruled that the security guard had acted in 
self-defense when he fatally shot Chu and wounded Tran in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran's case has triggered an outcry from jailed youths protesting that they 
were wrongfully arrested, AWARE members said. The members contend that many 
Asian Americans are wrongfully suspected of crimes because of cultural 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westminster police Lt. Andrew Hall pointed out that arrests cannot be made 
without probable cause, otherwise the cases would be invalid in court. He said 
Westminster police act appropriately in arresting suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very cognizant of people's civil rights," he said, noting that gang 
activity is on the decrease in Westminster. "We realize we're playing within a 
lot of rules too." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by AWARE members at a news conference at the Pacific Asian Community 
Center, Tran alleged that during his nine months in custody, a jail deputy beat 
him and that jail officials denied him any medical attention for his gunshot 
wound. A bullet is still lodged in his back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wound got infected. . . . It was a nightmare," Tran said. The experience 
is "going to stay up in my head for the rest of my life. (The fight) is never 
over for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Tu is free and we are willing to continue to find the truth -- justice -- 
for Asian youths," AWARE member Kim Ha said. "We don't support gangs. We are 
trying to fight police harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Tran said, he hopes to help other jailed or at-risk youths 
understand the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the newsconference were Westminster Councilman Tony Lam and the 
parents of the victim, Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran and Chu had struck up a friendship weeks before the shooting, said Hoi 
Mong Do, Chu's mother. She said the two were like brothers and were out for 
beers and a game of pool the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy Tu is free," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said he will help in a community fund-raiser aimed at assisting Tran in 
seeking medical care for his gunshot wound and re-enrolling at Rancho Santiago 
College to complete his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help him return to school and regain his life," Lam said.

THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL; RESCUE: OFFICER HEARS 911 CALL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND 
RACES TO APARTMENT, WHERE HE REVIVES A CHOKING 19-MONTH-OLD GIRL.

<P>
 It was the best Christmas gift that Marcos and Martha Reyes had ever received. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank the (sheriff's) sergeant for saving my daughter's life," 
Marcos Reyes, 26, said Thursday. "He can have anything I have. I owe him that 
much and more." 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas evening, Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Russell Moore saved the 
couple's 19-month-old daughter, Jessica, by dislodging a piece of food stuck in 
her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had been to a Christmas party at a nearby apartment. When they 
returned about 8:15 p.m., Martha, 25, filled a bowl of dry cereal for Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later they discovered Jessica had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very quiet, and then she started to move her head wildly from side to 
side," Reyes said. "My wife took Jessica in her arms, and I ran to the 
telephone to call 911." 
</P>
<P>
 In the confusion, Reyes said he first spoke in Spanish and then English 
describing the situation as best he could to the emergency dispatcher. Precious 
seconds ticked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do. Usually I'm in control," Reyes said, as he bounced 
Jessica in his arms. "I told them: 'Somebody please send an ambulance. My baby 
is dying.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, Moore, 41, was less than a block away but out of his 
patrol car. Normally, he would not have heard the first-aid call that goes to 
the Fire Department's paramedics, but a fast-thinking police dispatcher, Gwen 
Loverink,overheard the call and broadcast it to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the call over my radio, I was in the home of a family who 
happened to be related to Marcos Reyes," Moore said. "And, when I heard the 
address, I immediately knew where it was. It was the same apartment that I had 
lived in when I was a Marine and had first moved into San Clemente more than 20 
years ago!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, accompanied by a member of that family who was asked to help with 
interpreting, hopped into his car and raced to the Reyes' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got there, you could hear people screaming inside the apartment," 
Moore recalled. "The mother handed me the baby, whose finger tips and lips were 
now blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore first pressed on the baby's diaphragm, without result. Then he turned 
her on her stomach and tapped her back several times. Still no luck. But after 
a few more tries, a big kernel of cereal popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jessica was not breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started breathing into her mouth several times and just kept doing that," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 When paramedics arrived, Moore had gone to meet them in front of the 
apartment. As paramedics went to attach an oxygen mask, Jessica emitted two 
gasping "whoops" and took her first breath as she started crying loudly, Moore 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The girl was taken to Samaritan Medical Center in San Clemente, where doctors 
diagnosed that she had a high temperature and virus and, as a result, had 
suffered a seizure while eating. She was released later to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incident, Reyes, who is a manager of a fast-food restaurant in San 
Clemente, has refused to take money from any sheriff's deputy who drops in for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have Moore tell him to stop doing that," Lt. Tom Davis said. 
"As deputies, we cannot accept any free food or gratuities, and although he 
means well, he's going to get us in trouble."

 After 15 days of searching, Newport Beach police still have no leads to a 
missing 52-year-old man who was last seen driving his wife to work, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never came back to pick her up," Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Carl Vincent of Newport Beach was reported missing Dec. 13, after 
taking his wife, Mikie, to work at an Irvine business that morning. At 10:30 
a.m., he telephoned his brother-in-law to say that he had several errands to 
run, said Vincent's younger sister, Cherie Raborn.

 Vincent's beige Mercedes-Benz was abandoned the same day in the 5400 block of 
Walnut Avenue in Irvine, but reported three days later, Gonis said. The key was 
still in the ignition when police recovered the car Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Raborn said the $144 in Vincent's bank account has not been withdrawn and he 
has not used his credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him and I know he wouldn't leave like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raborn last spoke to her brother Dec. 12, when the two had discussed money 
problems. The two were partners in an embroidery business that failed two years 
ago. Raborn said Vincent filed for bankruptcy this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that wasn't enough for him to leave," she said. "I can't think of any 
reasons why he would get up and go like that." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sign of foul play, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raborn is 6-foot-1, weighs 210 pounds, has blond hair and blue eyes, according 
to records from the Department of Motor Vehicles.THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL REAPPOINTS OUSTED PLANNING 
COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has reappointed a planning commissioner who lost his seat 
last summer, inadvertently reigniting controversy over the closing of the 
city's Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote, the council selected Jack Mauller to fill a vacant position on 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was still reeling from criticism in July over its decision to 
close the city Fire Department and contract for those services from the county, 
when it cut the commission from seven to five members, leaving Mauller without 
a seat. The other seat eliminated was vacant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said at the time that Mauller was being cut because he had the 
least seniority on the commission. The council said it had long wanted to 
shrink the commission because many larger cities get by with five members. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mauller attacked the council members at the time of his decommission, 
insisting the move was retaliation because the commission had refused to 
support the council in its controversial decision involving the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a political move on their part," Mauller said. "It all goes back to 
the fire issue." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Tricia, had resigned from the Beautification/Environmental Committee 
to protest her husband's ouster, and the couple had publicly slammed the 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all on the council supported Mauller's reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that service on a commission is a privilege, not a right," said 
Councilman Donald L. Bone, who voted against the reappointment. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; STUDENT VOLUNTEERS RECEIVE A LESSON IN ART OF 
RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Arturo Ramirez watched with pride Thursday as murals on a pedestrian bridge 
depicting Mexican culture and community unity came alive with a vibrant and 
colorful face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad these pictures are getting cleaned up because they tell about the 
culture here and they make me feel proud," the 11-year-old boy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Four volunteer high school students and muralist Emigdio Vasquez, who painted 
two of the 10 scenes on the bridge over Lemon Street, have spent much of the 
past two weeks restoring the murals, washing, scrubbing, scraping, removing 
graffiti and retouching the paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people here take a lot of pride in their cultural heritage, which is 
(depicted in) these murals," Vasquez said, while removing graffiti with paint 
thinner. "I hate to see them deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 The murals, some 16 years old, have become city landmarks. The depictions 
include a Mexican flag with two hands clasped and the name of the surrounding, 
predominantly Latino neighborhood -- Fullerton Tokers Town. Another includes a 
sign saying, "The Town I Live In" welcoming motorists to the city and a sign 
reading, "Come Back Again Soon," for those driving out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The city occasionally sponsors restoration of the murals to keep them looking 
fresh and free of graffiti that comes from taggers outside the community, said 
Eloisa Espinoza, a city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the current $3,000 restoration project is being paid for through a 
grant from the private philanthropic Webb Berge Foundation of Arcadia. Vasquez 
and the volunteers hope to finish the work next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This needed to be done," said volunteer Audrey Watson, 16, as she sanded one 
of the murals. "They're really beautiful murals and a lot of people identify 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Martinez, 28, remembers when there were no murals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty nasty with graffiti all over that bridge," he said. "It looks 
great now. Those pictures are perfect right here in the middle of the barrio ."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK/GLENDALE; CITIES' FLOATS CARRY PRIDE OF 
VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the countdown to Monday's Tournament of Roses Parade ticked away, 
volunteers worked briskly Thursday to put finishing touches on the floats 
representing the cities of Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the rate we're going, I wouldn't be surprised if we were done tomorrow," 
said David Weaver, chairman of Glendale's float development committee.  
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's parade, "Quest for Excellence," has brought a 
plethora of floats with sports motifs. Glendale's float will feature nine river 
rafts, with the first carrying Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 The other eight rafts will feature residents, who reportedly paid about $600 
each for the privilege of riding in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale paid the Bent Float Co. of Pasadena about $60,000 to build the frame 
and mechanics for its creation, but most of the decorative work has been done 
by volunteers, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors, church groups and homeowners associations have spent time at home 
cutting up the dried flowers and material used to blanket the float's exterior, 
while still more volunteers will help finish the float with live flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make the float 100% Glendale-decorated," Weaver said. "We 
hope to have a shot at the theme prize, because we're right in line with the 
theme of the parade."  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Glendale's "Whale's Tail" won the Mayor's Trophy for the best float 
entered by a city of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as many as 400 volunteers were working in a building near the 
Burbank power plant, finishing off "Reach for the Wind," their city's Rose 
Parade entry -- one of only six that is still entirely built and decorated by 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The float, which depicts three sailboats rushing through the waves amid 
playful sea animals, was designed by Burbank resident Jennifer Edward, who also 
serves as decorative chairwoman for the city's float committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward's design was chosen in a contest in which more than 100 designs were 
submitted, including some from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a coincidence because not only am I the lucky person whose design 
is chosen, but I'm also responsible for decorating the float," Edward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building of the frame and the purchase of flowers from as far 
away as Holland, South America, Thailand, Hawaii and other places amount to 
large expenses, Burbank saves money by also recruiting local people to donate 
cactus, orchids, birds of paradise and other flowers grown in their yards, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward said Burbank has a 60-year history of volunteer-built floats, although 
it did try farming out the work to a private company for a few years several 
decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two Girl Scout troops and a group of honors students from John 
Burroughs High School were on hand to help apply flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about six community organizations and dozens of individuals have been 
involved in planning and building the float throughout the year, Edward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's completely built, designed and decorated by scads of volunteers," she 
said. "If we were to pay a company to build our float, we couldn't get one like 
this done for less than $100,000, and we love it so much that we just continue 
to do it this way." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two cities' floats, several private companies in the 
Glendale-Burbank area will be fielding floats in Monday's parade, including the 
1928 Jewelry Company, Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., IHOP Corp. and Disney.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY HELPS FINANCE PIONEER PAGEANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Impressed by the success of a yearly pageant commemorating the passing of 
Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza through what is now Calabasas, the city 
has donated $4,000 to this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that this is seed money, and if we make money, then we have to 
pay it back," said Juliana Gensley, who created the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th annual Juan Bautista de Anza Pageant will be held Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. 
in Malibu Creek State Park, off Las Virgenes Road. In 1776, De Anza, who was 
leading 240 settlers from Mexico to what is now San Francisco, camped in a spot 
where the intersection of the Ventura Freeway and Las Virgenes Road is now 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is considered an outstanding success in the annals of pioneer history 
for being exceptionally well planned, pageant organizers say. Only one person, 
a woman who was in labor, was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Congress designated the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail 
-- a portion of which runs through Calabasas -- as a national historic trail. A 
new park planned for Calabasas will be named after the explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pageant, actors play the roles of De Anza and others, said Gensley, 
who is seeking volunteers such as actors, sound engineers and costume 
designers. She is also seeking sponsors, video camera operators, traffic 
directors, poster makers, advertising solicitors and others. Those wishing to 
help should call her at (818) 222-4617. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, De Anza has been portrayed by Rod Bergen, a 
businessman and actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," said Bergen, who will play De Anza again this year. 
"This man exemplifies things which I think are very characteristic of our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have vowed to increase attendance at the event, which usually draws 
about 200, said spokeswoman Stephanie Abronson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year that we have picked up a monetary sponsor," she said. 
"That tells us that we're getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendees are advised to bring picnic lunches because no food will be sold. 
There is a $5 parking fee for Malibu Creek State Park. FRANK MANNING

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; SHOULD PARENTS PAY FOR THEIR 
KIDS' CRIMES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New state laws going into effect Sunday will give California courts the 
authority to punish parents whose children are found guilty of graffiti 
vandalism or of breaking curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws are designed to curb costs to state agencies imposed by an increasing 
juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If a minor is picked up for violating curfew, parents can be fined an amount 
equal to the cost of their child's arrest and detainment. 
</P>
<P>
 A maximum fine of $25,000 may be levied against adults whose minor children 
are responsible for an act of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The enactment of these laws has been labeled as a futile exercise by those who 
claim that parents likely to be affected by them are poor and would not be able 
to pay the fees levied by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, however, say the laws will inspire parental influence necessary 
for cutting into juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should parents be made to pay for their children's crimes? 
</P>
<P>
 Trebien Bellows, supervisor, Sun Valley Graffiti Busters: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Local governments) fork out a lot of money to people working to remove 
graffiti for them. They are paying all this money and we still can't get a grip 
on the problem. Parents should take the (paint) rollers themselves and erase 
what their kids put on other people's property. These laws will inspire parents 
to show a little more interest in what their kids are doing and could deter 
kids from tagging. Parents have a tendency to look the other way when their 
children show signs of being taggers, like writing all over notebooks or school 
textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), author of pending legislation that would 
allow juvenile court judges to punish offenders with as many as 10 whacks with 
a wood paddle: 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is punishment for the children, the laws will not be effective. 
We generally look at a 14- or 15-year-old as a kid, but they are not kids 
today. They are young adults. (Under the new laws,) the parent is forced to do 
everything by way of punishment and the young hoods will continue to do what 
they do. If you only punish the parents for those actions, the children will 
behave any way they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Harris, executive director of Because I Love You, a support group for 
parents with troubled children: 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids go out socially or to school, the parent can't control their 
actions. (Yet,) it's always the parents that catch the blame. Most kids don't 
have a concept of how their actions will affect their parents. Will a child 
discontinue his activities based on being screamed at by a parent? Still, 
parents are legally responsible for their children's actions. Instead of paying 
a fine (for a crime like graffiti,) parents should only be required to perform 
community service with their child. The kid would then gain a firsthand 
impression of what consequence his actions have." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary L. Bauer, president, Family Research Council, a nonprofit organization 
focusing on current family issues: 
</P>
<P>
 "Many parents are clearly being irresponsible in the job of instilling proper 
values in their children. The government, (however,) has not been a partner in 
instilling those values. As long as you've got politicians not doing enough to 
stop the flow of drugs into the country or disallowing schools to teach 
reliable standards of right and wrong because it may violate the Constitution, 
the government does not have clean hands in this whole business of youth 
delinquencies."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENT FINDS NICHE ON COLLEGE CREW AT 38 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody's heard about the wunderkind who graduates from high school with 
high honors, makes the varsity team in college and goes on to earn six figures 
by the tender age of 23. Ventura's P.J. Galligan isn't one of those people. But 
at age 38, he's finally made the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Galligan has been an oarsman at Sarah Lawrence College in New York state since 
September, when he entered the elite school to study drama. His only previous 
athletic experience was playing softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he's raced in novice and varsity lightweight teams at such choice 
events as the Head of the Charles Regatta. He's also grown used to getting up 
at 5 a.m. for practice sessions and occasionally being brained by a misplaced 
paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Galligan rowed a circuitous course to college jockdom. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Ventura's continuation school, Mar Vista, and held various 
day jobs while he played with a rock 'n' roll band. His guitar-playing 
eventually gained him a place in the Angry Samoans, a hard-core L.A. punk rock 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The band toured California and the East Coast, but Galligan never made the 
cover of Rolling Stone -- or much money. "We made and squandered most of our 
dollars when we were on tour," Galligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cut three records with the Samoans but decided to split when they switched 
their style to "retread psychedelia." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said no thanks," Galligan said. "I'd rather play fast and loud." 
</P>
<P>
 In transition, he attended Ventura College for a while, dropped out to earn a 
living, lost his job when the company went out of business, went back to 
Ventura College and finally decided what he wanted to do for the rest of his 
life: work in professional theater and write plays and sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
 He's already had a few plays produced at the college level. In "Celebrity 
Power Play," for example, terrorists on a television game show compete for 
control of a country for a year. In "Peace Is Hell," characters in a state 
unemployment office muse over the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also acted, but the only place he's performing right now is at the 
Ventura Family YMCA, where he'll be keeping in shape on the rowing machine 
until Jan. 22, when he returns to school and to a new season of crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that his teammates are half his age -- ages 17 to 22 -- he's 
fitting in just fine. Being a former rock star gives him celebrity status. Some 
teammates have even suggested an Angry Samoans revival. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say they weren't skeptical at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they looked at me at first and said, 'You think he's going to undergo 
a heart attack?' " Galligan said. JAN STEVENS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who claimed to have a gun robbed a Port Hueneme bank Thursday morning 
and escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber handed a note demanding cash to a teller at the Bank of America 
branch in the 700 block of Channel Islands Boulevard at 10:10 a.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded to an alarm from the bank, but when officers arrived the man 
had already fled on foot. The robber, described as about 5 feet, 7 inches tall 
and in his 20s, told the teller he had a gun, but it was not seen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme investigators said they, the FBI and the Oxnard Police Department 
are pursuing several leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very hopeful," Port Hueneme Detective Jerry Beck said. "We've got some 
good leads." MATTHEW MOSK

 Police have arrested an Oxnard man and a teen-ager on suspicion of snatching 
an 84-year-old woman's purse while she was shopping in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Ostalaza 24, and a 17-year-old Oxnard youth whose name was not released 
because of his age surrounded Beverly Elder of Oxnard outside a store on 
Channel Islands Boulevard Wednesday and grabbed her purse, Port Hueneme police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the two then ran behind a shopping center. Later that afternoon, 
when a witness spotted the 17-year-old, police were summoned and the youth was 
arrested, police said. Ostalaza later turned himself in at the Oxnard Police 
Department, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were booked on suspicion of grand theft, police said. The purse and 
its contents were not recovered. MATTHEW MOSK

LOCAL LAWS '94; A GUIDE TO NEW LEGISLATION IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smokers are out and animals are in as Los Angeles County enters a new year. 
Anti-smoking measures wafted across the county landscape this year, while 
creatures from potbellied pigs to whales found the favor of lawmakers. Here is 
a sampling of laws enacted in 1994. Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Artwork -- Officials imposed a moratorium on placement of artwork in MacArthur 
Park, saying it is cluttered with more than 25 statues, plaques, murals and 
fountains in dire need of repair. The ban will last until the park's existing 
art work is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Chimneys -- After thousands of Angelenos lost brick chimneys in the Jan. 17 
earthquake, officials began requiring homeowners to hire an engineer to design 
a method of anchoring the chimney to the house's frame and use steel 
reinforcement. Stricter construction reviews for outdoor brick walls also were 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation -- Residents can now use recycled water from bathtubs, sinks and 
washing machines for landscaping irrigation if they install a filtration 
system. Such systems can cost from several hundred dollars to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes -- Animal regulation officers began charging residents a $200 fee to 
set coyote traps, but only after homeowners meet certain conditions, such as 
putting up fences to deter coyote intrusion, notifying residents within 300 
yards that trapping will occur and signing a waiver freeing the city from 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency lighting -- Spurred by power outages after the Northridge quake, the 
city required owners of residential buildings with more than five units to 
install battery-powered emergency lights to help tenants get out during 
emergencies. Owners of existing buildings have up to five years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf -- The city increased its golf fees from $15 to $16 a round during the 
week and $19.50 to $20.50 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Shut-off valves -- As a result of the nearly 17,000 gas leaks that were caused 
by the earthquake, all new residential, commercial, industrial and government 
buildings must have valves that automatically shut off main gas lines during a 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking -- Smoking was prohibited in all city-owned buildings. Other 
facilities owned and leased by the city previously were covered under an 
ordinance that restricted but did not bar smoking in public and private 
workplaces. The new law imposes a total ban in those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants -- Under an ordinance designed to prevent landlords from using quake 
damage to force out tenants in favor of new ones paying higher rent, the 
original tenants must receive first priority to reoccupy buildings damaged in 
quakes after repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Street vendors -- The city created eight areas where street vendors will be 
allowed to sell their wares. But red tape and infighting between the vendors 
have caused months of delay, and no legal districts have yet been set up. L.A. 
County 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers -- The county made curbside job-seeking in unincorporated areas a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or a $1,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Garage sales -- Residents of unincorporated areas are now allowed only two 
garage sales a year, with each sale not to exceed three consecutive days. Sale 
hours are limited to 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti -- Business permit holders must promise to clean up graffiti on their 
premises or their licenses will not be renewed. Arcadia 
</P>
<P>
 Sidewalk dining -- The city code was changed to allow sidewalk dining outside 
restaurants that obtain a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family homes -- An ordinance was amended to prohibit construction of 
houses with more than two floors, even if one is subterranean. Azusa 
</P>
<P>
 Juveniles -- Parents can now be billed for personnel costs involved in the 
detention, processing and supervision of juvenile offenders. Bellflower 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew breakers -- An ordinance now allows the city to sue parents whose 
children repeatedly violate a 10 p.m. curfew and other laws. The city may seek 
up to $2,500 from parents of chronic offenders. Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes -- Beverly Hills joined Santa Monica and 98 other cites nationwide 
in eliminating cigarette vending machines at stores, restaurants, bars and 
hotels. Claremont 
</P>
<P>
 Parks -- A permit system was established giving Claremont residents priority 
to use parks and requiring large parties of non-residents to pay a reservation 
fee for certain park sites. Covina 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti -- The city enacted an ordinance calling for the fining of graffiti 
writers and, if they are minors, their parents. Culver City 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti -- Convicted taggers face suspension of their driver's licenses and 
fines of up to $50,000, a year in jail and up to four days of community 
service. Responsibility for paying fines will fall to the parents of minors, 
and those unable to pay could face the same community service time as their 
children. Also under the ordinance, owners whose property has been cleaned up 
by the city more than four times must voluntarily clean up markings or pay the 
city to do it. Gardena 
</P>
<P>
 Massage parlors -- The city ordered a moratorium until July 12 on new massage 
parlors. Nine parlors exist in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Card clubs -- The city's two card clubs, the El Dorado and Normandie, each 
were permitted to double their playing tables to 250. 
</P>
<P>
 Development -- Ten acres at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue were zoned 
for the development of a controversial Smith's Food & Drug Center adjacent to a 
freshwater wetland known as the Willows. 
</P>
<P>
 Swap meet -- Complaints from residents prompted the city to adopt an ordinance 
banning all swap meets. The Vermont Drive-In and Swap Meet, set up in the 
mid-1960s, will be phased out over the next three years. Hawthorne 
</P>
<P>
 Street vendors -- A rising number of complaints about illegal street vendors 
spurred an ordinance prohibiting solicitation on public sidewalks. Nonprofit 
organizations may apply for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult businesses -- An ordinance was passed limiting the operation of adult 
businesses. The city's rules were too vague, city officials said. Inglewood 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew -- In response to an increase in juvenile crime, city officials raised 
the age of youths subject to a 10 p.m. curfew from under 16 to under 18. 
Lancaster 
</P>
<P>
 Potbellied pigs -- A city ordinance was passed making it legal for a household 
to keep one potbellied pig as a pet in a residential zone. Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking -- Lighting up was banned in restaurants, coffeehouses, bowling 
alleys, eateries, workplaces, hair salons and business offices. Violators face 
fines of up to $50. Smoking is permitted in a third of the seating areas of 
bars with their own ventilation systems and in a third of the outdoor seating 
areas of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult businesses -- Restrictions on adult businesses were eased after court 
decisions called into question aspects of an existing ordinance. The city 
agreed to allow topless bars and other adult establishments in more areas and 
to allow them to operate closer to homes, churches and parks. Judges in two 
separate lawsuits said the original law failed to provide enough suitable 
commercial areas for adult entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Boating -- City marine patrol officers were granted authority to arrest 
boaters for criminal activities. The 11 patrol officers previously had been 
empowered only to cite boaters for infractions such as speeding and improper 
loading. Now they can detain people for boating under the influence of alcohol 
and other criminal offenses. They still are not allowed to carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating -- Skateboarding and roller-skating were banned in the Long Beach 
Convention Center, Civic Center Plaza, Lincoln Park and the Promenade. City 
officials said that skaters had caused minor damage around the remodeled 
convention center and that they were concerned that pedestrians might be 
injured. Malibu 
</P>
<P>
 Whaling -- Two years ago, Malibu declared local shores a "human-dolphin shared 
environment." This year, the City Council named cetaceans a "living cultural 
resource." The measure was part of an effort to lobby the International Whaling 
Commission to extend a moratorium on whaling. Monrovia 
</P>
<P>
 Truancy -- In the hope of keeping students in school and stopping them from 
engaging in serious crime, the city enacted an ordinance allowing police to 
cite students 12 to 17 years old caught unsupervised from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m. If ticketed, the student must appear with a parent or legal guardian in 
Juvenile Traffic Court. Failure to do so can result in suspension of a youth's 
driver's license and issuance of an arrest warrant. Montebello 
</P>
<P>
 Scavengers -- The city passed a law banning people from taking plastic items, 
glass, cans and newspapers from recycling containers. The city gets revenue by 
selling the recyclable trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes 
</P>
<P>
 Nude beaches -- Responding to complaints about one of the last nude beaches in 
Southern California, the city banned public nudity. Nudists had scared away 
other beach-goers and had trashed an area known both as Smuggler's Cove and 
Sacred Beach. Redondo Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Guns -- A proposed amendment to the City Charter will be put on the March, 
1995, city election ballot that would advise the Legislature to ease 
restrictions on concealed-weapon permits. The city wants law-abiding citizens 
who can pass a firearms safety course to be able to carry concealed weapons. 
San Dimas 
</P>
<P>
 Horse-drawn carriages -- After a hayride driver applied to do business in the 
city and found there were no provisions for such an operation, the City Council 
approved a permit for the endeavor. Santa Fe Springs 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunetellers -- The City Council banned fortunetelling, at least 
temporarily, after a Whittier resident sought to open a fortuneteller business 
in the city. The moratorium is in effect until July to give the city time to 
study the issue. Santa Clarita 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking -- A ordinance bans smoking in all public buildings except restaurants 
and bars. Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking -- The City Council passed a tough ban on smoking in indoor locations 
-- even bars -- but the measure might be snuffed out before it takes effect 
next month. Approved before newly elected council members took office, the ban 
has drawn heavy opposition from restaurant and bar owners and is expected to be 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs -- For the first time in more than 50 years, Santa Monica decided to 
allow leashed dogs in all city parks. Dogs are also allowed to run free in 
designated areas of two parks -- Joslyn and Marine -- during specified morning 
hours. Temple City 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti -- In response to the problem of youths who repeatedly vandalize 
private homes and businesses, the city decided to force parents and guardians 
to pay up to $2,500 if their child disregards the instructions of a police 
officer after a daily 10 p.m. city curfew. Torrance 
</P>
<P>
 Animals -- The City Council enacted an ordinance requiring anyone with more 
than three animals of one kind to pay an $80 fee for the fourth. The ordinance 
also prohibits more than four animals of any kind in Torrance homes. 
</P>
<P>
 City property -- The council gave the city manager permission to sell surplus 
city property. Any item valued at less than $1,000 may be sold to anyone except 
city employees. The city is still studying whether to open its own store to 
sell such items. West Covina 
</P>
<P>
 Juveniles -- The City Council passed an ordinance allowing the Police 
Department to charge parents for personnel costs involved in the detention, 
processing and supervision of juvenile offenders.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BEACH BOULEVARD PROJECT COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All lanes are scheduled to be reopened today on Beach Boulevard, after five 
months of street construction to add a lane in each direction and make other 
improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 The 2.7-mile project extends from Ellis Avenue to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers installed new coordinated traffic signals, paved a fourth lane in each 
direction, resurfaced roads and added left- and right-turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, the Orange County Transportation Authority and the California 
Department of Transportation cooperated on the $2.9-million project. The R.J. 
Noble Co. of Orange was responsible for the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was completed on schedule, a city spokesman said, and cost 30% 
less than expected. Officials used federal transportation money and Measure M 
proceeds -- from Orange County's half-cent transportation sales tax -- to fund 
the project. ALAN EYERLY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WOMAN INJURED IN FALL FROM ESCALATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 42-year-old woman was in serious condition Thursday after she rode down the 
handrail of a moving escalator, slipped and fell 20 feet onto a marble floor at 
the Media City Center shopping mall in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelly Carlson, of North Hollywood, was rushed to County-USC Medical Center on 
Wednesday suffering from a fractured pelvis, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall and police officials said it was unclear why Carlson sat precariously on 
the handrail shortly before the Media City Center closed at 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 She was reportedly at the mall by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got on the third-floor escalator near the rotunda, put her leg over the 
rail and rode down like she was sliding down a banister," Burbank Police Lt. 
Joe Valento said. "When she got to the second floor, her leg got caught and she 
flipped over." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson landed on the ground-level marble floor head and shoulder first, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time police arrived, she was conscious and complaining of pain in her 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's general manager, Dan Millman, said the fall was the first such 
accident at the Media City Center since it opened in 1991. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; EMERGENCY AID CENTERS TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas next month will dedicate one of two emergency aid 
stations that have been set up to treat people with minor injuries during 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience has proved that so many people clog the hospitals during 
disasters," said City Manager Charles Cate."For people with minor injuries, 
this would be a good way for them to get treatment without overburdening the 
medical facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication will be on Jan. 17, the anniversary of the Northridge 
earthquake, at the Calabasas Tennis and Swim Center, 23400 Park Sorrento, from 
10 a.m. to noon. The second "M.A.S.H." unit, as they are called, is located 
behind A. E. Wright Middle School, 4029 N. Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At the stations, tamper-proof boxes, 8 feet high by 10 feet long, are stocked 
with emergency first aid equipment, as well as other emergency items such as 
generators, according to city officials. The city provided the funding for the 
stations, which cost about $6,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is overseen by Dr. Arnold Bresky, a local physician, as part of an 
emergency preparedness plan developed by the city in cooperation with the 
Calabasas Emergency Response Team, a volunteer organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the plan is to have medical personnel report to the stations in the 
event of disasters, said Cate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a high concentration of doctors and medical technicians in the 
community that can report to the sites," Cate said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also at the Tennis and Swim Center on Jan. 17, the Health and Wellness 
Committee will offer a free 7 p.m. lecture on how to deal with the stress 
brought on by disasters. Shelly Horner will be the speaker. FRANK MANNING

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; FIRE DAMAGES HOME IN LEISURE VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An early-morning blaze broke out on the back porch of an elderly Camarillo 
woman's home, forcing her from the house and killing her poodle, Ventura County 
fire officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire raced through one side of a duplex in the Village 16 neighborhood of 
the Leisure Village retirement community at about 12:40 a.m. Thursday, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people, including homeowner Iva Grace Adams, 81, were treated at the scene 
for symptoms of smoke inhalation, but neither required hospitalization, fire 
officials said. The identity of the second victim was not available from 
investigators Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the blaze caused an estimated $40,000 in damage to Adams' home 
and an additional $20,000 worth of property was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 It took nearly three dozen firefighters about 25 minutes to contain the fire. 
The cause is still under investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' pet poodle was found dead inside the home, apparently from smoke 
inhalation, after firefighters extinguished the blaze, according to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Duke, president of the 3,000-member community's board of directors, said 
Thursday that the association was insured for the losses and that Adams had 
relatives in the area she could stay with until repairs are completed. JEFF

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BANDITS ROB CLERK AND MOTEL GUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura detectives are investigating an armed robbery at a Motel 6 in which 
two men wearing ski masks stole cash from a clerk and a truck driver 
registering for a room. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the robbery Wednesday night at the Johnson Drive motel, 
although one of the bandits threatened to kill the driver with a sawed-off 
shotgun while waiting for the clerk to hand over the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not say how much money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Jim Burt said the robbery may be linked to a holdup Tuesday night at 
Susie's Deals on Telephone Road. In that incident, two robbers, one carrying a 
sawed-off rifle or shotgun, stole money from a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have had no suspects in either case, Burt said. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A 20-year-old Camarillo man was arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary 
and of assault with intent to commit rape after threatening a woman from 
outside her front window, Ventura County sheriff's officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Patrick Schmitt is accused of knocking on the window of a 21-year-old 
Camarillo woman about 12:30 a.m. Thursday and threatening to break inside the 
home and assault her, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was on the telephone to her sister in Oregon at the time, told 
the sister that Schmitt said he was going to rape her, according to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The sister called authorities, and deputies found Schmitt several minutes 
later as he was walking away from the South Glen Drive residence, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitt was held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on Tuesday. JEFF

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL VOTES TO INVEST IN STATE POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In light of Orange County's recent financial woes, the City Council has voted 
to deposit its money in a state-run investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, made at the council's Dec. 20 meeting, reversed an investment 
policy that council members approved earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, the council voted to switch most of the city's investments from 
the state fund into the one operated by former Orange County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron. The council simultaneously put a $250,000 lid on 
the amount of city funds it would allow in the state pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Bob Patchin said the council decided in February to deposit its money 
with the county because "last winter, the county was paying over three 
percentage points more than the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Park city government had invested about $1.3 million of its funds in 
the county pool by early December, when the county declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dec. 20 meeting, City Manager Fred Maley asked that the $250,000 
city-imposed lid on state investments be lifted so Villa Park could once more 
put most of its idle funds with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the request unanimously. Patchin told the council 
audience that the city had been misled about Citron's county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the mistake, along with others, of trusting the wrong expert," 
Patchin said. BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 22, at 1:30 p.m., peace will break out. 
</P>
<P>
 On that date, local historical associations and city agencies will team up to 
commemorate a monumental peace treaty, the Campo de Cahuenga Treaty, which 
ended the Mexican-American War in California and paved the way for California 
and the Western states to join the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is free and open to the public, and is sponsored by the Campo de 
Cahuenga Historical Memorial Assn., the city of Los Angeles and its Department 
of Recreation and Parks, and the San Fernando Valley Historical Society, among 
other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be held at Campo de Cahuenga, 3919 Lankershim Blvd., across from 
Univeral Studios. Parking is accessible through the alley behind Lankershim 
Boulevard or at South Weddington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of the original peace treaty, which occured on Jan. 13, 1847, will 
be reenacted, and look-alikes will play the parts of the two principal parties 
to the treaty, Lt. Gen. John C. Fremont and Gen. Andres Pico. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GAY BUSINESS GROUP HOSTS AWARDS DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Business Alliance, a gay and lesbian organization, is hosting its 
16th annual president's dinner and awards presentation Jan. 14 at Sportsmen's 
Lodge in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance President Bill Robinson said the event is an opportunity for his 
organization to recognize people's contributions, regardless of sexual 
orientation, to the gay community and HIV/AIDS causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of the Humanitarian of the Year award is Miki Jackson, who has 
spent the past two years volunteering at Aunt Bee's Laundry Service, a 
Hollywood group that collects, washes and delivers the laundry of homebound 
victims of the AIDS virus, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laundry service will be expanded to the Valley next year once they get 
another truck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored will be Bill Craig, owner and publisher of the gay and lesbian 
magazine Frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also helps the LIFE AIDS lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 The media service award will go to Madam Dish Productions, which produces a 
gay talk and cooking show called "Dish" for public access television. 
</P>
<P>
 Started by Steven McCarthy, the show features McCarthy first interviewing a 
gay or lesbian guest -- anyone from Washington politicos to local playwrights 
-- at a couch in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they cook a meal together in the kitchen and eat together, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique opportunity to communicate with the non-gay community and let 
them know about gay and lesbian people," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the dinner cost $50 until Tuesday; $60 afterward. 
</P>
<P>

YOUNG CAR BUFF, TRUCK DRIVER DIED IN PILEUP; TRAFFIC: WOMAN, 20, WAS GOING TO

 Stacey Lynn Long loved cars -- including the Honda Civic she regularly drove 
from her father's home in Claremont to her boyfriend's apartment in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for an upcoming local auto show, she was driving the car 
Wednesday to Upland to buy new tires when heavy fog suddenly fell on Interstate 
5 in the Tejon Pass, triggering a massive pileup involving at least 30 cars and 
more than a dozen big rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car was hit repeatedly. Long, 20, was identified Thursday as one of two 
people who died in the massive wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very outgoing, had an excellent sense of humor and was a very caring, 
loving person," said Robert O'Connor, a friend of the family, speaking from the 
home of Long's mother in Helendale in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Long's interest in cars had been sparked by her boyfriend and her stepbrother. 
"It's something they've done all the way since high school," said her 
stepfather, Jim Falk. 
</P>
<P>
 The other person killed in the pileup was Miguel Angel Leanos, 34, of Chula 
Vista, whose trailer truck slammed into the back of a milk truck. The cab of 
Leanos' truck was so badly damaged that it took rescue workers several hours to 
free his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanos had worked for two years for J&J Trucking Co. of Chula Vista. "He was 
quiet," company owner Juan Fernandez said. "These things always seem to happen 
to the nicest people." 
</P>
<P>
 Leanos' wife and two children, who were riding in the cab, sustained only 
minor injuries in the crash, co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Thursday that it could take several days to determine the 
exact cause of the deadly collisions that began after the fog cut visibility to 
almost zero about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight people reported being injured in the collision, although that 
number could increase, Officer Mark Ehly of the California Highway Patrol said.

RAILROADS, PORTS SIGN DEAL FOR ALAMEDA CORRIDOR PROJECT; TRANSPORTATION: PACT 
IS EXPECTED TO RAISE $600 MILLION OF THE $1.8 BILLION NEEDED TO BUILD A FREIGHT 
ROUTE TO DOWNTOWN. NEXT PART IS THE TOUGHEST: ASKING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO PAY 
THE REST.

 The Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads agreed Thursday to 
use the Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile railway that will run from the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach to Downtown Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The corridor, which is expected to cost about $1.8 billion to build, would 
separate train and automobile traffic, providing a high-speed rail link for 
freight. Now, freight carried by rail can take eight hours to move across the 
Los Angeles Basin because trains must go 5 to 10 m.p.h as they pass through 34 
street crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Thursday's agreement, the companies will pay $15 for each 20-foot cargo 
container that rides the rails. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroad and port officials signed an operating agreement during a ceremony at 
the Port of Long Beach with a goal of raising $600 million of the project's 
costs in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the ports paid $400 million to buy 26 miles of right of 
way from Southern Pacific, 18.6 miles from Union Pacific and 0.7 miles from the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the corridor will only be 20 miles long, the ports had to buy 
additional railway for alternative routes while the corridor is being built and 
for overflow trains. The Alameda Corridor will run along the railway owned by 
Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 With railroad cars from each of the companies parked behind them, officials 
said they were happy to obtain the agreement between the rival railroads and 
ports, but the difficult part lies ahead: getting the rest of the money from 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be an anti-California feeling that's sweeping the leadership 
of the Congress," Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley said. He called on 
local and federal officials to persuade Congress that the project is important 
and will affect not only Southern California, but the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) said the project must have bipartisan 
support in Congress to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ask how you spell economic relief, I spell it 'Alameda Corridor,' " 
Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the corridor say the project is critical to the expansion of the 
ports, which are expected to triple their exports and imports during the next 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of construction began in October with the Carson Street 
overpass. Other overpasses are scheduled to be built at Pacific Coast Highway, 
Sepulveda Boulevard, Del Amo Boulevard and Alameda Street near Laurel Park 
Road. The project is expected to be completed by 2001. LOS ANGELES HARBOR

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; OREGON DUCKS TEAM UP WITH FLIGHTY FOWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Silila Malepeai is one big Duck -- 5-foot-11, 265 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But, on Thursday afternoon, he turned into one big chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Malepeai was one of three Oregon Ducks football players judging a duck-calling 
contest at Universal Studios when Rocky, a real duck, suddenly bolted off the 
chair next to him. A startled Malepeai immediately got off his seat. Asked 
later about his nerves, the senior nose tackle didn't duck the issue: 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want the duck to go wild on me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only wild Ducks were the Oregon players, coaches and fans who enjoyed 
yet another stop on their unlikely pilgrimage to Pasadena. The event often 
resembled a pep rally for the team that will play powerhouse Penn State on 
Monday in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, however, centered on another competition. Malepeai and two teammates 
-- senior fullback Dan Meade and sophomore tight end Josh Wilcox -- were picked 
by the squad to judge the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about their duck-calling credentials? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're Ducks," Coach Rich Brooks said. "We know everything about Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. Meade said he knows nothing about the foul, but was chosen 
because "I'm the team goof." He later proved it with a series of spontaneous 
impressions, including Ronald Reagan, Robin Leach and Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' lack of duck expertise hardly mattered.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the event's winner, Chris Blume, 16, from Silverton, Ore., had never 
attempted a duck call. He was one of two contestants plucked from the crowd by 
Universal, along with three studio ringers, who livened things up. The three 
Oregon players each sat next to real ducks brought in from the studio's Animal 
Actors Stage Show. 
</P>
<P>
 Blume offered a weak "quack, quack, quack," but, as Malepeai said, "the kid's 
from Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Malepeai didn't exactly seem to be in the mood to spend much more 
time on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the real ducks, the Nittany Lions ought to be easy prey. MICHAEL 
ARKUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three people were injured in single-car accidents that occurred within hours 
of each other on separate Ventura County freeways, the California Highway 
Patrol reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Coleman of Ventura was driving west on California 126 about 6:20 p.m. 
Wednesday when he veered onto the right shoulder west of Victoria Avenue and 
his pickup truck flipped several times, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Coleman, 38, was thrown from the cab of the truck and 
suffered multiple injuries. He was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, 
where he was listed in serious condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, Sharon Ward of Palmdale was traveling south on 
California 23 in Thousand Oaks when she veered off the roadway onto the right 
shoulder, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 33, struck a light pole near the intersection of California 23 and Erbes 
Road, snapping the fixture, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was listed in serious condition at Los Robles Regional Medical Center on 
Thursday. Her passenger, 6-year-old Brandon Ward of Palmdale, was treated for 
his injuries and released, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes of both crashes are still under investigation. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; $250,000 GIFT TAKES ARTS PLAZA OVER 
TOP

<P>
 A $250,000 donation from a Westlake Village stockbroker has pushed the Civic 
Arts Plaza fund-raising campaign over the top of its $10-million goal three 
months early, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest and the excitement over the new center during its initial months 
has really worked very much in our favor," said Alliance for the Arts Director 
Richard Johnson."We're thrilled that we are ahead of schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance now has an endowment of $10.2 million in pledged donations. 
Interest on the endowment will fund operating expenses for the performing arts 
center at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, including maintenance and any 
needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Tesoro, president of Jones and Associates Inc., pledged the 
donation this week. Johnson said an exterior courtyard will be renamed the 
Anthony J. Tesoro Courtyard of the Oaks in honor of the gift. The courtyard has 
a small performance area and is lined with inscribed bricks given by donors to 
the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took Anthony and his family on a tour of the building, backstage and into 
the park area," Johnson said. "He was really taken with the Courtyard of the 
Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Tesoro also brought over several friends to look at the building last week, 
including Marc and Linda Sirkus of Agoura Hills and Lance and Nina Holt of 
Thousand Oaks. Both couples later gave $50,000 to become members of the 
Founders Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Alliance for the Arts has reached its goal, Johnson said he is 
not sure whether fund-raising efforts will slow down. MARY F. POLS

 A developer will ask the city early next month to approve construction of 264 
detached condominiums off La Novia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums would complement 22 attatched townhouses under construction 
now as part of a now-scuttled project on 79 1/2 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous developer had permission from the city to build 286 townhouses but 
didn't complete the project, according to C.J. Amstrup, an associate planner 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 New city approval for the proposed 264 detatched condominiums is necessary 
because zoning changes are needed to accommodate the project, Amstrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amstrup said the city was unsure why the previous developer didn't finish the 
project. The new developer could not be reached Thursday. The developer is 
scheduled to present the project to the city Planning Commission on Jan. 10 and 
to the City Council on Feb. 7.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; STUDENTS CREATE VIDEO DETAILING POLICE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-minute video written and produced by middle school students will soon be 
used by the Police Department during community presentations about police work. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty students in grades seven and eight from Columbus Tustin Middle School 
produced the video, calling it "What Is Suspicious?" 
</P>
<P>
 The video includes simulation of a car theft and shows people how to make an 
emergency 911 call. It also gives tips on recognizing a suspicious person and 
illustrates the procedure police officers follow from the time they are 
dispatched from the police station to when they arrest a suspect, said John 
Mirarchi, a Tustin police community resource officer who has coordinated the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in Orange County that students have produced a videotape 
for a police department," Mirarchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Police Department does not produce its own training videos because 
of budget constraints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirarchi said he outlined the scenarios, but the students wrote the script and 
shot the video. The production took several weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus Tustin, one of four middle schools in the community, has offered a 
video production class, paid for by a state grant, for the past two years, said 
Kathy Sampson, who teaches the class. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the students videotaped classroom projects, emergency 
preparedness drills, holiday programs and school board meetings, Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the police project, students were divided into three teams, each with a 
director and two for camera work. They shot the video at the Rancho Mariposa 
apartments in Tustin Ranch and at the police headquarters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are now editing, dubbing and adding music, special effects, 
titles and credits to the video at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Once completed, the video will be used in police training, shown at 
neighborhood watch meetings, community events and as a public service 
announcement on local cable's Channel 33. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHAMBER WILL OFFER GREEN CARD RENEWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigrants who need to renew their green cards are invited to take advantage 
of outreach services offered by the British American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service has agreed to let the chamber 
process renewal forms for green cards on Jan. 10, Feb. 7 and April 7, said 
Valerie Blackholly, the chamber's executive director.Immigrants from any 
country may participate. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials announced plans in 1993 to replace and update all green cards 
issued before 1978. Cardholders must obtain new ones by March 20, Blackholly 
said. Some legal immigrants may not be aware that their cards will expire, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the chamber's program must make an appointment. They will 
receive forms and instructions in the mail, and are asked to take completed 
forms with them when they go to the outreach office.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll only take 20 minutes of their time," Blackholly said. "There will be no 
taking numbers and waiting hours."  
</P>
<P>
 Normally, renewing a green card means standing in line with hundreds of others 
at INS offices in downtown Los Angeles or Westminster, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make an appointment, call the chamber at (714) 452-9292. LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 The Westminster Fire Department has taken on the added duties of code 
enforcement in a six-month experiment to determine if the action is effective 
and could save the city some money. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to say if the idea is working, but based on statistics for 
November, the Fire Department's four-man team has been kept busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about trash and debris were the most numerous, followed by banner 
and sign violation issues, particularly in the Little Saigon area.  
</P>
<P>
 But Donald C. Tully, chief of the fire prevention division now handling code 
enforcement, said that 76% of the complaints were resolved with one inspection 
and a follow-up. Today 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fair & Exposition Center continues to offer an exhibit of 
World War II memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local veterans have lent their own letters and photos for display, and 
the fair has gathered information and items from the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair is on land that was once part of the Santa Ana Army Air Base, and 
mementos from the facility are also on display. Admission is free to this 
exhibit, open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the fairgrounds. Information: (714)

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PROBLEMS ENDURE AT BELEAGUERED MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after a nonprofit agency leased the Chateau Motel and promised to 
turn the former trouble spot into a job-training center and home for the 
disabled, the establishment is still vacant, still an eyesore and still a 
problem, some community members say. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at 6719 Sepulveda Blvd., the motel -- where rooms once rented for $13 
an hour -- has been the site of prostitution, drug use, at least one murder and 
several stabbings over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of community groups in October, 1993, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude asked the city's zoning administration to investigate 
the motel, along with 10 others between Sherman Way and Magnolia Boulevard on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the city declared the Chateau Motel a public nuisance, citing a 
sharp increase in crimes and arrests attributed to the motel since 1991, and 
other negative effects on the community.  
</P>
<P>
 The motel's owners, listed in city records as Jin Chang Yang and Guey Dan Hwu, 
did not appeal the city's ruling or a list of 27 conditions imposed on the 
motel that would have allowed it to continue to operate. On March 17, the 
motel's operating permit was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city's action, Asian Pacific Community Services, a Westminster-based 
nonprofit group, signed a two-year lease with the owners of the 46-unit motel, 
promising to convert the building into a job-training center for the mentally 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, with support from the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., local 
Neighborhood Watch groups and the Town Keepers Action Group, the organization 
began cleaning out the rooms and selling the few remaining pieces of shabby 
furniture not stolen by vagrants and others who invaded the property after it 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months later, community members say no visible sign of improvement 
is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Woo, Asian Pacific's executive director, said delays resulted because 
initial cost estimates of work required at the motel were far lower than actual 
costs. TIM MAY

MAN, TEEN-AGER HELD IN DEATH OF BEVERLY HILLS SHOP OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood man and a teen-ager were arrested Thursday in the fatal shooting 
of a Beverly Hills clothing store owner during an apparent robbery earlier this 
month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police surrounded an apartment in the 300 block of West 
Hillcrest Boulevard in Inglewood before dawn Thursday and arrested Martin Earl 
Dawson, 25, and an unidentified 15-year-old boy without incident, police 
said.They were booked on suspicion of murder and armed robbery in the Dec. 7 
slaying of Sherry Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 45, was discovered shot to death in her Olympic Boulevard gown rental 
shop, Starlit Soiree, which is on the second floor of a mini-mall in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it did not appear that cash was taken from the small store, robbery 
apparently was the motive, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Joe Lombardi. A 
diamond ring Morgan usually wore was believed to have been taken in the holdup, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said physical evidence found in the shop linked Dawson to the crime, 
but they declined to be specific. A small handgun that matches the caliber of 
the murder weapon was found in the suspects' apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said a person matching the description of Dawson was seen 
entering Morgan's store between 6:30 and 7 p.m. the night of the slaying. The 
man then went into an adjacent jewelry store, apparently casing the area for 
possible robberies, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson was being held without bail in Beverly Hills Municipal Jail, and the 
youth has been turned over to Los Angeles County juvenile authorities, police 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; POST OFFICES TO BEGIN DELIVERING TAX FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YVETTE CABRERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most people, it's a piece of mail they dread receiving, especially during 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the past three years, the Internal Revenue Service has been nice enough 
to wait until the new year to send out tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual mailing flurry, however, began in mid-December when the IRS sent 
its first bulk of packages to Orange County's post offices as well as to post 
offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mass mailing that the United States Postal Service described as one of 
its biggest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 With 109 million taxpayers nationwide, the IRS must send out 86 million tax 
forms, plus an additional 23 million postcards to those who use tax preparers 
already stocked with tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that tax forms can start being delivered by Jan. 3, the IRS mailed 
the forms to local post offices weeks ahead time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been receiving booklets since the mid-part of December, zip code by 
zip code, but the instructions are to not deliver them before the third of 
January," said Bob Gillis, plant manager at the Orange County Processing and 
Distribution Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County alone will receive 1 million tax-form packages. All tax forms 
are sent to the Processing and Distribution Center in Santa Ana and are then 
shipped off and stored in each city's post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, tax forms arrived in mailboxes right around Christmas, 
but now the delivery date falls on the day after the new year begins. This year 
it is Jan. 3 because of the observed Monday holiday, said Santa Ana Postmaster 
Rosemarie Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago, the IRS used to deliver the week between Christmas and New 
Year's Day," said Fernandez. "We speculate that the IRS changed its delivery 
dates because it didn't want to be sending out tax forms during the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax form package includes the 1040 and 1040A tax forms, tax tables, tax 
rate schedules, an instruction booklet and basic schedules and attachments 
required to report certain income and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the package also will include customer service standards 
that explain how IRS employees are instructed to deal with customers, said 
Keith Kimball, public affairs specialist in the IRS district office in Los 
Angeles.YVETTE CABRERA

WOMAN, 74, STABBED 20 TIMES IN HOME; CRIME: A 17-YEAR-OLD NEIGHBOR IS ARRESTED 
IN THE ASSAULT AND APPARENT ROBBERY. THE VICTIM, WHO WAS FOUND HANDCUFFED IN 
HER KITCHEN, IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

 A 17-year-old boy was arrested Thursday in the attack and apparent robbery of 
an elderly woman who was stabbed 20 times with a butcher knife and handcuffed 
to a drain pipe in the kitchen of her Reseda home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Aline Rose, 74, was able to whisper the name of her assailant to 
officers before she underwent surgery for stab wounds in her hands, neck and 
torso, said Detective Rick Swanston of the Los Angeles Police Department.Rose 
was listed in critical condition at a hospital Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing his name from Rose, police arrested the teen-ager on suspicion 
of attempted murder, Swanston said. The boy was taken into custody at a Reseda 
fast-food restaurant where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe she knew the youth," Swanston said. "They were neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has lived alone in a home in the 18200 block of Strathern Street since 
her husband died several years ago, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her alleged assailant lived about a block away in the 8000 block of Wynne 
Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators estimate that the stabbing occurred early Thursday afternoon. 
Shortly before 3 p.m., a neighbor, concerned because he had not seen Rose all 
day, climbed through an unlocked window and found her semiconscious and 
bleeding. A butcher knife was recovered at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood residents were shocked by the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a sweetheart of a gal," said Rick Kahana, 37, another neighbor and 
friend. "I can't imagine anybody would want to hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Federico, who has lived next door to Rose for 32 years, said the woman 
lived a quiet life and worked as a caretaker at the church across the street 
from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she has an enemy in the whole world," said Federico, 69, a 
retired restaurateur.

OFFICERS LAY SLAIN COLLEAGUE TO REST; FAREWELL: HUNDREDS ATTEND FUNERAL OF 
THOMAS WORLEY, WHO WAS KILLED IN A GUN BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON and CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Worley looked out from a church pulpit Thursday at hundreds of police 
officers who had come to mourn his son, a Los Angeles County Safety Police 
officer slain just days before Christmas in a gun battle with a robbery 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope you can join us in hope," he said at the funeral of Thomas 
Benton Worley. "Because death will not have the last word here. Life will have 
the last word here." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, police officers from all over Southern California lifted their hymn 
books in unison and belted out a rousing rendition of "On Eagles' Wings" -- a 
vibrant tribute to Worley, who had dreamed his whole life of being a police 
officer, and died living out his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 33, was shot Dec. 21 in the crowded parking lot of a Canoga Park strip 
mall after confronting Jesus Valenzuela, 44, who witnesses said had just held 
up a discount shoe store in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worley identified himself as a police officer, investigators said, 
Valenzuela shot at him. The officer returned fire. Worley, who was off duty and 
not wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the chest and groin and died about 
90 minutes later. Valenzuela, an ex-convict with three robbery convictions, was 
wounded and died within the hour from internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral Thursday at the First United Methodist Church of Santa Monica, 
family, friends and law enforcement officials sought to understand how it was 
that Worley and Valenzuela came to square off in a suburban mini-mall parking 
lot, with both ending up mortally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 What was particularly difficult to accept, mourners said, was that Worley died 
so young -- leaving a young wife, Pam, 29, and two young children, Christina, 
6, and Matthew, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom is my brother and right now, as with everyone else in this room, I can 
make no sense of this," said Charles Worley, 23. "It's tugging at my ability to 
make sense of much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was solace to be found, mourners said, it was in the fact that Thomas 
Worley had a lifelong passion for police work. His brother called it "a huge 
love in his heart" that elevated police work to a patriotic duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley had served as a policeman in the Air Force, worked as a private 
security guard when he got out, and then, 18 months ago, was accepted into the 
Safety Police, the sworn officers who provide security for county facilities 
such as office buildings and hospitals.

 A retired Van Nuys man was killed when he was struck by two cars as he 
attempted to cross the street outside a crosswalk at Victory Boulevard near the 
intersection of Gloria Avenue, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gureghian, 62, who lived less than one mile from the accident scene, 
was pronounced dead upon arrival at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys on 
Wednesday, said Officer Bill Rice of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The first car that hit Gureghian was driven by Steve Meinster, 43, a 
construction worker from Van Nuys. The driver of the second car, Danny Dam, of 
Rosemead, didn't see Gureghian lying in the street, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither motorist was cited for the accident, which occurred at about 6 p.m., 
Rice said. CHIP JOHNSON

 The great-granddaughter of the founder of Knott's Berry Farm has regained 
consciousness, a month after she was bludgeoned by an unknown attacker in her 
San Diego County home, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire Anderson, 17, of Fallbrook was moved to an undisclosed rehabilitation 
center in San Diego on Wednesday after regaining consciousness at Palomar 
Medical Center in Escondido, where she had been hospitalized since the Nov. 28 
attack.Her condition was upgraded to fair from serious, hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators, who have not interviewed Anderson, said they do not expect 
her to lead them to the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if she recovers 100%, it's not likely she'll remember anything," said 
homicide Lt. Doug Clements of the San Diego Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have said Anderson might have been asleep at the time of the 
attack, which occurred shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's grandmother said Thursday that she was too shaken to discuss the 
girl's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really not lucid," said Marion Knott of Newport Beach. "I think being 
in rehab is a hopeful sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members had offered a $10,000 reward for information in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements said police have no leading suspects and have dismissed a number of 
tips. Among the suspects who didn't pan out was a parolee who lives in the same 
semirural neighborhood where Anderson lives on a four-acre ranch with her 
mother, Diane Anderson. Attempts to reach Diane Anderson were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire Anderson, the great-granddaughter of park founder Walter Knott, is a 
senior and honor student at Fallbrook High School. Relatives said she excelled 
in French and was also training as a competitive figure skater. She had planned 
to apply to colleges this month in hopes of becoming a doctor someday, family 
members said.

SUIT SAYS DEAF-MUTE WAS ABUSED ON BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deaf and mute Alhambra teen-ager has sued the city's high school district, 
saying she was sexually abused by two male students on a school bus in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was 15 when the alleged incidents occurred, said that on Jan. 3, 
4, 5 and 7, the two juveniles threatened to kill her or report her and her 
family to immigration authorities if she did not perform oral sex on one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, the girl also alleges that on several occasions the boys 
removed articles of her clothing and touched her breasts, buttocks and other 
parts of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the final incident, according to the lawsuit, the girl and her 
mother complained to officials of Alhambra and its high school district, but no 
action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who communicates with sign language and writing, is still forced to 
ride on the same bus and to attend the same school as the boys, according to 
the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages from the boys and their families 
and from Durham Transportation, operator of the bus line, as well as from the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

LARRY OWEN; FORMER DIRECTOR OF 'TODAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Owen, who began a lengthy career in television as a page for NBC and 
later directed the network's "Today" show, has died at a hospital here. He was 
69. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Burbank resident, Owen died Tuesday of leukemia at St. Joseph 
Medical Center, said his son, Bill Owen of Poway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his son, Owen joined NBC as a page at its Rockefeller Center 
headquarters in New York during the 1950s. He rose through the network ranks, 
working as a stage manager for a variety of programs during television's Golden 
Age. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early 1960s, he landed at the "Today" show, where he worked as an 
associate director, said Jim Straka, the show's former stage manager. Owen 
eventually became the show's director during the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very generous with his friends," Straka recalled of their years 
together in New York. "He gave a great deal of time to his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen left "Today" and relocated to Burbank in the mid-1970s, where he produced 
spots for the network's evening newscast. He retired about 10 years ago, his 
son said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Lawrence Joseph Owen Jr. in Cleveland on April 30, 1925, he grew up in 
New York, the son of a musician in Guy Lombardo's orchestra. He served in the 
Navy during World War II and briefly attended junior college before joining 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Owen is survived by two daughters, Lynette Kay of 
Burbank and Robin Roccaro of San Diego, and five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at Foursquare Church, 269 
E. Providencia Ave., Burbank. Aftercare California Cremation & Burial Society 
in North Hollywood is handling the arrangements.

MOTORIST ROBBED AFTER PARKING CAR; CRIME: POLICE SAY THE HOLD-UP OF A MERCEDES- 
BENZ DRIVER WAS THE 15TH FOLLOW-HOME CRIME THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Thieves struck again late Wednesday in the northwestern San Fernando Valley, 
bringing to 15 the total number of so-called follow-home robberies in the area 
this month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, a man robbed a North Hills woman near midnight after 
she parked her Mercedes-Benz in the garage of her home in the 15800 block of 
Plummer Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man escaped in a waiting car with the woman's purse and $537. 
</P>
<P>
 But police say the robbery does not appear to be the work of two groups 
suspected in several of the 10 robberies reported in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Devonshire Division this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Valley, there have been four follow-home robberies reported this 
month, Lt. George Rock said. One follow-home robbery was also reported in the 
northeast Valley's Foothill Division this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are also investigating whether the same culprits are linked to 
five additional follow-home robberies that took place between August and 
November in the northwestern Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Police know that at least some of the crimes are related because a purse 
stolen in one of the West Valley robberies was recovered at the scene of a 
second follow-home robbery in the Devonshire Division on the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, a 52-year-old man was shot in the chest as he tried to 
retrieve valuables stolen at gunpoint from his family when they arrived home in 
the 17100 block of Prairie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Bob Normandy said one group is suspected of committing nine of the 
crimes, in which two to four bandits pointed a gun at their victims and ordered 
them to hand over valuables. Another group is suspected of committing five 
additional robberies involving mostly Asian victims that took place north of 
the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that no suspects have been identified. Officers from the LAPD's 
elite Metropolitan Division continue to assist in the investigation, and 
Neighborhood Watch groups have been alerted to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives have been unable to determine how the robbers picked their victims, 
who were followed from a variety of locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police are baffled," Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who was robbed Wednesday, for example, told police she did not 
notice anyone following her from her job Downtown to her North Hills home. 
Other victims were on their way home from shopping malls and, in at least one 
case, a Ventura Boulevard restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week four members of a Van Nuys family were tied up for two hours while 
two men ransacked their house. And a Granada Hills man was shot in the shoulder 
when he fled from robbers.

THEIR NUMBER IS UP; TRAFFIC: MOTORISTS IN THOUSAND OAKS SLOW DOWN WHEN THEY SEE 
THEIR SPEEDS ANNOUNCED AHEAD IN HUGE YELLOW FIGURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of cars zooming down Thousand Oaks Boulevard zoomed a little more 
slowly Thursday as police unveiled a new radar trailer that confronted speeders 
with their crimes in foot-high yellow numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8,000 solar-powered trailer, one of two that will be placed throughout 
the city of Thousand Oaks, drew mixed opinions from passing motorists, but a 
uniform reaction: They dropped their speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're slowing down. They're backing way off," said Lt. Mike Brown, watching 
the radar trailer's digital readout plummet from 48 m.p.h. to 38 m.p.h. as 
drivers realized what the roadside contraption was. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if drivers reduced their speed, they were not necessarily happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it. That's why I carry a Fuzzbuster," said one driver stopped at 
a nearby red light, proudly pointing to the radar detector on his dashboard 
before blasting away in his jet-black luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others said they would like to see the trailers moved to their own 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want people speeding down their streets when kids are playing," 
said Cmdr. Kathryn Kemp, explaining the sentiments that have led residents to 
request special speed patrols at more than a dozen locations in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The three traffic officers usually on duty are hard-pressed to monitor 
speeding traffic, as well as handle crashes, officials said. The trailers, 
which can be moved about and then left unattended, will make it easier for the 
department to fulfill demands for service, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trailer's debut Thursday afternoon, cars sped by going as fast as 59 
m.p.h. The speed limit on Thousand Oaks Boulevard is 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some more expensive radar trailers recently installed elsewhere in 
California, the Thousand Oaks devices do not carry video cameras and do not 
automatically issue tickets to speeders. In fact, most of the speeders who 
passed by Thursday on Thousand Oaks Boulevard escaped scot-free. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will not always be so lucky. "Just because this is here doesn't mean 
there isn't a traffic officer down the road another block and a half," Brown 
said, warning that officers will periodically be stationed near the trailers to 
write tickets to the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without getting tickets, drivers confronted with the trailers will slow 
down and become more conscious of their driving habits, police said. The 
readouts can also help motorists calibrate their speedometers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar trailers came to Camarillo in 1990 and will soon be operating along 
roadsides in Moorpark, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what they called "horror stories" about drivers speeding up as fast as 
possible as they approach unstaffed radar trailers, police said they believe 
most will slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always going to be a few that don't care, but the vast majority 
will take heed," Brown said.

MOORPARK OFFICIALS PREDICT FISCAL SLUMP WILL END IN '95; DEVELOPMENT: MANY HOPE 
THE PROMISE OF NEW HOUSING, STORES AND PERHAPS A NEW FACTORY WILL TURN AROUND 
THE FINANCIAL MALAISE OF THE '90S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Predicting that the coming year will end an economic slump for Moorpark, city 
officials say they hope that 1995 will see the biggest increase in local 
development since the boom years of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time Moorpark was one of California's fastest growing communities. 
Tripling in size in about seven years and issuing so many building permits -- 
about 1,900 in 1986 alone -- it accumulated roughly $2 million in surplus funds 
through fees collected from developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that surplus declined to about $150,000 this year, a result of the city's 
growth rate dropping from a high of 200% at one point in the 1980s to about 2% 
annually over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 While no city representative wants to repeat the growth the town experienced 
in the 1980s, many are hoping that the promise of new housing, new stores and 
the possibility of a new factory will turn around the financial malaise of the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of good things happening for Moorpark in the coming year," 
Councilman Scott Montgomery said. "The new developments will bring a lot of 
needed facilities. They will bring employment. Home values will rise again. 
People will be able to stay in town for their entertainment and to shop. The 
future looks good."  
</P>
<P>
 City leaders want Moorpark to be more than just a bedroom community for Los 
Angeles. They hope an increasing number of residents will not only choose to 
live in the city, but work there, shop there, and stay there for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, city leaders are boasting about a proposed shopping center 
and theater complex at Mission Bell Plaza on Los Angeles Avenue expected to be 
finished by next fall.  
</P>
<P>
 And to bring more jobs to the city, Moorpark officials hope their efforts to 
lure a Newhall-based manufacturing company -- Special Devices Inc. -- and its 
more than 700 jobs to the city will pay off in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials helped work out an incentive package for the company 
worth about $1.6 million, and are hoping that state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley) and Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) will be able to pass 
legislation worth more than $5 million in tax credits for the company if it 
relocates to Moorpark. But Special Devices officials have yet to make up their 
minds on the offer and are considering a move to Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the company and its workers relocate to Moorpark, several plans 
guarantee that the city will see new housing to accommodate newcomers by the 
end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 One company, Urban West, will probably complete the Mountain Meadows housing 
development with the construction of about 270 multifamily dwellings off 
Mountain Trail Street on the southwest side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 On the southeast side, construction is expected to begin on some of the 552 
residences planned by the Carlsberg Development Co. on its 500 acres. Also, the 
city hopes to begin work in 1995 on its first affordable housing project -- 50 
residences planned for Gisler Field off Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the activity from housing construction, there will be a flurry of 
activity by city officials as they begin environmental impact reviews involving 
several other larger projects. 
</P>
<P>
 These projects include the Messenger Investment Co.'s plan to build more than 
3,000 residences on the northeastern side of town, the Levy Co.'s plans for 620 
housing units on the north side of Poindexter Avenue, and a project involving 
216 luxury houses proposed by the Bollinger Development Co. on 400 acres 
between Grimes Canyon Road and Walnut Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're seeing is really based on what every other city is experiencing," 
said Jim Aguilera, Moorpark's director of community development. "The economy 
is improving."  
</P>
<P>
 With its rolling hills, small-town feel and reasonable housing prices all 
within commuting distance to Los Angeles, Moorpark is still a highly desirable 
locale, real estate specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Department has started to receive inquiries nearly every 
day from development companies interested in building in the city, Aguilera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And those inquiries very likely will continue. City officials and residents 
alike want to ensure that any growth in the city is carefully managed. But 
exactly how to do that remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's existing slow-growth ordinance -- called Measure F -- limits the 
number of new housing units in the city to 250 each year. But it expires at the 
end of 1995, and the city had planned to pass a new ordinance then that would 
be similar in terms of limits on new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders, however, are backing away from that plan because of the 
experience of Oceanside, which lost a six-year legal battle over a similar 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Oceanside case it's apparent that we're going to have to take a 
second look at the ordinance," Councilman John Wozniak said. "It looks like 
we'll have to get away from numerical caps. There's no sense in spending 
millions and millions of dollars defending something that is not legally 
defensible." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with just how to manage growth within Moorpark, city officials are also 
being saddled with managing growth on the city's periphery. Two large golf 
courses proposed for Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park and an endangered species 
zoo proposed for Oak Park on the east side of town have Wozniak worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Wozniak said information on the projects was kept from the city by county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have projects at our front door and our back door and we were left out of 
the process," Wozniak said. "What we've learned from that is that this year we 
are going to have to make sure we are part of the process from here on in. 
We're going to lobby our newly elected supervisor and we're not going to take 
an 'I'll get back to you' response."

WOMAN, 74, STABBED 20 TIMES IN HOME; YOUTH ARRESTED; CRIMES: POLICE SAY SHE WAS 
HANDCUFFED TO A DRAIN PIPE IN KITCHEN OF HER RESEDA HOUSE. SHE UNDERGOES 
SURGERY AND IS EXPECTED TO LIVE. THE SUSPECT LIVES NEARBY.

<P>
 Los Angeles police arrested a 17-year-old boy Thursday in the attack on an 
elderly woman who was stabbed 20 times with a butcher knife and handcuffed to a 
drain pipe in the kitchen of her Reseda home, apparently during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Aline Rose, 74, was able to whisper the name of her assailant to 
officers before she underwent surgery for stab wounds to her hands, neck and 
torso, LAPD Detective Rick Swanston said. Rose was listed in critical condition 
Thursday evening, but was expected to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the crucial lead, police arrested a teen-ager who lived nearby, 
Swanston said. The boy, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, 
was taken into custody at a Reseda fast-food restaurant where he worked. He was 
expected to be booked on attempted murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe she knew the youth," Swanston said. "They were neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has lived alone in the house in the 18200 block of Strathern Street since 
her husband died several years ago, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her alleged assailant lives about a block away in the 8000 block of Wynne 
Avenue, police said. Neighbors described him as a "quirky" teen-ager who moved 
into the neighborhood just a few months ago and often rode his bike up and down 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanston said his investigators believe the stabbing occurred early Thursday 
afternoon. Shortly before 3 p.m., a neighbor, concerned because he had not seen 
Rose all day, climbed through an unlocked window and found her semiconscious 
and bleeding from numerous stab wounds. A butcher knife was recovered at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Rose came near the end of a year marked by violence against 
elderly residents in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a house fire led police to the discovery of Berneda McMackin, 77, 
who had been fatally beaten and stabbed inside her Van Nuys home. A few days 
later and a few miles away, Aliza Levi, 72, died in a similar fashion after 
startling a burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared robbery was the motive for the attack against Rose, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe some property was taken," Swanston said. He declined to elaborate 
on what items were stolen, the nature of Rose's relationship with the youth or 
whether he had confessed to the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the close-knit neighborhood were shocked by Thursday's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a sweetheart of a gal," said Rick Kahana, 37, another neighbor and 
friend. "I can't imagine anybody would want to hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Federico, who has lived next door to Rose for 32 years, said the 
elderly woman lived a quiet life, and worked as a caretaker at the church 
across the street from her home where she attended services. She had her own 
set of keys to the church, Federico said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she has an enemy in the whole world," said Federico, a 
69-year-old retired restaurateur. "Whoever did this is a crazy, desperate 
person. I am sick about this."

CONGREGANTS' FAITH KEY TO SYNAGOGUE'S EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Alan Greenbaum was thrilled when a grimy yellow bulldozer began clearing 
the field next to Temple Adat Elohim this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, Thousand Oaks' only Reform Jewish congregation will boast a new 
home -- a spacious synagogue, a social hall, a teen lounge and a cluster of 
classrooms. As the blue-and-white banner on the temple's front door proclaims, 
"We're Building." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite general rejoicing at the bulldozer's rumble, the first step in the 
long-awaited construction, Temple Adat Elohim did not hold a formal 
groundbreaking ceremony. Fact is, the congregation had already celebrated the 
groundbreaking in a 1991 ritual that proved three years premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sort of lost our credibility after that one," Greenbaum said sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were too embarrassed to hold another," added congregation President Zelda 
Finestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even without formal hoopla, ground has been broken. And this time, it's 
for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost incredulous," Finestone said. "I can't believe it's really 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Adat Elohim's congregation began planning the $2-million expansion nearly 
seven years ago. By the late 1980s, organizers were ready to begin 
fund-raising. Just then, the recession hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still hoping they could pull it off, leaders of the 400-family congregation 
set up an optimistic groundbreaking ceremony in an effort to whip up 
enthusiasm. It took another three years, however, for them to gather enough 
donations to actually start work. 
</P>
<P>
 With $600,000 in the treasury and a $900,000 loan from Los Robles National 
Bank, the congregation finally hired contractors this fall. They have watched 
with pleasure as the field has been graded to a level plain. "It's been a long 
time coming," Greenbaum said with evident relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregation leaders expect the new sanctuary's shell to be ready by spring. 
If they can drum up enough cash, they hope to finish the interior by fall, in 
time for the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do a lot of praying," Finestone said. "You need a lot of faith and a lot 
of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 As the only Reform Jewish congregation between West Hills and Camarillo, 
Temple Adat Elohim draws worshipers from all over eastern Ventura County, 
Agoura Hills and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Its no-frills sanctuary, with a peaked wooden ceiling and rows of plastic 
orange chairs, overflows during major Jewish holidays. In fact, to accommodate 
the crowds, Greenbaum has moved Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services to a 
nearby church for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sanctuary will seat 380, more than double the current capacity. And 
the back wall will swing aside to open up still more seating in the social 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A new feature for Temple Adat Elohim, the social hall will allow members to 
celebrate weddings and bar mitzvahs in their own synagogue, instead of hotel 
ballrooms. The temple will also use the space to host community events -- 
including free dinners for homeless people and the Conejo Valley's annual 
ecumenical Thanksgiving service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll play more of an equal part in the community," Greenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's all sorts of things you can expand to, once you have the room and the 
money," Finestone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the temple has suffered several anti-Semitic attacks in the past 
decade, the expansion has drawn no protest, Greenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the temple's ambitious plans for expanded religious programs and 
community service have sparked renewed interest in the 26-year-old 
congregation. About 30 new families have joined Adat Elohim this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a voluntary dues program, each family contributes to the temple's annual 
$700,000 budget. This year's recommended donation for a two-parent family with 
children was $1,200, congregation member Robert Murray said. That figure could 
jump in future years because of the new construction, Murray acknowledged. And 
all families will be tapped in the aggressive fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the expense, most congregation members welcome Adat Elohim's 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm excited, to put it mildly," Audrey Benesch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing her attitude, congregation member Charlotte Lewis said simply: "It 
has to be."

WAN TO HEAD CAL STATE FULLERTON'S SCIENCE AND MATH EDUCATION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An innovator in science education has been selected director of Cal State 
Fullerton's center for science and math education, officials announced.  
</P>
<P>
 Julia C. Wan will become the new director of the campus's Center for 
Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education effective Saturday, Cal State 
Fullerton spokeswoman Paula Selleck said.The center is a cooperative venture 
between the university's schools of Natural Science and Mathematics as well as 
Human Development and Community Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Wan took a leave from her post as assistant superintendent for curriculum and 
instruction for the Bainbridge Island (Wash.) School District two years ago to 
work for the National Science Foundation, Selleck said. She developed projects 
in various states to improve elementary- and secondary-level math and science 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the center, Wan will be charged with reworking Cal State 
Fullerton's teacher education programs to fit new national standards in 
mathematics and science education. The center aims to help elementary school 
instructors teach children scientific principles from an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 Wan has worked both in public elementary and secondary schools and held posts 
as an adjunct faculty member at two universities in her career, Selleck said. 
At Cal State Fullerton, Wan will hold the title of adjunct professor of science 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned her doctorate in educational administration and supervision from 
Boston College, and earned her master's degree in chemistry and bachelor's 
degree in physics at Wellesley College.

AND A NON-FATAL SHOOTING IN PANORAMA CITY WERE GANG-RELATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

apparent gang-related killing in Van Nuys, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandro Navarro died shortly after 12:30 a.m. after a confrontation in the 7100 
block of Valjean Avenue near Sherman Way, Los Angeles police said.Navarro had 
apparently been standing with a group of friends, including his brother, when 
he got into a fight with two other men. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County deputy marshal trying to serve an arrest warrant on an 
assault suspect shot the man at his front door Thursday following a scuffle, 
police said. Tyrone Mathews, 40, was shot in the stomach at 9:30 a.m. at his 
home in the 4800 block of East Maychelle Drive, Police Lt. Vince Howard 
said.Mathews, who was wanted on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, was 
in stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics treated the marshal, whom police would not identify, for minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard would not say whether Mathews was armed, but said the marshal's 
injuries did not result from a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident is still under investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all officer-involved shootings, the Orange County district attorney's 
office is conducting an investigation.

SLAIN MOUNTAIN LION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Slain Mountain Lion Is One That Killed Hiker," Dec. 13: If a person gets 
hit by a car, do we shoot the car? If a person gets killed by a mountain lion, 
why do we kill the mountain lion? 
</P>
<P>
 There are risks associated with all of our activities. We knowingly accept 
these risks when we drive on the roads or go hiking in areas where we know 
there are mountain lions. Should we kill all the mountain lions and other 
wildlife so there are no risks to going hiking in the national forests?

U.S. PRESENCE IN SOUTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chalmers Johnson's commentary on North Korea, "A Spark That Might Ignite" 
(Dec. 20), is ill-timed and ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's assertion that the downing of a U.S. army helicopter by North Korea 
may be an incident that may ignite a full-scale war is a grossly exaggerated 
fear. Furthermore, his call for the withdrawal of the American ground troops 
from South Korea before they become "hostage" to "hair-trigger" hostilities is 
reckless and dangerous. His apprehension may stem from his lack of 
understanding and appreciation of the genesis of the artificial division of 
Korea by the former Soviet Union and United States at the end of the World War 
II. Hence, the United States has borne a moral and political responsibility in 
the Korean problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that the presence of the American ground troops in 
South Korea for the past 41 years has played a crucial role of preventing 
possible outbreak of another Korean war ever since the signing of the armistice 
agreement in July of 1953. Their military and psychological impact should be 
neither underestimated nor ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the history of enmity and mistrust between the two Koreas, it would be 
ill-advised and irresponsible for the United States to leave and let the two 
well-equipped armies totaling more than 1.5 million people confront each other 
across the demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Korean peninsula has not yet seen the end of the Cold War, there 
have been some encouraging movements for the past several years in the 
direction of detente and peaceful cooperation, namely, South Korea's 
normalization of diplomatic relations with two archenemies, Russia and China. 
At this critical juncture, it is extremely important that we do not send wrong 
signals to the North Korean leadership as they are engaged in the succession 
process following the death of their paramount leader, Kim Il Sung.  
</P>
<P>
 For the United States and South Korea now, it is critically important to 
maintain a steady course along with Japan to encourage North Korea to 
faithfully implement all the provisions of the U.S.-North Korea nuclear 
agreement in exchange for economic assistance and diplomatic rapprochement. 
However, the question of full diplomatic recognition and ambassadorial 
exchanges between the United States and North Korea should proceed along with 
meaningful progress in North-South dialogue for peaceful coexistence and 
cooperation. Meaningful progress must include reunification of separated 
families between North and South Korea, mutual verification of 
non-nuclearization, economic and cultural exchanges, and an eventual peace 
agreement and disarmament.

POST-RIOT RECOVERY: AND MILES STILL TO GO . . .; MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL 
INITIATIVES, PLUS PRIVATE PROGRAMS, REMAIN CRUCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake shoved the 1992 riots from the consciousness of most 
disaster-weary Southern Californians. Rebuilding homes, businesses and lives 
damaged by the catastrophic temblor took precedence over making the city whole 
after riot fires were extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Jan. 17 quake, Washington sent billions of dollars in 
assistance to homeowners, business owners and poor people who lost homes, 
possessions or jobs. The flood of reconstruction diverted inspectors, 
contractors and others who had been working to repair riot damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The feds didn't rush to rebuild after the 1992 civil disorder, which killed 58 
and damaged or destroyed 2,314 businesses. Washington did allocate more than $1 
billion, but much of that went to cover emergency costs and expenses related to 
the disaster, such as lost jobs and lost businesses. Then-President George Bush 
promised an "urban enterprise zone" to provide incentives for businesses to 
invest in poor areas of Los Angeles, but he ended up vetoing the pork-laden 
bill that emerged from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration refined the notion, and last year Congress 
established the concept known as federal empowerment zones, complete with tax 
breaks for employers and new social spending to help disadvantaged workers. But 
this month Los Angeles -- scandalously -- was rejected in applying for the 
coveted empowerment-zone designation. Absent such help from Washington, the 
post-riot recovery is left mainly to local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA REMAINS A KEY PLAYER: In the immediate aftermath of the urban violence, 
then-Mayor Tom Bradley directed most of the recovery planning to a newly formed 
organization, Rebuild Los Angeles. The original RLA team concentrated on luring 
corporate America to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last February, there has been a new RLA leadership team, headed by Linda 
Griego, who is a former deputy mayor, and Lodwrick M. Cook, retiring chairman 
of Arco. RLA has about 2 1/2 years left to achieve the promises made after the 
riots; it is scheduled to go out of business in 1997, after a life of five 
years. The RLA mission remains rebuilding, but it is broader now. 
</P>
<P>
 As RLA president, Griego is putting to use her civic experience and her 
background as an entrepreneur (she is one of the developers of Engine Co. No. 
28, the trendy Downtown eatery) and is concentrating on creating jobs and 
redeveloping lots left vacant in the areas most heavily hit by the fires and 
vandalism. In these historically neglected neighborhoods, RLA has organized 
networks of companies in the furniture, toy manufacturing and metalwork 
industries. These small and medium-sized businesses tackle common obstacles to 
growth such as access to investment capital and new markets, finding skilled 
workers and negotiating environmental and other regulations. If the firms 
expand, they will create additional jobs in neighborhoods that sorely need more 
employment. To help manufacturers sell their products, RLA via a computer 
on-line system is linking companies with purchasers at major corporations. If 
big businesses buy locally, more local residents will have jobs. Jobs are as 
important as new stores and services in the affected neighborhoods, for 
unemployment, poverty and related social problems fed the civil disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering from the worst urban upheaval in U.S. history will require a 
multitude of privately funded rebuilding efforts. However, government -- in 
Washington, Sacramento and City Hall -- must not abandon its responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A LESSON FOR LOS ANGELES: Mayor Richard Riordan, a consummate deal maker, 
should persuade more of his friends -- corporate leaders, elite lawyers, 
bankers and foundation heads -- to win the necessary agreements and commit the 
time and resources needed to make projects pay off in the form of jobs and 
services in poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 He also must take to heart lessons learned from the city's failed attempt to 
get a federal empowerment zone; yes, Washington politics may have played a part 
in the rejection but there's no denying that Los Angeles hurt itself through 
its disorganized, less-than-stellar application. Riordan should take a sharp 
look at what went wrong -- as he would scrutinize any disappointing business 
deal -- and take steps to ensure that such a mistake does not recur.  
</P>
<P>
 And President Clinton, surely anxious to keep in the good graces of California 
voters, must find a way to get Los Angeles an empowerment zone that will 
encourage employers to do businesses in, and hire from, poor neighborhoods. 
Only that will bring about a complete recovery and prevent a repeat of a sorry 
bit of Los Angeles history. Thirty years ago, Watts exploded. That tragedy 
spurred a commercial and middle-class exodus that was never reversed. Such a 
dreadful departure should not be allowed to become the permanent legacy of the 
1992 Los Angeles riots.

IN FROM THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R. James Woolsey is a good man who took over direction of the Central 
Intelligence Agency at what was perhaps the worst time in its history. During 
his short tenure he was severely criticized for failing to radically change an 
excessively self-protective bureaucracy that had developed over decades. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shrinking number of supporters on Capitol Hill and denied regular 
access to President Clinton -- a huge mistake by the White House -- Woolsey 
abruptly quit this week after less that two years in office, battered and, as 
he indicated in his resignation letter, burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems he leaves behind are pretty much those he inherited. The Aldrich 
Ames spy scandal, which broke last February after festering eight years, both 
demoralized the CIA and deservedly exposed it to harsh criticism because of the 
almost unimaginable laxity it revealed in the agency's internal security 
practices. The end of the Cold War left the nation's huge intelligence 
apparatus -- very much a creation and a reflection of that ideological conflict 
-- uncertain and unclear about its needed roles and missions. 
</P>
<P>
 What has come to be called the intelligence community is, like the Agriculture 
Department or the Air Force, also a large employer, meaning that besides its 
assigned tasks it has a basic interest in protecting budgets and jobs. For two 
years Woolsey, with considerable success, fought budget cuts in intelligence 
operations. But there was a steady increase in skepticism about the need to go 
on spending $28 billion a year or so on intelligence (only about 10% of that 
for the CIA itself) and a rise in questions about duplication of efforts among 
the various intelligence agencies and the relevance of the information they 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-member bipartisan presidential commission, chaired by former Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin, is scheduled in the coming year to review the structure 
and focus of all of the nation's intelligence efforts and to propose changes 
for dealing with the post-Cold War world. It's a formidable undertaking, and 
it's likely to produce recommendations that will shape the nature and direction 
of intelligence operations well into the next century. Meanwhile, our current 
troubled century still has a time to run, and of a certainty there won't be any 
shortage of global crises to disturb those remaining years. The President who 
didn't have a lot of interest in seeing his departing director of Central 
Intelligence regularly would be well advised to make a lot more time on his 
schedule for his still-to-be-chosen successor.

 In the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, the cells are a cramped 
7-by-9-feet. That's not most people's idea of comfort.It's not supposed to be. 
It's jail. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, jail should be an equal-opportunity place within its limits; if one 
inmate gets a hot dinner, that should be available to others. Los Angeles 
County Sheriff Sherman Block is properly beginning to address inequities in the 
system pointed up by the presence of the jail's most famous resident, O. J. 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald 
Goldman. Attorneys for other inmates have been grumbling that the former 
football great has been getting special privileges. Through examination of 
court records and interviews, Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino found that 
Simpson indeed was being treated different from other "keep away" inmates -- 
those who are considered too dangerous, or too vulnerable, to mix with the 
jail's general population. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Simpson is a celebrity, certain precautions must be taken; it's 
understandable that he should not be thrown in among the other inmates. In the 
past, other famous inmates have been isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other differences -- largely made possible by court orders obtained 
by Simpson's attorneys -- included unlimited visiting privileges by certain 
friends and family members and hot dinners denied to other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Block says Simpson's visiting rights will be more in line with 
restrictions faced by other inmates and the hot dinners Simpson has been 
receiving will be extended to other inmates involved in long trials. It's only 
fair.

LAMP PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with enthusiasm your Dec. 21 article about the $106-million grant for 
the LAMP project. That is, I read with enthusiasm until I got to the fourth 
paragraph, where it stated that the money would not be spent on three of the 
four things teachers need most, but would be spent on two things that teachers 
do not need at all.How many of the millions will be spent on administrators 
"gathering data" and "analyzing the progress" while too few teachers continue 
to teach too many students with too few books and too out- of-date equipment in 
too dirty classrooms housed in too broken-down buildings? 
</P>
<P>
 Education needs more money, there is no doubt. But with priorities like these, 
LAMP is just business as usual-bureaucracy first, classroom last. MICHAEL

<P>
 It very well may be the case that Orange County will have to absorb the 
expense of defending Robert Citron (Dec. 26). And Orange County will also be 
bearing most of the expense related to his prosecution. As there seems no doubt 
of his guilt, which is not denied by him other than the possible degree of his 
fault, is it not time to back off and drop all charges? A big legal wrangle 
benefits only the attorneys who participate. Why should more tax money be 
misspent or wasted when it could be spent to much better effect?

 * The audacity of the Orange County government is beyond belief! First the 
outrageous gambling with public funds by the county treasurer accomplished 
under the criminally negligent oversight of the county supervisors. Now these 
same incompetent, so-called public servants want to take the entire loss out of 
the hides of the defenseless poor and county employees -- all arranged by two 
county executives whose own departments are barely touched after a recent hefty 
budget increase of 24% in their own department budgets (Dec. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 To spread the pain more equitably it would seem reasonable to impose a 
temporary emergency tax that would touch the vaunted affluent sector of Orange 
County's population.

Proposition 13 was deemed necessary.

 It was not to bankrupt county governments, not to deny schoolteachers'

LIFE UNDER THE GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Freedman's Column Left (Dec. 20) demonstrates that the liberal 
revisionists are already out in full force. Rather than decrying a government 
that has yet to take power, Freedman should join those who wish to seek real 
answers by examining the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no factual dispute that federal, state and local government spending 
programs for the poor have grown exponentially over the past three decades. 
Coincident with this rise has been an equal increase in the numbers of poor. To 
anyone with an understanding of statistics, these two facts indicate that these 
programs, while good-intentioned, have failed to produce the results for which 
they were intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Newt Gingrich and his newly appointed lieutenants in Congress do not 
have the complete answers to all of society's problems. But at least they are 
determined to eliminate old programs that have failed to produce anything more 
than a vested bureaucracy and a class of individuals who feel entitled to, and 
have become dependent upon, a series of government handouts.

 * According to Freedman, "The spirit of Christmas '94 is dampened by a mood of 
meanness." The only meanness I see has come from the media's coverage of 
orphanages these past few weeks. These organizations deserve a fair shake from 
the press. Freedman would do society a favor if he would tackle that issue 
through his forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas is about giving; personal giving, not federal giving. Freedman 
should get off his higher-education horse and find out what works in our 
troubled communities. The Christmas spirit can be found in local nonprofit 
organizations (try any local church) that are addressing the needs of families. 
If he could see the effectiveness that local organizations have with limited 
funds, he would join the crusade to shrink the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Our problems need a local common-sense approach that is efficient, effective 
and flexible. These are attributes not commonly associated with the federal 
government.

 * Re "Getting the Big Boys Off Our Backs," Column Right, by Mickey Edwards, 
Dec. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards tells us that the new Republican government will restore the old 
federalism that the Founders, in their infinite wisdom, conceived over 200 
years ago. This federalism was on target in 1790, when the 10th Amendment was 
passed. Our country has changed quite a bit since then. We no longer see people 
as inferior because of their skin color or their sex. We also realized that 
when states possessed too much power they took advantage of it, they 'created a 
tyranny of the majority. Hence, the Civil War occurred and the 14th Amendment, 
which gave the federal government the power to protect the abused minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we learned that local power made local prejudice king, the Articles of 
Confederation taught us that too much local power was a threat to the economy 
and unity from which we derive much of our power and comfort. The Republicans 
would do well to learn the lessons history has taught us instead of repeating 
them.

 I yearn for the good old days when you could open your front door in the 
morning and there would be your newspaper folded and tucked into your mailbox 
by a smiling, personable youth. Now your paper is flung from a fast-paced 
vehicle by an adult in a rush to finish the route before going to his or her 
normal job.Did they make their mark? Did they remember the forecast and place 
your paper in plastic? Many times, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the courtesy. Gone is the personal touch. Gone is one of the few jobs 
for our young to learn about responsibility, to earn money for sports, 
Christmas gifts or perhaps college. It has died and left us with a void.

LAGUNA HILLS OKS 5 MORE STOP SIGNS AT INTERSECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved placing stop signs at five more city 
intersections, bringing the total of stop signs installed since the city's 
incorporation in 1991 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the stop signs approved earlier this month will be placed at "T" 
intersections where drivers have trouble deciding who has the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 One stop sign will be placed on Appaloosa Place at Mustang Drive, even though 
no accidents have occurred there in the past three years and the number of cars 
does not warrant a stop sign, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Ken Rosenfield recommended the stop sign to the council because 
residents have complained about drivers failing to yield. The council 
unanimously approved the traffic control measure this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The other side-street stop signs will be placed on Bridlewood Drive, Woodbluff 
Road and Devonshire Road where they each meet Vista Viejo, and on Devonshire 
Road at Nottingham Court. The council approved those signs in a 4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Melody Carruth voted against the signs, saying she felt the new 
signs may encourage drivers to speed along Vista Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1992, 19 intersections have received multidirectional stop signs, 
and another 20 side-street signs have been installed, Rosenfield said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; POLICE HAD HIS NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A shooting suspect inadvertently helped police reach out and catch him this 
week when a cellular phone he used set police on his trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old youth had gotten into a fight with another boy Wednesday 
evening in the 7000 block of Lasaine Avenue in Reseda, Los Angeles Police 
Detective Bud Mehringer said.The teen-ager allegedly pulled a gun and fired a 
round that struck the other youth in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a call for help, police arrived at the scene and found the 
shooting victim but no suspect, Mehringer said. The armed youth had apparently 
fled to a nearby house, where he borrowed a telephone to make a call. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspecting something was amiss after they spotted the boy's sweat shirt in 
their bushes, the residents called police after the boy had left, Mehringer 
said. Officers who arrived at the home pressed the cellular phone's redial key 
to figure out whom the youth had called. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick led police to their suspect, who investigators said subsequently 
confessed to the shooting and then took officers to a trash can in an alley in 
the 17000 block of Sherman Way, where a gun was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting victim, also 17, was taken to a hospital in satisfactory 
condition.

PERSPECTIVE ON ISRAEL; TIME RUNS SHORT FOR PEACE PROCESS; THE AGENDA NEEDS SOME 
AGREEMENT WITH PALESTINIANS THAT WOULD SURVIVE A POTENTIAL RETURN OF LIKUD IN 
'96. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEROME M. SEGAL, Jerome M. Segal is a research fellow at the University of 
Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies and the director of 
the Jewish Peace Lobby based in Silver Spring, Md. He developed the basis for 
the proposals sketched here in his 1989 book, Creating the Palestinian Statea 
Strategy for Peace (Lawrence Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent Israeli polls indicate that if an election were held today, Likud Party 
leader Benjamin Netanyahu would defeat Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the 
progress made thus far toward ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would 
count for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, and in response to the continued difficulty of negotiating 
interim status arrangements with the Palestinians, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Yossi Beilin has proposed that Israel use the time that remains in Rabin's term 
to negotiate a final agreement with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has rejected Beilin's advice and seems determined to push on with the 
effort to implement the Gaza-Jericho interim accord. His reluctance to jump to 
final-status negotiations is understandable. Israelis would then have to 
confront some very difficult issues: the return of Palestinian refugees, 
Palestinian sovereignty over much of the West Bank, a compromise on Jerusalem 
and the dismantling of settlements in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin quite reasonably doubts that agreement with the Palestinians could be 
reached well before the 1996 elections, and having such hot issues pending at 
election time is a sure formula for a Likud victory.  
</P>
<P>
 In short, it is -- or seems to be -- too late. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Yossi Beilin's concerns are very well taken. When the Likud 
was in power, it used its time in office to create "facts on the ground." The 
Likud government rushed forward with the expansion of West Bank settlements in 
the belief that even if Labor came to power, it could not reverse the process 
of de facto annexation. Labor did return to power, but has done nothing that 
would impede a Likud successor; indeed, on Rabin's watch the settler population 
in the territories has increased by at least 10,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The situation is made even more bleak by the extreme vulnerability of the 
peace process to terrorist incidents, such as the bus bombing in Tel Aviv in 
October or the massacre in Hebron last February. Concerned for his own 
political survival, Rabin has made it clear to Yasser Arafat that proceeding on 
even the interim accord will require much tougher action against the radical 
Hamas. Yet when Arafat's Palestinian police confronted Hamas demonstrators in 
November, the result was a slaughter in which a dozen demonstrators died and 
more than 100 were wounded. That did not increase Israeli confidence in 
proceeding with troop withdrawals from the West Bank, and further estranged 
Arafat from a large segment of the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no easy answer, but Rabin can do better than muddling along, hoping 
that luck will hold through the next electoral role of the dice. What follows 
is a series of steps that are bold but politically possible; if taken, they 
would advance the peace process, strengthening both Israeli and Palestinian 
moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Israel would agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state with 
sovereignty over Gaza and Jericho, with which it would negotiate the remaining 
issues, including the extension of Palestinian sovereignty to West Bank 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Palestinians would dissolve the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
muting the issue of its covenant, which calls for the destruction of Israel, 
and replacing the PLO with a national government constitutionally committed to 
peaceful coexistence, an ideal espoused in the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 * The new government would extend citizenship to all Palestinians, whether 
they were living in territory under its effective sovereignty, in territory of 
claimed sovereignty or in the Diaspora. 
</P>
<P>
 * As agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho accord, Israeli forces would be redeployed 
away from Palestinian communities in the West Bank. And the Palestinians would 
conduct elections, not for an interim authority but for the national 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drawing on its new authority, the Palestinian government would use its full 
resources as a sovereign state to prevent Palestinians from planning or 
carrying out attacks on Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 * While negotiations on the final disposition of settlements would be 
deferred, Israel would move to reduce the size of the settler population by 
undertaking a generous program of financial incentives to induce settlers to 
leave the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the United States would support the admission of the new state of 
Palestine to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this could be accomplished well before the Israeli elections scheduled 
for mid-1996. The thorniest negotiating issues would be postponed, but if Likud 
does return to power, there will at least be some "facts (of peace) on the 
ground" not easily swept away.

OBITUARIES ; WALTER POPP; PIANIST, MUSICAL COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter Popp, whose 50-year music career took him from his uncle's saloon in 
Chicago to the nightclubs and television studios of Hollywood, died in Ventura 
on Thursday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Popp moved to Ventura County 17 years ago with his wife, Jacqueline. 
</P>
<P>
 A lyrical pianist, Popp met Danny Thomas at the 5100 Club in Chicago more than 
50 years ago and the two joined forces as a musical act. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit it off immediately," Jacqueline Popp recalled. "Danny would sing 
something and my husband would ad-lib on the piano." 
</P>
<P>
 For 35 years, Popp worked alongside Thomas, first in Hollywood clubs and later 
as musical coordinator for "The Danny Thomas Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Popp chiseled out a niche for himself in show business, working as music 
coordinator for numerous television shows, including "The Dick Van Dyke Show," 
"Andy Griffith," "I Spy," "That Girl" and "Gomer Pyle." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, Popp bought a cottage on Oxnard beach to escape the demands of the 
television business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have a phone or anything," his wife said. "One time when Danny 
Thomas needed Wally, he called the Oxnard police and had them drive out to our 
cottage." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Popp was never bothered by the demands of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a wonderful experience in Hollywood, working with all the big stars," 
his wife recalled. He was known both in Hollywood and Ventura as a true 
gentleman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always wore a cap and if he saw a woman he would reach to tip it," she 
said. "He always tipped his cap." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Popp is survived by his son, John Popp of New Mexico; 
daughter, Lorraine Woodman of Santa Barbara, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held in Illinois.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN KILLED IN HIGH-SPEED CAR CRASH;

 A Saugus woman died early Thursday after driving away from a party at more 
than 100 m.p.h. and crashing into a tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayna Hong, 34, was driving her car south on Bouquet Canyon Road when the 
single- car accident occurred about 3:20 a.m. at Alamogordo Road, said Lt. Tim 
Peters of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe she was driving in excess of 100 m.p.h. when she lost control of 
her vehicle," he said. "It came up on two wheels and struck a light, shearing 
off the top of the car, and it ended up hitting a tree." 
</P>

 The speed limit on Bouquet Canyon Road -- one of the city's main thoroughfares 
-- at the accident site is 50 m.p.h., Deputy Mike Shapiro said.

<P>
 "Many of the people there were quite under the influence of alcohol," Peters 
said.

TELLER ACCIDENTALLY FILLS OFFICE WITH TEAR GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A device kept in a decoy money bag exploded accidentally Thursday at a Home 
Savings & Loan in the 2200 block of North Tustin Avenue, filling the building 
with tear gas, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift's officials declined to comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Orange City Fire Capt. Frank Gonzalez said that the money bag, kept 
in each teller's cash drawer, is designed to go off when handled by robbers. As 
they leave the office, a small charge releases tear gas and covers them with 
bright-red dye. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, a new teller who was unfamiliar with the decoy bag jostled it and 
set it off just after 9 a.m., Gonzalez said. Most of the dye remained in the 
cash drawer, Gonzalez said, but "the whole building was filled with tear gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the estimated 10 people in the office at the time was injured, a 
woman who declined further treatment after being examined by paramedics. 
Firefighters set up large fans to remove the gas and allow employees and 
customers to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Different financial institutions use different methods to apprehend robbers, 
authorities say. Some use the exploding dye packs, while others use bags in 
which tiny electronic transmitters are concealed.

BELLFLOWER RENEWS ITS CARGO CONTAINER BAN; STORAGE: DECISION IS PART OF EFFORT 
TO CLEAN UP THE CITY AND ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. THE HOLDERS HAVE NEVER BEEN 
PERMITTED, BUT LAW HAS BEEN IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metal cargo containers -- ideal storage space to some Bellflower residents and 
businesses but eyesores to others -- apparently are about to hit the road out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
 A divided Bellflower City Council voted recently to order businesses and 
residents to get rid of the containers. Containers have never been permitted in 
the city, but the ban has been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ugly," Councilman Ray T. Smith said in explaining why he wanted 
shipping containers banished from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined Mayor Ken Cleveland and Councilman Randy Bomgaars in ordering 
officials to enforce the ban. Council members Ruth A. Gilson and Art Olivier 
dissented, saying they did not want the city to appear unfriendly toward 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to clean up Bellflower, but we can't come down with an iron 
fist," Gilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority initially decided businesses should have three years and 
residents one year to ship containers out of town, but then sent the proposal 
back to the Planning Commission for further study to determine if other 
deadlines should be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they're trying to pull," said Lloyd Basham, who keeps two 
storage containers behind his Alondra Boulevard engine-rebuilding shop. "I'd 
just like to see them make up their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 The council decision to enforce the ban came after more than a year of study 
and debate on shipping containers, which are commonly used to carry goods on 
ships, trains and trucks. It was in keeping with the city's effort to shed an 
anything-goes image. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently beefed up its code enforcement staff from one officer to 
three to tackle widespread building code violations. City leaders said they 
hope the cleanup ultimately will make Bellflower more attractive to new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's ban on shipping containers, they have sprouted behind, next 
to, and even in front of local businesses and homes in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Auto Parts, for example, stores motor oil in a shipping container on its 
front parking lot on Alondra Boulevard. The Sizzler restaurant on Artesia 
Boulevard has a container behind the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Containers typically are 8 feet wide, 8 feet 6 inches high and up to 40 feet 
in length. They are popular because they are sturdy, dustproof, fireproof and 
difficult for thieves to crack. Although not cheap -- one businessman said he 
paid $2,200 apiece for two containers -- they are not as costly as adding onto 
an existing building. 
</P>
<P>
 Bing H. Hyun, the city's interim planning director, said the exact number of 
illegal shipping containers in Bellflower is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've identified about 30 locations where they're visible from the street, 
but we know there are many more out there," he said. "There could be two, 
three, maybe four hundred." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the city ordered the removal of containers spotted by city 
inspectors. Several of the property owners protested, prompting the council to 
set up an ad-hoc committee to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, led by Councilwoman Gilson and former Councilman Bill 
Pendleton, met six times and concluded that businesses should be allowed to 
keep the containers. The matter then went to the Planning Commission. After 
four public hearings between March and October, the panel recommended that the 
council keep the ban and give violators up to three years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Basham, owner of Lloyd's Crankshaft Grinding on Alondra Avenue, is fuming over 
the possibility of being told to get rid of the containers he has had for seven 
years. He stores auto parts in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree with it totally," he said. "I'm going to have to close up. I have 
no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cleveland said he is not convinced that enforcing the ban on shipping 
containers will trigger a business exodus, as Gilson and Olivier have warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this one particular item is going to make them move, because 
very few other cities permit them," Cleveland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of 15 area cities permit shipping containers, according to a survey 
by the Bellflower Planning Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Containers are banned in Artesia, Cerritos, Compton, Huntington Park, 
Lakewood, Long Beach, Lynwood, Norwalk, Pico Rivera and Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Containers are allowed in Whittier as long as they are set back from property 
lines the same distances as from buildings. They are permitted in industrial 
and commercial zones in Commerce but restricted to industrial areas of 
Paramount. Hawaiian Gardens allows them in industrial zones for up to six 
months. In Downey, they can be kept in industrial zones for no more than 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Brian Maginnis, owner of American Rentals on Rosecrans Avenue in 
Bellflower, says he's ready to move his construction-equipment rental business 
elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 He described himself as the biggest violator in the city. Last month he had 13 
cargo containers for storage or rental, but has since sold six containers in 
anticipation of a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Maginnis said the ban is only one reason that he wants to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm moving because of the anti-business atmosphere created by the City 
Council. This is not 'The Friendly City' -- at least to small businesses," he 
said, referring to Bellflower's motto. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Crha is one of several horse property owners on Chicago Avenue who also 
will have to get rid of shipping containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Crha and her husband, Stan, have had "his" and "her" containers in their back 
yard for about 10 years. She keeps saddles and tack for the couple's five 
horses in hers. His shelters two vintage automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors use containers to store hay, Crha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we have to get rid of them?" she asked. "They don't bother 
anybody. We're on 1 1/2 acres. You can't see them. They're 300 feet from the 
street. No one has ever complained." 
</P>
<P>
 Crha said she is uncertain how she will respond to the abatement order but is 
leaning toward giving in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired of fighting the city," the lifelong Bellflower resident said. 
"We fought to save the horses and we fought to keep out developers."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGY IN THE SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional lifeguard rescue meant a savior in a red swimsuit paddling out 
through the surf or using a rowboat to save people who were in over their 
heads. But modern technology is available now, and Orange County lifeguards 
wisely have started to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 This week there was a three-day, on-the-water training course for two dozen 
lifeguards from Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and 
Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeguards were taught the ins and outs of the so-called personal 
watercraft, the popular one- or two-person vehicles that look like snowmobiles 
on the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County emergency services personnel started using the craft last 
year, and Newport Beach followed suit last summer. In one instance last year, 
Newport Beach turned to a personal watercraft when a rescue boat broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County lifeguards said they think the new device can help prevent 
drownings. One noted that the watercraft can be launched easily by a single 
person and can operate in shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
 In a good example of public-private partnership, Newport Beach and Huntington 
Beach each were given two of the craft by local dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 For lifeguards who have been known to make hundreds of rescues on busy summer 
weekends at Orange County beaches, the watercraft could prove to be a valuable 
asset in keeping swimmers alive.

CALABASAS WILL OPEN 2 EMERGENCY AID CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas next month will dedicate one of two emergency aid 
stations that have been set up to treat people with minor injuries during 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience has proved that so many people clog the hospitals during 
disasters," said City Manager Charles Cate."For people with minor injuries, 
this would be a good way for them to get treatment without overburdening the 
medical facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication will be on Jan. 17, the anniversary of the Northridge 
earthquake, at the Calabasas Tennis and Swim Center, 23400 Park Sorrento, from 
10 a.m. to noon. The second "M.A.S.H." unit, as they are called, is located 
behind A. E. Wright Middle School, 4029 N. Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At the stations, tamper-proof boxes, 8 feet high by 10 feet long, are stocked 
with emergency first aid equipment, as well as other emergency items such as 
generators, according to city officials. The city provided the funding for the 
stations, which cost about $6,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is overseen by Dr. Arnold Bresky, a local physician, as part of an 
emergency preparedness plan developed by the city in cooperation with the 
Calabasas Emergency Response Team, a volunteer organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the plan is to have medical personnel report to the stations in the 
event of disasters, said Cate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a high concentration of doctors and medical technicians in the 
community that can report to the sites," Cate said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also at the Tennis and Swim Center on Jan. 17, the Health and Wellness 
Committee will offer a free 7 p.m. lecture on how to deal with the stress 
brought on by disasters. Shelly Horner will be the speaker.

CITY OFFERS 'SEED MONEY' TO CALABASAS PIONEER PAGEANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Impressed by the success of a yearly pageant commemorating the passing of 
Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza through what is now Calabasas, the city 
has donated $4,000 to this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that this is seed money, and if we make money, then we have to 
pay it back," said Juliana Gensley, who created the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th annual Juan Bautista de Anza Pageant will be held Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. 
in Malibu Creek State Park, off Las Virgenes Road. In 1776, De Anza, who was 
leading 240 settlers from Mexico to what is now San Francisco, camped in a spot 
where the Ventura Freeway and Las Virgenes Road now meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is considered an outstanding success in the annals of pioneer history 
for being exceptionally well planned, pageant organizers say. Only one person, 
a woman who was in labor, was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Congress designated the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail 
-- a portion of which runs through Calabasas -- as a national historic trail. A 
new park planned for Calabasas will be named after the explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pageant, actors play the roles of De Anza and others, said Gensley, 
who is seeking volunteers such as actors, sound engineers and costume 
designers. She is also seeking sponsors, video camera operators, poster makers, 
and others. Those wishing to help should call her at (818) 222-4617. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, De Anza has been portrayed by Rod Bergen, a 
businessman and actor. "It's very exciting," said Bergen, who will play De Anza 
again this year. "This man exemplifies things which I think are very 
characteristic of our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have vowed to increase attendance at the event, which usually draws 
about 200, said spokeswoman Stephanie Abronson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year that we have picked up a monetary sponsor," she said. 
"That tells us that we're getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendees are advised to bring picnic lunches because no food will be sold. 
There is a $5 parking fee for Malibu Creek State Park. FRANK MANNING

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; NEBRASKA'S NO. 1 MAN WILL BE FRAZIER AGAIN; ORANGE BOWL: 
AGAINST MIAMI, OSBORNE WILL START QUARTERBACK WHO HASN'T PLAYED SINCE BEING 
SIDELINED BY BLOOD CLOTS IN SEPTEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it came time to make the announcement , Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne was 
led to a concrete walkway overlooking the west end zone of the Orange Bowl. 
From there he could glance down at the reporters pressed together in a 
semi-circle at his feet and deliver the news that today is being second-guessed 
from one end of America's breadbasket to the other, from Chadron to Lincoln, 
from Nebraska City to Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will start Frazier," Osborne said, squinting into the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was that. Tommie Frazier, who hasn't played since blood clots 
sidelined him in September, who admits he isn't in football shape, who wouldn't 
even be in uniform if the NCAA had approved his request for a medical redshirt 
season, will start against Miami and the nation's No. 1 defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much is at stake. Only a national championship, a seven-game bowl losing 
streak and perhaps a bit of Osborne's coaching reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Nebraska, there are already newspaper polls asking readers to choose 
between Brook Berringer, the understudy who led the top-ranked Cornhuskers to 
seven victories, and Frazier, the preseason Heisman Trophy candidate who lasted 
four games before doctors discovered blood clots in his right calf. 
</P>
<P>
 And during Thursday's media day, ESPN analyst Lee Corso told Osborne he 
couldn't believe Frazier was the starter. Osborne basically told Corso that 
explains why one of them still wears a headset and the other wears makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the 1984 Orange Bowl, when he approved an ill-fated two-point 
conversion that cost the Cornhuskers a national title, has one of Osborne's 
decisions been so scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of it all is Frazier, whose only mistake was bad timing 
and the kind of talent that makes a coach bench an undefeated Berringer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a strange season," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is exactly sure when Frazier hurt his leg and the potentially 
life-threatening blood clots began to form. It might have been in the opener 
against West Virginia, or, as Osborne initially guessed, against UCLA a few 
weeks later. But this much is known: Nine plays into the game against Pacific 
on Sept. 24, Frazier limped off the field and wasn't seen in uniform again. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 During his absence, Nebraska continued to win with relative ease. Berringer, 
who struggled through injuries of his own, led the Cornhuskers to seven 
victories, including an impressive 24-7 triumph over Colorado. And when 
Berringer was hurt, walk-on Matt Turman was quarterback in Nebraska's victory 
over Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching with mixed feelings was Frazier, who realized he was no longer 
indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably one of the most difficult times I've had to deal with," 
Frazier said. "I've been playing football going on 13 years now . . . and this 
was the first time I had to sit out or miss any type of game, whether it was 
because of an injury or some other type of problem I had off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, and with the blessings of the Nebraska coaches, Frazier stopped 
attending team meetings. He didn't go to every practice. Actually, nothing was 
mandatory except taking his medicine and showing up on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier said it was too painful at times to watch the Cornhuskers play. He 
felt himself becoming an afterthought, an auxiliary member of the team rather 
than the center of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd see guys out there doing things I used to do," Frazier said. "To have 
something taken away in an instant, that's going to be hard for you to go out 
there and watch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Frazier was cleared to return to practice. It happened shortly 
before the regular-season finale against Oklahoma. By then, Nebraska team 
doctors and blood clot specialists had determined that the chances of the 
condition returning were less than 5%, probably closer to 1%, Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be sure, Osborne consulted DeePak Gangahar, the surgeon who had 
operated on the Nebraska coach's heart nine years ago. Gangahar gave his OK 
after a careful review of Frazier's condition and medical history. That was 
enough for Osborne, who allowed the junior quarterback to return to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Gangahar) has your heart stopped and it's lying out there on the table, 
you tend to put a lot of confidence in what he says," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his return, though, Frazier said he wasn't sure that the team 
accepted him. After all, Berringer had helped lead the Cornhuskers to an 
undefeated season, a No. 1 ranking and added the dimension of a passing attack. 
And the last thing the team needed was a quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I wasn't sure (about being accepted) because I didn't know how the 
players would react to, 'Well, he's coming back now and I don't think he should 
start because Brook has led us this way,' " Frazier said. "But now I can see I 
have the support of them, that if you're going to be the starter, then go out 
there and practice like you did at the beginning of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier practiced so well that Osborne soon found himself facing a decision no 
coach wants to make days before a national championship game. He could choose 
Frazier, who is the better player, but also more rusty. Or he could stick with 
Berringer, who had earned the respect of the Cornhuskers with those seven 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said he would begin grading the two players at each workout. Then he 
said the starting job would be determined by their play in a Christmas Eve 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: Berringer and Frazier each took about 30 snaps -- about half a game's 
worth. Berringer moved the ball, but also threw two interceptions. Frazier 
didn't commit a turnover and dazzled the coaches with his scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played just like he had never left," said Turner Gill, who coaches 
Nebraska's quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff vote was unanimous: Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier tried to be diplomatic about the decision. He complimented Berringer 
on his play this season. He said he understood how it must feel. He thanked 
Osborne for the confidence. But it also was clear that Frazier thought he 
deserved his starting job back, mostly because he never thought he had lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went down with my injury, I was probably at my peak," Frazier said. 
"Now, I don't feel like I've lost anything. As a matter of fact, I think it 
gave me more time to prepare myself for a big game like this mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 If anybody else says that after a 14-week layoff, they're laughed off the 
premises. But Frazier, the probable Heisman leader before the blood clots were 
diagnosed and he was put on anti-coagulant medication, isn't anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson, not known for gratuitous hyperbole, said Frazier 
is the best quarterback he saw this season. So when Osborne made his decision 
Thursday, Erickson wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a great player like (Frazier) . . . it's pretty hard to keep 
him on the bench," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone was so impressed. Warren Sapp, Miami's All-American 
defensive tackle, did everything but yawn when told of Frazier's playing 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Miami safety Malcolm Pearson: "We're still going to try to crush 
both of their facemasks. Don't make no difference if it's Marino . . . J.C. 
Watts, whoever." 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy for Pearson to say now. But while Miami was busy losing to Arizona 
in last season's meaningless Fiesta Bowl, Frazier, only a sophomore, was this 
close to leading Nebraska to an Orange Bowl victory over 17 1/2-point favorite 
Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers lost on a missed field-goal attempt, but Frazier finished with 
94 yards rushing, 206 passing, a touchdown and had put the Cornhuskers in 
position for the game-winning attempt with a second remaining. Heisman Trophy 
winner Charlie Ward had slightly better total numbers -- 322 total yards to 
Frazier's 300 -- but the Seminole quarterback needed 19 more passes to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what Frazier will do this time, with another national championship 
in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year left a little hole in what I wanted to accomplish as a college 
player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This season there was a three-month gap. Frazier begins stitching Sunday. The 
second-guessers await the result.

SHAW SAYS A DEAL TO MOVE ISN'T NEAR; RAMS: THREE MAJOR DIFFERENCES WITH ST. 
LOUIS REMAIN TO BE SETTLED, TEAM PRESIDENT SAYS, AND 'SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO GIVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ram President John Shaw said negotiations between the team and St. Louis have 
reached a point where "somebody is going to have to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said a list of 16 major differences has been whittled to three, but 
contrary to reports that a completed deal with St. Louis is imminent, there 
isn't even an assurance that one can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing from the media that an announcement will come in a week or 
Monday or whatever," Shaw said. "Apparently I have no credibility, because I've 
been saying we're still negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even gotten to the point where it can be presented to ownership 
for approval. There are still three large issues unresolved and other issues 
could be raised once documents start to be drafted. We're also talking to other 
people about minority ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams attempted to sell 40% of the team to Columbia, Mo., businessman Stan 
Kroenke, but for his $80 million, Kroenke also demanded the opportunity to buy 
out team owner Georgia Frontiere at some point. Frontiere wouldn't agree to 
such a deal and to date has only offered Kroenke first refusal rights should 
she opt to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis newspaper reported weeks ago that the Rams had struck a deal with 
Kroenke, but in fact, Kroenke has taken a step back. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Kroenke remains the Rams' first preference for minority ownership 
but there have been no recent talks. While declining to be specific about the 
differences with Kroenke, Shaw said, "He's got certain needs that are important 
to him, and I'm not sure we can address them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minority ownership issue is totally up in the air. We're talking to other 
people, and that's all I'd like to say about that now. Selling a minority 
interest in the Rams will absolutely not have an impact on our negotiations 
with St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the three remaining unresolved issues with St. Louis are: guarantees 
on permanent seat license sales, guarantees on club seats and luxury box sales 
and the location of the proposed practice facility for the team. But he 
declined to detail his differences with St. Louis on each issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent-seat licensing program, in which fans pay a one-time fee for the 
right to purchase season tickets, is critical to the deal because St. Louis 
hopes to raise at least $60 million from it to cover major costs associated 
with the move: $30 million the Rams would owe the city of Anaheim for stadium 
improvements completed in 1980, $15 million for a practice facility and $15 
million in expected NFL relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The 101 luxury suites and 6,550 club seats in St. Louis' new 70,000-seat domed 
stadium have the potential to generate about $12 million annually for an NFL 
tenant -- if they are all leased and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit to St. Louis, two Ram officials toured six potential 
practice facility sites. FANS, Inc., the St. Louis group negotiating with the 
Rams, has proposed a 400-acre complex owned by the county's pipe fitters union 
because transforming the existing buildings into a training complex there could 
be done for about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw reportedly was not happy with that site, because its North County 
location would be at least a 50-minute drive from where he expects most players 
to live, in the West County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both know where we are, and somebody is going to have to give," said Shaw, 
who has yet to visit St. Louis during these negotiations. "I'm sure we'll 
handle these differences as we did the others and either send lawyers there or 
do it by conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running out of time. Even if we were to make some progress, though, I 
know there is no way we will have an announcement in the next week. I would say 
somewhere within the next 30 days, or otherwise we won't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Under NFL bylaws, any team wishing to move for the 1995 season must notify the 
league and submit a proposal for transfer at least 30 days before the annual 
owners meetings March 12-17 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 While details of a possible move to St. Louis occupy Shaw's time, the future 
of Coach Chuck Knox and his staff and the possible hiring of a general manager 
also have to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be meeting with Chuck in the next couple of weeks," Shaw said. "(His 
future) is something we're going to discuss with ownership. There will be a lot 
of football decisions made in the next month."

LAKERS SHOW THEIR REBOUND ABILITY; PRO BASKETBALL: CAMPBELL KEYS 96-95 VICTORY 
OVER SEATTLE AFTER BIG LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers played the Seattle SuperSonics at the Forum on Thursday night, and 
the go-to guy was the young athletic power forward, the one who can run the 
floor with the grace of a much smaller man and the next possession work from 
the low post. 
</P>
<P>
 Take one step forward . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell? 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell. All-star Shawn Kemp had 22 points and 13 rebounds for the 
SuperSonics, but it was Campbell who went from a stretch of solid showings to a 
starring role by scoring six of the Lakers' final eight points and finishing 
with a season-high 28 points along with 10 rebounds and six blocks to lead the 
way in a 96-95 victory before a sellout of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if he stumbled into the spotlight, either. He was the first 
option on the last two possessions -- a turnaround jumper over Sam Perkins from 
the low post that provided the final margin with 45 seconds remaining and then 
a short jumper from the left flat. He missed that, but Vlade Divac grabbed the 
rebound as the final seconds ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always want the ball, especially when I can get it that low on the post," 
Campbell said. "It was working for us tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Laker Coach Del Harris: "Elden was having the night. We wanted to get 
the ball inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor rebounders under the basket, the Lakers -- who also got 35 points and 10 
rebounds from Cedric Ceballos -- have at least shown the ability to rebound 
after bad games, a resiliency that has already served them well. 
</P>
<P>
 When they lost by 21 to New York, the next outing was an emotional victory 
over Cleveland, now the Central Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 When they lost by 38 points at Cleveland, the response was an 18-point Forum 
victory over Houston, the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 When they lost by 25 to the Clippers, the follow-up was a seven-point victory 
at Utah, now the Midwest Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally in this league, when you take a bad loss, most teams do respond," 
Harris said. "Certainly, good teams do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two days after falling behind by 37 points and eventually losing by 24 at 
Golden State, similar redemption came against a Seattle team that began the 
night having won 12 of its previous 15 and was pushing Phoenix for the Pacific 
Division lead. The SuperSonics fell short despite 26 points by Detlef Schrempf 
and the contributions of Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says we have a confidence," said Divac, who made only two of 11 shots but 
did his part with five steals, three blocks and the big offensive rebound to 
seal the victory. "We have a goal. After a bad game, we want to come back with 
a good game. That's what happened tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics played without swingman Vincent Askew, one of their many 
defensive stalwarts, who was serving a one-game suspension without pay after 
refusing to enter Wednesday night's home contest against Philadelphia in the 
second quarter. He had done the same thing last season and the following game 
dressed but did not play. This time, it cost him $19,512.16. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Nate McMillan, another key player, was ejected after two 
rapid-fire technicals from Don Vaden with 9:57 remaining in the first half, 
apparently after disputing a foul call moments earlier. Ceballos converted both 
free throws, part of his 22 points in the first half that contributed to the 
Lakers' 50-46 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 It was close the rest of the way. The Lakers had a 90-82 lead, but then began 
turning the ball over, and the SuperSonics had a 95-92 advantage with 1:27 to 
play. From there, though, Gary Payton missed both free throws with 54 seconds 
to go and, after Campbell's go-ahead basket, Schrempf's cross-court pass from 
the left flat sailed high and out of bounds with 31.7 seconds showing. Seattle 
never got another chance.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; HE'S NOT 100% ON COTTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Man, it sure feels great to finally get out of L.A.," senior linebacker Brian 
Williams was quoted Thursday by a Ft. Worth newspaper, a very peculiar thing 
for a University of Southern California football player to say. "This is where 
we belong -- where I belong -- in a New Year's bowl game. Now I can look back 
on my career at Southern Cal and be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 He can? Brian, Brian, Brian. I suppose that coming back home to Texas, where 
he once played gospel music in an all-saxophone band, must have put the 
230-pound Williams in a sentimental mood, or something. Because one would have 
assumed that the Rose Bowl was the bowl where a true Trojan would have felt he 
belonged, where he could look back and be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's song is strangely upbeat. Had someone before the fall school term 
tipped off a typical USC student (or booster) that this season's team would not 
defeat Penn State, Oregon, Notre Dame or UCLA, that the defense would be 
shredded for 229 points in 11 games and get its coordinator ushered out the 
door, I would have suspected that there would have been hell to pay in Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the players seem happy as puppies while practicing here for the 
Cotton Bowl, and after a rainy-day session, Coach John Robinson actually said: 
"Life couldn't be better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, might as well let a smile be your umbrella. Trojan football, which has 
given the world everything from All-American heroes to accused killers, has 
seen harder times. Their record was 3-8 back when Williams wandered westward 
from Texas, and a year later came the Fresno State farce and the hasty exit of 
Coach Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder these seem like heady days, by comparison. Consider the sentiments 
of offensive guard Kris Pollack, also a senior, who doesn't sound so eager to 
get on with the rest of his life as certain classmates do. Pollack says: "Of 
course I wish I had some more years to play. I love playing college football. I 
had a good time playing under Coach Smith -- he was a great coach. I feel lucky 
playing two years under Coach Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfaction is by degree, see. The disappointment anyone naturally feels with 
USC's failures this season can be tempered by recollection of how bad things 
used to be, not so very long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the Cotton Bowl, which might not be the granddaddy of 'em 
all but is surely one of the uncles. Being here is not so bad, not bad at all. 
Imagine the frustration a player from, say, Michigan must suppress, pretending 
that the Holiday Bowl was a dream vacation trip. Or an athlete from Alabama, 
making all kinds of polite noises about what a cool place this big Citrus Bowl 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep telling myself that the USC season we just witnessed was pretty much a 
drag. Being pummeled at Penn State and then beaten at home by Oregon must have 
been humbling experiences at the time, no matter how soothing it became in the 
weeks thereafter when the nation discovered that Penn State was not so much 
good as great, or that Oregon was not a bunch of lucky Ducks but a hard- 
hitting squad. 
</P>
<P>
 By that point, the Trojans had a record of 2-2 and didn't feel any luckier 
than Texas Tech did a couple of weeks later, when the Red Raiders found 
themselves 2-4 and caused their loquacious coach, Spike Dykes, to say that they 
were approaching something he called, " 'Molly Get the Mop' time." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if John Robinson was reaching for a mop by then, but he did at 
least know where the broom was and would use it later on his defense. Coaches 
and players won't be the only ones gone by next autumn, Robinson is promising 
here this week. USC's entire defensive system is about to undergo some 
upheaval. "Some big changes in our scheme," Robinson put it. 
</P>
<P>
 The season wore on many individuals. Williams, the fine outside linebacker who 
called this Dallas homecoming "the answer to a prayer," remembers vividly how 
he felt flying home from Penn State, leaving the field after the Oregon game, 
looking forward to Notre Dame and UCLA games that, ultimately, produced no 
moment of triumph for a senior to enjoy forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing to Oregon, he says, actually woke up the team -- "a little too late, as 
it turned out." And that so-called moral victory of not actually losing to 
Notre Dame this time, that did little to lift Williams' spirits because, he 
said, "It still felt like a wasted day. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I can't believe we've lost four straight to UCLA. This school used to 
beat them all the time, so that shows you how bad things had gotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here, there were problems. Some of it was hard to put your finger 
on, but things just weren't working. But this group has turned it around, and 
pretty soon these guys will be beating UCLA and Notre Dame. And after that, 
they're going to win a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Not at a Cotton Bowl, they won't.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; SPURRIER'S FAILURE?; DEAN ENDS CAREER ON SIDELINES, DEBATING 
WHAT WENT WRONG AS WUERFFEL STARS FOR GATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Spurrier has been accused of being driven, paranoid, charming, 
manipulative, successful, impulsive, compulsive and sometimes even repulsive. 
</P>
<P>
 But never sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 A sentimentalist would have moved heaven and earth to make sure his first 
recruit at Florida was successful, returning loyalty for loyalty, rewarding 
effort with praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Spurrier did. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, as Terry Dean says, Spurrier didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known: On Jan. 2, 1990, three days after he was hired to coach 
his alma mater, Spurrier and Frank and Nancy Dean lifted their glasses in 
Naples, Fla., to toast the newest Gator marriage. Steve Spurrier, coach, had 
gotten the Deans' son, quarterback Terry, to say "I do" to an offer to play in 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
 Al and Peg Bundy have gotten along better since. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dean has been the equivalent of a yo-yo at Florida, and the string has 
played out. On Monday, against Florida State in the Sugar Bowl, he will trot 
out with the rest of the co-captains for the coin toss, then return to the 
sideline, his work done for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 And for his career. In August, he began writing a journal that he hoped would 
spawn a book about a quarterback and a national championship season. The ending 
has changed. Happiness is Gainesville in his rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny Wuerffel is our quarterback," Spurrier said this week. "This is his 
game. This is not a rotation system. We have two fine players there. . . . We 
don't have a depth chart at quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 The one listed by the sports information department has Terry Dean as the 
third-stringer, behind Wuerffel and sophomore Eric Kresser. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Oct. 15, Dean was the starter, and stories about him used the 
modifier "Heisman Trophy candidate" liberally. Why not? He was the second-rated 
quarterback in the country, top-rated in the Southeastern Conference, and had 
thrown 18 touchdown passes in five games for the No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a Heisman front-runner had grown to the point that the campaign 
for Steve McNair, a Division I-AA player at Alcorn State, was given serious 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, Florida's potential second Heisman Trophy winner, playing quarterback 
for the first, Spurrier, offered an attractive option. There was symmetry, 
somehow, a publicist's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a wake-up call. Reality is almost as tough as Auburn, which intercepted 
four Dean passes and recovered one Dean fumble while beating the Gators, 36-33, 
to ruin their national championship bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean spent 40 minutes afterward telling reporters he knew he was no longer 
Florida's quarterback. On Monday he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't simply intuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had built," Dean said. "The (Louisiana State) game, I had a mediocre 
performance. I threw one touchdown, one interception (in a 42-18 victory). The 
next week, I went in to watch the films, and (Spurrier) just got on me like he 
never had. It kind of baffled me at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had told me Monday before the Auburn game that if I had a bad game, he 
would bench me. He told me again the Friday before the game that if I wasn't 
playing well, he would pull me." 
</P>
<P>
 After those pep talks, Dean threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to Jack Jackson. 
Two interceptions came on good plays by Auburn defensive backs, he said. The 
other two came on bad plays by Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't myself," he said. "I was looking over my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Wuerffel, who twice brought Florida back to a lead ultimately lost by 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit Dean, for good. He played in a mop-up role in the next three games and 
not at all in the last three, finishing second in the nation in quarterback 
efficiency. Wuerffel was third. 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who asked, Dean has explained about the mind-games he had gone 
through that week. It hasn't helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's why I have been written off," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach/offensive coordinator/quarterback coach -- Spurrier wears all three 
visors in Gainesville -- hasn't talked with Dean since Oct. 15. Dean said there 
have been coach-quarterbacks meetings that he hasn't been invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 It's plain that Spurrier is more comfortable with Wuerffel, who has led the 
Gators to five victories and a tie since. Wuerffel is more coachable, perhaps 
less physically talented but more cerebral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny never puts us in a bad play," center David Swain said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a coach's dream -- compliant, understanding and team-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean had been the starter as a junior after playing behind Shane Mathews for 
three seasons, but lost the job to redshirt freshman Wuerffel, who threw 22 
touchdown passes. But when Wuerffel struggled in the rain against Georgia, Dean 
re-established himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Wuerffel responded by taking footballs and a pail of water to the practice 
field, throwing a wet ball until his arm ached. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, When Dean was benched after this season's Auburn game, he took 
two NFL balls to practice and threw them during warm-ups, getting ready for the 
next step in his career, presuming that he had taken all the steps at Florida 
he could take. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dean worked as the starter last season, winning the SEC championship 
game and the Sugar Bowl, then throwing seven touchdown passes in the first half 
of this season's opener against New Mexico State, Wuerffel worked after 
practice on his throwing, the weakest part of his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just in a kind of a weird situation as far as personnel," Wuerffel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy to get caught up in your own frustration, but you just have to 
realize that the person in charge has the same goals that we have, and that's 
to win football games. So you just have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but not for Terry Dean, to whom team and individual goals are in 
lock-step. He finds himself on the sideline, watching with conflicting emotions 
while Wuerffel is winning with the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's definitely an awkward situation to be in," Dean said. "I definitely 
want the team to win, but I want to be the one leading them and the only way 
that's going to happen is if he screws up. I really like Danny a lot. He's one 
of my best friends on the team. But it's a tough situation to be in." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one he won't be in much longer. Dean graduated two weeks ago with a 
degree in marketing, a 3.91 grade-point average and Academic All-American 
status, and he and his wife, Robin, have moved back to Naples. The Hula Bowl 
lies ahead, and then the NFL combine workouts. There is talk of a quarterback 
coach to prepare him, as Dan Henning did Tennessee's Heath Shuler last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to be gone," Dean said. "It's been a frustrating five years, and I 
definitely think I'm capable of bigger and better things. I still think I'm the 
best quarterback here. There are a lot of reasons why I want to make it in the 
pros, and one of them is I want to be able to go back (to Gainesville) and say 
I got a little redemption. Nobody else believed me, but I never lost the idea 
that I could make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Take that, Steve Spurrier, who is sixth on Florida's all-time touchdown pass 
list with 36. Dean is fifth, with 39, Wuerffel fourth, with 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I'm not going to win any battles with Terry Dean and I don't want to," 
said Spurrier, who has coached Florida to all three of the SEC titles it has 
won. "I'll be the bad guy. I've tried to coach Terry the best I can, and I've 
failed. If he goes on to have a proven NFL career, then obviously it was my 
fault he didn't do better here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dean of Spurrier: "He's demanding. He's a perfectionist. He wants you to 
be as perfect as you can be and he's going to drive you toward that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just does some things I really don't understand, but he wins and, sad to 
say, that's pretty much all people care about. As long as he's winning, he's 
one of the most successful guys in the world. He's one of the great coaches 
coaching today. He's got a great mind for the game. So far, that's all that 
counts."

PUCK STOPS HERE, BETTMAN SUGGESTS; HOCKEY: MEMO FROM NHL COMMISSIONER WARNS 
SEASON MUST BEGIN BY JAN. 16 IF 50 GAMES, FULL PLAYOFF SCHEDULE ARE TO TAKE 
PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman hinted Thursday that he will cancel the season 
when he informed union chief Bob Goodenow that it must begin by Jan. 16 in 
order to schedule 50 regular-season games and full slate of playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 For that to occur, a collective bargaining agreement would have to be reached 
no later than Jan. 6-8 to allow players to regroup and get back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, Bettman does not 
specifically say he will cancel the season if 50 games can't be played. There 
has been some sentiment among NHL executives to settle for a season of 44 or 40 
games, rather than wiping it out entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 League spokesman Arthur Pincus said that Bettman, in sending the memo, was 
acting under instructions given him by the NHL's Board of Governors on Dec. 12, 
when they authorized Bettman to cancel the season if he determines 50 or more 
games and a full complement of best-of-seven playoff series can't be concluded 
by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the possibility of a shorter season remains, Pincus said 50 games 
will probably remain the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't expect the instructions to change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an ultimatum was implied and not stated, the purpose of the memo was 
clear: to kick-start the stalled negotiations and end the lockout, which began 
on Oct. 1 and threatens to make the NHL the first professional sports league to 
call off an entire season because of a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and Goodenow have not met in more than three weeks, although 
sub-committees from the NHL and the union have met three times. Talks were to 
resume the day after Christmas, but Goodenow canceled them by relaying word he 
had nothing to discuss if the league remained intent on imposing a payroll tax 
or extracting more economic concessions from players. 
</P>
<P>
 No negotiations have been arranged. But Goodenow, replying to Bettman's fax, 
said he would have union counsel John McCambridge contact NHL counsel Jeff Pash 
to set up a small-group meeting, "so they can continue to work on a deal 
without a tax and hopefully advance the negotiations to a point where it would 
be productive for us to meet and conclude an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow added, "As you were aware, after Dec. 6 (their last face-to-face 
talk), we agreed a number of small-group meetings should take place to 
establish framework for a new (collective bargaining agreement). My information 
was that substantial progress was made towards a deal without a tax until 
discussions broke off on Dec. 17." 
</P>
<P>
 In those small-group sessions, Pash and Cliff Fletcher, the general manager of 
the Maple Leafs, floated the idea of eliminating the tax if players would make 
concessions that would slow salary growth, mostly in the area of salary 
arbitration. Players contended they have already made major concessions and 
resisted the idea, ending the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation arose as to whether Bettman was setting a firm deadline or simply 
trying to spark action. On Dec. 12, he estimated that a deal had to be made in 
seven to 10 days. That period has long since passed. 
</P>
<P>
 A union-allied source said it appeared that Bettman, by not specifically 
saying Thursday that he will refuse to start a season of any length if it can't 
start by Jan. 16, avoided setting a deadline because he doesn't want to give 
bargaining leverage to Goodenow. But a league source denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the union is thinking we're ready to go lower (in the number of games) 
that's a mistake in thinking," the league source said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, it appears that the next talks will be crucial in determining 
Bettman's course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running out of time, if we haven't run out of time already," King 
co-owner Joe Cohen said. "Gary's making it perfectly clear he's willing to meet 
to try to resolve this. I applaud that, and I hope Bob takes him up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't be lingering on semantics. We should be trying to play hockey 
under a system that works for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman's memo, which followed a brief phone call he made to Goodenow, refers 
to cuts that have reduced the schedule from 84 games to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, since we last met in Chicago on Dec. 6, at least eight additional 
games have probably been lost," he wrote. "As you know, we have been constantly 
reviewing and updating scheduling options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now at the point that, based on building availability, the regular 
season must begin by Jan. 16 in order to schedule 50 regular-season games and 
full playoffs. The length of time permitted for training camp will determine 
how much time remains to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have repeatedly told you during this process, and as I told you this 
morning, we remain prepared to meet at any time. When you are prepared to 
resume negotiations, please let Jeff Pash or me know." 
</P>
<P>
 No talks are likely until Tuesday because of the New Year's holiday. Most 
members of the NHL's negotiating committee have scattered to vacation sites or 
to scout the world junior championships in Red Deer, Canada.

 It will never happen, but Roy Jones Jr. can't help but wonder what it would be 
like to fight 46-year-old heavyweight champion George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, considered one of the world's top fighters, pound for pound, after 
dominating James Toney to win the International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight title, says he could be very effective against Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would never land a punch," Jones says. "I would be the most frustrating 
opponent for him, because I would hit him eight or 10 times before he realized 
I had moved to a new position and would be whaling on him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I stood there with frozen feet in front of him, I wouldn't have time to be 
stupid, because I'd be in a coma." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jones: "I can see why Foreman would want to fight Mike Tyson," Jones says. 
"First of all, he could make $30 million. But more importantly, he could win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyson would come straight at him like a bull, but George is crafty. He would 
be like the matador in those cartoons, holding the red cape with a big iron 
anvil hidden behind it."

 Trivia time: Don Shula is so closely identified with the Miami Dolphins'

 But has he been good? Bill Parcells, the workaholic coach of the New England

 Sugar-coated: Recently, Bert Sugar of Boxing Illustrated noticed that the 
Boston Globe ran a picture under a schedule of fights with a caption that read: 
"Joey Gamache gets a shot at the WBZ lightweight title Oct. 29." 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know what?" Sugar says, "They didn't get one letter telling them it 
was a typo and that Gamache would be fighting for the WB A title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you think the typo went unnoticed? Because it's entirely possible, 
with sanctioning bodies multiplying like rabbits, that there really is a WBZ."

 Fast start: Ross Atkin of the Christian Science Monitor points out the weird 
reality of the NFL's current expansion.

NBA ROUNDUP; WILKENS' 938TH TIES AUERBACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lenny Wilkens matched Red Auerbach's record for NBA coaching victories at 938 
Thursday night as the Atlanta Hawks rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs, 
127-121, in overtime at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Norman, who led the Hawks with 32 points, lifted Wilkens off the floor 
with a bear hug as players and assistant coaches congratulated the coach as the 
game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkens, 57, gets a chance to take sole possession of the record tonight in 
Cleveland, where he spent seven seasons as coach before taking over at Atlanta 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy it's over, believe me," Wilkens said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 22 seasons, Wilkens' record is 938-790. Auerbach was 938-479 in 20 seasons, 
16 of those in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio's seven-game winning streak ended despite 30 points from David 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, baskets by Mookie Blaylock, Jon Koncak and Tyrone Corbin gave the 
Hawks a 114-108 lead they never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 125, Orlando 123 -- Playing without injured Alonzo Mourning, the 
Hornets made a club-record 14 three-point baskets at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell Curry, who sank six three-pointers, led Charlotte with 28 points and 
Scott Burrell finished with a career-high 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal had a game-high 30 points for Orlando, which had its 
five-game winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 126, Golden State 124 -- Vernon Maxwell's desperation three-pointer 
with 1.9 seconds remaining lifted the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon had 42 points and eight rebounds as Houston held off a furious 
fourth-quarter rally by Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway made a jumper with three seconds left to give the Warriors a 
124-123 lead. Houston tried to get the ball to Olajuwon on the ensuing inbounds 
play but failed and the ball bounced off the backboard toward the out-of-bounds 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, who finished with 15 points, grabbed the bounding ball and threw it 
in for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Portland 104, Denver 93 -- Cliff Robinson scored 27 points at Portland as the 
Trail Blazers scored their eighth consecutive victory over the Nuggets.

 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson of the New Jersey Nets was fined an undisclosed amount for 
missing Wednesday's practice and his status for tonight's game against Indiana 
was uncertain. Unknown personal problems, not a benching in a blowout loss the 
previous night, caused the all-star guard to skip practice, Anderson said. . . 
. Detroit's Oliver Miller will undergo surgery today for his broken right hand. 
He will have a pin inserted and will be sidelined four to five weeks.

CLIPPERS ADD ANOTHER LOWLIGHT; PRO BASKETBALL: FITCH SEES NO POSITIVES AS TEAM 
IS BURIED UNDER THREE-POINT AVALANCHE. HEAT ROMPS, 126-83. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Glen Rice, even after thinking hard, could name only four players on the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter that he couldn't identify them all. What mattered was that he 
badly embarrassed them all, with a 35-point performance in the Heat's 126-83 
rout at Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice was 13 for 20 from the field -- including four of nine three-point 
attempts -- and led the Heat to the most decisive victory in franchise history. 
When he recorded his 30th point, on a jumper early in the third quarter, he was 
only eight points behind the entire Clipper team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept moving, using my screens," Rice said after the Heat set a season 
high by shooting 60.8% from the field. "I made up my mind all I need coming off 
a screen is half a second, and they gave me that half a second. It wasn't that 
they were playing bad defense. I was just kind of feeling it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice was being kind. The Clippers (4-24) were playing no-contact, no-muscle 
defense. Miami's front line outscored its counterparts, 61-28, with Kevin 
Willis chipping in 19 points and 14 rebounds and Matt Geiger grabbing eight 
rebounds and scoring seven points. The Clippers' high-scoring honors, such as 
they were, went to Harold Ellis, who had 11 points. That's the lowest 
team-leading total in a season of lows. 
</P>
<P>
 And that doesn't even begin to address Heat forward Brad Lohaus' three-point 
spree coming off the bench. Lohaus, who had been averaging 4.8 points per game, 
made his first six three-point shots, inspiring chants of "Looo-haus" from the 
crowd of 14,626 before he finally missed. He finished with 18 points; the Heat 
finished with a franchise-record seven three-pointers in the fourth quarter and 
tied a season-best with 14 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clipper Coach Bill Fitch: "Lohaus is Larry Bird's son's godfather. I 
think tonight, he thought he was Bird." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the Clippers' worst game statistically -- they lost to Portland by 
48 points on Dec. 14 -- but it was bottom-of-the-barrel stylistically, 
especially since it followed Tuesday's upset of the Bulls in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch found it fitting that the only prop available to lean on after the game 
was a plastic trash can. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them manhandle us in the low box, (Ledell) Eackles and Willis, and we 
never got into it at either end of the floor," Fitch said after his team's 
sixth loss in seven games and eighth in 10 games. "This is the first time I 
can't find one good quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had no defense for their effort. Eric Piatkowski, cheered by 
fellow Nebraskans in town for Sunday's Orange Bowl game, felt compelled to 
apologize to his fans. "All those people show up and I never dreamed we'd play 
this bad," he said. "I want to tell them I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Randy Woods, who was kicked in the groin and experienced hemorrhaging, 
did not accompany the team to Orlando. He was to be evaluated today and might 
be sent home.

SHAW SAYS RAMS, ST. LOUIS STILL FACE OBSTACLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations between the Rams and St. Louis have reached a point where 
"somebody is going to have to give," Ram President John Shaw said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said a list of 16 major differences has been whittled to three, but 
contrary to reports that a completed deal with St. Louis is imminent, there 
isn't even a guarantee that one can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing from the media that an announcement will come in a week or 
Monday or whatever," Shaw said. "Apparently I have no credibility, because I've 
been saying we're still negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even gotten to the point where it can be presented to ownership 
for approval. There are still three large issues unresolved. . . . We're also 
talking to other people about minority ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to sell 40% of the team to businessman Stan Kroenke of 
Columbia, Mo., but for his $80 million, Kroenke also demanded the opportunity 
to buy out team owner Georgia Frontiere at some point. Frontiere wouldn't agree 
to that.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Kroenke remains the Rams' first preference for minority ownership 
but that there have been no recent talks.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the three unresolved issues with St. Louis are guarantees on 
permanent-seat license sales, guarantees on club seats and luxury-box sales, 
and the location of the proposed practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent-seat licensing program, in which fans pay a one-time fee for the 
right to buy season tickets, is critical to the deal because St. Louis hopes to 
raise at least $60 million from it to cover major costs associated with the 
move -- $30 million the Rams would owe the city of Anaheim for stadium 
improvements completed in 1980, $15 million for a new practice facility and $15 
million in anticipated NFL relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The 101 luxury suites and 6,550 club seats in St. Louis' new 70,000-seat domed 
stadium have the potential to generate about $12 million annually for an NFL 
tenant -- if they are all leased and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit to St. Louis, two Ram officials toured six potential 
practice facility sites. FANS, Inc., the St. Louis group negotiating with the 
Rams, has proposed a 400-acre complex currently owned by the county's pipe 
fitters' union.  
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw reportedly was not happy with that site because it is at least a 
50-minute drive from where he expects most players to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both know where we are, and somebody is going to have to give," said Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running out of time. Even if we were to make some progress, though, I 
know there is no way we will have an announcement in the next week. I would say 
somewhere within the next 30 days, or otherwise we won't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Under NFL bylaws, any team wishing to move for the 1995 season must notify the 
league and submit a proposal for transfer at least 30 days before the annual 
owners' meetings, which will be March 12-17 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Also remaining to be dealt with is the future of Coach Chuck Knox and his 
staff and the possible hiring of a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be meeting with Chuck in the next couple of weeks," Shaw said. "(His 
future) is something we're going to discuss with ownership. There will be a lot 
of football decisions made in the next month."

TWO MORE NFL COACHES ARE SENT PACKING; PRO FOOTBALL: SEATTLE FIRES FLORES AND 
DENVER DISMISSES PHILLIPS IN WAKE OF DISAPPOINTING SEASONS.

<P>
 Two more NFL coaches were fired Thursday -- Tom Flores of the Seattle Seahawks 
and Wade Phillips of the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the second and third coaches dismissed since the end of the regular 
season, joining Rich Kotite of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who coached the Raiders to two Super Bowl victories during the 1980s 
and was coach of the Seahawks the last three seasons, had two option years 
remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, the Broncos' coach for only two seasons, had one year left on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, also Seattle's general manager, announced his own departure after 
being informed of the move by majority owner Ken Behring in a telephone 
conversation. All of Flores' 12 assistants also were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very fleeting profession and it's based on what have you done lately," 
said Flores, 57, who was named to replace Chuck Knox in 1992. "Memories are 
short." 
</P>
<P>
 In Flores' three seasons in charge, the Seahawks were 14-34 and finished last 
in the AFC West all three years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a promising 3-1 start this season that included a victory over 
Pittsburgh, the Seahawks lost nine of their last 12 games to finish 6-10 for 
the second consecutive season after a franchise-worst 2-14 finish in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, 47, the son of former NFL coach Bum Phillips, signed a three-year 
contract with Denver in 1993, after Dan Reeves was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Broncos were 9-7 and made the playoffs as a wild-card team, 
losing to the Raiders in the first round. This season, they finished 7-9 after 
losing their final three games and failed to qualify for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation on a new coach immediately shifted to Mike Shanahan, offensive 
coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers. Shanahan turned down the Denver job 
because of a disagreement over salary after Reeves left. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlen said he wants to find a coach who can take advantage of the talents of 
quarterback John Elway and lead the team to a Super Bowl title before Elway 
retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Elway is a special player who will only come through these headquarters 
once in my lifetime," Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawk President David Behring, the son of Ken Behring, said the team had put 
together a short list of four or five head coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Seattle ownership has had two meetings with former San Francisco 49er 
Coach Bill Walsh, but said Walsh has not been offered any job with the team.

PARCELLS VOTED COACH OF YEAR FOR BRINGING SUCCESS TO PATRIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The one thing Bill Parcells discourages is rampant optimism. Yet how could any 
team be anything but positive with Parcells as its coach? 
</P>
<P>
 In his second season with the New England Patriots, Parcells guided the team 
to a 10-6 record, a wild-card playoff berth and won the 1994 coach of the year 
award from the Associated Press 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells, the first Patriot coach to win the award, also won the honor in 1986 
with the New York Giants. He received 29 votes from a nationwide panel of 98 
sportswriters and broadcasters, beating out Bill Cowher of Pittsburgh, who got 
25 votes, and Dave Wannstedt of Chicago with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gratified by any selection," Parcells said. "But I know deep in my heart 
it's always just a reflection of the whole organization's work and some good 
players and a dedicated coaching staff. I'm the beneficiary of those results." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots were 1-11 last season, then ran off a four-game winning streak to 
end 1993. They were 3-6 this year and losing, 20-0, to Minnesota when 
everything suddenly jelled. New England came back to win that game and the next 
six to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in eight years.

LONG BEACH STATE IN SPARTAN FINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everett Ratleff came off the bench to score 14 points and Mike Atkinson had 13 
points and eight rebounds as Long Beach State defeated Coppin State, 69-63, 
Thursday in the first round of the Spartan Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (4-1) advance to today's championship game against 15th-ranked 
Michigan State, which defeated Ball State, 117-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State led, 38-29, at the half, and extended the margin to 12 before 
Coppin State (2-6) put together a 15-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge, which cut the 49ers' lead to 53-52, was keyed by a pair of 
three-point plays from Stephen Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stewart made his 13th free throw of the half with 3:10 to play, the score 
was tied, 61-61. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers scored the next seven points to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart led all scorers with 22 points, and his 13 free throws tied Shawn 
Respert's two-year-old Spartan Classic record.

LONG BEACH STATE'S RATLEFF LIVES UP TO HIS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BALDWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They still speak about Ed Ratleff in hushed tones at Long Beach State although 
the former 49er basketball star's eligibility ended more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Everett Ratleff might not accomplish what his uncle did -- but give the 
kid time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratleff, a smooth-shooting sophomore guard, scored a team-high 14 points 
Thursday night in Long Beach's 69-63 victory over Coppin State in the Spartan 
Classic at Michigan State's Breslin Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sends the 49ers (4-1) against No. 15 Michigan State (6-1) for the 
tournament championship at 5 p.m. today. Michigan State defeated Ball State, 
117-95, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratleff, 6 feet 3, struggled in Long Beach's first four games. He entered the 
Thursday's game averaging 4.8 points, making only 40% of his shots. He was six 
of 10 against the Eagles, including two of four on three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just feels good to finally do something," said Ratleff, who did not 
qualify academically to play at Long Beach as a freshman. "Having the uncle I 
have really isn't pressure, but having to sit out last year -- that's what 
brought the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just haven't been playing like I'm capable of, until tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers played stifling perimeter defense, shot 51% and received major 
contributions from the bench, including Ratleff's. Coppin State (2-6) shot 30%, 
15% (three of 19) from the three-point line.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great defensive effort from our guys," 49er Coach Seth Greenberg 
said. "Especially from our guards. Coppin State scores half its points with 
three-pointers. We did a great job of taking that away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' top two long-range shooters, senior guards Sidney Goodman and 
Keith Carmichael, were a combined seven for 21, one of six three-pointers. "We 
really took it upon ourselves as a challenge to shut down their guards," said 
Long Beach shooting guard Jamie Davis, who scored eight of his 13 points in the 
first three minutes. "They were the best two guards we faced this season. Until 
tomorrow. Then we face the real big test." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the Spartans' back court of Shawn Respert and Eric Snow, who 
combined for 44 points and 11 assists against Ball State.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach took a 19-4 lead and kept a comfortable double-digit lead through 
the first 30 minutes. With 10 minutes remaining, the 49ers held a 51-41 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 With six minutes left, however, Coppin State had tied the score at 55. Stephen 
Stewart, who finished with a game-high 22 points, keyed the Eagles' 14-4 run.  
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers never fell behind. Forward Akeli Jackson hit one of two free 
throws and reserve forward Brian Yankelevitz put in a layup off an in-bounds 
pass to make it 58-55.  
</P>
<P>
 Stewart made six free throws to tie the score at 61 with three minutes left. 
Then Ratleff threw a perfect pass inside to Yankelevitz. He was fouled, and 
made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Ratleff passed to Atkinson, whose dunk gave Long Beach a 65-61 lead. The 
49ers increased the lead to seven with 1:30 left before settling for the 
six-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The game capped a hectic trip by Coppin State. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, our best student-athlete was late for the bus to the airport," Eagle 
Coach Ron Mitchell said. "Then we accidentally left one of our student managers 
at the airport in Pittsburgh during a changeover. Our sports information 
director's suitcase was lost. The floor we were supposed to stay on at the 
hotel was being painted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a day straight out of hell."

LOSS TO BROWN IS 'LOW POINT' FOR NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trailing by 13 points with less than 14 minutes to play, Brown rallied behind 
the shooting of reserve guards Alan Cole and Oris Bryant to defeat Northridge, 
81-72, Thursday night in the consolation game of the Lobo Invitational at the 
Pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the low point," said Peter Micelli, who scored a game-high 
18 points for Northridge.Considering the Matadors last week lost a game by 62 
points, that's saying something. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown rallied by making seven of 13 three-point shots in the second half. The 
Bears missed all but one of their first 10 tries from long range. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just turned the tables on us," Micelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who had one point in the first half, finished with a team-high 17. 
Bryant scored 11 of his 14 points in the second half. Eric Blackiston also 
scored 14 for the Bears, who evened their record at 4-4.

 Northridge fell to 2-7. MIKE HISERMAN

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: TRAGEDY PREVAILED DURING THE '94 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they are in most years, the champions -- Dale Earnhardt, Al Unser Jr., 
Michael Schumacher, Steve Kinser, John Force and others -- were worthy winners, 
some even record setters, but 1994 will be forever remembered in motor racing 
for its downside. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Neil Bonnett, one of stock car racing's most beloved 
personalities, and rookie driver Rodney Orr on the first weekend of qualifying 
for the Daytona 500 last February set the tone for a long season in which 
Formula One drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger and sprint car 
champion Robbie Stanley died in racing accidents. And that's not to mention the 
possibly career-ending head injuries suffered by Ernie Irvan and Page Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's death, the result of a single-car crash on May 1 during the San Marino 
Grand Prix in Italy, ended the career of one of racing's greatest drivers, 
certainly the finest road racer of his era. The brilliant Brazilian had won 
three world championships and was expected to win many more before his car shot 
off the track at 190 m.p.h. and smashed head-on into a guard rail. He was 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Formula One never recovered from the shocking loss of its biggest attraction, 
its most tragic event since Jimmy Clark's death in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The Formula One season was almost as confusing as it was tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, NASCAR has been accused of keeping Winston Cup races competitive by 
"throwing a NASCAR yellow flag" at some opportune moment under the guise of 
"debris on the track" or "track inspection." The gimmick was to bunch up the 
cars, bring the leader back to the pack and restore the image of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Formula One took that a step further. Instead of bunching up cars in a single 
race, FIA tried to artificially establish a season points race between 
Schumacher and Damon Hill by disqualifying Schumacher in one race, banning him 
from two more and then disqualifying him after he had won yet another. 
</P>
<P>
 And what had Schumacher done? In the first instance, he passed Hill, the 
pole-sitter, on the pace lap , even though the cars would then come to a dead 
stop before the race started. For that he drew a black flag -- ordering him in 
for consultation -- which he temporarily ignored, which led to the two-race 
ban. In the second instance, the German driver's Benetton had a wooden skid 
block -- like a bed slat -- beneath the car that was a fraction of an inch too 
thick. 
</P>
<P>
 After all of this, the season that had seemed over because Schumacher had won 
seven of the first nine races came down to a shootout between him and Hill at 
the final race in Australia. When they crashed together and neither finished, 
Schumacher won his first championship by a single point, a fitting end to a 
bizarre season. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, voted American driver of the year, and Unser were runaway winners 
of this country's two most prestigious series, Winston Cup and Indy cars. 
Earnhardt, whose seventh championship brought him even with the legendary 
Richard Petty, dedicated his season to Bonnett, his closest friend and hunting 
partner. Earnhardt collected $3.4 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A high point was the running of the Brickyard 400, the first non-Indy car race 
at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. More than 300,000 fans watched as the stock 
car drivers waged one of the most exciting finishes in the speedway's storied 
history before youthful Jeff Gordon, an Indiana product, beat Irvan to the 
checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser put a victory in the Indy 500 together with seven other triumphs in 
winning the PPG Cup driver's championship as Roger Penske-owned cars finished 
1-2-3 in five races and the series championship standings. Nigel Mansell, the 
1993 champion, did not win a race and at season's end announced he was 
returning to his native England and Formula One, whose title he won in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinser, in World of Outlaws sprint cars, and Force, in a drag racing funny 
car, kept doing what they do best -- winning. Kinser claimed his 14th 
championship by winning 29 main events and, after stunning the racing world 
with an upset in the International Race of Champions, announced he was leaving 
sprint cars to race Winston Cup stock cars in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Force won his fourth National Hot Rod Assn. championship with 10 event 
victories that pushed him past Don (Snake) Prudhomme as funny car racing's 
winningest driver. He also ran 303.95 m.p.h. at Pomona for a funny car record. 
Prudhomme spiced the year by winning three races plus the Winston Invitational 
on his retirement tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Other champions of note included Scott Pruett in Trans-Am, Steve Millen in the 
Exxon GTS series, Millen's brother Rod in Mickey Thompson Grand National 
trucks, Steve Robertson in Indy Lights, Paul Choiniere in SCCA Pro Rally, David 
Empringham in Formula Atlantic, Tony Stewart in USAC midgets, Mike Chase in 
Winston West stock cars and Scott Kalitta and Dale Alderman in drag racing's 
top fuel and pro stock classes.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / ABOVE THE RIM TOURNAMENT; COTTON COMES TO MATER DEI'S RESCUE 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thursday night's game was not one of Mater Dei's finest performances. Shaun 
Jackson spent much of the game pouting or in foul trouble. Clay McKnight missed 
all four of his three-point attempts and finished with six points. 
</P>
<P>
 But sophomore forward Schea Cotton scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, 
and Mater Dei survived with a 65-63 victory over New York Christ The King in 
the semifinals of the Reebok/Above The Rim Prep Classic in front of an overflow 
crowd of about 3,500 at Torrey Pines High. The Monarchs play Brooklyn Lincoln 
in the final at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, that was an ugly win," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight 
said. "I told the kids after the game, that was nothing to be happy with. I 
don't think we came in very focused. Our pregame wasn't very focused. Our two 
seniors did not come through. Shaun and Clay did not play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson played only 18 minutes and had 13 points, eight rebounds and six 
turnovers before fouling out. Jackson was pulled by McKnight with four minutes 
left in the half and did not return until six minutes remained in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaun is worn out," McKnight said. "Facing this kind of competition every 
night is tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he departed, Jackson helped Mater Dei (15-1) to a 60-52 lead by making 
a 10-foot jumper with 4 minutes 37 seconds left. The shot ended a 6-0 run that 
turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton appeared to run over a Christ The King defender, but the referee called 
a block, and then called a technical on the Royals' bench. Cotton hit his two 
free throws and McKnight hit both technicals before Jackson hit his jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 Christ The King Coach Bob Oliva didn't agree with the call or many others made 
by the referees, and he said the booing crowd agreed with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so inconsistent, I couldn't tell what I was supposed to get used to," 
Oliva said. "The crowd said it all and it was a California crowd and you've got 
to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals (6-2) could have overcome the officiating if they could have 
stopped Cotton down the stretch or made some free throws. They made only 17 of 
30 free throws and missed three in the last four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schea carried us," McKnight said. "He carried our four guys against five of 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the pressure," Cotton said. "That's what you play for. I hate 
blowouts. I remembered when Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) got hurt and Magic (Johnson) 
had to take over the game. That's what I thought of when Shaun fouled out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation bracket: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 67, Las Vegas Gorman 59 -- Dan McDonald had 20 points and five 
steals, David Wilson had 17 points and seven rebounds and Erik Petersen had 
eight points and eight rebounds to lead Ocean View (10-6) to fifth place.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / CENTURY TOURNAMENT; SONORA ROLLS PAST CYPRESS INTO FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sonora proved why it is one of the best boys' basketball teams in Orange 
County by easily dispatching Cypress, 64-48, in a semifinal of the Century 
Holiday Classic Thursday at Century High. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Sergio Hernandez, who had 23 points, and Nathan Mirth, who had 13 
points, including three three-pointers, led seventh-ranked Sonora (12-2) over 
10th-ranked Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who will play Calvary Chapel in the final tonight, broke open the 
game by outscoring Cypress, 18-5, in the third quarter. Sonora cruised although 
its front line was relatively quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-foot center Craig Clark, who has signed a letter of intent with San Jose 
State, had 12 points and 10 rebounds but fouled out with 4 minutes 43 seconds 
remaining and Sonora leading, 51-38. Clark took only eight shots and was not 
dominant on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting forwards Chad Fister and Josh Lien combined for only nine points, but 
Sonora didn't need their output to defeat Cypress (11-3) for the second time 
this season. Sonora beat Cypress in the Sonora Cage Classic final, 63-49, on 
Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sluggish," Sonora Coach Mike Murphy said. "Although Craig fouled out, 
we're confident we can win without him. We're real deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy brought in sophomore Jimmy Landry for Clark in the fourth quarter, and 
Landry scored six of his seven points in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cypress guard Derek Mitchell scored 22 points, including five 
three-pointers, Clark's presence on defense helped shut down the Centurions' 
inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' 6-5 forward Brett Boulton (nine points) and 6-4 forward Chad Boberg 
(five points) made only five of 19 shots. Cypress shot 34% from the field and 
made only one of nine shots in the pivotal third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 62, Century 51 -- Brandon Wills scored 12 of his 24 points in 
the fourth quarter to help the Eagles (12-2) pull away. Nate Morton scored 12 
points and Kevin Falconer added 11 for Calvary Chapel, which made 16 of 17 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Beltran scored 13 points and Vibol Ros added 10 for Century (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 54, Santa Ana 47 -- Ruben Gasso and Towan Oliver each scored 16 
points for Buena Park (7-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago 56, Los Amigos 55 -- Ralph Robledo scored 26 points for Santiago 
(5-7). Kit Ratanaphoulee had 24 points for Los Amigos (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills 78, Westminster 41 -- Ben Nicolas was perfect in 11 free-throw 
attempts and scored 21 points for Sunny Hills (6-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 59, Garden Grove 49 -- Mike Montoya scored 19 points, including six 
three-pointers, for Costa Mesa (6-9). Mike Campuzano had 28 points for Garden 
Grove (5-8).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / COSTA MESA TOURNAMENT; WOODBRIDGE PLAYERS STAY FRESH, WIN 
TITLE 
</P>

 Woodbridge needed the rest and Coach Eric Bangs knew how to supply it as the 
top-ranked Warriors cruised to a 47-35 victory over Kirkland (Wash.) Lake 
Washington in the championship game of the Costa Mesa girls' basketball 
tournament Thursday night at Costa Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing their eighth game in 10 days, Bangs put the Warriors in a zone defense 
and rotated his players regularly enough to keep them productive and prevent 
the Kangaroos from making a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (13-0) went up, 9-0, on two free throws by Krissy Duperron midway 
through the first quarter and kept Lake Washington in check the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors took their biggest lead in the third quarter when Erin Stovall 
made one of two free throws for a 35-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Woodbridge seemed to run out of gas late in the third quarter after 
Stovall's layup made the score 37-22. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of tough-luck shots that wouldn't drop," Bangs said. "We were 
stuck on 37 for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall finally broke the drought when she made two free throws with 4:01 
remaining to give the Warriors a 39-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Washington cut the lead to 41-33 on a three-point play by Meghan Geddes, 
but Duperron scored four points down the stretch to halt the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall led the Warriors with a game-high 14 points and Duperron scored 11 
despite playing on a sore ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Burgess was held to six points and was shut out in the second half, but 
the 6-foot-4 center contributed 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Yarborough, who scored 21 in the Kangaroos' semifinal victory over Costa 
Mesa, was held to four second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Kelly Middlesworth led Lake Washington with 10 points and Geddes 
had eight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 54, Huntington Beach 47 -- Center Corri Lurmann's 18 points and 
nine rebounds helped Costa Mesa in the third-place victory. Erin Brown had 12 
points, including two three-pointers.

COPPER BOWL; BYU'S WALSH FINISHES OFF GIBBS, 31-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Walsh made Gary Gibbs' last game as Oklahoma's football coach a 
nightmare, passing for 454 yards and four touchdowns Thursday night in leading 
No. 22 Brigham Young to a 31-6 victory in the Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs announced his resignation in November but chose to coach through the 
bowl game.Walsh may have made him wish he didn't stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw a 43-yard completion on the first play of the game and didn't slow 
down. He wound up 31 of 45, setting a Copper Bowl record for completions and 
coming up only 22 short of the bowl's record for passing yards, set two years 
ago by Drew Bledsoe of Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars finished the year 10-3, their ninth 10-victory season in 23 years 
under Coach Lavell Edwards. Oklahoma (6-6) saw its string of consecutive 
winning seasons end at 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs concluded his six years as coach with a record of 44-23-2. He is being 
replaced by Howard Schnellenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young dominated from the start, with Walsh completing 10 of his first 
11 passes -- the one miss was a drop. The Sooners didn't cross midfield until 
the final minute of the third quarter.

THESE RAMS A TEAM ON THE RISE; HOLIDAY BOWL: COLORADO STATE TRIES TO MAKE IT 
MOELLER'S WORST SEASON AT MICHIGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten and one.  
</P>
<P>
 They are ranked 10th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenth . 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, outside the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, not many think of 
Colorado State's Rams as a football powerhouse. Certainly not the folks in Ann 
Arbor, Mich., where the mighty Wolverines often start the season among the 
nation's first five. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a down year, Gary Moeller's Michigan is a daunting sight for a Western 
Athletic Conference champion, particularly one that has been to all of two 
bowls (Raisin and Freedom) in its less-than-storied football history.  
</P>
<P>
 So in the name of respectability, Colorado State will be aiming for a victory 
tonight when it faces the No. 20 Wolverines (7-4) in the Thrifty Rental Car 
Holiday Bowl at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Kickoff is at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely not intimidated," Ram quarterback Anthoney Hill said. "We've 
come too far for that. We worked from the bottom up." 
</P>
<P>
 The work began in 1993 with the arrival of Coach Sonny Lubick, who came from 
Miami to replace the controversial Earle Bruce. In Lubick's first season at Ft. 
Collins, the Rams were 5-6. But they won their final three games and have won 
13 of 14, losing only to Utah in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose tonight, it has been an emotional ride for Lubick's Rams. 
Michigan, on the other hand, needs a victory after ending the regular season 
with a 22-6 loss to Ohio State to finish third in the Big Ten. Another defeat 
would give Moeller his worst record since succeeding Bo Schembechler in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan has the big names and even bigger players. But Colorado State's 
offense is so unpredictable, the Rams cannot be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want them to get into an offensive battle with us," Hill warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines have no intentions of such foolishness. This, despite an 
imposing offense that has solid running backs in Tyrone Wheatley, who had 1,064 
yards and 11 touchdowns in nine games, and Tim Biakabutuka, who had 713 yards 
and seven touchdowns in 10 games, and senior quarterback Todd Collins, who 
passed for 2,356 yards and 11 touchdowns, including 1,033 yards to receiver 
Amani Toomer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick is not quite sure how to stop Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of stopping their running game, then they pass," he said. 
"They are a little more physical than anybody we faced this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick was Miami's defensive coordinator from 1988 to '92 so he knows 
something about stopping big-time offenses. The Hurricanes won two national 
championships and were runners-up once during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lubick is not sure whether the experience will help tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Miami, all I did was get on the bus (to go to a bowl game) when they told 
me to," he said. "We'll have 12 or 13 practices before the game. . . . I don't 
know what else (a coach) can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Moeller, who marveled at Lubick's defensive schemes while 
watching videotape of Colorado State. He reminded his players this week about 
Colorado State's ability to play aggressively even when being pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 "All year long, we played better teams with big lines," Ram defensive tackle 
Steve Hodge said. "A lot of our guys don't have the size or numbers of 
Michigan, but we like to take on the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley, whose Heisman Trophy hopes ended with an early-season injury, is 
wary of that attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say (we can) run through them," he said. "I wouldn't say we are 
going to try to go in and overpower them. You try to use too much power and all 
of a sudden they will run past you." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State has been doing it that way all season. Whether mounting a 
running game or passing to a group of fleet receivers, the Rams have proved to 
be dangerous beyond the front range of the Rockies, where they have had a 
season to remember.

MAGNOLIA RALLIES TO WIN IN FOUR OVERTIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Magnolia boys' basketball team rallied from a 24-point deficit midway 
through the third quarter to defeat Fullerton, 86-81, in four overtimes 
Thursday in a consolation-round semifinal of the Canyon tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Amad Shurdim made a three-point basket with three seconds left to tie the 
score at 61-61 and send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Reding, who finished with a game-high 26 points after scoring only two in 
the first half, was fouled during a three-point attempt at the end of the third 
overtime and made three free throws to tie the score at 78-78. 
</P>
<P>
 Reding connected on one of his four three-pointers and Vatha Singbandith hit 
two free throws in the fourth overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Young led Fullerton (8-5) with 19 points, including five 
three-point baskets.

 USC offensive coordinator Mike Riley, after a whirlwind visit to Nashville, 
Tenn., Wednesday night, said he hasn't been offered the head coaching job at 
Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's athletic director, Paul Hoolahan, had asked Riley to fly to 
Nashville to meet university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on an 8 p.m. flight and I was back (in Dallas) after midnight," a 
red-eyed Riley said Thursday. "The hard part was being at our 7 a.m. offensive

 Tony Boselli, USC's 6-foot-8, 320-pound offensive tackle, said he felt like 
going into the Coliseum stands when the Nov. 26 Notre Dame game ended.  
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the 17-17 tie, during the traditional final tributes to 
departing seniors, some in the crowd booed Rob Johnson, departing USC 
quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 Boselli, Johnson's roommate, said the booing "made me sick -- it hurt me, 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like going up there after them and strangling about 90% of them. It 
was so unfair to do that at that moment, after the great career he had." EARL

ROSE BOWL DAILY REPORT; WILL LIONS BE THE FIRST TEAM?

 Twenty-five years later, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno said Thursday he is 
still annoyed that then-President Richard Nixon bestowed a national 
championship plaque upon Texas at the end of the 1969 regular season, even 
though the Nittany Lions also were undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the national championship race becomes a political issue after Monday's 
bowl games, Paterno said he expects support from the White House. First Lady 
Hillary Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, played football for Penn State in 1934, 
and her brother, Hugh Rodham Jr., was a walk-on for the Nittany Lions, although 
he did not play enough to earn a letter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Oregon Coach Rich Brooks was not very optimistic about the status of starting 
wide receiver Cristin McLemore, a junior from Huntington Beach, who sat out 
practice Wednesday because of an ankle injury. McLemore practiced Thursday at 
Glendora's Citrus College and made one outstanding catch, but Brooks said he 
expected the ankle to swell overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be 100%," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McLemore refused to be counted out of Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's saying that stuff to get me going," McLemore said of Brooks. "I ain't 
that old that I can't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only Penn State player considered questionable is defensive tackle Eric 
Clair, who had 11 tackles and a sack in the 63-14 victory over Ohio State but 
has been sidelined since Nov. 1 because of a broken bone in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Clair said his condition has improved each day this week and he should be 
ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks will close the team's practice to media and fans today for the first 
time since arriving in Southern California on Monday.

 "We want to work on a couple of special things I plan to do in the game that I 
don't want the world to see yet," Brooks said.

<P>
 Paterno, on the other hand, has closed his practices all week at UC Irvine. He 
almost never opens them, even at home.

<P>
 "The practice field is a classroom," he said. "I don't want a lot of people 
around."

he can blow smoke like everyone else." RANDY HARVEY

one more step in the right direction.

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; FIESTA: COLORADO VS. NOTRE DAME, MONDAY; 6-4-1 IRISH 
GETTING SOME RESPECT HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unranked Notre Dame's 6-4-1 record going into Monday's game against 
fourth-ranked and 10-1 Colorado at Tempe, Ariz., has created new license to 
needle Lou Holtz and the Fighting Irish. Wrote Joseph Tybor in the Chicago 
Tribune, quoting an anonymous waiter: "What's the difference between Notre Dame 
and Cheerios? Cheerios belongs in a bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Such high humor, not to mention the implication that Holtz and his 1994 
underachievers should have stayed home, has made the Notre Dame coach a bit 
thin-skinned this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me get this straight," he said. "We are playing a team you will concede 
is one of the four best teams in the country, right? Will you concede they are 
going to be at an emotional peak? They've got the Heisman winner, they've got 
Bill McCartney retiring and (assistant coach) Bob Simmons leaving. We're 
playing them in their section of the country. Then I would assume we're, what, 
a 30- to 35-point underdog? Is that what we are? Oh, you mean to tell me, with 
all those things going on, we're only a seven-point underdog? I guess somebody 
thinks we belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, who will step down after 13 years as Colorado's coach and give way 
to assistant Rick Neuheisel, didn't like the intensity of his team during 
Wednesday's practice, so he put the Buffaloes on an 11 p.m. curfew. Holtz, 
perhaps not liking the depth of his players' culture, took them to a ballet.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI FINALLY RISES TO CHALLENGE BY BEATING 
FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The close games have been few, and when Mater Dei has played them in the past, 
it always seemed the Monarchs came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Thursday's semifinal at the Marina tournament, the third-ranked 
Monarchs got a test of character -- trailing in the fourth quarter -- and 
emerged with a 77-63 victory over No. 6 Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Peterson did the most damage for the Monarchs, scoring 35 points -- 
including 19 in the second quarter; she was two short of Leticia Oseguera's 
1993-94 single-game school record. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (8-0) plays fifth-ranked Marina at 8 tonight in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (9-5) trailed by nine at halftime, 43-34, but led by as many 
as five in the third quarter. Jen Rizzo's 15-footer with 6 minutes 2 seconds 
left gave the Barons a 61-60 fourth-quarter lead, but it was their last basket 
until 24 seconds remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, the kids never won any big games; all the close games, we'd lose," 
Mater Dei Coach Mary Hauser said. "This group, they know they have a chance to 
win. . . . Now they don't get nervous. Our kids didn't panic (in the fourth 
quarter), they stayed calm -- that was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting five of 16 from the floor in the third quarter to lose the 
lead, Mater Dei responded in the fourth, making 11 of its final 14 shots; 
Rhonda Gondringer scored eight of her 12 points in the final 5:06. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Hollis added 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley got 21 points from Jennifer Ludwicki and 15 from Nicole 
Strange, but neither scored in the fourth, shooting a combined zero for seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The blowouts) are great for the other (reserve) players, but I would rather 
win a close game to get ready for Brea Olinda, (Ventura) Buena and (Mission 
Hills) Alemany," said Peterson, whose team plays those three powers in January. 
</P>

 Tommie Frazier is Nebraska's starting quarterback, but Brook Berringer will 
play in the Orange Bowl game Sunday night at Miami, Cornhusker Coach Tom 
Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Osborne, Berringer could conceivably play the majority of the 
game.Then again, he said, "It might be Tommie." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer was a little more definitive. He said he expected to play "late in 
the first quarter, early second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the schedule, Nebraska players didn't seem too concerned about the 
switch of starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it really matters who plays quarterback," offensive lineman 
Zach Wiegert said. "If we're going to pass, we can pass block. If we're going 
to run, we can run block. They're both very capable and will do a good job. 
I'll go with whatever (Osborne) says."

GIRLS' SOCCER / OCEAN VIEW HOLIDAY TOURNAMENT; FOUNTAIN VALLEY BEATS OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER STEVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With four minutes left in the second half Thursday, Ocean View scored the 
tying goal, but Fountain Valley won on penalty kicks after two scoreless 
overtime periods in the final of the Ocean View Holiday girls' soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seahawk Coach Ron Uehle was not disappointed after the 2-2 tie and 3-1 
deficit in penalty kicks. His team had reached the final for the first time in 
the tournament's 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (9-1-2) dominated the scoreless first half. But Fountain Valley's 
defense, while haphazard, was effective. Goalkeeper Kim Rudloff stopped all 
four Ocean View shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's on," Baron Coach Brandee Craig said. "Yesterday Erin (Bottis) played in 
the semifinals, and she was on. They're just switching off." 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes into the second half, Ocean View's Kimberly Engesser took a 
corner kick. Rudloff seemed to have caught the ball at the near post, then 
dropped it and it rolled across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 But the view was different from Fountain Valley's side. "One of our girls 
ducked and as our keeper came out, the ball ricocheted between her and the post 
about three times, then went in," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sloppy defense nearly did in Ocean View, and Fountain Valley tied the 
score, 1-1, 20 minutes later when fullback Sharon Gillis scored on a free kick 
from about 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (12-1-2) then took the lead with a little more than five 
minutes left in regulation. After a throw-in, Diana Ginns passed to Karrie 
Layton, whose shot was blocked, but Layton got the rebound and passed to Debbie 
Blake, who scored. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute later, Krista Gaeta tapped Engesser's corner kick through a crowd 
and into the net to tie the score at 2. 
</P>
<P>
 After two scoreless overtime periods, Uehle replaced goalkeeper Jacquelyn 
Knebel with Gaeta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goalkeeper has never played soccer before, and so she's never been 
through that," Uehle said. He said Knebel's first game was Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaeta had never played in goal either, but Uehle said she had more experience

GIRLS' SOCCER / FOOTHILL EXCALIBUR TOURNAMENT; MARINA EASILY DEFENDS ITS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina reaffirmed its girls' soccer preeminence Thursday, easily defeating 
Simi Valley, 3-0, in the title game of Excalibur Tournament at Foothill High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, which annually draws one of the toughest fields in Southern 
California, barely tested the Vikings (8-0), who outscored their competition, 
19-1, in five games to defend their tournament title and extend their unbeaten 
streak to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina, ranked No. 1 in Orange County and the Southern Section, outshot Simi 
Valley, 21-1, but wasn't able to score until the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were too unselfish," Marina Coach Bobby Bruch said. "We would get alone in 
front of the net and we weren't looking for the shot. In the second half we 
told them to be more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings didn't waste much time, but the first two goals came from slightly 
unexpected sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Kristen Palmer, the tournament's offensive most valuable player, 
didn't break through; neither did dangerous forward Cassie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 First it was sweeper Marcy Crouch with her second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes into the second half, Crouch, the tournament's defensive MVP, set 
up for a free kick from the right side about 20 yards out. Her shot, aimed for 
the far post, bounced off goalkeeper Erin Janke's hands and into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was stopper Gina Giallonardo with her first goal of the season six 
minutes later. Giallonardo, whose main responsibility is to keep the ball in 
Simi Valley territory, intercepted a clearing pass and dribbled through the 
heart of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of an accident," Giallonardo said. "I lost control and the next 
thing I knew I was in front of the goal with just the keeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Janke came out to try to stop the shot, but Giallonardo put it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight minutes later, Campbell finally got Marina's offense on the board. After 
a corner kick by Crouch and a scramble in front of the goal, Campbell's hard 
shot from close range hit the crossbar and bounced over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (12-2-2), which beat Trabuco Hills, 2-0, in a semifinal earlier 
Thursday, couldn't manage much of an attack against Marina; its only shot 
coming midway through the first half when Anna Wolleck got behind the Vikings' 
defense. However, Wolleck's shot was weak and Jennifer Simmons barely had to 
move to make her only save. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina, which has won the last two Southern Section Division I championships, 
defeated No. 4 Santa Margarita, 2-0, in the semifinals. Campbell had a goal and 
an assist and Heather Cuthbertson scored. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 1, Santa Margarita 0 -- Lisa Casey scored off an assist by 
Theresa Summa to give the Mustangs the victory.

BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; MATER DEI TAKES MARINA TITLE IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With less than one minute remaining in overtime, Mater Dei freshman Greg 
Bechtold took a pass from Kris Hulgreen in front of the net and slammed the 
ball past the Clovis goalkeeper, Aaron Bryan, earning the Monarchs a 2-1 
victory Thursday and a championship in the Marina boys' soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (8-2-1), last season's Southern Section champion, pressured Bryan 
throughout the overtime period, with junior Ara Akoubian narrowly missing the 
goal wide left earlier in the period, before Bechtold broke free and scored the 
winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams moved the ball well and had ample opportunities to score during the 
game, but Mater Dei broke through the Clovis defense first. Freshman Giancarlo 
Barzotti sailed a shot past Bryan with 11 minutes left in regulation, giving 
the Monarchs a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mater Dei defense and senior goalkeeper Paul Gerdis, who gave up only two 
goals in the tournament, held off the Cougars (10-2-1) for most of the game, 
but with less than four minutes remaining in regulation Curt Posey passed the 
ball into Marty Zubiri, who put a header into the right corner of the goal 
beyond Gerdis' reach. MELANIE NEFF

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / THOUSAND OAKS TOURNAMENT; TORRID HART ADVANCES TO TITLE 
GAME, 53-32 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 10 days ago, the Hart High girls' basketball team was 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday night's 53-32 victory over Cabrillo in a Thousand Oaks 
tournament semifinal, the Indians are 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't difficult for the Indians to pinpoint the reason for the 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's defense," said Hart Coach Dave Munroe, whose team will meet Chino 
tonight for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Valley point guard LaCresha Clark credits Munroe with the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came up with some weird defense," said Clark, who had 18 points and six 
steals. "I didn't even understand it at first, but it seems to be working." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart led, 11-8, after one quarter, then forced seven Cabrillo turnovers at the 
outset of the second quarter to trigger an 18-0 run and a 29-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Jaclyn Kuptz contributed 11 points and nine rebounds, while Jamie 
Broneer added nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who staggered early in the season, rebounded to win the 
consolation title in last week's Simi Valley tournament before taking Thousand 
Oaks by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 In three games, they have outscored their tournament opponents, 184-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino 42, Thousand Oaks 35 -- Rasheeda Clark scored 15 points to lead Chino 
(9-3) in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Jean Clark added 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicki LaSala paced Thousand Oaks (7-6) with 12 points, while Jenn Detmer added 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley 65, Clovis Buchanan 43 -- Freshman Michelle Greco scored 25 
points for Crescenta Valley (11-4) in a consolation semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands 48, Las Vegas Basic 29 -- Kristina Portillo scored 14 points 
for the Raiders (7-6) in the other consolation semifinal.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / HART TOURNAMENT; SIMI VALLEY EDGES NOTRE DAME IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<P>
 Simi Valley High's boys' basketball team has found a rather irksome way of 
beating opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts slowly, lies in wait, then strikes with venom at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers did it again, beating Notre Dame in overtime, 60-56, Thursday 
night in the semifinals of the Hart tournament at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (10-1) trailed by nine points with 6 minutes 31 seconds left but 
closed it out with a 24-9 run. Senior guard Anthony Tauriello led the latest 
ambush with 11 points -- all in the second half -- and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about the third time we've had to come back," said Tauriello, who, 
like his team, started slowly. "I was struggling. But I knew in the second half 
it was important for us to get into a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (8-4) were seemingly in control, leading, 45-36, at the 6:31 mark 
of the fourth quarter. Then they hit the skids with four turnovers. After two 
scoreless minutes, Simi Valley sliced the lead to 45-41. 
</P>
<P>
 After an exchange of baskets, Tauriello made a pull-up jumper to give the 
Knights a 47-45 lead. Then Tauriello made a layup to tie the score after center 
Dan Van Etten stole a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:27 left, Van Etten's first field goal, a three-foot jumper, gave Simi 
Valley the lead, 49-47. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 54, Hart 52 -- The Cowboys (7-4) earned their first berth in the 
championship game in the 23-year-old tournament when Ruben Castaneda made two 
free throws for his only points with six seconds left. Canyon's Greg Minor 
scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half.

CANYONS LOSES ONE AT THE LINE; MEN'S BASKETBALL: COUGARS TAGGED FOR 35 FOULS 
AND ANTELOPE VALLEY WINS TOURNAMENT, 91-83.

<P>
 Nothing like 59 personal fouls to ruin an otherwise perfectly nice basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many there were in a 91-83 victory by Antelope Valley College over 
Canyons in the championship game of the Canyons men's tournament Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders (12-5), who won for the seventh consecutive time, committed 24 
of the infractions but took advantage of the 35 transgressions by Canyons (7-9) 
to run up 41 points at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams play very aggressive defense," said Newton Chelette, Antelope 
Valley coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Marauder forward Orville Turner, who scored a game-high 34 points and was 
named the tournament's most valuable player, was one of the main beneficiaries 
of the foul-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner made 15 of 17 free throws, including all 11 he attempted in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons, on the other hand, connected on only 17 of 30 from the line (56.7%). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by Antelope Valley avenged an 82-73 nonconference loss to the 
Cougars on Nov. 19. The Marauders have won 11 of 13 since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they paid enough attention to us last time," Cougar Coach Lee 
Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley held a 35-30 lead at the half but the Cougars made a run in 
the second half, pulling to within 47-46 midway through the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders, however, went on an 11-2 blitz and stayed ahead the rest of the 
way. Turner scored seven points in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played awfully hard and we've played together," Chelette said. "That's 
what has helped us win 11 of the last 13." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Kwesi Fulton led Canyons with 25 points. The 6-foot-6 sophomore had 17 
of his points in the first half, but got into foul trouble in the second half 
and fouled out with 1 minute 35 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Norris Dorsey added 15 for Canyons and center Marrcel Crain had 14 
points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Jerome Payton scored 21 points for the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played three hard games in a row," Smelser said. "We showed some 
wear and tear tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark 94, El Camino 67 -- Five players scored in double figures to pace the 
Raiders (11-6) in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 Twins Paul and Nick Foster each had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Moorpark. 
The Raiders also got 15 points from forward Brady Mertes. Guard Jaime Jaquez 
scored 14 and guard Jim Harbour had 13. Guard Simon Zanki of El Camino led all 
scorers with 17 points.

AFTER A LOSS TO BROWN, NORTHRIDGE FINDS ITSELF FEELING A LITTLE BIT BLUE; MEN'S 
BASKETBALL: MATADORS REACH NEW LOW AFTER BLOWING 13-POINT LEAD IN SECOND HALF 
OF BEARS' 81-72 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 There have been worse losses by margin. Several of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But worse losses? "I don't think so," said Cal State Northridge basketball 
Coach Pete Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by 13 points with less than 14 minutes to play, Brown rallied behind the 
shooting of reserve guards Alan Cole and Oris Bryant to down Northridge, 81-72, 
Thursday night in the consolation game of the Lobo Invitational at The Pit. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate name, The Pit. Northridge, 2-7 and loser of four in a row, has 
sunk to new depths. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the low point," said Peter Micelli, who scored a game-high 
18 points for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Northridge last week lost a game by 62 points, that's saying 
something. But Cassidy concurred. "We should have been in command of this 
game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown rallied by making seven of 13 three-point attempts in the second half. 
The Bears missed all but one of their first 10 tries from long range. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who had one point in the first half, finished with a team-high 17. 
Bryant scored 11 of his 14 points in the second half. Eric Blackiston also 
scored 14 for the Bears, who evened their record at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just turned the tables on us," Micelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they did, Northridge offered little resistance. "We didn't fight 
back," Cassidy said. "Every coach on the bench was trying to get (Matador 
players) jacked and going." 
</P>
<P>
 In making its decisive run, Brown outscored Northridge, 19-4, in a span of a 
little more than five minutes. "We got on a nice hot streak at the right time," 
said Brown Coach Frank Dobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge helped out, committing 11 of its 17 turnovers in the second half. 
The Matadors went more than 10 minutes late in the game with only one field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were too busy turning the ball over to shoot," Cassidy said. "We just did 
a series of real stupid things and didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli scored 14 of Northridge's 33 second-half points, and the Matadors 
still didn't get him the ball nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious to me they couldn't stop Micelli, and yet we stopped going to 
him," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't take an Ivy Leaguer to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
 Also obvious was that Northridge not only was outshot but outhustled by a team 
that appeared to cherish a victory more. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill, Northridge's floor leader, disagreed with Cassidy's assessment 
that the Matadors lacked fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was talking at halftime about burying them," said Hill, who scored 
all nine of his points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instinct was there. We just didn't take it onto the floor. I don't think 
anybody wanted to fold against a team like this we should beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Martin and Eric Gray each scored nine points for Northridge. Mike Dorsey 
added seven points, but he picked up his fourth foul with 11:48 remaining and 
was on the bench during Brown's big run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears' rally was fueled by an unlikely duo. Although Cole last season led 
Brown with a 13.4 scoring average, he came in averaging 5.4 points and shooting 
22.4%. Bryant, averaging 5.6 points, had made eight three-point baskets in 
Brown's seven previous games. 
</P>
<P>
 He was four for six against Northridge after being forced into a significant 
role when Brian Lloyd, who had been the Bears' most dangerous outside threat, 
injured his right knee with 12:24 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Northridge, which manages to suffer even when a top 
opposing player is injured. "I hope," Hill said, "that this is as low as we 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Note

 Mike Johnson, a Cal State Northridge assistant basketball coach, was taken by 
paramedics to Kaseman Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, complaining of 
chest pains, after Northridge's loss to Brown. Johnson, 25, was expected to be 
released late Thursday night. He attributed his discomfort to Northridge' 
second-half collapse. "I was so ticked I couldn't see straight," said Johnson 
from the hospital.

9 FROM AREA EARN HONORS IN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine regional athletes have been named to the All-Southern Section football 
team, and two area schools each had two representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley High defensive linemen Caleb Smith and Chad Shrout garnered 
section honors, and kicker Chris Sailer and linebacker David Dupetit of Notre 
Dame also earned the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 All are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dupetit, the Mission League's most valuable player, the awards keep coming 
despite his 5-foot-10, 185-pound frame, much to his surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way it does (surprise me) because for my position, most guys are a lot 
bigger," Dupetit said. "I'm pretty small for my position. But I guess size 
doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The section's best offensive players include junior running back Ted Iacenda 
of Hart High, senior receiver Billy Miller of Westlake, and senior linemen Mark 
Manskar of Canyon and Kane Cullum of Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior punter Ignacio Brache of Village Christian was the only player 
recognized from Division X. Brache averaged 41 yards a punt and kicked 16 field 
goals, including 10 from 40 yards or more and five of 50-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 In three seasons, he had 32 field goals and converted 74 of 78 extra-point 
attempts.

All-Sunset League selection.

SIDELINES; CHATSWORTH GIRLS IDLE BUT 'LOSSES' MOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth High girls' soccer Coach Jack Sidwell could only hope that his team 
didn't spend Christmas vacation reading the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal tournament officials erroneously listed the Chatsworth girls' team as a 
participant. So when the Chancellors failed to show for scheduled games against 
Moorpark and Kennedy, results of the matches were phoned in as Chatsworth 
forfeits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to have the girls pick up the paper and be horrified to 
see that we forfeited games in a tournament we never entered," Sidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidwell said that Royal Coach Andy Silva called and apologized for the 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys' team from Chatsworth entered a tournament there and somehow we 
ended up getting included," Sidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zero tolerance: The Chaminade High boys' basketball team plays a swarming 
defense that produces turnovers and discourages opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: In the first round of their tournament Wednesday, the Eagles 
(6-3) forced 22 turnovers, held Yeshiva to 39 points and made Shawn Blank live 
up to his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank, a senior point guard, did not score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense is our philosophy," said Chaminade Coach Jeff Young, whose team has 
allowed an average of 46 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Double vision: Spectators at the Bell-Jeff High girls' basketball tournament 
this week were seeing double. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-round game featured North Hollywood, with senior twin guards Anna and 
Bobbie Celaya, against Oak Park and its identical backcourt tandem of Alexa and 
Alisha Valavanis, also seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood won, 82-66, and the Celayas and Valavanises accounted for 81 
points. Anna Celaya scored 35 points, Bobbie 15. Alisha Valavanis countered 
with 26 points, Alexa five. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two-minute drill: Blake Jacobson, a starting 6-foot-9 senior center for 
Crescenta Valley High, recently was given only two minutes of playing time -- 
but he made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson is slowly recovering after suffering a hyper-extended right knee last 
week. He originally was told he would be out two weeks but lobbied successfully 
for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor said he could play two minutes," Coach John Goffredo said. "That's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson didn't waste any time. Coming off the bench in the third quarter, he 
scored four points, grabbed three rebounds and drew a charge. The Falcons went 
on to defeat Bev Facey of Canada, 86-43, in the opening round of the Covina 
tournament. Stats  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ulloa has moved into 10th place on Cal Lutheran's all-time list in 
assists with 247. The 5-foot-9 junior from Glendale High is averaging 5.3 
assists a game this season and 4.0 during his career. Quotebook  
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian High girls' basketball Coach John Domke, after his team 
committed 29 turnovers and was outrebounded, 43-26, in a 62-50 loss to 
Crescenta Valley on Monday: "They decided to be aggressive and we decided to 
stay on Christmas vacation for an extra day." Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 8 p.m. at Thousand Oaks High gymnasium: championship round of the 
Lady Lancer Holiday girls' basketball tournament. Also tonight at 8 at 
Bell-Jeff High: championship round of the Bell-Jeff Holiday Classic girls' 
basketball tournament.

to Oklahoma.Cooper, one of five black Division I-A head football coaches, was 
an assistant at Notre Dame for two years before taking over at Eastern 
Michigan.

SKIING / BOB LOCHNER; STORMS MAKE CONDITIONS IDEAL IN SIERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Lochner 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For skiers, it was a perfectly timed gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving on Christmas Eve and continuing into the next day, the first of a 
series of Pacific storms added just the right layer of powder for the holiday 
rush to the mountains of California. Then, in midweek, more snow arrived, 
keeping conditions ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 From Big Bear to Mammoth Lakes to Lake Tahoe's great white north, the hills 
are alive with the sound of skis hissing down slopes covered by the deepest 
early winter snowpack in several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Mountain picked up 14 inches of snow over the weekend and six more 
Wednesday, boosting its total past 100. Nearby June Mountain, also owned by 
Dave McCoy, is reporting up to 52 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skiing is really spectacular," Mammoth spokeswoman Pam Murphy said. "This 
is shaping up as one of our biggest weeks ever. We've even been getting a lot 
of calls from skiers who had planned to go to Colorado, trying to make room 
reservations here. Unfortunately, the town is about 99% booked." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere throughout the Sierra, the storms boosted depths to new heights, so 
to speak -- 156 inches at Kirkwood, 132 at Sugar Bowl, 125 at Alpine Meadows, 
120 at Squaw Valley and 102 at Heavenly, to cite a few of the more notable 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 Five to 10 inches fell last weekend in the Southland mountains, where Ski 
Sunrise and Kratka Ridge both opened on a limited basis Monday, joining Mt. 
Baldy, Mountain High, Snow Valley, Bear Mountain and Snow Summit, all of which 
are in full operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Snow Summit, which has up to 40 inches on its slopes, spokeswoman Bonnie 
Tregaskis said: "We've been selling out of lift tickets as early as 8:30 a.m. 
this week, and it looks like it's going to be that way clear through the 
weekend -- although tickets are still presently available for each day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Sunrise, near Wrightwood, is running its quad chairlift and two surface 
lifts at a reduced rate of $22. 
</P>
<P>
 Kratka Ridge, somewhat closer to downtown L.A., has up to 14 inches covering 
its beginners' area, with three lifts operating at a discounted $15. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief holiday break, World Cup competition will resume with a women's 
slalom today at Meribel, France. However, a persistent scarcity of snow has 
forced cancellation of a men's giant slalom that had been scheduled there 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Tomba of Italy, who already has piled up 550 points, holds a 
substantial lead over his closest pursuers in the men's standings. With Michael 
Von Gruenigen sidelined because of a dislocated shoulder, defending champion 
Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway has moved into second place at 302, eight more 
than the Swiss racer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland tops the women's division with 485 points, 
99 more than teammate Vreni Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Americans have performed well in the speed events -- the downhill and 
super-giant slalom -- while exhibiting a chronic inability to make efficient, 
high-velocity turns with any regularity in the slalom and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Twardokens of Santa Cruz provided about the only glimmer of hope for the 
U.S. technical contingent when she finished fifth in a giant slalom last week 
at Alta Badia, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The three finalists for the 13th annual AT&T Skiing Award are Diana Golden, 
Olympic disabled skiing gold medalist; Phil Mahre, Olympic slalom gold medalist 
and three-time World Cup champion, and John Fry, editor-in-chief of Snow 
Country magazine and a former editor of Ski magazine. The winner of the award, 
given annually to an individual "whose commitment to excellence and dedication 
to skiing have profoundly enriched the sport," will be announced shortly before 
its presentation on March 2 at Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 California stops on the 1995 Jimmie Heuga's Ski Express will be Snow Summit on 
March 19 and Squaw Valley on March 26. The event, open to all skiers, is 
designed to raise money for the Jimmie Heuga Center, a nonprofit, scientific 
research organization dedicated to "reanimating the physically challenged" at 
Avon, Colo. Tamara McKinney, a former World Cup champion, and Doug Lewis, 
downhill bronze medalist in the 1985 World Alpine Championships, are the 
national spokespersons for the Ski Express, which begins Jan. 8 and continues 
through the finals at Vail, Colo., April 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Three California resorts have been honored for environmental activities by the 
Skiing Company, which publishes Ski and Skiing magazines. Heavenly, Sierra at 
Tahoe and Sugar Bowl are among 14 finalists for the Silver Eagle Awards to be 
presented at the National Ski Areas Assn.'s annual meeting May 5-8 at Palm 
Springs.

 Senior guard Mike Yang made six free throws in the final minute as Chaminade 
High outlasted previously undefeated Alhambra, 68-60, Thursday in the 
semifinals of the Chaminade tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we wanted," Chaminade Coach Jeff Young said."Mike is one 
of our captains and he came through when he had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading after each of the first three quarters, Alhambra (11-1) couldn't pull 
away from the Eagles (7-3). Chaminade will play Marshall (5-4), a 47-42 winner 
over Calabasas in overtime, in tonight's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get to their bench because that is their weakness," Young said. 
"Every team has a breaking point, and they broke in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade outscored the Moors, 27-17, in the fourth quarter, sparked by 
freshman Justin Stewart's three-point basket with 2 minutes 46 seconds to play 
that put Chaminade ahead, 56-54. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmine Rossi led Chaminade with 20 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles survived early foul trouble and a 17-11 first-quarter deficit to 
tie the score, 19-19, on a layup by Torey Ellis off a behind-the-back pass from 
Yang with 6:13 to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Ho's driving layup gave the Moors a 31-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall 47, Calabasas 42 -- David He scored 17 points, including four in 
overtime, for Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Bloom scored 15 points for Calabasas (3-6).

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BULL'S-EYE VIEW OF '95 RESTS ON POWER OF THE 
MEGATRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After such a wretched year as this one for stocks and bonds, the only 
consolation for most investors is to take a long-term view. After all, the 
market and economy "megatrends" that were so positive a year ago are still in 
place, aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been mulling that question in recent weeks, as investment pros 
fashion their 1995 forecasts for stock prices and interest rates. For the 
bullish camp, maintaining optimism is largely a function of belief in the power 
of certain megatrends to provide a mostly favorable environment for stocks and 
bonds in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 To the bulls, 1994 will wind up looking like a hiccup if the megatrends are 
still valid. But are they? Here's an update on some of the most important 
trends that Wall Street touted so vociferously a year ago, before the markets 
went into their slump: 
</P>
<P>
 * Main Street loves Wall Street. Individual investors' appetite for stock and 
bond mutual funds was viewed as almost insatiable a year ago, as short-term 
interest rates hit 30-year lows and as "long-term investing" became the mantra 
of the masses. As long as the public pumped billions monthly into the funds, 
the bull markets in stocks and bonds always had a ready source of new fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public pump broke down for bond funds last  
</P>
<P>
 spring, as rising market interest rates pummeled bond values and fund 
investors' losses mounted. Result: Bond funds have been drained by net 
shareholder redemptions since last March. In November alone, bond funds' net 
new cash flow was a negative $10.9 billion, according to figures reported 
Thursday by the Investment Company Institute, the funds' trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Now stock funds appear to be suffering a crisis of confidence. Stock funds' 
net new cash inflow in November was $3 billion, the smallest monthly inflow 
since August, 1991, the ICI says. And this month, many mutual fund companies 
say stock fund purchases have continued to wane, as high short-term interest 
rates lure investors back to bank CDs, Treasury bills and money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mutual funds have been such an important source of demand for stocks 
in particular, Wall Street's fear is that a sustained drop-off in stock fund 
purchases -- or worse, a surge in redemptions -- could spell another tumble for 
the market. January will be a key month to watch, because many investors will 
be making decisions about where to put 1995 retirement savings. If they shun 
stocks, this megatrend could be headed for an interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barton Biggs, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co., is bullish on 
stocks for 1995 as a whole, with one caveat: He expects a selloff early on. And 
he warns, "If the public aggressively redeems equity mutual funds next year in 
the same way it redeemed bond funds this year," any market decline "might last 
longer than I now think likely." 
</P>
<P>
 * Capitalism is spreading worldwide. No doubt about it, this megatrend remains 
in place. But as investors learned in 1994, that isn't necessarily immediately 
positive for financial markets. Surprising economic strength worldwide this 
year, as demand for goods and services boomed, helped send interest rates 
rocketing. And as capitalists everywhere clamored for capital, some economists 
began to contend that long-term interest rates were bound to stay higher than 
expected in the 1990s, reflecting a "shortage" of money. That could botch any 
hopes for a continuing bond rally. 
</P>
<P>
 For Third World capitalist economies like Mexico, meanwhile, concern about a 
still-wide gap between rich and poor -- and the potential for social unrest -- 
detracted this year from an otherwise generally bullish long-term outlook for 
"emerging" stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Dean Witter investment strategist William Dodge argues that the 
capitalism wave "can't be bad in the long run" for investors, especially 
considering the alternative. And he sees the major industrial companies of the 
world's developed economies, like the United States, as the real near-term 
winners. "The developed nations will provide the tools (machinery, technology, 
etc.) to the developing nations" to make their economies grow, Dodge says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inflation will stay low. It did in the United States, Europe and Japan in 
1994. U.S. consumer inflation is expected to total a mere 2.7% for the year, 
despite the economy's boom. Wall Street credits the highly competitive U.S. 
economy and increasing competition worldwide, as falling trade barriers favor 
low-cost producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet low inflation didn't stop long-term bond yields from surging in the United 
States or Europe -- to the shock of most investment pros. Now most economists 
expect a slight pickup in inflation in 1995, in part because a tight U.S. labor 
market will help workers negotiate higher wages. The newsletter Blue Chip 
Economic Indicators says economists' consensus estimate for U.S. consumer price 
inflation in 1995 is 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, at least, financial markets are already prepared for such an 
uptick. Then again, last February many pros figured that the markets were 
prepared for the Federal Reserve's initial credit-tightening move. In 
retrospect, they weren't. In the long run, there's still every reason to bet on 
low inflation, experts say. The question near-term is how low is low to Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small stocks will outperform big stocks. As small-stock indexes beat blue 
chip indexes for three straight years from 1991-93, analysts credited smaller 
companies' nimbleness and ability to cash in on profitable "niche" demand in 
the global economy. Many experts predicted that small stocks' bull run would 
last five to eight years -- a typical cycle for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the streak has ended. The Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks is down 
4.5% for the year, while the blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index is off just 
1.1%. Prudential Securities analyst Claudia Mott says odds are small stocks' 
suffering will last: In 68 years, she says, "There hasn't been a cycle in which 
small stocks outperformed for three years, lagged for a year, and then resumed 
their leadership position for another year or two."

TELEPHONE COMPANIES HEAR CALL OF NEW ROUND OF COMPETITION; TELECOM: BEGINNING 
SUNDAY, THE LOCAL LONG-DISTANCE MARKET WILL BE OPEN TO ALL COMERS. THE AD 
ATTACK HAS ALREADY BEGUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The impending arrival of competition for local long-distance telephone service 
in California has set off a nasty marketing battle among telephone companies 
desperate for a piece of a $2-billion market. 
</P>
<P>
 Local long-distance, or toll, calling has long been the exclusive province of 
Pacific Bell and GTE, but on Jan. 1 it will be open to all comers -- and the 
nation's long-distance phone carriers in particular are pulling no punches as 
they try to seize a rare opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider an ad from Express Tel, a Salt Lake City-based phone company. It 
shows a dry-cleaning store and says: "You should know this place well. Pacific 
Bell has been taking you there for years." Another Express Tel ad shows three 
dead fish and asks, "What's that smell?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, Miss.-based LDDS, now the nation's fourth-largest long-distance firm, 
is also on the attack. One ad shows a pair of handcuffs with "Pacific Bell" 
etched on them. The ad says, "You're finally free to choose your own 
long-distance carrier for local toll calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive tactics are not limited to the advertising arena: Competitors 
are offering aggressive discounts and technical assistance to lure prospective 
customers. And MCI Communications was busy Thursday alerting the media to a 
complaint it plans to file today with the California Public Utilities 
Commission alleging that Pacific Bell is unfairly preventing businesses that 
use Centrex service from switching their toll traffic away from Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrex is a special local phone service for businesses, and MCI says Centrex 
customers will not be able to use an optional call-routing feature to choose an 
alternative toll carrier. Pacific Bell notes that Centrex customers can still 
dial a code to use another carrier and says it is not obliged to provide the 
routing feature for toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the competitors say they have to use aggressive tactics -- especially 
attacks on Pacific Bell -- to raise their profiles with the public. As John 
Kennedy, a marketing executive with Express Tel, said, "We've been in the 
business market in California for 10 years, but we're not exactly a household 
word." 
</P>
<P>
 Express Tel hopes to create consumer awareness before competition heats up. 
Big competitors, including MCI and Sprint, have so far relied on direct mail 
and telemarketing to existing customers, saving their big pushes for the new 
year. More than 100 companies have told the PUC they plan to compete for local 
long-distance business -- defined as calls between points more than 12 miles 
apart but within the local calling area. Those calls had been handled by either 
Pacific Bell or GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the competition means much cheaper toll calls. Pacific Bell and 
GTE are lowering their charges by an average of about 40%, and some 
long-distance carriers are promising even greater savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade-off for many consumers is that the cost of basic telephone service 
will rise. Basic rates for Pacific Bell residential customers will rise 35%, 
while basic rates for GTE residential customers will jump 60%. The PUC approved 
the increase in basic service rates to help offset the decrease in local 
long-distance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ads, Pacific Bell and GTE are touting the declines in local 
long-distance charges but saying little about hikes in basic service rates. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, in one of its ads, takes Pacific Bell to task for raising basic service 
charges. "What's behind Pac Bell's cutting their local toll call rates by 40%?" 
the AT&T ad asks, adding, "Is it because Pac Bell will raise basic monthly 
service rates to help make up the difference?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific has had quite a campaign touting their rates," said an AT&T 
spokesman. "We are trying to point out the whole environment is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, GTE, the smaller of the two local phone companies, has escaped attack. 
Pacific Bell hasn't responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research shows consumers don't like the unfriendly nature of the ads they 
are seeing," said Eileen Arbues, vice president of consumer marketing at 
Pacific Bell. "Historically in the long-distance market, companies, in their 
advertising, focus on each other. We choose to focus on the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pacific Bell and GTE have an advantage that allows them to stay above the 
fray: They do not have to provide so-called 1-plus dialing for toll calls. 
Although a customer who uses, for example, MCI for regular long-distance 
service only needs to dial a 1, the area code and number, the same customer 
using MCI for local long-distance will have to dial a five-digit code first. 
The customer will have to know the toll call boundaries in order to know when 
to use the codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer group, thinks the need for an 
access code is enough to neutralize competitors. "It virtually guarantees that 
Pacific Bell and GTE will remain dominant carriers in the regional toll 
market," says Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst at TURN. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the system less cumbersome, MCI, Sprint and Express Tel, among others, 
are providing businesses with equipment that can electronically recognize which 
calls are toll calls and automatically dial the access code. In return, the 
customers must either agree to send a certain number of calls over the 
long-distance networks or to stay with the long-distance carrier for a year or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) New Phone Rates, New Choices 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Jan. 1, local phone customers will for the first time be able to 
choose alternate carriers for handling "toll" calls -- those which travel more 
than 12 miles but are still within a regional calling area. Although rates for 
toll calls will be dramatically lower, the monthly charge for basic residential 
phone service will increase. Pacific Bell's will rise from $8.35 to $11.25 a 
month; GTE's will increase from $9.75 to $17.25 per month. Here are some 
current and future prices for a three-minute daytime toll call: 
</P>
<P>
 From Santa Ana to Los Angeles 02,29,07 Company Rate Pacific Bell (current) 
$0.57 Pacific Bell (after Jan. 1) 0.36 AT&T 0.34 MCI 0.30 Sprint 0.38 Express 
Tel 0.20 Cable & Wireless 0.21 From Pasadena to Riverside 02,29,07 Company Rate 
Pacific Bell (current) $0.84 Pacific Bell (after Jan. 1) 0.40 AT&T 0.37 MCI 
0.33 Sprint 0.41 Express Tel 0.20 Cable & Wireless 0.21 From Anaheim to

(after Jan. 1) 0.42 AT&T 0.37 MCI 0.33 Sprint 0.43 Express Tel 0.20 Cable & 
Wireless 0.21 Note: Sprint has a special promotional rate of one cent per 
minute for toll calls, which will expire at the end of February. The rates 
listed above are those Sprint will charge when the promotion expires. Smaller 
carriers such as Express Tel and Cable & Wireless charge a flat rate per minute 
for toll calls. Their rates are not distance-sensitive.

2 SENTENCED IN WORKER COMP CASE; FRAUD: BEVERLY HILLS DOCTOR AND EX-WIFE PLEAD 
NO CONTEST. AMOUNT RECOVERED IS A RECORD FOR SUCH CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beverly Hills doctor accused of masterminding one of the biggest workers' 
compensation scams in California history -- bilking insurance companies out of 
at least $30 million -- was sentenced Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior 
Court after pleading no contest to four counts of criminal conspiracy and 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The physician, Mark Kaplan, 55, was joined in court by his ex-wife and office 
administrator, Polina Ioffe, 50, who pleaded no contest to a single count of 
conspiracy. Authorities said the couple's business -- which operated under a 
variety of names, including Harper Medical and Park Medical -- recruited 
thousands of laid-off workers and persuaded or duped them into making false 
on-the-job injury claims from 1988 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Under plea agreements reached with the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, Kaplan and Ioffe will pay fines and restitution expected to amount to 
$7.5 million -- a sum prosecutors called the largest ever recovered in a state 
fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kaplan will be sentenced to eight years in state prison and Ioffe 
will receive a two-year term, although their actual time in prison is expected 
to be substantially less than that. They will also forfeit claims to an 
estimated $10 million to $20 million in outstanding medical bills submitted by 
their clinics to insurers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The case easily marks the biggest legal victory by the district attorney's 
office in its battle against workers' compensation fraud. The office had been 
criticized by employer groups and insurance carriers for moving too slowly to 
convict the masterminds behind the allegedly widespread fraud that has plagued 
Southern California in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, prosecutors were exultant. The case shows that "if you 
rip off the system and get caught, you're going to prison," said Rebecca 
Noblin, the deputy district attorney who was lead prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with insurance companies and employers, prosecutors said, genuinely 
injured workers and job-seekers were victimized. Officials said some people 
with job-related injuries went to the Kaplan clinics hoping to receive needed 
medical attention; instead, they were simply whisked through the clinics 
without getting proper care, or sometimes were treated by therapists lacking 
proper certification. 
</P>
<P>
 About the time Kaplan and Ioffe were arrested at their Beverly Hills estate in 
July, 1993, another nine employees of the enterprise were charged. Seven of 
those arrested previously pleaded guilty, receiving jail terms of 30 days to 
six months. Another employee was granted immunity in exchange for testimony; 
the remaining employee, also a suspect in an unrelated homicide case, is at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Kaplan and Ioffe's operation recruited workers or job-seekers 
to make work injury claims that, in turn, were used to generate inflated or 
bogus medical bills. The enterprise sought recruits by advertising in Spanish 
and other foreign-language newspapers and broadcast media, sometimes calling 
itself an employment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Those drawn to the bogus agency typically would be directed to an affiliated 
clinic, where where they would be put through a battery of unnecessary, 
overpriced medical tests. Kaplan's company often charged insurers $8,000 to 
$12,000 per patient for an initial medical evaluation, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some job-seekers knowingly participated in the workers' comp scam, 
others unwittingly went through the medical tests believing they were required 
for employment, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's appearance before Superior Court Judge Nancy Brown stretched on for 
five hours as the defendants repeatedly balked at terms of the plea agreement. 
Finally, they entered pleas of "no contest" rather than the standard "guilty," 
even after Brown told them that both pleas would mean the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers said Kaplan and Ioffe's concerns about the welfare of their 
two sons, ages 22 and 13, were pivotal in their decision to enter into the plea 
bargains. Under the agreement, they noted, the family would be left with $2.5 
million in assets. Also, Ioffe could be free by September or October, given the 
time she has already served and anticipated time off for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they entered the plea agreement to save taxpayers the expense 
of a long trial and because of the unprecedented penalties and the length of 
the prison terms.

NO KNOCKS YET FOR NEW GAS; LESS-TOXIC FUEL IS HERE; HIGHER PRICES MAY FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The air in Southern California is already slightly cleaner today than it was a 
month ago because of the latest gasoline required by a federal law that 
officially takes effect Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most drivers in the air basin covering Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties have been using the new fuel for the past few weeks as it 
has steadily replaced conventional gasoline at service stations ahead of the 
New Year's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no complaints have been heard from consumers about the new mix, known 
as reformulated gas, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
which administers the rule mandated by the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had any reports of performance problems," said Dave Schmidt, a 
spokesman in the EPA's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has found that one component of the new gas, which improves combustion 
by introducing extra oxygen, could result in an almost undetectable 1% to 2% 
reduction in mileage. But Schmidt noted that Southern California drivers have 
used such oxygenated fuel without much notice for the past few winters, under a 
separate regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, retail prices for the new fuel have yet to rise, though reformulated 
gasoline is more expensive to produce. However, oil experts caution that gas 
prices in Southern California could rise substantially over the next two years 
because of changes in the refining process to meet federal and state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest fuel change is aimed at cutting gasoline toxins and smog-forming 
substances -- which damage lungs and have been linked to cancer -- by 15% from 
1990 levels in the nation's smoggiest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-brewed gasoline will be the only fuel available in the Los Angeles area 
and eight other cities, as well as other less smoggy regions that have 
voluntarily opted to use the gas to cut their own air pollution. In all, a 
third or more of U.S. drivers will be using the new formulation, which is 
required for all octane grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in the past decade, public health laws requiring cleaner-burning 
gasoline have been implemented one after another -- and more are coming over 
the next five years. Ending air pollution has been much more difficult than 
early Los Angeles regulators had hoped, some of whom predicted that smog would 
be gone by 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the toughest change of all takes hold in California a year from now, 
when gasoline must become even cleaner -- and therefore more expensive -- under 
state regulations known as CARB II, shorthand for the second phase of 
reformulation required by the California Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "CARB II is the most severe reformulation of any gasoline in the world," said 
D.J. Youngblood, general manager of environment, health and safety for Texaco 
Refining & Marketing in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Converting refineries to make different fuels can be expensive, and these 
costs are inevitably passed along to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investments to enable California refineries to make the current reformulated 
gasolines and diesel will total $5 billion to $7 billion, according to Purvin & 
Gertz Inc., a refining consulting firm with offices in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil industry experts and federal and state regulators estimate it will cost 
refiners up to 6 cents a gallon more to produce the new fuel due Sunday. As for 
CARB II gasoline, the same experts expect it will cost 6 cents to 8 1/2 cents a 
gallon more to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Some oil industry planners say California gasoline could rise as much as 17 
cents a gallon at the pump by mid-1996, depending on what happens to crude oil 
supplies and prices. Much also depends on how refining, wholesale and retail 
profit margins fare under the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, confusion in the marketplace has offered a chance to widen 
profit margins. Unleaded gasoline was expected to cost refiners 3 cents to 5 
cents a gallon more to make than conventional fuel. But retail prices at the 
pump increased from 5 cents to 15 cents, an EPA fuels expert recalled recently. 
Refiners today, who have lately been squeezed by unusually tight margins, might 
see opportunity in rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But many refiners say they are worried that in highly competitive gasoline 
markets such as Southern California, they may have trouble passing along the 
extra costs of refining, let alone gaining a shade more profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, prices haven't risen yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest Lundberg Survey, analyzed in mid-December, regular unleaded 
self-serve gasoline in Los Angeles averaged $1.26 a gallon, down almost a cent 
from two weeks before. The American Automobile Assn., which has been tracking 
costs weekly in cities where the new gasoline is required, has also found pump 
prices dropping nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Trilby Lundberg suspects that several factors could be keeping prices 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been energetic price cutting of conventional gasoline to purge it 
from the system, to make way for the new reformulated gasoline," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 And crude oil prices, which are sooner or later reflected in gasoline prices, 
have been falling for more than a month, Lundberg said. That could offset the 
higher cost of the new fuel.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, refiners have been careful to see that adequate supplies of the new 
fuel are on the market at the same time they have cut prices to lower inventory 
of conventional gasoline by the end of the taxable year, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Refiners have cushioned themselves, and the benefit for the moment has come 
to the consumer," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But few service station owners expect that to last. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Doms, owner of a Unocal station in Mission Viejo, has cut his pump prices 
slightly in recent weeks, but he expects his wholesale suppliers to start 
raising fuel costs in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a number of us sitting around waiting for the other shoe to drop," 
Doms said.

SUCCESSFUL GAME PLAN BY O.C. HOTELS; TOURISM: WESTIN SOUTH COAST PLAZA AND THE 
WATERFRONT HILTON IN HUNTINGTON BEACH ACTED EARLY TO LURE BOWL GAME BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bonnie Best began scouting Penn State University in August, even before the 
opening game of the college football season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions' strengths were obvious, Best said. Longtime Coach Joe 
Paterno's squad had an explosive offense, and the team seemed the best bet in 
the Big Ten to win a berth in the Rose Bowl against eventual Pac 10 champion 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 So Best, director of marketing at the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, 
drew up a game plan to bring Penn State's coaching staff and football team to 
the Westin. She sent Penn State's athletic department a scouting report that 
outlined the hotel's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 As the team marched undefeated through its regular season, she "sent them 
notes and cards, letting them know we wanted to be part of their team." 
</P>
<P>
 In late November, her diligence paid off. Penn State's athletic department 
signed on with the Westin, and on game day Monday, more than 90% of the hotel's 
390 rooms will be filled with football players and their coaches, relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a nice economic boom for us," Best said. "We've had a good year, 
and this is just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westin joins other hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions across 
Southern California that ring up big benefits from the annual bowl game. 
Officials at the Pasadena-based Tournament of Roses estimate that the annual 
parade and bowl game pump about $100 million into the local economy. Pasadena 
alone collects more than $265,000 in license fees and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The week between Christmas and New Year's is usually a pretty slow time 
because there's very little business travel and no convention business," said 
Bruce Baltin, a vice president with PKF Consulting, a Los Angeles-based company 
that tracks tourism. "This kind of thing really helps." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses "can't go wrong on bowl programs," said Tim McGill, sales director 
at the Waterfront Hilton in Huntington Beach, where Penn State stayed for four 
days before transferring to the Westin Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful for a city, especially if you have teams that haven't been to 
the bowl in a while," McGill said. "Look at last year with Wisconsin, when you 
seemed to have 'cheeseheads' everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the stakes are so high, hoteliers "make contacts early on in the 
season and try to keep in touch with various teams" as the season progresses, 
said McGill, whose hotel hosted the University of Michigan for the 1993 Rose 
Bowl. "You try to find out who makes the decisions and let them know what you 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 In odd-numbered years, hoteliers said, the Tournament of Roses requires that 
Pac 10 teams stick with hotels in the Pasadena area, while the Big 10 
representative has the option of booking out-of-town accommodations. In 
even-numbered years the roles are reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, thousands of Penn State fans are staying at Orange County hotels 
this year to be near their team. Penn State charter groups are booked at more 
than half a dozen local hotels, including Le Meridien in Newport Beach, the 
Anaheim and Irvine Marriotts, the Waterfront Hilton and the Westin. 
</P>
<P>
 At Le Meridien, more than 200 rooms are reserved for Penn State fans, who 
began arriving at midday Thursday. "Most of them are coming in on Friday and 
Saturday, and they're staying through to Wednesday," said Diane Pacheco, 
director of marketing. "They'll be influencing a lot of businesses throughout 
the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels and merchants try to make it easy for out-of-towners to spend freely. 
South Coast Plaza, for example, is offering parking space for more than 100 
buses bringing Nittany Lions fans to a pep rally at the nearby Westin on 
Sunday. To reach the rally and return to the buses, those fans -- expected to 
number as many as 10,000 -- will walk through the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legends Sports Bar & Restaurant in Costa Mesa will serve as an unofficial 
headquarters for Penn State alumni who don't have tickets for the big game. 
Legends landed that role during the college football season, when it served as 
host to about 100 alumni who gathered regularly to watch their Nittany Lions on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Penn State students who are staying at a nearby hotel plan a New 
Year's Eve party at the bar, and Penn State fans are expected on New Year's Day 
to watch No. 1-ranked Nebraska play No. 3 Miami. The outcome of that game could 
affect Penn State's bid for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have tapes of the Penn State band playing, and we'll have 
videos of the team's past great years," said John Moore, Legends' general 
manager. "We're going to try our best to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Best, at the Westin, said the hotel has learned to pay attention to details 
when it goes after teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to know you can provide a taping room (for the athletes) and that 
you can deal with all the equipment," Best said. "We tried to let them know we 
had the experience. . . . We let them know that we'd hosted USC and that Ohio 
State had stayed here twice and won both times." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westin took the unusual step of allowing Penn State to make room 
assignments. Hotel managers turned over floor plans to the athletic department, 
which selected rooms for its team members, coaches, family members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Bowl participants aren't chosen until late November, hotels may find 
themselves scrambling for replacement business if their bids fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-season scramble was eased at the Hilton in Huntington Beach, which 
booked more than 100 rooms for the Nittany Lions during their early four-day 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave us a really good bump up because it came at a time that's usually 
pretty quiet," sales director McGill said. "Last week was just awesome."

 Coke Out for Bear Over Rival Ads: The Goliath of soft drink makers took on 
David when it sued a 112-year-old family-owned soft drink business over the 
latter's use of television ads featuring polar bears. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola 
is seeking a preliminary injunction against Worcester, Mass.-based Polar Corp. 
in U.S. District Court in Boston. Coca-Cola claims the TV spots disparage its 
products. A recent ad by Polar, which said it has used a polar bear as its 
mascot for most of its history, shows an animated bear tossing a can of Coke 
into a recycling bin marked "Keep the Arctic Pure." The bear then drinks a can 
of Polar's seltzer water. Coke has also used polar bears in its TV advertising.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; TECH STOCKS RALLY; DOLLAR BOUNCES BACK 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. stocks closed mostly higher Thursday, led by a year-end rally in 
technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar gained ground after sliding on Wednesday on concerns 
about a potential U.S.-led rescue of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks continued to rebound. But in Europe shares slumped as interest 
rates took a surprising jump. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials eased 6.06 points to 3,833.43, but the 
blue-chips' small losses masked gains in the broad market. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers by 1,164 to 1,086 on the New York Stock Exchange in 
moderate trading. And in the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks, winners 
beat losers by 1,774 to 1,486. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with tech stocks, soared 7.07 points or 1% 
to 749.53. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly a handful of technology stocks are doing their own thing while the 
Dow stocks are cooling off," said Trude Latimer, analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The tech rally was led by Intel, which zoomed 1 7/8 to 64 3/8 after Merrill 
Lynch raised its 1995 earnings forecast for the computer chip giant to $7.90 a 
share from $7. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar rose to 1.553 German marks from 1.544 on 
Wednesday, and to 99.70 Japanese yen, up from 99.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern that the United States would become ensnared in Mexico's financial 
problems caused the dollar to tumble on Wednesday. But on Thursday the 
plummeting peso stabilized, calming traders' nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. bond market, which was hurt by the falling dollar on Wednesday, 
closed largely unchanged. The 30-year Treasury bond yield held steady at 7.83%, 
showing no reaction to the latest government economic reports suggesting a 
slowing economy ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds didn't fare as well in Europe: A surprise rise in bank lending rates in 
France, and a renewed pledge by British Prime Minister John Major to cut taxes, 
helped send bond yields surging. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 15-year benchmark British government bond jumped to 8.65% 
from 8.43% Wednesday. In France, the 10-year government bond yield soared to 
8.25% from 8.04%. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in European yields slammed stocks there. London's FTSE-100 index 
dropped 30.2 points to 3,065.6, Frankfurt's DAX index tumbled 31.98 points to 
2,077.03 and Paris' CAC-40 index plunged 33.68 points, or 1.8%, to 1,894.15. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, the Bolsa index gained 73.34 points, or 3.1%, to 
2,411.06 as bargain-hunters rushed in, betting that the country's crisis will 
pass. Argentina's key stock index rebounded 5.4% and Brazil's jumped 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks also rallied, with the Nikkei-225 index gaining 87.45 points to 
19,752.98, a two-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks rising with Intel included Micron Technology, up 1 1/8 to 45 1/4 
after Goldman, Sachs raised its earnings estimates; and Hewlett-Packard, up 1 
7/8 to 102 1/8 after Smith Barney upgraded its rating to "buy" from 
"attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Also gaining: Compaq, up 7/8 to 40 1/8; Sun Microsystems, up 1 to 36 5/8; IBM, 
up 1 3/8 to 74 3/8; America On-Line, up 2 1/8 to 57 7/8; Ortel, up 2 1/4 to 26 
1/4; and Lotus Development, up 1 3/4 to 41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail issues rebounded from their selloff in recent days on 
disappointment over Christmas sales. Ann Taylor gained 2 5/8 to 34 1/2 and Gap 
added 1 to 30 1/2. But Stroud's slumped 1 7/8 to 9 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S.-traded Latin American stocks rising included Telmex, up 7/8 to 42 3/8; 
Coca-Cola Femsa, up 1 7/8 to 24 1/2; Grupo Sidek, up 1 1/8 to 10 1/2; and 
Brazil Fund, up 1 1/4 to 33 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Citicorp surged 1 3/8 to 41 7/8. The banking giant's shares had been 
battered on worries about its Latin American loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, in commodity trading, copper prices rose to their highest level in 
six years with economic recoveries in the United States, Japan and Germany 
fueling a rally that analysts say shows no sign of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand from Asia has also been boosted by the prolonged closure of the 
Philippines' only copper smelter. The smelter was shut before the Christmas 
holiday because of typhoon damage, and it is not expected to reopen until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper futures on New York's Commodity Exchange set contract highs on most 
months, with March futures rising 0.15 cent to $1.38 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year copper has soared about 70%. Demand for the 
metal is forecast to grow more than 3% next year, and since no new mine or 
refinery output will be on stream until the second half of 1995, copper 
supplies should fall steadily, analysts say.

 Alaska Oil Export Ban Challenged: Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said she will 
push to repeal the law against exporting oil from Alaska's North Slope.She said 
she saw broad support for the idea late in the last Congress, but Alaska's 
delegation was unable to win repeal. President Clinton has also indicated 
support for lifting the ban. Energy Department research concluded that 
exporting the oil would generate jobs and revenue, but some West Coast 
lawmakers say gasoline prices could soar with less Alaskan oil going to 
domestic ports.

 Wall Street stocks struggled to an indecisive close Thursday, a sharp run-up 
in the shares of high-technology companies notwithstanding. The dollar was 
definitely strengthened, however, bouncing back in thin trading as panic over 
Mexico's financial crisis subsided.  
</P>
<P>
 Many investors were selling to establish losses for tax purposes, traders 
said, something that will continue through Friday, the final session for 1994. 
In addition, some options expirations coming up on the last day of the year had 
a mixed effect on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly a handful of technology stocks are doing their own thing while the 
Dow stocks are cooling off," said Trude Latimer of Ferguson, Andrews & 
Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets showed little reaction to two important pieces of economic news: 
The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading economic indicators 
rose 0.3% in November, its biggest increase since August. The increase raised 
expectations that the economic recovery will continue. Those expectations were 
also fed by the Labor Department's report that 3,000 fewer Americans sought 
unemployment benefits last week, more than compensating for the 2,000-person 
increase for the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 6.06 points at 3,833.43. Advances 
beat declines 1,165 to 1,093 on a light volume of 250.5 million shares on the 
New York Stock Exchange, up from 243.5 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite rose 7.07 to 749.53, reflecting gains in stocks such as 
Intel and Dell Computer. Intel added $1.875 to 64.375, and Dell gained 1 5/16 
to 41 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dow has been leading the market, and I guess it's taking a back seat 
today," said Hildegard Zagorski of Prudential Securities. The Dow has risen 
nearly 200 points from early December through the Tuesday after Christmas, but 
the blue chip index retreated 22 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5533 German marks, up 
from 1.5425 late Wednesday. The dollar also was changing hands in New York at 
99.70 Japanese yen, up from 99.21 Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Bond market activity has been extremely slow this holiday week. On Thursday, 
the yield of the Treasury's main 30-year bond held at Wednesday's close of 
7.83%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.31 to 461.17. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.15 to 251.44. The 
average price per share rose 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Some retailing stocks that had come under pressure earlier in the week made 
partial recoveries. Toys R Us, which lost 3 1/8 on Wednesday, rose 3/8 to 30 
1/2. Ann Taylor gained 2 5/8 to 34 1/2, and Dayton Hudson rose 2 1/2 to 69 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico ADRs ?? gained 7/8 to 42 3/8 as bargain hunters were 
attracted to stocks that had been badly battered by last week's peso 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Micron Technology rose 1 to 45 1/8 after Goldman, Sachs raised its earnings 
estimates for the company's 1995, 1996 and 1997 fiscal years. Hewlett Packard 
rose 2 1/8 to 102 1/4 after Smith Barney upgraded its rating to "buy" from 
"attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 * Copper prices rose to their highest level in six years Thursday with 
economic recoveries in the United States, Japan and Germany, fueling a rally 
that analysts say shows no sign of slowing. Demand from Asia has also been 
boosted by the prolonged closure of the Philippines' only smelter. The smelter 
was shut before the Christmas holiday because of typhoon damage, and it is not 
expected to reopen until next week. Copper futures on New York's Commodity 
Exchange set contract highs on most months, with March delivery closing up 0.15 
cent at 138.05 cents per pound, just below the day's peak of 138.40 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, copper has soared by about 70%. Its demand is 
forecast to grow by more than 3% next year, and since no new mine or refinery 
output will be on stream until the second half of 1995, copper supplies should 
fall steadily, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tokyo stocks were steady, with the 225-share Nikkei average ending 87.45 
points higher at 19,752.98. London equities finished broadly lower. Dealers 
said thin post-Christmas trading exaggerated the downturn. The FTSE 100 index, 
which had risen in eight of the previous 10 sessions, dropped 30.2 to 3,065.6. 
The German DAX index ended down 31.98 points at 2,077.03. In post-bourse 
trading, the DAX eased to 2,074.68.

LEADING INDICATORS SUGGEST ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN; FORECAST: DESPITE A 
HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED GAIN OF 0.3% IN NOVEMBER, ANALYSTS SEE MORE COOLING. 
</P>

<P>
 After remarkably strong growth in 1994, the U.S. economy will slow next year 
but avoid a recession, the government's forecasting gauge suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Thursday that its index of leading economic 
indicators posted a 0.3% gain in November. The increase followed a 0.1% decline 
in October, the first setback in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 While the November gain was better than expected, analysts said that for the 
past six months, the performance of the index has clearly been signaling a 
slowdown in growth but, so far, no outright downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts are forecasting low growth next year, as measured by the gross 
domestic product, which is expected to be below 3%. That would be significantly 
lower than the 4% GDP rate expected for 1994, a year in which the economy 
created more than 3 million jobs, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year 
low of 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 That growth was led by a surge in consumer spending for homes, autos and other 
big-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the rapid growth, coming in the fourth year of an economic recovery, 
spurred the Federal Reserve Board to launch an aggressive effort to boost 
interest rates to dampen demand and thus ward off higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said there were hints in the November index report that this effort 
was starting to bear fruit, with interest-sensitive sectors such as 
construction showing weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second report Thursday, the Labor Department said claims for unemployment 
benefits dropped by 3,000 last week, with 322,000 Americans filing initial 
claims at unemployment offices, reflecting continued strength in labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs report was in line with other indicators showing 1994 is ending at an 
extremely rapid clip. That strength is likely to prompt the Fed to boost 
interest rates for a seventh time at its next meeting in late January, analysts 
said. But they were split on whether there would be further rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argued that mounting signs of a slowdown will prompt the Fed to remain on 
the sidelines for the rest of 1995, but others said that inflation concerns 
will force the central bank to raise rates at least twice after January.

 Airbus Lands Big Order: International Lease Finance Corp., a major commercial 
jetliner leasing company based in Beverly Hills, placed firm orders for 30 
single-aisle jets built by Airbus Industrie of Europe.ILFC, a unit of American 
International Group Inc., ordered eight A319s, 13 A320s and nine A321s. The 
company also took an option on 10 additional Airbus planes. The value of the 
deal was not disclosed, though the sticker price for the firm orders totals 
$1.4 billion. However, major buyers such as ILFC -- which is Airbus' biggest 
customer -- often negotiate discounted packages that include spare parts and 
aircraft training.

 Pentagon Endorses Lockheed-Martin Merger: Saying defense mergers are "both 
inevitable and necessary" because of defense spending cuts, Deputy Defense 
Secretary John M. Deutch said the $10-billion marriage of Lockheed Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. should be approved by the Federal Trade Commission. In a 
letter to FTC chief Janet D. Steiger, Deutch said the deal would not give 
Lockheed-Martin unfair market concentrations, even in the satellite market, 
where Calabasas-based Lockheed and Martin Marietta are both big players.

 Partnerships in for Tax Scrutiny: The Internal Revenue Service published rules 
intended to keep companies from maintaining separate partnerships to avoid 
taxation.Dan Halperin, law professor at Georgetown University in Washington, 
said taxes due on a partnership's earnings are allocated to the individual 
partners, so some companies use the structure to show a tax result "that 
doesn't reflect the actual economic transaction." Income may be shifted to a 
tax-exempt partner or losses may be falsified to offset a partner's obligation, 
he said. Since the new rules were proposed last summer, many securities firms 
have stopped marketing partnership structures that could run afoul of them.

 California Utilities' Debt Downgraded: Moody's Investors Service lowered its 
ratings on $19 billion in debt issued by the state's three major utilities in 
anticipation of new competition in the industry. Moody's said it was concerned 
that the utilities will not be able to sell power at competitive rates and will 
lose major customers when the market is deregulated under a plan to be phased 
in beginning in 1996. It downgraded the senior debt of San Francisco-based 
Pacific Gas & Electric to A2 from A1, the senior debt of San Diego Gas & 
Electric to A1 from AA3, and the senior debt of Southern California Edison to 
A2 from AA3.

 Nestle to Sell Cat Food Plant: The company agreed to the sale to settle 
concerns that its planned $510-million acquisition of Alpo PetFoods would 
stifle competition and lead to higher prices.The government said Nestle Food 
Co., which makes various cat and dog foods, must sell its Ft. Dodge, Iowa, 
plant to close the deal. The Federal Trade Commission had said the acquisition, 
announced in September, would eliminate competition between Glendale-based 
Nestle and Alpo PetFoods of Allentown, Pa., a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan 
Inc. The sale may also have raised the odds for collusion among the remaining 
cat food companies, the FTC said.

 Executive Life Settlement Reached: The $36-million settlement of a lawsuit 
filed on behalf of policyholders of the Los Angeles-based insurance company was 
agreed upon by private law firms and the state Insurance Department, which 
filed the suit, and the officers, directors and outside auditors of the 
insurance concern, which were its target. The settlement was presented to Los 
Angeles County Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski, who scheduled a hearing on 
technical matters for today and could approve the deal then.The class-action 
suit filed in February, 1992, alleged that Executive Life Insurance Co. falsely 
advertised and promoted life insurance products and then speculated with the 
premiums. The settlement is the latest in the Executive Life case. 
Policyholders have already received nearly $60 million from a separate 
settlement of litigation by now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert and about $60 
million as part of financier Michael Milken's personal settlement of lawsuits. 
The Insurance Department estimates that 92% of all Executive Life policyholders 
have already gotten back 100 cents on the dollar, mostly through state guaranty 
funds.

 Coke Out for Bear Over Rival Ads: The Goliath of soft drink makers took on 
David when it sued a 112-year-old family-owned soft drink business over the 
latter's use of television ads featuring polar bears. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola 
is seeking a preliminary injunction against Worcester, Mass.-based Polar Corp. 
in U.S. District Court in Boston. Coca-Cola claims the TV spots disparage its 
products. A recent ad by Polar, which said it has used a polar bear as its 
mascot for most of its history, shows an animated bear tossing a can of Coke 
into a recycling bin marked "Keep the Arctic Pure." The bear then drinks a can 
of Polar's seltzer water. Coke has also used polar bears in its TV advertising.

 Mortgage Rates Mixed: Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were 
unchanged at 9.18% this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
said.Fifteen-year rates averaged 8.81%, up slightly from 8.79% last week, while 
adjustable rates fell to 6.75% from 6.79%. A year ago, the 30-year rate was 
7.13%, the 15-year rate was 6.63%, and adjustables were 4.20%. "If economic 
growth continues at a robust pace, the Federal Reserve Board will undoubtedly 
raise short-term rates, which will raise adjustable mortgage rates," said Frank 
Nothaft, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac.

STANFORD GRAD ORTIZ: VETERAN OF FINANCIAL CRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In naming Guillermo Ortiz to be Mexico's finance minister, President Ernesto 
Zedillo appointed a friend, former colleague and, like himself, a U.S.-trained 
economist. But most important, given Mexico's perilous economic state, he 
brought on a respected international player. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, a native of Mexico City and son of an Army general, earned a doctorate 
in economics from Stanford University in 1977. For the next seven years, he was 
an economist at Mexico's central bank, where he met Zedillo and gained 
experience in crisis management, helping the Miguel de la Madrid administration 
with the delicate process of rescheduling Mexico's foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1984 to 1988, Ortiz represented Mexico at the International Monetary Fund 
in Washington. By the time he left the IMF, he was executive director and had 
built a global reputation -- while gathering the inside knowledge of the world 
financial community Zedillo is now counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the IMF, Ortiz became the No. 2 man at the Mexican Finance 
Ministry under Pedro Aspe, another respected international player who was the 
architect of Mexico's return to fiscal respectability during the Salinas de 
Gortari administration. 
</P>
<P>
 As a banking specialist, Ortiz oversaw the privatization of Mexico's 18 
commercial banks under Salinas and helped draft the banking chapter of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. In the course of his career, he has 
written two books and published numerous articles on international economic 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissal of Jaime Serra Puche as finance minister had been expected this 
week amid mounting criticism of his handling of the peso devaluation. The seeds 
of that crisis were sown long before Serra Puche and Zedillo took office Dec. 
1, however. Mexico's worsening trade imbalance and continued political unrest 
in Chiapas state, which unsettled foreign confidence, were factors beyond their 
control.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: BEST, WORST OF 1994'S NEW PRODUCTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A product that stops runs in pantyhose is among the best new products of the 
year, while chocolate-flavored salsa is among the biggest duds, according to a 
study by AcuPoll, a product idea screening company. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual survey, which looks at more than 500 products, is designed to 
highlight the best and worst new products of the year based on initial interest 
by those surveyed, not by performance or sales potential. 
</P>
<P>
 AcuPoll said most of the products given a thumbs-up by consumers provided 
convenience, like DowBrands' Baker's Mate non-stick oven ware line, which 
quickens cleanup. Consumers liked others because marketers took an existing 
successful product and improved it, like M&M Mars' Milky Way Light candy bar, 
which has half the fat of the regular Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having your candy and eating it too," said Steve Phelen, AcuPoll 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Products that consumers eschewed were unappealing, AcuPoll said, or were 
simply trying to fill a need that didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the freeze-dried vegetable crisps made by Burns & Rickers. Each bag 
contains a mixture of vegetables, including sweet potatoes, carrots, string 
beans, squash, blue potatoes, zucchini and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blech! It looks like Birds Eye has nothing to fear from this category," 
AcuPoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 AcuPoll said the annual survey is about 85% successful in predicting market 
success for new products. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean good news for products on its list of best new offerings. 
Among them: Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.'s Active Strips bandages; Dap 
Inc.'s Patch Stick, a pocket-sized tube of nail-hole and crack filler; Playtex 
Products Inc.'s Dura Mitt scouring glove; Kraft General Foods' Shake & Bake 
Perfect Potatoes, a mix of spices for potatoes, and Breyer's Viennetta ice 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included among the best new products are Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s 
dishwashing liquid with antibacterial hand soap; Dexus Laboratories' Pantyhose 
Savers, a small tube that stops runs in pantyhose, and CPC International Inc.'s 
Hellmann's potato salad dressing.

STATE FARM DENIED HOMEOWNERS RATE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has denied a request by State Farm 
Insurance Cos. for a rate increase on its homeowners and manufactured-home 
policies in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came just 15 days after State Farm raised its estimate of 
losses from January's Northridge earthquake by 26%, to $2.53 billion. The 
insurer expects that to be the final tally. 
</P>
<P>
 In refusing the rate increases, the state said the hikes would have resulted 
in "excess profits" for the company, which it noted was decreasing its 
homeowners insurance exposure in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's decision also rejected an administrative law judge's proposed 
approval of State Farm rate increases of 5.7% for homeowners insurance and 
17.3% for manufactured-home coverage, the commissioner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm -- the largest U.S. home and 
auto insurer -- said they were not surprised by the decision, but they charged 
that it may have been politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be another political decision for (Garamendi) to decide we 
don't warrant an increase in our homeowners rates by ignoring the findings of 
his own administrative law judge," said Bill Sirola, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirola also disputed the commissioner's claim that State Farm is decreasing 
its exposure in California. He said State Farm's homeowners policies in the 
state are up 11% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 California accounts for 12% of State Farm's homeowners insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer is looking at ways it can appeal the decision, Sirola said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm had requested an 8.3% increase in homeowners insurance rates in 
California and a 17.3% increase in manufactured-home rates.

 Dietary Supplement Makers Want Change: Some makers of dietary supplements want 
Congress to retool a hard-won compromise over how to regulate their industry. 
The makers insist they're not resurrecting the bitter issue merely because they 
expect the new Republican Congress to back less-strict regulations. Instead, 
they contend that the compromise -- lauded as historic just two months ago -- 
gives the Food and Drug Administration too much authority over vitamins, herbs 
and other supplements.

 Infomercial Company Settles Charges: National Media Corp., the world's largest 
infomercial company, will pay $175,000 to settle Federal Trade Commission 
charges involving a scheme to charge consumer credit cards for services and 
products that were marketed on a free trial basis. Philadelphia-based National 
Media is among 14 firms and individuals who agreed to pay a total of $292,000 
in a settlement agreement with FTC.The companies, all based in Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey, were charged in an FTC complaint with providing consumer credit 
card information to outside telemarketing firms, which used the lists to sell 
various products, including discount shopping and travel clubs. Although 
consumers contacted by the telemarketers were offered a free trial membership, 
the sales companies often proceeded without warning or authorization to charge 
the full price on consumer credit card numbers provided by National Media and 
affiliated firms, according to the FTC charges. The settlement is the latest in 
a series of legal problems to confront troubled National Media.

 Media: Loews Corp. is seeking government clearance to own as much as 25% of 
CBS Inc. stock. Loews, which is controlled by CBS Chairman Laurence Tisch and 
his family, already holds 18% of the television network's shares.In documents 
filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Loews indicated 
that its previous clearance to add to its CBS holdings expired in 1990. It is 
now seeking clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under antitrust 
regulations to own between 15% and 25% of CBS stock. In August, Loews reduced 
its CBS holdings to about 18% from 19.4% when it sold shares back to CBS for 
the equivalent of $65 each. Loews said in the documents that it will not buy 
any CBS stock below $65 a share before Feb. 21. CBS stock closed at $54.75 a 
share Thursday, up $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. New York-based Loews 
also has insurance, tobacco and other interests.

THE BIZ / JAMES BATES AND CHUCK PHILIPS: COMPANY TOWN; A YEAR THAT LEFT 'EM 
SPINNING; '94 MUSIC INDUSTRY SHAKE-UPS COULD LEAD TO MAJOR CHANGES 
</P>

 Among the rules established in 1994 in the music industry: The Eagles can 
still sell a lot of records and concert seats, monks with good voices can break 
into the Top 10, and it's important to differentiate whether rap refers to rap 
music or a rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, 1994 in music was the year of executive suite turmoil, played out 
publicly for weeks. Although things have calmed down at Time Warner's music 
group for now, there remain some hot spots to watch in 1995. Here are some of 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Where will Mo go? The biggest executive departure in the music business in 
1994 -- and potentially the biggest executive recruit in 1995 -- is industry 
legend Mo Ostin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin's official departure last week as head of Warner Bros. Records after an 
executive suite corporate battle was reminiscent of the classic "Mister 
Roberts" scene in which Henry Fonda leaves his ship. Tears flowed as hundreds 
of employees lined the halls and streets to watch Ostin, 67, take his last 
stroll out of the Burbank headquarters of what has long been considered the 
most successful and stable label in the rock era. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who run the $11-billion industry are still reeling from the bitter 
boardroom brawls last fall that drove Ostin out the door and nearly brought his 
label's parent company, Warner Music Group, to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The betting is that Ostin will end up with David Geffen, who is forming a 
label as part of the new entertainment conglomerate he's creating with director 
Steven Spielberg and former Walt Disney Studios chief Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Hiring Ostin would be a coup for Geffen's label. 
</P>
<P>
 Should that happen, expect Ostin to be joined by longtime partner Lenny 
Waronker, along with a number of hot rising executives and artists. Insiders 
believe Geffen's new company will immediately change the dynamics of every 
bidding war for talent on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geffen is going to make such a huge noise when his new company opens for 
business," said one record chief. "There isn't a competitor in this business 
who isn't anxious about it, especially with Mo and Lenny probably going over 
there. I mean, if I was a manager, I'd bring my band to those guys in a second. 
That company is going to be a mother." 
</P>
<P>
 * More Warner stuff. The major complaint about Ostin was that he refused to 
play ball with the corporation and resisted streamlining his bloated label, 
which his critics called a graveyard for over-the-hill rock stars and deadwood 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ostin's successor at Warner Bros. Records, Danny Goldberg, has assured 
anxious employees and talent managers that he has no plans to make slashes in 
the artists or staff when he takes over next week. In the aftermath, insiders 
find it ironic that Ostin and longtime sidekick Waronker may be the only 
veteran executives to have been purged from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Most insiders are confident that Doug Morris, who was recently granted 
autonomy over Time Warner's domestic music division, has the creative vision to 
restore order and confidence not only at Warner Bros. but throughout the 
conglomerate. Morris is starting to stabilize things at Elektra, where he 
installed longtime lieutenant Sylvia Rhone and industry veteran Seymour Stein 
to run things, and he moved quickly to resolve an embarrassing 
breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by superstar band Metallica. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rap on Interscope. One task ahead for Warner is to finalize its purchase 
of Interscope Records, the successful label founded by Ted Field and Jimmy 
Iovine and part-owned by Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Field and Iovine, with buyout offers from other companies on the 
table, are still waiting for Time Warner's board to approve a bid that would 
allow them to stay at Warner. The price forWarner to acquire the remaining 75% 
of Interscope is said to be a hefty $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Interscope has an enviable record of signing and breaking cutting-edge artists 
such as Trent Reznor, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Interscope has also bested 
other start-up labels -- such as American, Giant and Hollywood Records -- and 
is now considered a primary competitor in the signing wars among established 
labels such as Geffen and Epic. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the label's most talented stars, however, are facing legal 
problems as they enter the new year. Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Amaru 
Shakur have all been charged with violent crimes. Time Warner's board is known 
for having shied away from controversy in the past, but insiders predict its 
members will approve the purchase primarily because they can't afford to lose 
the enormous profits or creative respect Interscope brings the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sumner time? Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone has made noises about entering 
the music business. Viacom spent $10 billion earlier this year to acquire 
Paramount Communications, but Paramount does not have a music operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is that Ron Perelman, whose New World is expanding its 
presence in Hollywood, will enter the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies not versed in music haven't had much luck when it comes to starting 
up labels in recent years, however. Just look at Walt Disney's Hollywood 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMI trouble ahead? Despite reporting decent profit, the British-owned 
company that had a big hit with chants by Benedictine monks may need a prayer 
or two in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of older records from the Capitol Records catalogue are selling, but 
where are the new acts that talent whiz Gary Gersh (handpicked by Charles 
Koppelman, EMI Records Group North America chairman) was supposed to deliver? 
The label clearly needs to develop younger acts for the day when it pairs them 
up with Frank Sinatra for "Duets V." 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin's Ken Berry is the biggest star at EMI these days, but the glow 
diminished when his wife, Executive Vice President Nancy Berry, reportedly 
began impinging on the turf of Virgin President Phil Quartararo. Quartararo 
tried to get out of his contract when Warner Bros. beckoned, but EMI President 
James Fifield wouldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI dumped President Daniel Glass after a lackluster year, replacing him with 
Davitt Sigerson. Word is that Fifield is also keeping a closer watch on 
Koppelman these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * BMG. New North American chief Strauss Zelnick may need to take out a 
help-wanted ad to find someone to run laggard RCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Music agent Tom Ross, like the batch of executives before him, is said to have 
turned down the job. RCA's country music chief, Joe Galante, abandoned the 
position to return to Nashville. Word is that BMG Canada's Bob Jamison may fill 
the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 On the brighter side, BMG's Arista, under Clive Davis' leadership, continues 
to outperform labels twice its size. 
</P>
<P>
 * PolyGram. Its Mercury label is a mess. But Island, run by Chris Blackwell, 
and its A&M Records label, run by Al Cafaro, are both strong. 
</P>
<P>
 * MCA. MCA under Al Teller remains hot in country and rhythm and blues, and 
the respected Eddie Rosenblatt at MCA's Geffen Records will remain after 
namesake David Geffen leaves after his contract expires next spring. After 
former Elektra boss Bob Krasnow was forced out, Teller moved quickly to pick 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sony Music. This is the one thing Sony Corp. did right in entertainment. The 
company's movie operation has lost a bundle, but Sony Music under Thomas D. 
Mottola continues to make money with stars such as his Epic label's Pearl Jam 
and Columbia's Mariah Carey. Columbia also launched a West Coast label, with 
industry vets Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, that could draw in new talent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Final thoughts. Said one industry insider of what to expect in 1995: "It 
isn't like we're entering a new year here; it's more like we're moving into a 
brand-new phase. New music. New technology. New faces in the executive suites. 
It's going to be interesting to see who survives."

CENTURY 21'S FALSE-ADVERTISING CLAIMS DISMISSED; COURTS: REAL ESTATE GIANT HAD 
COMPLAINED THAT SEVERAL OF RIVAL REMAX'S FRANCHISES DECEPTIVELY TOUTED BETTER 
SALES AND SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has dismissed real estate giant Century 21 International's 
allegations that several of competitor ReMax International Inc.'s local 
franchises made false advertising claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Century 21, based in Irvine, sued three ReMax franchises, including ReMax 
South County in Newport Beach, in early 1993 over an advertising campaign in 
which the offices maintained they were leaders in their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler on Dec. 20 dismissed most of 
Century 21's complaints, saying they had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
 A Century 21 spokeswoman said Thursday that the company plans to appeal the 
ruling. She said the judge did not address Century 21's broader allegation that 
ReMax engages in false advertising when asserting that it has more sales and 
better customer service than other residential real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, ReMax, based in Denver, is suing Century 21 as part of the same 
case, alleging that it used inaccurate surveys to bolster its own claims of 
being No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial on that portion of the case is to begin in April in U.S. District Court 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Major real estate chains such as Century 21 and ReMax are zealously protective 
of their performance claims because they see them as their main marketing tool 
in a residential market that has leveled off to about 3.8 million transactions 
a year.  
</P>
<P>
 With the aging of the baby-boom generation, which fueled that growth, the 
market is expected to begin shrinking shortly after the end of the decade -- a 
situation that has residential real estate brokers scrambling to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 ReMax Chairman David Liniger said that Judge Stotler's Dec. 20 ruling, made 
public Thursday by ReMax, applies to Century 21's challenges to a number of 
ReMax TV commercials, an ad in an industry journal, statements about ReMax 
sales leadership printed in company newsletters and statements made by Liniger 
at his company's annual convention in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 One of four ReMax TV spots challenged in the Century 21 lawsuit was not 
included in Stotler's summary judgment in favor of ReMax. Liniger said the 
company is filing a separate motion for dismissal.

WASTE FIRM TO PAY $325,000 TO SETTLE CONTRACT CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Security Environmental Systems Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to pay 
$325,000 to settle various allegations of breach of contract and securities law 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the waste-management company, based in Huntington Beach, said it still has 
some "significant" litigation issues to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it is now finalizing a tentative settlement with the 
California Department of Health Services involving state allegations that 
Security Environmental ran its Bakersfield operations without a proper permit. 
The state asked for damages and fines in excess of $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlements announced Thursday, Security Environmental Systems said it 
would pay $325,000 to the various parties, $260,000 of it in installments 
beginning in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The money settles separate actions involving an alleged breach of contract to 
pay substantial commissions in 1992 and 1993 to third parties for waste 
contracts, an alleged breach of written contract to pay money in 1990 to an 
environmental consultant, and alleged violations of securities laws and 
breaches of contract involving a three-year warrant allegedly issued by the 
company in December, 1990.

TRAVELERS SCRAMBLE TO TRADE DOLLARS FOR DEVALUED PESO; CURRENCY: O.C.

 The full effect of Mexico's decision last week to let the value of the peso 
float against the dollar is yet to be seen, but one result was immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency traders in Orange County said Thursday that they have been swamped 
with requests for the Mexican currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers bound for Mexico are buying up every peso on hand at Thomas Cook 
Currency Services' three local offices, manager Tom Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't usually sell out," he said, "but this year it was people taking 
advantage of the devaluation before they go."

<P>
 Though some companies that have extensive business dealings in Mexico fear 
that the falling peso might reduce demand for U.S. exports in the short term, 
even they are generally optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, it will be good news for all of us," said Robert Wallace, 
managing director of Export Specialists Inc. The company, based in Irvine, 
arranges trades for U.S. manufacturers in Mexico and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The short-term effect is that it will stunt exports," Wallace said. "But it 
really was a correction to where the peso should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, it will increase demand in Mexico and increase the 
opportunity to make investments there." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the local boom in dollars-for-pesos trading, travel agents said they 
had not yet seen a boost in their own business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This part of the year is the absolute bottom for new sales," said Donald 
Carlson, president of Courtyard Travel Inc. in Tustin. "Mexico is our most 
popular destination, but our sales are still way down right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said he expects brisker sales in the first weeks of January, however, 
as the news sinks in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican currency has lost about a third of its value since Dec. 19, the 
day before the government said it would no longer buy pesos priced below the 
official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The devalued peso is likely to help Mexican manufacturers and foreign 
consumers as the country's goods become cheaper abroad. In contrast, Mexican 
consumers and foreign investors will be hurt as domestic purchasing power 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors probably will get over their shock relatively quickly, however, said 
Edmund Bretz, a vice president for international banking at Bank of America's 
Anaheim office. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the goods shipped from Orange County to Mexico are precision 
manufacturing and medical products, which will still be in demand despite the 
higher prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are critical items for their economy, so it's not just consumer items 
people can do without," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Magdaleno, a consultant based in Yorba Linda, said at least one deal he 
had arranged for a Corona-based toy manufacturer has been postponed. The buyer, 
a Mexican distributor, asked for more time before offering a price. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer "just wanted to see how the market is going to adjust," Magdaleno 
said. "I didn't think he was wrong" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno noted that the value of U.S. currency sent home by Mexican workers 
in the United States has suddenly risen, which will stimulate demand for 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those 'I'll get rich for a while, then you get rich for a while' 
kind of deals," he said.

 Residential Development: One forecast for next year is already out. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Leventhal & Co.'s Orange County real estate economist says that 1995, 
despite county government's fiscal crisis, will be a good one for residential 
real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 In his annual forecast, economist Walter Hahn said Orange County "is the only 
place in Southern California that has seen any significant increase in home 
sales and construction" in 1994. The outlook for 1995 "is much brighter," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the end of November, new-homes sales in the county totaled 7,955, up 
30% from the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn is projecting that permits for 14,000 residential units will be issued in 
the county in 1995, with pent-up demand for housing pushing the annual total to 
18,000 in 1996.

 Headquarters Move: Avco Financial Services Inc. is moving its headquarters 
from Irvine to Costa Mesa in what real estate specialists say is one of the 
biggest commercial office deals of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The international consumer finance and insurance company is vacating its 
209,000-square-foot quarters at Park Place -- the old Fluor Corp. complex -- 
and has signed a 10-year lease to occupy 103,000 square feet of space on five 
floors of the 21-story Plaza Tower building near South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the parties to the lease would disclose its value, but industry 
watchers say it is likely to total about $18 million. Avco reportedly is 
negotiating with another landlord for 86,000 square feet of space.

EDUCATORS WELCOME PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN BUT FEAR GOP CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College and university officials, who fiercely compete for the brightest 
students and financial support, are cautiously optimistic of President 
Clinton's tax proposals on financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But they cast a wary eye toward amendments to the Republicans' "contract with 
America," which they fear would cut financial aid and put a higher education 
out of reach for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are strongly in favor of the President's call for a tuition tax credit," 
said James Rowe, director of public relations at Harvard University. "We hope 
that that will not affect in any way all the other financial aid programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, as part of his "Middle-Class Bill of Rights," has proposed tax 
deductions of up to $10,000 on tuition expenses for families earning $100,000 
or less. For a family in the 28% tax bracket, those deductions could save them 
as much as $2,800 a year, tax officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, which 
represents about 1,900 independent and publicly funded schools, said Clinton's 
proposal "deserves strong consideration" but needs reviewing to see how it 
would aid low-income as well as middle-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is especially welcome in light of other proposals now being considered 
that would reduce federal support for college students and erect greater 
barriers to access and affordability," Atwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee in the next Congress, Rep. 
John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed cutting back financial aid to save $9.6 
billion over a five-year period to help pay for the "contract with America." 
School officials said the proposal would end the interest-free grace period for 
student loans from six months after graduation and add more than 20% to the 
cost of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a major incentive to allow middle- and low-middle income families 
to send their sons and daughters to college," said David Warren, president of 
the National Assn. of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), which 
represents 850 institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to oppose it strenuously," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalating tuition rates are putting strains on pocketbooks, but statistics 
show education pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition at four-year independent colleges and universities has risen about 6% 
a year for the past four years to average $9,995, according to NAICU. The 
tuition rate at publicly funded schools, which receive a taxpayer subsidy of 
$6,000 per student on average, is $2,576, the NAICU said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said earlier this year that the unemployment 
rate among college-educated Americans stood at 3% last year compared to 12% 
among those without a high school diploma. The wage gap between the two groups 
also grew last year, continuing a 20-year trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising expenses have forced schools to walk a balancing act between cutting 
back nonessential costs and raising rates, all the while appealing for 
financial benefits and keeping education affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of schools out there biting the bullet," NAICU spokesman Tim 
McDonough said. "Some of the schools are closing. You'll find that more schools 
are restructuring than closing." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard University announced in May a $2.1-billion fund-raising campaign over 
the next five years, the most ambitious ever attempted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard President Neil Rudenstine drove himself to exhaustion and was forced 
to take a leave of absence in November, partly due to the fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools have taken innovative steps to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Fisher College in Rochester, N.Y., has adopted the "Fisher 
Commitment." Students who complete a four-year degree and a number of 
conditions -- including a minimum 2.75 grade-point average -- are guaranteed a 
suitable job when they graduate or St. John Fisher will pay them $417 a month 
for up to 12 months or $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper Union for the Advancement of Arts and Science in New York is one of 
only a handful of "work colleges," where students work in exchange for free 
tuition.

UNISYS TO CUT 4,000 JOBS WORLDWIDE NEXT YEAR AS PART OF RESTRUCTURING; LAYOFFS: 
THE COMPANY, WHICH IS SHIFTING ITS EMPHASIS FROM HARDWARE TO SERVICES, HAS 
THREE FACILITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT MAY BE AFFECTED.

<P>
 Unisys Corp. said Thursday that it will cut 4,000 jobs from its worldwide 
payroll in 1995 as it continues to shift its focus from hardware to services. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer and information services company has three facilities in Orange 
County with a total of about 2,000 employees.Worldwide, the company employs 
about 46,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Unisys headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., could not be reached for 
comment on where the cuts are likely to be made. Officials at the company's 
200-employee western regional sales and service office in Santa Ana could give 
no details. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's manufacturing facility in Rancho Santa Margarita and engineering 
office in Mission Viejo were closed for the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 If the work force reductions include the Orange County operations, they are 
likely to be at the manufacturing or engineering facilities. In its 
announcement, Unisys said that all of the cuts will be in the hardware 
manufacturing and development side of its business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Unisys said, it plans to add more than 2,000 jobs in its 
services area through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will give details of the restructuring late next month, 
when it releases its financial results for 1994. As part of the staff 
reduction, the company said, it plans to take a one-time charge of $175 million 
to $225 million for the current quarter to cover severance and other 
layoff-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs will be spread across Unisys' U.S. and overseas operations, a 
spokesman said. Employees will be given 30 to 60 days' notice in the United 
States and more time overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring is expected to yield annual savings of at least $200 million 
by the end of 1995, Unisys said.

CRUISE LINES EXPAND FLEETS FOR VACATION TREASURE; TRANSPORTATION: EIGHTEEN NEW 
SHIPS ARE SET FOR DELIVERY BY LATE 1997, INCLUDING THE TWO BIGGEST LINERS EVER 
MADE. PASSENGER COUNTS ARE PROJECTED TO HIT 8 MILLION IN THE YEAR 2000, NEARLY 
DOUBLE THE '93 TALLY.

</P>
<P>
 Adjustments are made with hours to spare before the maiden cruise of Holland 
America's Ryndam, heralding a three-year building boom for the cruise industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Four cruise lines have $1-billion worth of ship orders each, influenced by 
industry projections that passenger counts will rise from 4.1 million in 1993 
to 8 million in the year 2000. Eighteen new ships are set for delivery by late 
1997, including the two biggest liners ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have more ships than the Spanish Armada, or at least more beds," joked 
Rich Steck, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. "We already know where 
the gold is out there in passenger land." 
</P>
<P>
 More than just industry growth is feeding the building frenzy, a business 
dominated by shipyards in Finland, Italy, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit potential on more efficient ships, the availability of financing, 
favorable currency exchange rates and new safety rules mandating major 
renovations on older ships are playing a role in the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any end in sight," said Tim Gallagher, a spokesman for 
Carnival Corp. The company's 2,060-passenger Fascination began sailing in July, 
and Carnival has three more ships on order. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland America, meanwhile, has orders for two more ships, while Princess and 
Royal Caribbean each have four ships on order, and Celebrity has three. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival and Princess have generated the most intrigue by promising 
100,000-ton liners, the biggest ever built and vastly outdistancing the largest 
now at sea, Kloster Cruise Ltd.'s 76,049-ton Norway. The passenger capacity 
will be 2,600 on the ships, which are due for delivery in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival is paying $400 million for its mega-liner. Princess, which is buying 
the other ship, isn't saying what it cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're pretty much pushing the outer limits," conceded Carnival 
chairman Micky Arison. "It gets tougher and tougher to take advantage of that 
additional size." 
</P>
<P>
 The sleek, white Princess ship will feature three dining rooms instead of the 
standard two and a suspended nightclub reached at the stern through a moving 
walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a specific passenger profile," said line spokeswoman Julie 
Benson. "It attracts a lot of first-time passengers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new ships are destined for Caribbean service, the world's biggest 
cruise market, a year-round option and the preference of first-time cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The untapped potential in the Caribbean, where we're putting more tonnage 
over the next several years, we think is vast," Benson said. "Companies are 
going to need new, innovative, spectacular ships to attract those people and to 
keep them coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 However, few cruise operators have the ability to buy the big ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only ones that really have the money to do it are Royal Caribbean, 
Carnival, Princess and Cunard," said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. cruise industry 
analyst Paul Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing a growing oligopoly emerge in the industry where those cruise 
lines that are consistently adding to capacity are getting the benefits of 
economies of scale and are outpacing their weaker rivals," said Smith Barney 
Inc.'s Jill Krutick. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. shipyards are getting only a small share of the building boom -- 
although North America provides most of the cruise industry's passengers, the 
big liners are being built in Europe. That trend is unlikely to change any time 
soon because of the cruise lines' past experience with the U.S. yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure to seek at least one U.S. bid, Carnival asked a Virginia yard 
for a proposal on its Sensation, which sailed last year. The proposal arrived 
10 months after Carnival placed its order in Finland, and with a price tag 75% 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, U.S. shipyards, accustomed to raising their prices in Pentagon 
contracts, have a harder time than their European competitors when it comes to 
building ships under budget and on time. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, U.S. yards tend to get contracts for components, services and spare 
parts.

 Sport utilities -- those high-riding, high-fashion image makers aimed at 
reliving the military experience or your farming childhood -- will leave even 
heavier tire tracks on 1995 vehicle trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether honest off-roaders or two-wheel-drive poseurs that just look as if 
they could travel Jurassic Park, one out of every five vehicles sold in the 
United States next year will be a sport ute. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovering economy and healthier overall vehicle sales explains part of the 
pickup. Other reasons, say the experts, involve a general trend to tougher, 
less expensive transportation and full pursuit of chic. Plus a sharp decline in 
sales of sports cars as ubiquitous Baby Boomers dump their two-seaters for 
roomier, more outdoorsy sport utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet's Blazer and Jeep's Grand Cherokee are already in the Top 10 of all 
vehicle sales. Ford peddles twice as many Explorers as it does Mustangs. Land 
Rover sales are soaring, thank you veddy much. And next year -- sniffing a 
change in buyer profiles from Indiana Jones to Gordon Gotrocks -- luxury car 
makers will become heavily involved with recreational motoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes-Benz has announced that it will build a $30,000 sport utility at its 
new plant at Tuscaloosa, Ala. Infiniti, the leather-and-walnut division of 
Nissan, is planning a longer, softer, fancier version of its parent company's 
Pathfinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Acura, upmarket arm of Honda, is examining the possibility of re-equipping, 
re-badging and reissuing Isuzu's Trooper for U.S. service. And with Cadillac, 
Lincoln and Jaguar acknowledging interests in producing sport utilities, can a 
Rolls-Royce Rutland be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 We have known for years that ordinary coupes, sedans and sports cars are 
clogging every available mile of freeway and surface streets. Could it be that 
more and more off-road vehicles will eventually mean overcrowded country dirt?

 Pre-hip is in. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop culture prognosticators say hip is dead because it has gone mainstream -- 
and therefore can't be hip.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a mistake to declare the death of hip and say that nothing new is 
happening in America," says Marian Salzman, director of emerging media for 
Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is dead is the posture of hip. The idea that something is truly 
avant-garde. What is cool today is to recognize the connection between what's 
going on right now and what went on in the past. Nostalgia is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 That means the return of glamour, satin, martinis and tiki bars, says Van 
Buren designer Maggie Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also the irony of us getting into -- I don't want to say trailer-type 
things -- but mashed potatoes and weird funny things like Spam," Barry says. 
"People are discovering great things that are fattening." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as sensibility looks backward, technology pushes forward, and 
status-minded youth are blowing off fancy cars and designer clothes for 
cutting-edge electronics, Salzman says. "For those at the top of the heap, each 
month brings new must-have add-ons and upgrades."

 If I really knew the future of home computers for the coming year, do you 
think I'd still be working at a salaried position? 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing anyone can say for certain in the home computer field -- where 
the future seems to change about every two weeks -- is that there will be more 
of it. This year, an estimated 6.9 million computers will be sold for home use 
in the United States, making them second only to color TVs in consumer 
electronic sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the boom, entrepreneurs and other speculators will continue to 
throw millions of dollars into software, CD-ROMs and on-line services 
development in hopes of jumping on the bandwagon of the next "Carmen Sandiego," 
Flying Toaster screensaver or Mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the areas most primed for growth is on-line services, which have become 
all the more important now that many home computers come equipped with 
telephone modems. If you have students in the household, they might well want 
to do research on such services as America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy, all 
of which have encyclopedias and numerous special interest information groups 
on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 The ubiquitous Microsoft will debut its own on-line service in 1995, and 
because this 1,000-pound gorilla of the home computer world never does anything 
quietly, its entrance into the field could cause a shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for continuing efforts next year to tame the wild and woolly Internet to 
make it more friendly for home use. With the arrival last year of Mosaic, and 
its even more advanced offspring -- Netscape -- average citizens who don't want 
to sacrifice their leisure time to learn obscure computer languages have been 
exploring the Net. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROMs, which were still fairly rare at the beginning of '94, may soon make 
software disks the long-playing records of the home computer field. If your 
current home computer does not have a CD-ROM player, your next one likely will 
-- especially if you have children who want to explore the many art, music, 
science and history CD-ROMs due for '95 release. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly compatible Mac/Windows computers, slated to come out next year, will be 
a welcome addition to the home market -- especially for people who now use one 
format in the office and another at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, this is not a prediction but a request for the new year: Let's all 
join hands, digitally, and pledge that in 1995 we will no long make "clever" 
wordplay on the term "information superhighway."

AROUND TOWN: A MATCH MADE IN THE HEAVENS

 As Rotary International's float rolls along the Rose Parade route Monday, a 
Martian and an astronaut will be playing Frisbee with a Martian dog and an 
Earth dog. And an arrow will be pointing toward space and the Paulharris 
asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
 Our story begins on Sept. 8, 1988, when planetary scientist Eleanor Helin, 
peering through a telescope at Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego, 
discovered a potato-shaped asteroid about 10 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Protocol -- and sound science -- dictate that a newly identified asteroid be 
observed three times in its orbit around the sun and then, Helin said, "It's up 
to the discoverer to give it a name." 
</P>
<P>
 Having been duly "recovered," or verified, by astronomers worldwide, this 
asteroid was, in time, entered in the international log published in Russia as 
No. 5349, there having been 5,348 others entered since the first recorded 
asteroid sighting in Sicily 187 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one recent day, Helin, who heads the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid 
Survey and International Near-earth Asteroid Survey at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, happened to sit next to former Caltech alumni 
association president Theodore Combs at a banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs, a Rotarian, was thinking about the globe-spanning theme for this year's 
float, "Building Universal Friendship," and about how Rotary has raised $240 
million-plus with a goal of eradicating polio worldwide by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would it be appropriate," he asked Helin, "to name an asteroid for the 
founder of Rotary International?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was serendipity. Said Helin: "He did not know that I had had polio." 
</P>
<P>
 As a 5-year-old growing up in Pasadena, she contracted the disease and was 
bedridden for a year. "It was a struggle," she said, and her father was 
tireless in helping her overcome the paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 He happened also to have been a Rotarian. All in all, Helin said, "I felt this 
is most fitting." 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, Helin has devoted her life to sighting and tracking asteroids, 
which are minor planets, fragmented rocky bodies left over from the creation of 
the solar system. Unlike comets, which are sort of rocky snowballs, asteroids 
are iceless. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are so-called main-belt asteroids, moving in nearly circular orbits 
between those of Mars and Jupiter. But there are also asteroids whose orbits 
bring them close to Earth. It is these -- about 340 are known -- that most 
intrigue Helin. She describes Paulharris as an inner-belt asteroid, one of 
those thought of as "precursors to the near-Earth asteroids." With a little 
bump from another body, they could be flung into near-Earth space. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulharris "kisses the orbit of Mars, which is significant." It would 
"certainly be a flyby," and maybe a stop, for travelers to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, Helin and her team have discovered 90 near-Earth asteroids, about 
30% to 35% of all identified over that time. She has been credited with more 
discoveries than any scientist in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The discoverer may name an asteroid for a friend, a scientist, a place. 
</P>
<P>
 Helin named one Druyan (for astronomer Carl Sagan's wife, Ann). Sagan already 
had his. Now, Helin explains, they can be "in eternal space together." She 
named one Pauling (for the late chemist Linus). She plans to name one 
Occidental, for her alma mater, Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 An asteroid she discovered in September, 1978, just after the Camp David peace 
accord between Israel and Egypt, is called Ra-Shalom -- that's Ra, for the 
Egyptian sun god, and Shalom, the Hebrew word for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Other namers have gone commercial (which is frowned upon) or quirky. There's 
Swissair. And there's Roddenberry, for "Star Trek" creator Gene. Because the 
naming committee of the International Astronomical Union likes to keep things 
simple, it prefers single names -- thus, Paulharris. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Harris' was taken," Helin explained, "and 'Paul' is not distinctive 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing controversial about an extraterrestrial accolade for this 
Chicago attorney who founded Rotary in 1905. The names the committee has 
resisted have been those carrying political baggage. A ruler of an "unfriendly" 
nation, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Helin estimates that two-thirds of the 6,000 known asteroids are now named. At 
first, she said, they really went through the Greek and Roman mythology. "Now 
all of the important Greek gods and goddesses have been used. One may find a 
son of Apollo or a grandniece of Hermes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, a colleague named an asteroid for her. That's asteroid Glo, the 
nickname by which friends, family and fellow workers know Helin. 
</P>
<P>
 Each new discovery keeps her recharged. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that some of them have come very close to Earth, and there's always a 
chance of "finding an object really on a collision course" with us. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other scientists are also identifying asteroids that "might be good 
candidates for a (manned space) mission." In 1997-98, she mentioned, the 
Japanese are going to collect samples on Nereus, "one of my asteroids." 
</P>
<P>
 She is among the scientists who believe that it was a large asteroid, perhaps 
six miles in diameter, that did in the dinosaurs when it struck the Yucatan 
Peninsula 65 million years ago, plunging Earth into cold and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of thousands of objects" of significant size out there, 
said Helin, who's spent many long nights at telescopes from Mauna Kea to 
Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Should an asteroid the size of a football field hit a city (an unlikely 
scenario), "it would be disastrous," Helin said. The explosive impact would set 
off "massive shock waves," earthquakes and tidal waves, and obscure the sky for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Helin is not speculating on the odds of that but, she said, she would gamble 
that within the next 100 years an asteroid more than 100 feet in diameter will 
plunge to Earth somewhere with "stunning and alarming impact for people. It's 
something that would certainly get our attention." 
</P>
<P>
 What are earthlings to do? 
</P>
<P>
 There has been talk of intercepting a plummeting asteroid with a nuclear space 
probe and nudging it into a different orbit. But, Helin said, "It's years 
before we'll really be able to alter an orbit" effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Monday, parade-watchers will see that sign pointing to asteroid 
Paulharris some whimsical number of millions of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 And the real Paulharris? It has an orbital period around the sun of about 4.5 
years and will next be seen clearly over Southern California in August, 1997. 
</P>

 If, as has been said, Angelenos are what they drive, these recent 
license-plate sightings do give one pause: JACKRIPR and CHNSAW 1. Other 
favorites from our personalized-plates file: on a gold Lexus, GATS B. On a 
white Mercedes, A2 BRTUS. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, one perhaps to be avoided during rush hour: a white Mitsubishi 
identifying its driver as MS MAGOO.

LAUGH LINES; ENOUGH O.J. TO QUENCH ANY THIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plenty of comedy fodder from the O.J. Simpson trial: 
</P>
<P>
 * It was so hot in Los Angeles last week that O.J.'s lawyers were seen 
huddling around Marcia Clark just to get a cold stare. 
</P>
<P>
 * O.J. went to Cedars-Sinai for a minor procedure: Two hours of surgery to 
remove Robert Shapiro's hand from O.J.'s wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clark visited the doctor Monday. Apparently she got eye strain from rolling 
her eyes whenever Shapiro opened his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Major League Baseball resumes, Shapiro will throw out the first 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * There has been a DNA match. Skin and blood under Clark's fingernails match a 
sample from around Shapiro's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 * The technician who matched hair samples in the Simpson case has impeccable 
credentials: Four years at MIT, two with Interpol and three summers as personal 
assistant to Sy Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judge Lance Ito has denied the legal team's last eight motions. It's 
starting to dawn on O.J. that he had a better defense the year Buffalo went 
2-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * At an auction of items from the Chicago hotel room where O.J. stayed, the 
most unusual was an alibi. His lawyers tried desperately to buy it, but it went 
to a private collector in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state Air Resources Board has a tough new plan. It severely limits 
Shapiro's use of smoke screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * Law schools are using the case, but classroom role-playing is tough. 
Everyone wants to play the part of Shapiro's wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 * A cup of partially frozen ice cream may pinpoint the time of the slayings. 
The container also identifies a pair of new suspects: two white guys named Ben 
& Jerry.

</P>
<P>
 Seen on a working girl's desk: "Of course I don't look as busy as the men. I 
did it right the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard in a gay bar: You mean you were in the closet for 20 years and you 
came out wearing that?  
</P>
<P>
 Sign at a watering hole: "If the barmaid looks beautiful to you, don't drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hear about the new Barbie divorcee doll? She comes with all of Ken's stuff.

I thought there'd be more paperwork lying around.

 The Pope's new book is so full of chastity, the jacket won't even come off.

 With the '94 elections, Republicans haven't been this gleeful since the 
invention of the tax loophole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service may issue a new stamp honoring the marriage of Michael 
Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. It's a picture of Elvis getting his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait till they issue that new Richard Nixon postage stamp. It's bound to 
be the first one where half the people spit on the side without the glue. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ecumenical spirit, Jews and Catholics got together and wrote liturgy to

 Police investigated a shooting at a San Francisco karaoke bar. When asked if 
he was hurt, one patron responded: Feelings, nothing more than feelings . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That the Reagans' daughter, Patti Davis, appeared naked in a Playboy 
kick-boxing video should be a lesson for Lyle and Erik Menendez. There are

Washington D.C. has lawyers the way New York has rats. I guess New York got to

 Novice Farmer Jones buys 20 pigs at auction, only to learn that all are 
female. So he asks Farmer Brown if he can take his pigs to Brown's farm to mate 
with his male pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees, so Jones loads the pigs in his truck and takes them to Brown's. 
That evening, when Jones picks them up, he asks how he can tell if his pigs are 
pregnant. Brown says that if the pigs are grazing the following morning -- 
something pigs never do -- they are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Next morning, the pigs aren't grazing, so Smith takes them back to Brown's. 
When the pigs again fail to graze the next two days, he repeats the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, a discouraged Jones tells his wife: "Honey, I don't 
have the heart to go look. Please tell me what the pigs are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 She looks out the window and says: "Well, they're not grazing. But most of 
them are in the truck and one is honking the horn."

 A guy books a two-week cruise for him and his girlfriend. A couple days before 
the cruise, the travel agent calls and says the cruise has been canceled, but 
he can get them on a three-day cruise. The guy says OK and goes to the pharmacy 
to buy three Dramamine and three condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Next day, the agent calls back and says he can book a five-day cruise. The guy 
says he'll take it, returns to the same pharmacy and buys two more Dramamine 
and two more condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, the travel agent calls again and says he can book an 
eight-day cruise, so the guy goes back to the drug store and buys three more 
Dramamine and three more condoms.

wish, fellow," the genie admonishes. "I'm getting too old for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The man pauses, then announces: "I want to wake up in bed next to three 
celebrity women." 
</P>
<P>
 Poof! The guy is in bed with Lorena Bobbitt, Tonya Harding and Hillary 
Clinton.

 Next thing he knows, his penis is missing, his knee is throbbing and he's got 
no health-care coverage.

 Heaven has become very crowded, so St. Peter is admitting only people with 
particularly sad stories. Three men arrive at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The first man says that for some time he suspected his wife had been having an 
affair: "And when I came home last night to my 20th-floor apartment, I saw a 
guy hanging off my balcony. I got so mad I took a hammer and hit his fingers 
until he fell, but he landed on the balcony below. So I pushed our refrigerator 
through the window. It knocked him off, but I lost my balance and fell too." He 
is admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The next man says that he had been exercising on his 21st floor balcony when 
he slipped and fell: "Luckily, I grabbed the balcony below, but some idiot 
started hitting my fingers with a hammer until I fell again. I managed to land 
on the next balcony down, but then he dumped a refrigerator on me." He, too, is 
admitted to heaven.  
</P>
<P>
 The third man walks up to St. Peter and says: "Picture this. I'm naked in a 
refrigerator. . . ."

 The Capistrano Unified School District has gone on record against music and 
videotapes or computer games that depict or promote the killing of human 
beings, celebrate violence or desensitize children to the value of human life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an emerging body of evidence that indicates that there are links 
that exist between increased use by children of computerized games which 
simulate killing" and a lack of respect for human life, the district said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The additional negative influence of music and related videotapes that 
promote violence or celebrate killing adds to an unhealthy environment which 
may lead children to accept violence as a common fact of life in society."

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; A GRADUAL APPROACH TO LICENSING TEEN DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next to a gun permit, one of the easiest to get and potentially most dangerous 
documents in the United States is a driver license. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, states require applicants take a vision test, a simple written test 
and an around-the-block driving test most people pass on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
 But some safety groups are seeking to impose new licensing restrictions on 
teen-agers, the drivers with the highest risk of getting into fatal accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before teen-agers get full driving privileges, why not restrict some of their 
privileges," says Alan Williams, vice president for research at the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety. "Teen-agers have a higher rate of accident 
involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly licensed adolescent drivers have extraordinarily high accident rates 
compared to every other group. According to the Insurance Institute, 
16-year-olds average 43.2 crashes for every million miles they drive; 
17-year-olds have 30.3 crashes per million miles. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the rate drops to about five crashes per million miles for 
drivers between 30 and 60 years of age. Even for drivers 76 and older, the rate 
rises to just 10 crashes per million miles. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16-year-olds get their licenses, they are free to drive at night, in 
snow, with a carload of their friends and in some states with the same limits 
as adults on their blood alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety advocates want to restrict teen driving privileges through a system of 
graduated licensing, a plan supported by the National Transportation Safety 
Board, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Insurance Institute, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams suggests teen-age drivers be kept off the road during late hours, 
allowing them to get more experience in daylight before they are permitted to 
drive at night. Graduated licensing could also impose rules specifying 
near-zero alcohol levels for teen drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Limits on the number of passengers a teen-age driver could carry might also be 
imposed under this system, since the majority of teen passenger deaths occur in 
cars driven by other teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions would be lifted in stages as the new driver gains experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New Zealand, Canada and several European countries have introduced 
graduated licensing laws, no states have extensive restrictions on teen-agers. 
Under a federal contract, Alaska and North Carolina are devising a study 
program for such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, 21 states, including California, have lowered the 
allowable blood alcohol levels for younger drivers. (Younger teens cannot drink 
legally in the first place, but underage-drinking laws are enforced less 
strictly than drunk driving laws.) Nine states have night driving curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion for reform would be to require more driving experience 
before granting a license. Evidence shows drivers who get licenses after a 
short-duration learners permit have higher fatality rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Delaware has one of the shortest learners permit periods, granting licenses to 
teen-agers after they hold a permit just two months. Delaware also has the 
nation's highest per capita crash rates among 16-year-olds, more than 10 times 
higher than New Jersey, where teens hold learner's permits an average of 6.9 
months. Teen-agers would no doubt consider many of these proposals unfair. 
Millions of young people work after school or are responsible for helping 
others, so the idea isn't to stop them from driving. The thrust of the reform 
movement is to find better ways to educate new drivers so they gain some 
experience that may prevent fatalities.

THE GOODS; HOME ECONOMICS; GOOD TRY, BUT NO DICE

 The picture telephone, the electric soup stirrer, the knife-fork, the 
biodegradable plastic dishes that dissolve in the kitchen sink, the talking 
refrigerator. . . . The path of consumer history is strewn with rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the upcoming International Housewares Show in Chicago will unveil 
thousands of products, the ultimate test rests with American shoppers -- who 
can unexpectedly balk. 
</P>
<P>
 When computer chip maker Intel reversed itself this month and pledged to 
replace about 4 million of its highly touted Pentium chips (their slight flaws 
shouldn't bother ordinary consumers, Intel had maintained), it was proof once 
again that the customer is always right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Market research is not a science, it's an art," says industrial designer 
Cooper Woodring, longtime head of new products and design for JCPenney. "We've 
learned a lot of questions to get to the truth about what people want, but it 
isn't foolproof." 
</P>
<P>
 Some products have sunk with a mighty splash. Most consumers remember the 
public outrage in 1985 when Coca-Cola, with great fanfare, unveiled a new 
formula to replace its 99-year-old Coke. But the company's about-face was so 
nimble that some competitors still wonder if Coca-Cola didn't engineer the 
whole dispute just to get publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Less fortunate was the Ford Motor Co. Not only did Ford lose nearly $350 
million when consumers spurned its cutting-edge 1957 Edsel, the name has 
lingered as a symbol for marketplace rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bombs fizzle quietly. The Susan B. Anthony dollar, a coin commemorating 
the 19th-Century Suffragette, was in circulation from 1979 to '81, but it 
looked so much like a quarter that it was dubbed the "Susan B. Ugly." "When 
they tried to find out how it happened," Woodring says, "nobody would take 
credit for designing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bombs keep returning. When Bell Telephone introduced its Picturephone 20 
years ago, customers said no thanks. Fifteen years later, Sony, Mitsubishi and 
Panasonic all introduced video phone models that went nowhere, even while 
consumers snapped up faxes, cellular phones and other technology. Now there is 
talk again of videophones on the Internet, despite compelling evidence that 
most people don't want to be seen while they talk on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Woodring: "When you do consumer research, people can tell you what they 
don't like, but not what they want."  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes research can't tell you anything, he adds, citing a case in point:  
</P>
<P>
 "Akio Morita, who recently retired as head of Sony Corp., was told by his 
consumer research department that the Walkman would be a bomb. Morita stuck to 
his conviction and made it anyway, and it almost changed the world." CONNIE

THE GOODS; HOME ECONOMICS; MACHINES THAT MAKE GOURMET MEALS. COFFEE MUGS THAT 
PLUG INTO YOUR DASHBOARD. HOUSEWARES IN 1995 WILL FOCUS ON SAVING TIME AND 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How will American lifestyles change in the new year? What will consumers be 
consuming? Here are some predictions for 1995: 
</P>
<P>
 * A continued "cocooning" trend as aging yuppies intensify interests in 
gourmet cooking and bread-baking. 
</P>
<P>
 * An accelerated rate of home remodeling as families grow, but budgets don't. 
</P>
<P>
 * An unprecedented passion for getting organized. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computerized cooking that does everything but serve the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 These forecasts are not the musings of social demographers or crystal ball 
gazers, but samplings from the 2,000-exhibit catalogue of the upcoming 
International Housewares Show, Jan. 15-18 in Chicago's McCormick Place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show is a good picture of what's going on throughout the country," says 
Tom Conley, executive director of the sponsoring National Housewares 
Manufacturers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The gigantic trade event, which has a waiting list for exhibit space, will 
unveil thousands of products in 92 categories, from acrylic ware to vaporizers. 
More than 2,000 manufacturers around the world have done their market research 
and think they know what consumers are going to be shopping for in 1995, Conley 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a global marketplace of buyers, sellers, products and ideas," he says. 
"It's the largest housewares-only exposition in the world. We'll have our 100th 
show in 1997." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the term housewares may suggest a homey image of pots and pans and 
spatulas, those concepts were replaced years ago, Conley says. The show, which 
attracts 50,000 visitors, grew to encompass products for every room in the 
house and for outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our overall theme this year is diversity," Conley says. "That's not just race 
and nationality, but we are also designing specific products for different age 
groups, for different kinds of households and for changing lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become increasingly health conscious, so buyers will see more and more 
products for rotisserie cooking. And because our tastes are increasingly 
global, there are new ways to cook Chinese food or heat tortillas, for 
instance." 
</P>
<P>
 New ways of eating also dictate new ways of serving food, says John Meier, 
head of the glassware giant Libbey Inc. "We've been in business since 1818, and 
until recently, we had only a few coffee mugs, and we hadn't heard of a 
microbrewery. Now they are everywhere, and so are little coffee bars, and our 
research shows they will keep growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Libbey has responded by designing a spectrum of mugs and steins for sipping 
the new variety of ice beers, nonalcoholic beers, ales and stouts, he says, 
along with "all shapes and sizes of coffee vessels."  
</P>
<P>
 A boom in home businesses and telecommuting has inspired a wide variety of 
ready-to-assemble desks and storage units, and expandable modular systems. And 
the economic factor that keeps many growing families in their first homes has 
created a need for organizers of every sort, says Randy Coates, a spokesman for 
Closetmaid.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to do more with the space they have," he says. "We 
introduced the whole concept of closet organization 27 years ago, but in the 
last two years, we've introduced more than 275 new products." 
</P>
<P>
 Practical solutions for storage of small items are hot right now, he says, 
"like small, light shelves that sit on the kitchen counter or in the 
refrigerator, or a little wire gadget that holds 12 soda cans and dispenses 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Another major motif at the housewares show will be technology aimed at further 
efficiency in everyday tasks -- from an electronic roach killer to a new hair 
dryer with a volume-building attachment designed to give hair fullness. 
</P>
<P>
 The overriding consumer trend of the 1990s continues to be economy of time and 
money, says consultant Thomas I. Rubel of Management Horizons, consulting 
division of Price Waterhouse. That will be the message of his "Retailing 2000" 
keynote address at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The American consumer's value equation has changed for the '90s, Rubel says. 
"They are saying 'We want more for less -- more fashion, innovation, service 
and convenience for less time and money and risk.' They don't have as much 
discretionary time as in the past, and the time budget is as important as the 
money budget in many shopping behaviors." 
</P>
<P>
 That accounts for such products as irons with quick heat for people who iron 
clothes as they are getting dressed in the morning, and a coffee mug that plugs 
into a dashboard cigarette lighter for breakfast-on-the-run.  
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps the coffee warm all the way to the office and you can unplug and 
take it in with you," says Dov Glucksman, president of Appliance Development. 
"People have totally upgraded the quality of coffee they drink in recent years. 
The rise of coffee bars is generational, and has to do with health 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 For a generation that has also discovered homemade bread, American Harvest has 
turned out the first bread maker that bakes two loaves at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bread makers have really caught on in the last few years," says company 
spokeswoman Mary Jo Exley. "Our research showed people would make one loaf and 
it was gone immediately, so we came up with a double-baking pan. You just throw 
in the yeast, the flour and the water and press a button. The machine does the 
rest. It's a really neat idea." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ultimate in time saving for 1995 may be the new Robochef, which Don 
Wong, president of C.P. Design, will demonstrate at the Chicago housewares 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Robochef is a robotic cook, says Wong, an engineer who designed the device. 
Its microprocessor is programmed with hundreds of recipes for gourmet dishes 
and it will do all the chopping, mixing and baking, if you just put in the 
proper ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to eat good food, but they don't have time to cook," Wong says. 
"This is the only machine that allows you to prepare international cuisine by 
pressing a button."

 Items gleaned from student newspapers: 
</P>
<P>
 * A poetry club, fashioned after the Dead Poets Society, has sprung up at 
Brea-Olinda High School. Members share poetry ranging from classic literature 
to free verse as well as their own creations.A group poem is also part of the 
experience, with each member writing one line on a chosen topic. 
</P>
<P>
 * German classes, a victim of declining interest and tight budgets, will 
become a thing of the past next fall at Irvine High School. Students who want 
to continue to study German will have to go to University High, the only school 
left in the district with a German curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new tardiness policy is making a difference at Loara High School in 
Anaheim. If you're not on time, you might be locked out of the classroom. 
Periodic lockouts are called by administrators, who advise teachers to lock 
their doors after the bell rings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lockout resulted in about 40 students receiving detentions. After 
several more lockouts, the number of student violators dropped to about eight.

 During medieval times, King Arthur and his court searched relentlessly for the 
Holy Grail in order to save their kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, a troupe of British actors set out on its own comical pursuit of 
the Grail, delighting television and movie audiences in England and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And, 20 years later, teen-agers continue the pursuit, converging upon video 
stores for copies of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."  
</P>
<P>
 Monty Python is the troupe of British actors -- including John Cleese and Eric 
Idle -- that created the "Flying Circus" TV series of offbeat comedy sketches. 
The actors went on to create several full-length movies, including "Holy Grail" 
and "Life of Brian." 
</P>
<P>
 So why are teen-agers, two decades later, drawn to the antics of Monty Python? 
</P>
<P>
 A love for foreign films? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers like them and will continue to because it is just so 'out there,' 
and the comedy is different. Most teen-agers aren't used to this type of 
off-the-wall sketch comedy, and they like it," said David Isom, a junior at 
Troy High School in Fullerton and a devoted Python fan. He was introduced to 
the movies and "Flying Circus" series in his freshman history class. He hadn't 
before seen anything like Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, when I was a freshman, my friends and I didn't have driver's 
licenses, so we would rent the Python movies as our way of having fun on the 
weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the information superhighway has been spared the effects of the 
Python gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Chat rooms on America On-Line titled "Monty Python" frequently show up, filled 
with teens reciting their favorite lines and revisiting thousands of sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of teens were drawn into the zany world of Python films before they 
entered high school. Emily Sorenson, a junior from El Dorado High School in 
Placentia, was roped in when she was just 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at my neighbor's house when someone put in the 'Holy Grail,' and I fell 
in love with it from the beginning," she said. "Now I've watched that movie so 
many times that I could recite just about any line from it." 
</P>
<P>
 And she has spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the way they say things . . . the words they choose makes them so funny. 
The situations (the actors) are in make the movies hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like my favorite scene, where a wealthy landowner is looking out a window and 
then turns to his son and says, 'One day, lad, all this will be yours' as he 
points toward the window. And his son replies, 'What, the curtains?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fans say they find themselves thinking Pythonesque thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Isom said sometimes a quote from a Python film will just pop into his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you say it out loud, and then everyone around you starts going off on 
it, which usually turns into a half-hour conversation on Monty Python," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a routine warm-up for a cross-country meet, Jeremy Acres, a Troy 
freshman, said a Pythonism popped into his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our two team captains came up to where we were stretching, and someone said, 
'Here come our self-appointed dictators now.' That reminded me of the scene 
from the 'Holy Grail' where a peasant is giving King Arthur a hard time because 
he was made king by divine right. So I started reciting the scene, and two 
other guys started reciting it with me," Acres said. "We laughed about it for 
the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Python films helped develop his philosophy, Isom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something bad happens, try to think of something funny," he said. "Monty 
Python is that something funny that I usually think about. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a character in a 'Python' movie lost a limb or was thrown into a 
bottomless pit, they didn't care. They just laughed it off and life went on." 
</P>
<P>
 And, while that attitude might not work with every kind of problem, it might 
help you laugh off that last history test score.

MY TURN: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; LIFE EXPERIENCE IS THOROUGH TEACHER

<P>
 I found the old man sitting on the front porch, enjoying the whispering, cool 
breeze. Though there was much about him I did not know, I knew his experiences 
were many, for he often displayed a confident wisdom.  
</P>
<P>
 "Grandpa?" I asked. He turned and smiled his old, familiar smile: eyes 
crinkled in the corners, closed lips turned upward in the satisfaction that I 
had taken time to visit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Hon'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a really tough time right now. You know, making all these college 
decisions," I said, seating myself on a chair beside him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know. But I have confidence that you'll make the right decisions," he 
answered gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what if I don't?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Then," he said, easing into a more comfortable position, "then, you'll just 
have to start over, or pick life up from wherever it fell." I grew silent and 
watched the sun begin to slide toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandpa, where did you go? After high school, I mean." I knew he must have 
gone somewhere. Men that smart didn't just get that way on their own. Grandpa 
closed his eyes for a moment and smiled to himself in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hon', I went to the school of hard knocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did you go there?" I wondered aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't help it. It was a requirement to go in my day." 
</P>
<P>
 "How was the academic program?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he said, cocking an eyebrow in thought, "as I remember it, this school 
was really into hands-on experience. Yup -- that school always did things the 
most modern way. Let me tell you, their hands-on method really made you learn, 
though. You know, it was really easy to get accepted to the school, but it was 
trial-by-fire to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did everybody make it through this school, though?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, no, no," he said. "Some people took the easy way out and just dropped 
out of school -- and literally out of life. They were the ones who didn't take 
the time to study their mistakes and to learn from them. Others just went plain 
nuts and forgot who they were, or why they were there. But many made it to 
graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to the people who graduated?" 
</P>
<P>
 Grandpa shifted again and nodded in speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened to everybody , obviously. But those people I kept 
in touch with went on to be really happy. They were strong and confident. They 
knew themselves and understood others. Oh, and they helped out others who were 
still students. A lot of times, the students they helped were their own kids!" 
Grandpa gave a long, satisfying sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard school," he said. "There was a lot of difficult homework. 
Sometimes we students could help each other figure it out. But other times, 
everyone was in the same confused rut and couldn't get out! The teacher was 
relentless. The finals! Oh, the finals! But let me tell you, by the time we 
finished a lesson, we had really learned our stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The school sounded like quite an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't anything good ever happen there?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes!" And his face lit up like a child's on Christmas morning. "I met 
your grandma there. I learned a lot about myself, too. Changed my whole outlook 
on life. I entered quite early -- you can do that, you know, taking classes 
while you're still in elementary school or high school. Anyway, since I started 
early, I got an extra-long education. And believe me -- I use the skills I 
learned every day. I learned how to fend for myself! I also learned to 
appreciate what is good, and how to respect that goodness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you regret going there? It sounds so difficult!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a bit. Not one bit. I am who I am today because I went. I've got a great 
family that came from a human life studies class. I appreciate music and the 
arts because of another class. I changed my major many times. From finance, to 
child rearing, to business, to survival skills." 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandpa, did you get through school?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure did. No easy thing. But the alumni board still calls and gets me 
involved in little activities every so often. I try to avoid them as much as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 I laughed. His familiar smile reappeared, breaking open with a chuckle. The 
sun was dipping low, and it was now a bright half-circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "So tell me," I pressed. "Did you get your diploma?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hon'," he addressed me, and smiled lovingly. "You are my diploma." 
</P>
<P>
 The sun disappeared, and Grandpa and I went inside to eat dinner together.

<P>
 What you don't know can hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message for consumers in 1995 from the California Department of 
Consumer Affairs."Too many people don't realize how many laws we have to 
protect them," says Joanne Corday Kozberg, secretary of the State and Consumer 
Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the department's New Year's gifts is a 25-minute video, "Rebuilding 
After a Disaster." It explains why you should hire a licensed contractor for 
projects costing more than $300. Useful to any homeowner, the tape is available 
for $2.99 at HomeBase stores, which underwrote the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new year will also see many consumer laws go into effect, including 
tighter regulations on standards for clinics and doctors who perform outpatient 
surgery, stricter enforcement of child support laws, and new penalties for 
those who price-gouge during and after disasters.  
</P>
<P>
 A joint legislative Sunset Committee will review the function of every state 
consumer board, and the department's new Consumer Information Hotline ((800) 
952-5210) will help consumer advocates set priorities for the new year. The hot 
line fields questions and complaints from consumers about California's 180 
state agencies.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; VIDEO GAME; TOP VIDEO GAMES OF 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was 1994 the best year ever for the video game aficionado? 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking as someone whose experience dates back to Pong, I vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
 And although CD-based systems like 3DO and CD-i had strong offerings, and the 
64-bit Jaguar showed tremendous promise, Sega and Nintendo successfully 
demonstrated the 16-bit format remains the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two Super Nintendo games tied for my personal favorites of 1994 and 
lead my list of the best games I played this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When I fired up Super Metroid way back in April, I thought I'd found the best 
game of the year already and could sort of doze through the rest of 1994. This 
vast, incredibly detailed, innovative and engrossing shoot-'em-up maze kept me 
busy for weeks, and I'm still playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Nintendo topped itself with the hugely successful release in November 
of Donkey Kong Country, the fastest-selling single-platform game in history. 
The wonderful graphics, great game play and imaginative interaction between the 
two main characters make DKC maybe the best game ever designed for a Nintendo 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with those two tied for No. 1, which games fill rest of the slots? 
</P>
<P>
 3. A newcomer to the video game scene, Playmates, scored big with Earthworm 
Jim for SNES. This bizarre and surrealistic tale of a lowly garden worm 
inflated to super-hero status by a lost spacesuit is a tour de force of graphic 
design and intricate programming. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Acclaim's latest version of the controversial Mortal Kombat, MKII, made a 
great fighting game even better. And both the Genesis and SNES versions now 
have the oft-criticized, gory "finishing" moves much beloved by youthful gamers 
and hated by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Electronic Arts seems to make the Top 10 every year. This year, they make 
the list for a 3DO creation, Road Rash. They've done two versions for Genesis, 
but this one is the best, a devilishly amusing and highly illegal motorcycle 
race on public roads, with vastly improved control, better courses and a 
super-tough challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Crystal Dynamics, a fairly new company making games for 3DO, scores twice, 
with Total Eclipse and Off-World Interceptor. TE, a wild space shooter, and 
O-WI, an interplanetary 4x4 death race with great graphics and nonstop action, 
are musts if you own a 3DO system. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Seen enough of Mega Man to last you for a while? Well, Capcom squeezed new 
life out of the titanium terror in Mega Man X for SNES. It's the MM you've 
loved in a familiar yet all-new series of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Interplay's complex and lifelike Blackthorne for SNES, which tells the tale 
of an exiled warrior who returns home to free his enslaved people, is worth 
playing just to watch the almost-human hero in action. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Atari scored with Wolfenstein 3D for Jaguar. This bloody, bizarre shooter, 
which puts you in a Nazi bunker with orders to shoot to kill, may not be the 
true test of 64-bit technology, but it will do until something better comes 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Sega made the cut with its latest version of that hilarious hedgehog, 
Sonic. In Sonic 3, as he races through dozens of mazes, the whirling blue 
dervish continues to grow and to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy gaming in '95.

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNANSWERED IN ELEGANT EFFORT; 
SHADOWS OF THE MIND / A SEARCH FOR THE MISSING SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY 
ROGER PENROSE ;OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS $25, 457 PAGES

<P>
 How do our brains, which are physical objects, give rise to our thoughts, 
which are not? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a simple statement of the mind-body problem, which has bedeviled 
Western thought since Rene Descartes inflicted it on the world nearly four 
centuries ago. The question is easy to ask and can be understood by anyone. But 
answering it turns out to be among the most profound and difficult dilemmas 
ever posed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have struggled with the question, but so far no satisfactory and 
satisfying answer has been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent decades, the staggering growth in the power and speed of computers 
has focused renewed attention on Descartes' question. For computers are 
"electronic brains," and in certain well-defined areas -- chess, for example -- 
they can outperform all but a handful of humans. Does this mean they are 
thinking? Does this mean they have consciousness? Or that someday they will? 
</P>
<P>
 The scientific view is that there is nothing in our heads but flesh and blood 
and that every thought, every emotion, every dream, every nuance is merely the 
way we experience a certain arrangement of chemicals in our brains. To be sure, 
science today is far from having a full understanding of those arrangements of 
chemicals, but we know the laws that govern them, and ultimately we will figure 
it out and be able to replicate a fully functioning brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-scientific view says that no completely physical explanation will ever 
be found because there is something else in our heads -- something non-physical 
-- that enables this three-pound hunk of matter, our brains, to think and be 
conscious. Call it the soul , if you will, or the elan vital , or whatever (it 
doesn't have to be religious), but what we call mind, in this view, is not 
completely explicable by the brain and never will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Roger Penrose, the Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at 
Oxford and one of the world's most distinguished philosophers of mathematics 
and physics, wrote a book called 'The Emperor's New Mind," in which he proposed 
a middle ground between the two views. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Penrose, the workings of the brain and the mind are indeed 
ultimately explicable by the methods of science. But the laws of chemistry and 
physics that we now have are inadequate to the task. The laws of science that 
apply to the brain are different from the laws of science that apply to 
everything else, Penrose said. And these special laws of the brain have yet to 
be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Penrose's book touched off a furor of controversy, with many 
mainstream scientists attacking him for straying from the orthodoxy that all 
matter is the same and obeys the same laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The artificial intelligentsia in particular -- those who devote themselves to 
getting computers to think like people -- were livid at Penrose's assertion 
that their goal was unattainable and that computers would never have insight 
or, well, consciousness. (They agree that they have not yet achieved the Holy 
Grail, but the key word for them is yet. Yet may be a long time coming, they 
say, but it's just a matter of time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Penrose is no kook. So his views could not simply be dismissed. But he was 
roundly attacked for them and was accused of the ultimate sin in science: 
mysticism and its handmaiden, magic thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Penrose has written a new book, "Shadows of the Mind," in which he 
restates his earlier view more emphatically than before and responds to his 
critics. "Shadows of the Mind" is an elegant though difficult book, beautifully 
written and argued, in which Penrose draws on Godel's Theorem and the paradoxes 
of quantum theory in support of his claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain is not a computer, Penrose says. The brain is self-aware. It is 
capable of belief, understanding, insight and intuition. Computers cannot do 
these things and never will be able to. "Human intuition and insight cannot be 
reduced to any set of rules," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer is a physical object that obeys the known laws of physics. The 
brain, on the other hand, is a physical object that obeys so-far unknown laws 
of physics. Penrose surmises that the brain's physics is like quantum physics, 
in which subatomic particles can seemingly exist and not exist at the same 
time, and you can't be sure which until you observe them. 
</P>
<P>
 (Never mind about how this can be. No one knows. Quantum theory is an 
extremely accurate predictor of experimental results. So what if its 
philosophical implications don't make sense?) 
</P>
<P>
 Penrose speculates that the interaction between quantum mechanics and the 
brain occurs in cellular structures called microtubules. This is, to be 
generous, something of a stretch, as the evidence in support of this theory is 
scant at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it: Penrose is not going to persuade his critics, and they are not 
going to persuade him. Descartes's question remains unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Penrose has taken a mighty swing at it, using all of the tools of 
20th-Century thought at his command. If he hasn't quite solved the problem, he 
has nonetheless plumbed the depths of physics, philosophy and brain research in 
a powerful attempt to come up with an answer. Where is the computer that could 
do half as much?

 This is the year of revenge -- for the woman who never liked plaid shirts, 
combat boots, backpacks or tattoos. For the woman who never gave up on shoulder 
pads, gloves, hats, high heels -- or her waistline.For the woman who 
pooh-poohed her inner child and pampered her inner lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Glamour, sweetie-darlings, is big again. Think '40s and '50s sexy. Start with 
a suit or dress -- the tiny waist encircled with a thin-thin belt (the year's 
must-have accessory), a fanny emphasizing tight skirt (down to the calves to 
produce a wiggle-walk), hat-with-something (veil, cherries, flowers), spike 
heels and a snappy little hand-held bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Bias-cut dresses and shiny fabrics are part of the glam-track. Hair will shine 
too. (Think Breck girls.)  
</P>
<P>
 The bare midriff remains. And so do bare thighs, because in '90s freewheeling 
style, the mini will not die. Nor will visible corsets, bras and bustiers. But 
there is a newcomer: decorative panties. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's glamour puss is a dash of every goddess from Veronica Lake to 
model-of-the-moment Nadja Auermann. The rules for shopping? Recall them all, 
think feline-to-the-max, then be your own woman. 
</P>
<P>
 And get ready to find a Hollywood-retro sort of guy or a fashion gangster.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, sweetie-darlings, memories of Cary Grant and Al Capone have invaded 
menswear. The Armani man, however, remains as strong as ever, which means any 
sartorial sage worth his salt will have a wardrobe mix of Italian mod, old 
movie and the mob.

 Just as Republicans were big winners in '94, chickens should do well in '95. 
</P>
<P>
 After what one exasperated caterer calls "two years of chicken, chicken, 
chicken," look for New Year party menus to wing away from "health" rations and 
fly back to red meats and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The party world is overdue for a nostalgic return to comfort (read: fattening 
) food. The new motto: Eat now, aerobicize later. 
</P>
<P>
 As for movie premieres, the trend that began in '94 will continue full steam 
into '95, moving away from blockbuster tented parties and back toward the more 
cozy gatherings of 10 and 20 years ago. Most films will debut with mid-size 
affairs on studio lots or at the retro-fashionable Motion Picture Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the year's biggest parties is expected to come from the 
perennially strapped-for-cash theater world: April's West Coast premiere of 
"Beauty and the Beast" should be one of '95's true extravaganzas. 
</P>
<P>
 The look in parties will be less glitz and more style, less Bob Mackie and 
more Richard Tyler. What music will be heard at these stylishly subtle affairs 
is anybody's guess. Will the Republican resurgence mean more country and less 
Pearl Jam?  
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, maybe even the Funky Chicken will make a comeback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Also keep an eye out for what we might call haute porn. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Victoria's Secret catalogue has replaced Playboy as the smut rag of 
choice among high rollers, the hot theme on the club scene has become the 
striptease. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs such as Tatou, Glam Slam and 7969 all feature some version of Erotica 
Night, and Kelbo's has been recently reincarnated a la sailors' shore leave in 
Singapore. The truly savant go for the real thing: Look for Jumbo's Clown Room 
to be the next Dresden.

 In 1995, families will continue to try to rebuild their nests amid ongoing 
gender wars, an unknown political climate and a tidal wave of new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents, now dimly aware that their children know more about multimedia 
than they do, will wake up and see there is no escape from the inexorable 
onslaught.Questions to be pondered: Is this like TV and should it be regulated? 
Or is it more like books, where buyers should beware? Will limited access keep 
poor children from participating in the future? Will there ever be video games 
for girls? 
</P>
<P>
 If recent trends continue, birth rates will decline -- even to teens ages 15 
to 17. The number of divorces will decline, although they will still outnumber 
marriages. The pool of absent fathers will shift away from divorced to 
never-married dads. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials will continue trying to lure some fathers back into 
family life with carrots or sticks. Father advocates will rally to make dads 
more responsible at home, but on their terms: role models only, no housework. 
</P>
<P>
 A symbolic tax cut for families will have less real effect than welfare 
reform. While neo-traditionalists say cutting back on welfare payments will 
boost responsible parenthood, others fear that the reconstituted Congress will 
sharpen the "family values" sword to punish more parents who don't measure up 
and create institutions to house their children.

 If there's a gene for obesity, as New York researchers recently announced, 
could there also be couch potato genes? Jock genes? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe.Canadian researchers are trying to pinpoint the gene or genes that 
"predispose people to have success in sports," says Marcel R. Boulay of Laval 
University in Quebec City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are people who have (better) response in blood pressure and 
cholesterol lowering, for instance, when exposed to the same training program," 
says Boulay's colleague, Claude Bouchard. 
</P>
<P>
 But slackers, take note: Even if it turns out you're genetically shortchanged, 
you're not off the hook. Fitness researchers who specialize in adherence say 
your genetic blueprint may someday be used to write your personal exercise 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with "jock genes" or not, more people will get moving in 1995, 
predicts John Duncan, exercise physiologist at Dallas' Cooper Institute for 
Aerobics Research. "Integrate exercise into your daily life, that's the new 
message," Duncan says. New, less strenuous, exercise guidelines call for 30 
minutes of moderately intense activity to be accumulated throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the 78% of Americans who still don't exercise enough, the New Year may 
not be one of increased exercise as much as increased consciousness, says James 
Sallis, psychology professor at San Diego State University. "We'll have more 
awareness of how our lifestyles have become sedentary," he says, "but '95 is 
not the year we'll do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all bad, though. According to Sallis and others, this contemplation 
stage often leads to the action stage.

 Magazines will continue to woo Generation Xers and baby boomers -- and now 
that publishers have discovered that the former have money, they want to offer 
help managing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this spring, P.O.V., a young men's lifestyle magazine, will give 
industrious twentysomethings career and financial advice, and Money will 
publish a test issue of a companion magazine aimed at twenty- and 
thirtysomethings. 
</P>
<P>
 And as baby boomers settle down to home and hearth, magazines are doing the 
same. Time Inc. Ventures will publish a test issue of a magazine based on the 
PBS television series "This Old House," and Hearst will publish more issues of 
Country Living Gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Sassy, a girl's teen magazine recently purchased by the Los Angeles-based 
Petersen Publishing, will grow up, refocusing its appeal for a slightly older 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 At Conde Nast, expect Detail's new editor in chief, Joe Dolce, to bring back 
the cutting-edge sensibility the young men's magazine was known for before 
Sylvester Stallone appeared on its cover. Tina Brown will probably keep the 
much-watched New Yorker on course, but look for new fiction and literary editor 
Bill Buford to revitalize the magazine's short stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, there is expansion ahead for Los Angeles magazine, which promises to 
give more depth to its listings as well as to its stories. Buzz hopes to win 
more readers in New York and other cities, without sacrificing its L.A. 
personality.

 With the exception of "The Road Ahead" (Viking) -- a literary trip down the 
Information Superhighway with super-driver/billionaire Microsoft founder Bill 
Gates (due out in April) -- most of 1995's major books ring of nostalgia. The 
memories are often sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jamaica Kincaid's new novel, "The Autobiography of My Mother" (Farrar, 
Straus & Giroux), a 70-year-old West Indian woman looks back on the rich 
relationships that have given meaning to her life (out in August). 
</P>
<P>
 In Isabel Allende's memoir, "Paula" (HarperCollins), Allende sits at the 
bedside of her daughter, lying comatose in a Madrid hospital, and recounts the 
grand saga of her Chilean family (May). 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's favorite mystery writer, Walter Mosley, makes his first 
departure from the genre in "RL's Dream" (Norton), a novel about an aging blues 
man who fondly remembers the black poetry he spun on stage with such 
Mississippi Delta musicians as Robert (RL) Johnson (August). 
</P>
<P>
 The new year will also bring memories from a soldier -- Colin Powell's as yet 
untitled autobiography (Random House) in September -- and from a rebel: Susan 
Eisenhower's "Breaking Free" (FSG), a memoir of how the former President's 
granddaughter began a love affair with Russia's top rocket scientist in the 
midst of the Cold War (June). 
</P>
<P>
 For darker memories, turn to Carolyn See's "Dreaming" (Random House), a 
poignant memoir about her family's struggle with alcoholism (March), or to 
William Gass' massive novel on war and guilt in the 20th Century, "The Tunnel" 
(Knopf) in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the year's list of likely bestsellers are an as-yet-untitled book on 
America's foreign policy by George Bush and Brent Scowcroft (Knopf) in October, 
and novels from James Ellroy, Stephen King, John le Carre, Anne Rice and Larry 
McMurtry. 
</P>
<P>
 The only theme that jumps out from next year's major nonfiction titles is that 
most timeless one of all: Sex. And Americans' approach to it is lambasted in a 
number of books.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Intimate Terrorism" (Norton), Michael Vincent Miller contends that by 
viewing sex as merely a tool of power, we have stripped it of erotic magic 
(May). In "With Pleasure" (Oxford), scientists Paul R. Abramson and Steven D. 
Pinkerton show that we are programmed to have sex for pleasure, not merely to 
make babies (October). And in "The Apartheid of Sex" (Crown), Martine Rothblatt 
argues that by categorizing people from birth as either male or female, we've 
come to practice a form of sexual segregation "as pernicious as racial 
apartheid." (February).

MYSTERY SHROUDS MILLIONAIRE'S DISAPPEARANCE; ENIGMA: CAM LYMAN LOOKED AND ACTED 
LIKE A MAN. TO SOME, SHE VANISHED AS A COVER FOR A SEX CHANGE. BUT HER SISTERS 
THINK SHE'S DEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 They had words, an angry exchange about their mutual passion -- Clumber 
spaniels. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, George O'Neil said, his friend Cam Lyman disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the two sisters of the eccentric multimillionaire dog breeder have taken 
steps to have Lyman declared dead, but O'Neil thinks his friend may have 
slipped off that summer day in 1987 to have a sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd been talking about it for years," O'Neil said Wednesday from his home 
in North Kingstown, R.I. With her close-cropped hair, her mustache and her 
habit of dressing in men's clothes, Lyman "looked better as a guy than as a 
woman" anyway, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of the woman -- who had her name legally shortened from Camilla -- 
believes she was kidnaped and murdered, said the lawyer for Lyman's sisters. 
Barry Mills of Ellsworth, Me., said a worldwide search had produced no trace of 
the missing millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills also said he is disgusted with the prurient interest the case has 
generated. In the week after Christmas, he complained, the case has been the 
buzz of New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of the (cases) that we have handled, where people have been 
injured or killed, and nobody gives a damn, it just makes me sick," Mills said. 
"Then someone says 'sex change' and everyone gets excited. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Mills confirmed that Mary Margaret Goodale of Maine and Edith Kuhn of 
Northern California have petitioned the court to have their sister declared 
dead in Rhode Island, where she maintained a 40-acre estate, and where she 
raised and cared for 58 show-quality Clumber spaniels and Field spaniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyman's $2.1-million estate also includes an attache case filled with jewels 
that never left her side, even while she slept, O'Neil said. The case vanished 
with Lyman, who would now be in her late 50s, as did cash she kept squirreled 
around her house. Some of Lyman's clothing also is missing, leading O'Neil to 
refute the notion that his friend was abducted. People who are being kidnaped, 
O'Neil dryly noted, normally do not "bring a change of clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neil's attorney, Rosemary Healey of Providence, R.I., said that in his 
heart, even her client suspects Lyman died soon after her disappearance. Too 
much time has elapsed without contact or activity in Lyman's bank account or 
credit cards, Healey pointed out. Well-known investigators have been unable to 
solve the mystery, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe George hates to think of her as dead," Healey said, and would like to 
think that Lyman went off for "that other purpose" -- meaning the sex-change 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 But "in all likelihood, given the fact that there is no paper trail," Lyman is 
probably dead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While holding out the possibility that Lyman may have left home voluntarily, 
only to have met some untoward fate thereafter, Healey said the fact that she 
left her dogs behind -- particularly her champion Clumber spaniel, Raycroft 
Sheriff -- makes her death a virtual certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you don't care much about money, you don't leave your dogs behind," 
Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her will, the six-foot woman left most of her assets to the Dog Museum of 
St. Louis. Lyman also stipulated that O'Neil charter an airplane and sprinkle 
her ashes over New York's Madison Square Garden during the annual Westminster 
Dog Show there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was her desire, yes," Healey said. "Unfortunately (without a body), it 
has not been able to be carried out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for all parties said disposition of Lyman's assets is not at issue. 
Rather, family members and friends, such as O'Neil and other members of the 
dog-show community, are eager "to put an end to the uncertainty and accept the 
fact of her death," Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island law holds that a person missing for more than four years may be 
declared dead. The state's probate court is expected to make a decision in the 
Lyman case early in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Mills said, other events will no doubt sweep this case out of 
the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The O.J. trial starts next week," he said. "Maybe people will start focusing 
on that."

WANT TO GET ORGANIZED? IT'S ABOUT TIME; LIFESTYLE: MOST OF US SUFFER 'HURRY 
SICKNESS': TRYING TO GET TOO MUCH DONE IN TOO LITTLE TIME. AND TIME-MANAGEMENT 
CURES DON'T ALWAYS WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a rush? And still falling behind? You are not alone. Sixty-two percent of 
American workers said in a recent survey that they frequently or always feel 
pressed to accomplish everything they have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The mellowed-out were definitely in the minority: A mere 5% said they rarely 
or never feel rushed. "Hurry sickness" is what Anne McGee-Cooper, a Texas-based 
time-management consultant, calls it. Although epidemic, she says, there are 
antidotes -- if the stress doesn't get to you first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry sickness happens when your sole solution to time management is to try 
to get more things done in the same amount of time," says McGee-Cooper, author 
with Duane Trammell of "Time Management for Unmanageable People: The Guilt-Free 
Way to Organize, Energize and Maximize Your Life" (Bantam). 
</P>
<P>
 "In the computer world, it's called 'thrashing,' " she says. "So much 
information is entered that the computer is stuck in the sort mode -- trying to 
decide among many things that need to be done -- without being able to move 
into actually doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Unchecked, hurry sickness can trigger various physical symptoms -- shallow 
breathing, for one. Because it impedes the flow of oxygenated blood to the 
brain, it leads to fuzzy thinking and forgetfulness, making you fall even 
further behind. "It's another case of when you need to slow down to go faster," 
McGee-Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, obviously, the time-honored prescriptions put forward by time-management 
experts don't always mean a cure. Especially if you fall into what McGee-Cooper 
calls a divergent or "right-brain thinker" category, or are someone who thinks 
about time in a flexible "poly-chronic" rather than a rigid, "mono-chronic" 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask about how I manage my time," says free-lance writer Cindy 
Castleman, "but rather, ask me how much money I've wasted on time-management 
books." 
</P>
<P>
 Castleman is a typical example of the person who finds it difficult to conform 
to old-style rules for systems and schedules: "I hate filing. I like putting 
things in piles -- I like the physicality of piles, and having everything all 
out in the open, where I can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 "And," she says, "I can find everything I need." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1970s when McGee-Cooper was going for a doctorate at 
Columbia University in "creative problem-solving and the politics of change," 
she began to notice that a lot of people defied all time-management dogma -- 
and were succeeding. Many of them had messy desks, rarely finished one task 
before moving on and worked from multiple to-do lists. They even, she noted, 
handled papers many times, ignoring a prime time-management commandment -- 
"never handle a piece of paper more than once" -- from Alan Lakein's 
much-reprinted 1973 book, "How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life" 
(Signet). 
</P>
<P>
 "It began to occur to me," says McGee-Cooper, "that maybe the classic rules 
didn't work for everyone. . . . Left-brain people are 'convergent thinkers.' 
They like using unchanging logical systems based on abstract thinking and 
memory, repetition, conformity to standards. None of this comes easily to 
right-brain people." 
</P>
<P>
 But failure at managing time properly may not be merely a 
right-brain/left-brain issue. What author Dru Scott dubs "the secret pleasures 
of mismanaging time" are detailed in her classic 1980 book "How to Put More 
Time in Your Life" (Signet). 
</P>
<P>
 The psychology behind the incurable procrastinator, the chronic 
document-misplacer or list-loser, the person who is always late -- even to 
pleasurable outings -- is more complex than most people realize. And tardiness 
often brings hidden benefits to the guilty party. 
</P>
<P>
 The satisfaction of defying authority or thumbing one's nose at the status 
quo, for example. "Some of us mismanage time to get attention or gain a sense 
of power," Scott writes. "Mismanaging time can also serve as a way to avoid 
unpleasant tasks or shirk personal responsibility. It can also be used to 
resist change, sidestep new feelings, avoid feeling close to others, and deal 
with the age-old fear of feeling 'too good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But many people, even if optimistic about the future, are too 
nose-to-the-grindstone to focus on it, continually bogged down in getting the 
laundry folded, the car repaired, the bills sent out, the kids fed, the letters 
done -- in other words, stuck on a to-do list. 
</P>
<P>
 Being unclear about where your life is leading is another reason daily time is 
mismanaged. "Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can 
do something about it right now," Lakein writes in his book. 
</P>
<P>
 But time-management experts agree that lists must address more than chores. 
Loren Hulber, president of Day-Timers Inc., which makes calendars and date 
books, says, "Every individual needs to set down the beliefs and goals that are 
most meaningful to them. List what are professional goals, what are your dreams 
for your family, your community, as well as personal development goals for 
expanding your life. Once you have those established, you can begin to set out 
your priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people don't have a life plan," says Hulber, "then life is happening to 
them, instead of them happening to life."

 * Use the "Swiss cheese approach": Poking holes in daunting jobs reduces them 
to manageable size. This is also known as the "salami technique" -- slicing a 
huge task into mini-jobs, which can then be crossed off one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prioritize: Don't just work down your list in order, says Loren Hulber of 
Day-Timers. Put A, B or C next to each item. A means "must do"; B, "should do," 
and C, "could do." Go over this list every morning, he suggests: "The half-hour 
you spend planning each morning will add an hour and a half of productivity to 
your day." 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice the deceptively simple art of saying "no": Start small, say, 
promising yourself to say "no" once a week, building up until the practice 
becomes habitual rather than painful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at the big picture and chart your progress: A simple visual exercise 
Angelo Valenti uses is a timeline: On a big sheet of paper, list all the months 
for the year across the top; on the vertical axis, projects for that year. Use 
self-adhesive notes for each step toward the goal, removing or repositioning 
them as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn the art of letting go: "When a list becomes too overwhelming, it's 
time to take a good look at what you can realistically expect to accomplish," 
say Ronni Eisenberg and Kate Kelly in their book, "Organize Your Home" 
(Hyperion, 1986). Drop a couple low-priority items completely, delegate others; 
consider hiring someone or arranging with a friend to swap unpleasant tasks 
that have taken up list space for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go high-tech: New toys for the well-to-do time-management-impaired include 
computerized systems that break a day's schedule into 15- or 30-minute blocks; 
an alarm goes off when it's time to drop what you are doing and prepare for 
what's next on the agenda. SUZANNE CURLEY

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; MUSIC, MAGIC BUT NO MIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The Sound of Music" opened on Broadway in 
1959, there was no idea that it would run for almost four years, anymore than R 
& H thought their "Oklahoma" would capture the heart of America and seemingly 
run forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's retelling of the escape of the Von Trapp family from Nazi 
suppression, a true story, was played out with unabashed sentimentality, 
crystal-clear simplicity and a score that featured Hammerstein's folksy 
affinity and Rodgers' hummable melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three and a half decades later, the material holds up well. Indeed, in the 
touring production at the Orange County Performing Arts Center through Jan. 8, 
the show has become the star. A fine cast headed by Marie Osmond seems to 
understand the respect due, which may be part of the production's only problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the warm direction of the lyricist's son, James Hammerstein, the show 
itself appears to have become a sort of hymn, a classical morality play like 
those depicted on the Baroque ceilings of Neil Peter Jampolis' scenic design. 
There is a sense of both importance and import in Hammerstein's tempos in the 
dialogue sections and in much of Richard Parrinello's musical direction. It's a 
charming, heartwarming, melodious show, but it's not grand opera, and here it 
just doesn't glisten with the inner energy it once had. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that a lot of the magic isn't still there. The tear ducts 
will swell at the right time, and the lips will curl into a comfortable smile 
now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 What's missing is a lot of the fun, especially when the Von Trapp kids are 
onstage with Maria. Marie Osmond is impressive as the convent postulant whose 
heart is full of music and whose music is full of heart. Unlike many who have 
played the role, she manages at the beginning to seem almost like one of the 
children, maturing slowly and almost imperceptibly until Maria's marriage to 
the children's father finds her completely his equal. Osmond also sings 
Rodgers' melodies in a grand and accomplished manner. But her efforts, along 
with the children's, look very rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Benari's Captain Von Trapp is a fine, starchy patriarch who melts into 
his old true self with ease, and the actor, in a solid performance, fortunately 
doesn't get gooey about it. Claudia Cummings is a Mother Abbess to reckon with; 
her powerful soprano is an extension of the aura of wisdom, kindness and 
strength she drapes around the character. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Thompson has a nice brittle edge as Von Trapp's wealthy fiancee and 
Keith Jochim is very funny and brings new colors to the dingy impresario Max. 
Elizabeth Owens' housekeeper stands out for the roundness of characterization 
in an underwritten role. 
</P>
<P>
 The Von Trapp children are all they should be, but particularly noticeable are 
tiny Lisbeth Zelle as Gretl, the youngest, for her sense of humor, and Stephen 
Blosil (Osmond's real-life son) for his strong stage presence and his clarion 
voice in some solo bits. Vanessa Dorman is a surprisingly and appealingly 
complex Liesl, the oldest daughter, and her duet ("Sixteen Going on Seventeen") 
with Rolf, the telegraph boy she loves, is a highlight. Richard H. Blake gives 
Rolf an appealing boyishness during the number, contrasting effectively with 
his later Hitler Youth arrogance.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: THE O.C. THEATER SCENE WAS A PALE SHADOW OF REALITY; BEHIND 
FOOTLIGHTS, HIGHLIGHTS AND BLIND SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been a banner year for tragedy, a provocative one for theater of the 
absurd. But the most riveting shows in both categories came from the real 
world, not from Orange County's stages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a period that brought Citron's Folly, the Nixon Elegies and the Adventures 
of O.J. -- not to mention Serbian genocide, Rwandan genocide, Chechnya, Haiti, 
the Cuban exodus, Mexico, the Middle East and Proposition 187 -- the local 
theater scene was a pale shadow of reality. It often seemed irrelevant and 
insular, churning out hundreds of productions that barely took notice of the 
world beyond the footlights. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say some stage presentations couldn't hold their own among the 
best nationwide. Several plays at South Coast Repertory did, as did a couple of 
touring musicals at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But productions of new or recent works cued to contemporary issues seemed few 
and far between, although a handful of notable exceptions immediately come to 
mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * George C. Wolfe's "Jelly's Last Jam" was a snazzy 1992 Broadway musical 
about the roots of black-on-black racism in African-American culture (Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, December). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Athol Fugard's "Playland" presented an intense and eloquent drama about the 
dilemma of race relations in post-apartheid South Africa (South Coast Repertory 
Second Stage, January). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Greenberg's "Night and Her Stars" offered an ambitious satirical 
take on moral corruption, media money and fame as seen through the lens of the 
'50s quiz-show scandals (SCR Mainstage, March). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * John Twomey's "Teachers' Lounge" was a lively piece of gallows humor about 
the decline of urban public schools and teacher burnout (Laguna Playhouse 
Moulton Theatre, January). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there were other productions -- usually classics from the standard 
repertory but not always -- that dealt with longstanding issues that still 
relate: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Elmer Rice's "The Adding Machine" (1929), about the regimentation of a 
technological society (Cal State Fullerton Recital Hall, December). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" (1953), about McCarthyite fanaticism in the 
guise of the Salem witch trials (Vanguard Theatre Ensemble, November). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Lorraine Hansberry's "Raisin in the Sun" (1959), about minority dreams of 
upward mobility (Alternative Repertory Theatre, February). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Fugard's "Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act" (1972), about 
interracial sex and police rule (UC Irvine Fine Arts Village Theatre, 
February). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank McGuinness' "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me" (1992), about terrorist 
hostages (SCR Second Stage, March). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these were successful, some not. Either way, they served as reminders 
that theater need not exist in a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 But now to one man's opinion of 1994's best and worst -- regardless of agenda 
and in no particular order. 
</P>
<P>
 Most enthralling production: "Henry VI -- The Battle for the Throne" by 
William Shakespeare (Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, November). 
Actually, you couldn't come across a more inspired presentation in or out of 
the county -- Shakespearean or otherwise. Steeped in the aura of the late 
Middle Ages, this revelatory production by the Royal Shakespeare Co. was 
totally accessible and deeply moving. The velvet solemnity of the liturgical 
chants topped everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best new play: "Green Icebergs" by Cecilia Fannon (SCR Mainstage, October). 
Serious issues emerged between bright shafts of laughter in this witty and 
beguiling exploration of modern mores. It probed the meaning of marriage and 
loyalty, love and betrayal, sex and art. The smart writing couldn't have been 
more savvy, the spare production more handsome, the ensemble more winning. 
David Emmes directed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most soul-searching philosopher: "Gray's Anatomy" (Irvine Barclay Theatre, 
May). Spalding Gray, who is a more amusing hypochondriac than anybody in 
show-biz, delivered his latest introspective monologue about "the Bermuda 
Triangle of health." With his typical genius for metaphysics, Gray elaborated 
on an injury to his left eye and came up with wildly funny speculations about 
the profundities of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most charming one-man revue: "Mark Turnbull and Friends -- A One-Man Show" 
(Way Off Broadway Playhouse, April). A genuine local artist who may still 
become rich and famous, Turnbull offered bittersweet reflections about his 
downward climb on the mainstream ladder of success. He had coffeehouse charisma 
and a talent for combining the heartfelt with the facetious in song and story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bravest confession of an Oscar-winning actor: "An Evening With Rod Steiger" 
(Irvine Barclay Theatre, September). Once a top Hollywood star, Steiger 
dwindled into a sullen ghost of himself during a decade-long bout with clinical 
depression. He spoke with remarkable candor of his screen career, artistic 
beliefs and personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most passionate revival: "Playland" by Athol Fugard (SCR Second Stage, 
January). The furious sweep of the performances by Richard Doyle and Kene 
Holliday brought Fugard's plea for racial conciliation to life with vital 
force. Martin Benson directed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most brooding revival, also most daring: "Hedda Gabler" by Henrik Ibsen (SCR 
Mainstage, January). The operatic concept behind this production -- reinforced 
by the melodramatic design -- lent a grave and an uncompromising sense of doom 
to this bleak tragedy. David Chambers directed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most elegiac revival, also the prettiest: "Dancing at Lughnasa" by Brian Friel 
(SCR Mainstage, June). Poetic texture, nuances of mood and an able cast 
enriched this atmospheric memory piece. Though tinged with sadness, it was 
remarkably good-humored and told an old-fashioned tale of heartbreak without 
wearing its heart on its sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated revival: "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams (SCR 
Mainstage, September). When Blanche's tragedy provokes titters in the audience 
-- as happened the night I saw it -- something has gone terribly wrong. For me 
it was the casting of Blanche and Stanley. She seemed merely overwrought; he 
seemed tepid. As a result, their clash struck few sparks and had no tragic 
dimension. The conflict between them looked like nothing more than spite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated musical: Tommy Tune's production of "Grease" (Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, March). This Day-Glo revival was a great big hit for no 
good reason. The content was as empty as the style, an exercise in watered-down 
doo-wop. And, yes, it went on to Broadway, where it became an even bigger hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second most overrated musical: "The Who's Tommy" by Pete Townshend (OCPAC, 
May). This rock opera had high-impact visuals and low-impact drama. It featured 
grandiose pantomime that looked silly from beginning to end and a score that 
sounded better on the Who's original album. The effect was as catatonic as 
Tommy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All-time overrated musical: "The Phantom of the Opera" by Andrew Lloyd Webber 
(OCPAC, July). Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most underrated performance in a musical: Maurice Hines in "Jelly's Last Jam" 
(OCPAC, November). Although this snazzy show was ultimately more admirable than 
engaging, Hines depicted Jelly Roll Morton with stiletto-sharp style. George C. 
Wolfe's book and direction, not Hines' performance, kept Jelly at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most heartfelt post-performance: After the "Jelly" cast took its bows, Hines 
introduced his mother to the audience with an "I love my Mommy" speech that was 
in a class of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most endearing Shakespearean production: "Twelfth Night" (Shakespeare Orange 
County, July). An Alice-in-Wonderland concept worked like looking-glass magic. 
The fairy-tale overlay (director Carl Reggiardo's steal from Lewis Carroll) 
brought whimsical charm to this production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Funniest show: "Inspecting Carol" by Daniel Sullivan and the Seattle Repertory 
Theatre (Laguna Playhouse's Moulton Theatre, November). This satirical Yuletide 
farce lampooned a down-at-the-heels drama troupe putting on its moth-eaten 
version of "A Christmas Carol." The first act was funny, the second act a 
scream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actors who gave terrific dramatic performances: Lynnda Ferguson and Nicholas 
Hormann (in "Hedda Gabbler"), Hal Landon Jr. ("Green Icebergs" and "Dancing at 
Lughnasa"), Robert Curtis-Brown ("Night and Her Stars" and "Green Icebergs"), 
Kandis Chappel ("Lettice & Lovage" and "Lughnasa"), Richard Doyle ("Playland" 
and "Later Life") and Kene Holliday ("Playland"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More actors who gave terrific dramatic performances: Jill A. Johnston (in 
"Later Life"), Ron Boussom ("A Christmas Carol" and "Later Life"), Patrick 
Breen and Peter Frechette ("Night and Her Stars"), Jim Norton ("Someone Who'll 
Watch Over Me"), Ron Campbell ("Strange Snow"), Daniel Bryan Cartmell ("King 
Lear"), Alan Schack ("M. Butterfly) and Jill Cary Martin ("The Crucible"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most likable storefront shtick: "Searching for Signs of Intelligent Life in 
the Universe" (Alternative Repertory Theatre, May). Though written for Lily 
Tomlin as a one-woman show, this revival split her many impersonations among 
several players and made imaginative use of the postage-stamp space. 
</P>

 Drum roll, please. Blast of trumpets. Curtain.

THE ART OF NEWS CASTING; FINDING RIGHT MIX OF ANCHORS, STYLE NOT THAT EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it the anchor? The content? Or Oprah Winfrey? Not even a coven of 
late-night psychic friends could figure this one out. And though local stations 
have been willing to lay out basketball player-sized contracts to lure name 
anchors away from the competition, general managers and news directors are 
loathe, if not downright unable, to pinpoint just what it is that makes news 
viewers watch one station over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anchors are a major factor. Good anchors who have audience appeal and 
longevity in the marketplace are extremely valuable, but they are just one key 
ingredient to making a broadcast successful," said Bill Applegate, general 
manager of KCBS-TV Channel 2. "I can put the most experienced, most wonderful 
anchors on a newscast, but if the broadcast isn't any good, it won't sustain 
itself. Or I can have a wonderful newscast, but without the right anchors, it 
won't work. You need both. But you can't buy rating points. You can't go across 
the street and spend X amount of dollars for an individual and have them walk 
across the street carrying a sackful of ratings points." 
</P>
<P>
 Which doesn't mean stations, including Applegate's, don't try anyway: 
</P>
<P>
 * KCAL-TV Channel 9 chose to launch its massive news operation five years ago 
by hiring Jerry Dunphy from KABC-TV Channel 7. Local news observers contend 
that Dunphy didn't bring many viewers with him right off the bat, but, slowly, 
the station's entire prime-time news operation has prospered. In head-to-head 
competition at 10 p.m., however, Dunphy is still a distant third. With his 
original five-year KCAL contract now expired, he has been reported to be 
negotiating with others, including Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two and a half years ago, KNBC-TV Channel 4 stunned the market with a bigger 
anchor coup, paying around $1.4 million a year to steal Paul Moyer from KABC. 
Moyer had little immediate impact, and KABC remained No. 1 without him. 
Recently, however, KNBC has easily triumphed in the all-important 11 p.m. news 
battle.  
</P>
<P>
 * Early this year, John Beard, disgusted by what he called the sleazy and 
irresponsible direction of KNBC's newscast and certainly his diminished role as 
second banana to Moyer, took a 50% pay cut to jump to KTTV-TV Channel 11. The 
Fox-owned station's news numbers have been up as much as 40% ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * Then this summer, KCBS, the also-ran of the local news scene for the last 15 
years, made KABC anchor Ann Martin the richest broadcaster in L.A. history with 
a contract that pays her close to $2 million a year. Though several other 
factors, including a strong showing by CBS in prime time and a much-hyped 
series with Judge Lance Ito contributed too, the station's ratings soared in 
last month's sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 * KABC, meanwhile, having lost arguably three of the star anchors in the 
market (KTLA's Hal Fishman, who has kept Channel 5 in first place at 10 p.m. 
for more than a decade, is probably the only other of equal stature) survives 
nonetheless. Although it had a serious problem at 11 p.m. last month, it again 
won the 4 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, KCOP-TV Channel 13, the other VHF station in the market, spent a 
fortune over the last several years to build a state-of-the-art news 
department, but it was unable to entice any of L.A.'s star anchors to serve as 
its centerpiece. Hamstrung by that and other failures, the entire effort has 
been a ratings disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the issue is that you've got a very cluttered environment with more 
stations doing news here than anywhere else, and so it takes longer to 
establish who your people (anchors) are, particularly if they come from out of 
town," said Jose Rios, news director at Channel 11. "So it's always more 
attractive to get someone who is already in the market, who you think has 
credibility. One of the wonderful things about John Beard was that people knew 
him here, they like him, they trust him. That does translate into more viewers, 
but how many, I just can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Beard, KTTV's 10 p.m. newscast jumped close to 40% last month over the 
previous year. Some of that is because of him, some because the entire newscast 
is better, and some of it is simply that on many nights, the newscast benefits 
from a large lead-in from Fox's prime-time programs like "X-Files," according 
to Jeff Wald, news director at KCOP, who just announced his resignation after 
more than 4 1/2 years there. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Beard is giving KTLA a run for its money for the first time in a long 
while, but it's not just him. That whole newscast is significantly better," 
Wald said. "The anchor is certainly important. We wanted to get some big-name 
anchors (specifically Hal Fishman and Christine Lund) here at KCOP and we were 
unsuccessful and that set us back. But it's not the only thing. Fox lead-ins 
have really helped KTTV." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2, which traditionally has lagged behind Channels 4 and 7 in promoting 
its newscasts, stunted and promoted itself extensively during the November 
sweeps, according to Rios, a former news boss at Channel 2. While Martin's 
arrival certainly energized the station's 11 p.m. news to almost double its 
rather low mark of the previous year -- a jump high enough to put it ahead of 
KABC and into second place -- even Applegate notes that KCBS' six-part 
interview with Judge Ito contributed mightily to that improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to quantify what an individual anchor brings to a broadcast," 
Applegate said. "Our ratings are up considerably, and as much of an asset as 
Ann Martin is, you can't attribute all of that to her. There are so many other 
factors, and we have an entirely different newscast on the air. For a few years 
we were pretty much a crime-laden, tabloid broadcast that wasn't very 
substantive. Now we're journalistically better." 
</P>
<P>
 "Applegate is a very savvy general manager when it comes to news, and the Ito 
interview was a brilliant promotional strategy," Wald said. "Getting Ann Martin 
was smart, just like Channel 4 going after Paul Moyer was smart. It puts them 
on the map, shows finally that Channel 2 is serious. It's arguable whether they 
overpaid her, but she is a top talent, and now they have to figure out a way to 
fit their cast of characters and the kind of news they do around her." 
</P>
<P>
 Moyer's impact initially was rather minimal because he just didn't seem to fit 
into the Channel 4 mold, Rios said. First he was teamed with newcomer Wendy 
Tokuda, and when that failed to produce results, KNBC paired him with familiar 
veterans Colleen Williams at 5 p.m. and Kelly Lange at 11 p.m. It was only 
then, Rios believes, as the show was molded to fit Moyer's style of delivery, 
that ratings started to go up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it takes a while for viewers to get used to seeing an old favorite 
among new people on a different set. Moyer was at KABC for 13 years, following 
a previous stint at KNBC in the '70s; Martin for 18. Wald believes in some kind 
of intangible comfort factor -- that, for example, KCBS anchor Linda Alvarez 
was far more effective at KNBC simply because viewers were accustomed to her 
there, and she melded well with the broadcast and the other personalities 
there. Sometimes it can backfire on the new station, he said, with viewers 
seeing the anchor as some kind of "greedy turncoat." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Black, KNBC's general manager, claims that Moyer has helped expand the 
station's appeal to the most-prized news audience, adults 25 to 54 years old. 
She praises him as an "extraordinary addition" to the station, but she resists 
giving him the lion's share of the credit, stating that he's just that, an 
addition, "a truly excellent" cog in a complicated, collaborative machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a team effort, and one person can't make a newscast." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they've lost many of their stars in the last few years, can KABC, the 
dominant news station in this market for most of the last two decades, still 
thrive? KABC's general manager did not return phone calls to comment, but the 
consensus among competitors is that in the afternoon, as long as the station 
has "The Oprah Winfrey Show," it will retain its cushy lead. "Oprah" nearly 
triples the audience of its competitors on Channels 2 and 4, providing KABC 
with a great advantage in the 2 1/2-hour news block that follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Much also depends on the "bench strength." The station still employs familiar 
faces in Christine Lund and Harold Greene. "They might have some (ratings) 
problems, but they are still a well-oiled machine, with a very good newscast 
and some very good people, and they've had that for a long time," Wald said. 
"It's what Channel 2 really is trying to emulate because they've always had the 
exact opposite -- a very checkered career in covering the news with a news 
director and format du jour. Now they seem to be on the right road, but let's 
see if they stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said KCBS' Applegate: "We have languished in third for years, and it's going 
to take a long time for us to surpass the competition. But some of our gains 
already came at the expense of KABC. It's hard to say if losing all those 
people is going to impact them dramatically, but conventional wisdom will tell 
you that if you lose several of your key anchors in a short time, that's got to 
hurt you."

MOVIE REVIEW; LOACH'S 'LADYBIRD': AN UNRELENTING VIEW OF MISERY; DIRECTOR'S 
SEMI-DOCUMENTARY STYLE FRAMES THE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO LOSES SIX OF HER 
CHILDREN TO THE STATE AUTHORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Loach's "Ladybird, Ladybird" is so unrelievably grim that it's remarkable 
the filmmakers had the strength to get on with it. It's not an inspirational 
downer or a call-to-action. Even though it's based on a true story, it's not 
even an expose. 
</P>
<P>
 The horror story of a woman, Maggie (Crissy Rock), who loses six of her 
children to the state authorities is almost too painful to experience. Loach, 
and his screenwriter, Rona Munro, don't attempt to distance the audience from 
the pain. They don't even try to modulate it. It's just there on the screen, 
like a thick, suffocating fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach is perhaps the least compromising -- and least commercial -- of major 
British directors. It's not just his use of non-actors and newcomers, or his 
semi-documentary style, or his guerrilla left-wing political sympathies. Loach 
doesn't offer audiences a helping hand, and that can sometimes seem like a 
rebuff. With "Ladybird, Ladybird," the rebuff at least makes stylistic sense -- 
it places us in the same trapped, enraged position as Maggie. 
</P>
<P>
 Her character is not softened or sentimentalized for us. Rock, a Liverpool 
stand-up comedian acting in her first movie, gives her an ornery, block-like 
force. She has been battered by a series of men -- the four children she takes 
care of at the beginning of the movie all have different fathers -- but she's 
something of a battering ram herself. All the punishment she has received has 
given her a chunky fortitude. She's wary not only of other people but of 
herself -- of her ability to feel anything. 
</P>
<P>
 When she meets Jorge (Vladimir Vega), a Paraguayan refugee, in a pub, his 
doting unconditional tenderness is like an affront to her. Jorge is almost too 
good to be true: He needs a reason to love and Maggie is it. It takes her most 
of the movie to recognize his goodness. In other words, it takes that long for 
her to comprehend her own goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie's long slide with the social service authorities in west London begins 
when one of her sons is accidentally burned at the women's shelter where she is 
holing up. Because she left the boy unattended with her other children, and 
because she has in the past exposed them to domestic violence, the state takes 
them away from her. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a vicious cycle: The more enraged Maggie becomes at what the authorities 
have perpetrated, the more they regard her as dangerously unfit for motherhood. 
When she and Jorge have children of their own, the same cycle is repeated. Did 
Dickens ever dream up anything this ghoulish? 
</P>
<P>
 But Loach, for all his docu-realism, isn't quite the even-handed chronicler he 
pretends to be. When Maggie and Jorge first make love, for example, the 
soundtrack tinkles with soft guitars and pan-pipes. The social service types, 
especially the judges, are mostly implacable. Surely, they must have felt in 
their own minds that what they were doing was best for the children. But Loach 
doesn't extend his sympathies to them. To do so would be to disrupt the film's 
neat arrangement of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 It may appear that we are getting a more "real" take on life with Loach, but 
his realism lacks the flavors that give drama its richness. Nobody in 
"Ladybird, Ladybird," not even Maggie, grows very much in the course of the 
film. Their unvarying quality is probably meant to be taken as mythic -- these 
people are acting out a primal drama in which the drama is much more pertinent 
than the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of "Ladybird, Ladybird" is inseparable from its weaknesses. Loach 
brings us up close to the misery but, in a larger sense, he stands back.

WILL THE CENTER SAVE THE DAY?; ARTS: ALTHOUGH THE FACILITY HAS NOT BEEN 
APPROACHED, ITS PRESIDENT SAYS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP CONTINUE A COUNTYWIDE 
SCHOOL PROGRAM.

 The Orange County Performing Arts Center may help maintain a public school 
arts program threatened by the county bankruptcy, center president Tom 
Tomlinson said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, already expanding their community outreach and education programs 
to an unprecedented degree, center officials have increased their education 
budget by about 30% and are co-commissioning a children's ballet with a local 
troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bridge to Angel Island," about a Chinese family's immigration to the 
United States, is being commissioned with and for Ballet Pacifica of Laguna 
Beach for the center's "From the Center" outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the program has been funded about 50-50 by the center and 
participating county public schools. Some 350 performances by local groups are 
scheduled in 250 schools in 1995, but with school districts standing to lose 
millions as a result of the bankruptcy, cuts in such programs are being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson said that if the schools cannot continue to pay their share, the 
center "may be required, if we want to continue those programs, to fund them to 
a greater extent than we do already. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fund-raising climate doesn't change significantly, and there's a real 
need in the community . . . we might be able to identify funding." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the privately funded center has not been asked to help out and 
stressed that any funding it chipped in toward the program would be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the real problems could be if we . . . begin to be looked to to 
provide basic (arts) education services," he said. "That's not our job. We're 
not educators, and we don't pretend to be, and we don't want to be. That's the 
job and the province of the school districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, according to center spokesman Gregory Patterson, "The Bridge to 
Angel Island" is the first dance piece the center has co-commissioned, the 
first piece of any kind it has commissioned for outreach, and it marks the 
center's first such partnership with Ballet Pacifica, an emerging regional 
professional troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet Pacifica initiated the talks that led to the collaboration, according 
to its outreach coordinator, Jewel Tweten-Donnelly. The center's participation 
is part of an effort by Tomlinson, who replaced original center director Thomas 
R. Kendrick in 1993, to "place a greater emphasis on the center's education and 
community programs," Patterson said. The education budget, which climbs to 
$631,600 as of the new fiscal year, starting Sunday, is enough to meet the 
center's customary share of 200 additional "From the Center" performances, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute ballet for four, with a new score to come from a composer to be 
named, will be choreographed by Sylvia Turner, dance department chairwoman at 
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. Tweten-Donnelly said Ballet Pacifica will 
spend about $5,000 on the work. The center will chip in about $1,500, three 
times the usual amount it gives to "From the Center" groups, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tweten-Donnelly said Ballet Pacifica will premiere "The Bridge to Angel 
Island" during the 1996 Imagination Celebration, a children's arts festival 
sponsored by the center and the Orange County Department of Education, and will 
add the dance to its own outreach repertory to be performed during annual 
children's concerts at the Festival Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's only previous co-commission was with the Debussy Trio, for a 
classical work by jazz composer and keyboardist Lyle Mays, which premiered in 
the center's Founders Hall last month. In 1990, the center co-produced a 
revival of the musical "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" with 
the La Jolla Playhouse.

 Record Concert Sales: Confirming earlier estimates, lucrative tours by the 
Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and the Eagles made 1994 the richest year ever for 
the concert industry. According to a report out Thursday in Pollstar, the 
industry's most respected trade magazine, a record $1.4 billion was spent on 
concert tickets this year, shattering the previous record of $1.1 billion spent 
in 1991. The Stones topped all other tours, taking in $121.2 million from 60 
North American concerts to make their "Voodoo Lounge" tour the richest ever. 
They broke their own record of $98 million, set during the last Stones tour in 
1989. Second was Pink Floyd with ticket sales of $103.5 million, followed by 
the Eagles with $79.4 million, Barbra Streisand with $58.9 million and the 
Grateful Dead with $52.4 million. Last year, the Dead topped Pollstar's list 
with $43 million in ticket sales.

carried locally on KROQ-FM (106.7), will be broadcast from a private studio in 
Seattle. The band, whose latest album, "Vitalogy," went over the 2 million mark 
in sales this week, will perform live acoustic sets, as well as take phone 
calls from fans via an 800 number that will be announced during the show. In 
addition, special guests are expected to drop by for the broadcast and may join

 Another Controversial Kiss: A national advocacy group dedicated to promoting 
"traditional family values" is asking NBC not to show a lesbian kiss in its 
upcoming movie "Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story." The New 
York-based group's chairman, Howard Hurwitz, said he wrote the network warning 
that there would be advertiser fallout if the kiss is aired. The film stars 
Glenn Close as the highest-ranking military officer ever to be discharged from 
service because of sexual orientation and Judy Davis as her lover. Close and 
Barbra Streisand are among the executive producers for the film, which is 
scheduled to air Feb. 6. NBC officials could not be reached to comment on the 
letter.

 Does She Know the Way to San Jose?: Dionne Warwick's "Psychic Friends" is the

second was "Dura Lube," an infomercial for an auto engine oil additive; third 
was the Jane Fonda-hosted "Fitness Tread"; fourth was Barbara DeAngelis' 
"Making Love Work" and fifth was the "Popeil Pasta Maker" infomercial. The 
rankings are based upon the frequency of airing, longevity and the amount spent

 Ideas Not Included: Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas ("Basic Instinct") doesn't have 
to share profits with his ex-wife for story ideas hatched during their 24-year 
marriage, a Northern California judge has ruled. Gerri Eszterhas had sued 
Hollywood's highest-paid screenwriter over some 50 story ideas conceived before 
their separation last year. Arguing that such ideas are community property, she 
sought a share of Eszterhas' take from two current projects, "One Night Stand" 
and "Foreplay," for which Eszterhas got $3.5 million. However, Superior Court 
Judge Michael Dufficy ruled that "as a matter of law, an idea is not property."

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; FORGET BARNEY -- MAKE WAY FOR TOTORO, BRUM AND HOBO

<P>
 Let's see. There are the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Barney, the Muppets and 
Thomas the Tank Engine. There are Disney characters of all shapes and species. 
What starts out big on TV or in the movies eventually is big in children's 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 For those hoping to introduce new stars into this lucrative market, the 
challenge is to capture the imaginations of children whose hearts and minds are 
already actively consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some video companies are looking overseas in search of the Next Big Thing. But 
will kids here receive a magical furry creature, a spunky miniature antique 
auto, a free-spirited German shepherd and an ecologically aware dragon, just 
because they are favorites in Japan, England and Canada? For Totoro, Brum, Hobo 
and Dudley to put down roots in America, critical support and name recognition 
are musts. 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo is enjoying bestseller success with "My Neighbor Totoro," the 
English-dubbed feature about Japan's beloved animated forest spirit. The title 
was helped by a theatrical release and good reviews, followed by an aggressive 
ad campaign pitched to parents and video retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies without Fox's resources are starting from scratch with 
characters that have had minimal exposure to American audiences. Random House 
Home Video likens Britain's Brum -- a resourceful little car who motors into 
comical adventures -- to Thomas the Tank Engine. The target audience is ages 
2-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Brum's debut in 1991 on England's BBC television, the series has won 
film festival awards and motored to video bestseller status in Australia. 
Paving the way for its American video debut, Random House rolled out Brum in 
1993 in three books. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, said a spokesperson, was "to get the videos reviewed in as many 
places as possible. Then people recognize the name and start to look for it in 
stores." "Brum" earned a grade of B-plus from Entertainment Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Though priced at $9.95 each, "Brum to the Rescue," "Brum and the Little Girl 
Lost," "Brum and the Bank Robbers" and "Brum and the Baby Carriage" have been 
geared for the rental market. Even so, the company is struggling to reach the 
parents who pay and the kids who watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon Home Video's release of "The Littlest Hobo" is also geared to the 
rental market, selling for $89.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Littlest Hobo" contains two episodes from an award-winning live-action 
Canadian television series in which Hobo, a sort of canine Richard Kimble, 
drifts into a different adventure. The series went off the air in the mid-1980s 
but is still seen in that country in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 "A title unfamiliar to the general public may sit shrink-wrapped on the 
shelves and not get the exposure," said James Russo, Falcon's vice president of 
marketing. "We're using the video store like a TV channel as an avenue of 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Also of Canadian origin, "Dudley Finds His Home" and "Dudley's Tea Party" are 
being sold by Goodtimes Home Video ($19.95). The series premiered a year ago on 
Canada's public broadcasting stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley, who awakens after a 100-year nap and explores the mysteries of nature 
with 10-year-olds Sally and Matt, is being marketed as a "Barney: The Next 
Generation" for children ages 3-6.

FINDING ART IN THE DESPAIR OF CUBAN REFUGEES; EXHIBITIONS: AS MORE RAFTS FIND 
THEIR WAY INTO GALLERIES, ARTISTS AND CURATORS STRUGGLE WITH PRESENTATION OF A 
PRIMITIVE CRAFT USED TO ESCAPE A COMMUNIST REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the window of a storefront art gallery, the work on exhibit still drips 
with desperation. Strewn about the tiny plywood deck are plastic water bottles, 
a Russian-made medicine jar, a worn pair of shoes, a rusted knife blade, sand 
and seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 The tattered sail is tied to the mast with intravenous tubing apparently 
scavenged from a hospital. The hull is carved from plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rafts are like antiquarian African masks," said Cesar Trasobares, an 
artist and curator. "They are inventive, creative means of escape. They were 
not intended to be art. Yet it is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after the end of a ragtag exodus in which about 40,000 people set 
sail from Cuba on an array of flimsy homemade vessels, the rafts are being 
displayed in South Florida art galleries, snapped up by museums for their 
permanent collections and even used as dramatic centerpieces for social events 
and fund-raisers. The Cuban rafts have become poignant symbols in an exile 
community obsessed with the fate of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly viewed as a mix of art and artifact, the rafts have become 
valuable. Private collectors have rushed in. One man has more than 500 rafts, 
ranging from single truck-tire inner tubes covered with canvas to elaborate 
constructions of plastic foam, wood and metal that may have ferried 20 or more 
people across the Straits of Florida. He hopes to build a raft museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But other South Florida residents, not all of them Cuban American, also have 
preserved rafts as mementos of a tumultuous chapter in local history and the 
continuing Cuban diaspora touched off by Fidel Castro's rise to power on the 
island 36 years ago next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real people were on these things, fighting for their lives, for freedom," 
said collector Finlay B. Matheson, who has four rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer's chaotic exodus from Cuba and the unresolved fate of about 30,000 
rafters being held in U.S. detention camps have stirred deep emotions in Miami. 
But the rafts themselves have rekindled an impassioned debate on a conundrum as 
old as civilization: What is art? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take a raft and isolate it, it can be as much a work of art as African 
sculpture, for example," said Marcia Morgado, who -- with her husband, artist 
Juan Abreu -- last year published a book of glossy photographs of rafts. "And I 
presume that they will become valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time, there should be no exchange of money for these rafts. 
They are not ours. They are the patrimony of the Cuban people, a part of our 
history. Many people have died. These rafts should be a reminder that this 
should never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 No one admits to either buying or selling rafts, although one businessman who 
displayed a Cuban balsa in a fountain outside his Miami Beach store this fall 
says that a New York record company executive offered him $5,000 for the 
vessel. The offer was refused and the raft donated to a south Florida museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The raft or boat has long been a familiar icon in the works of such 
established Cuban exile painters as Luis Cruz Azaceta, Carlos Cardenas and 
Margarita Cano. But in recent years, as the number of Cubans fleeing the 
economically troubled island has surged, the balsa and the balseros who sailed 
them have re-emerged in works by scores of younger Cuban artists, both in the 
United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 For next month's Art Miami '95 exposition, one exile artist, Juan-Si, has 
planned a large installation, centered on a raft, called "The Islanders' 
Obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Several current Miami exhibitions featuring rafts and images of rafts were 
opened this month to coincide with the 34-nation Summit of the Americas. Among 
those exhibitions are "Diaspora," a selection of Azaceta's work, and "Exodus," 
a melange of artworks that includes an authentic raft as well as paintings by 
Juan Abreu, Jose Bedia and Ana Mendieta. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Havana Biennial earlier this year, Cuban artist Kcho (Alexis Leyra) 
created a huge installation in which he fashioned dozens of little rafts from 
such everyday objects as shoes, toys and driftwood. Both the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington and Mexico City's Museum of Contemporary Art are 
exploring exhibitions of rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics and collectors say that the image of the raft is now in such 
vogue among Cuban artists that its power has become diluted. "The image of the 
rafter is a symbol of the desperation of the Cuban people," says prominent 
Miami art collector Ramon Cernuda. "But in art, is it a fashion or a true 
expression of anguish?" 
</P>
<P>
 Overworked or not, the raft as symbol is rooted in both Cuban myth and 
reality. Cuba's patron saint, Our Lady of Charity, is said to have appeared to 
three fishermen adrift at sea, guiding them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of the raft is part of our national consciousness and a part of our 
religious iconography since day one," said art historian Ileana Fuentes, a 
Rutgers University professor recently named executive director of Miami's Cuban 
Museum of Arts and Culture. "For me, rafts are a symbol of bridges that don't 
exist in an island. The island itself is a raft." 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans climbing aboard a makeshift raft and hoping to drift to Florida as a 
means of escaping the communist island is not a new phenomenon. The first 
rafter known to have made it arrived in 1964. And, under a communist regime 
that prohibits ordinary citizens from leaving the country for any reason, 
fleeing the island by boat has been an option of last resort that thousands 
have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 The size and inventiveness of the rafts and the sheer suicidal courage of the 
people who get on them long has been a source of wonder and admiration on this 
side of the Florida Straits. Over the years, Cubans have made the crossing -- 
which, at its shortest point, is 90 miles -- astride plastic pool toys, in the 
overturned roof of a truck and standing up on a sailboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rafters are young men. But thousands of women and children have 
come too. And in Miami, oft-told tales of heroic endurance and terror at sea 
have become legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the rafts were fashioned from inner tubes, often topped with 
canvas or burlap and smeared with grease in hopes of repelling sharks. The 
materials to build them were scavenged, stolen, assembled in secret and hauled 
to the beach at night. 
</P>
<P>
 As this summer's exodus gained intensity, however, the rafts became larger and 
more sophisticated. By mid-August, when it became clear that Castro had 
withdrawn border guards from the beaches and was allowing the balseros to 
leave, the Cubans' long-repressed entrepreneurial spirit took over and 
professional raft-builders opened shop. In beachfront towns such as Cojimar, 
sturdy vessels made from 55-gallon oil drums welded together were selling for 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the first of the year and mid-August, more than 7,000 balseros landed 
in Florida and immediately were granted refugee status. But on Aug. 19, the 
Clinton Administration said it had had enough. A naval blockade was established 
off the Cuban coast, and more than 30,000 rafters were picked up and taken to 
the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba's southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard pulled Cubans from the rafts, many of the 
vessels were burned or sunk. Many of those that washed up on Florida's shores 
were hauled to landfills. But the appearance of crude rafts on beaches 
populated by sunbathing tourists stirred the public's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Cuban rafts were named, and fewer still have showed any decorative 
touches. Nonetheless, "this community is so shaken by rafting," says Fuentes, 
"and if you think of art as anything that a person creates, they are art." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the one that Steve Rhodes found abandoned in September was created 
more than just as transportation. It had a name, the Tio B (Uncle B) painted on 
the side, a hammered sheet of tin over the bow, and an unusual triangular 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes salvaged the raft from an uninhabited island south of Miami and 
installed it in a fountain outside his Miami Beach import store and restaurant. 
There it became a popular attraction, garnering publicity and eventually a 
monetary value. The New Yorker who offered $5,000 for the Tio B reportedly 
wanted to use it in a music promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," said Rhodes, who sells Asian and Indonesian artifacts, "that raft was 
conceptual art at least. It had a very distinctive shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it certainly got people talking. People would sit here drinking 
cappuccino and wondering who had made it and what it must have been like at 
sea."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The nexus of rafts and art was first explored by Coral Gables gallery owner 
Fredric B. Snitzer in 1991 when he mounted an exhibition called "They Would 
Rather Die." In addition to displaying several paintings and a 30-minute 
documentary film dealing with the rafter theme, Snitzer also borrowed eight 
rafts -- chiefly made of inner tubes and canvas -- and hung them on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction was mixed. Along with praise for calling attention to the rafters' 
plight, Snitzer also was criticized for making objets d'art of the detritus of 
human suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three years later, Snitzer said he remains convinced that the rafts are 
works of art. "It's complicated," he said. "Art functions in provocative ways. 
The rafts push what we think of as art and that's healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they are also coffins. They should never be sold. These rafts have to be 
separated from the commercial because of their sad and serious human 
implications. But they can be looked at as art and as tragic political 
artifacts. And one enhances the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The rafts that Snitzer hung on the walls, as well as seven others recently 
displayed at a downtown Miami exhibition mounted by a coalition of Cuban exile 
groups, came from the collection of Humberto Sanchez, a Cuban-born service 
supervisor for a Miami car dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 What became Sanchez's calling began seven years ago when he came upon a single 
life jacket while fishing in the ocean. Moved to begin preserving what he saw 
as the relics of a dramatic era in Cuban history, he contacted the Coast Guard, 
which agreed to give him rafts that otherwise might be destroyed. In two rented 
warehouses and in borrowed space in an airplane hangar, Sanchez has more than 
500 rafts, as well as 5,000 personal items recovered with the vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez also raised $30,000 to build a monument to Cuban rafters lost at sea. 
Called "Liberty Column," the marble monument was unveiled in a downtown Miami 
park earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to make any money from such a sad story," said Sanchez, 40. 
"And if I found out that anyone was making money out of the suffering of the 
Cuban people, I would be the first to protest." 
</P>
<P>
 In a section of her book, "Raft," Morgado presents several rafts photographed 
against a stark white background. Removed from the water, the rafts look like 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgado says, however, that although "some of the rafts are artistic, they 
were not constructed as art. Perhaps 50 years down they road they might become 
art objects."

Q&A WITH CHICK HEARNS; BASKETBALL'S FAST-TALKING MASTER POET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Slam dunk," "air ball," "the mustard's off the hot dog," "no harm no foul" . 
. . in his 34 years as the only play-by-play announcer the Los Angeles Lakers 
have ever had, Chick Hearn has coined so many colorful -- and oft borrowed -- 
expressions that it wouldn't be a reach to call him the poet laureate of 
basketball broadcasting.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearn's rapid-fire delivery, keen descriptive prowess and innate feel for the 
game of basketball have earned him legendary status in the Southern California 
sports community. It's nearly impossible to imagine a Laker game without the 
Aurora, Ill., native providing his inimitable "words'-eye view" description. 
Amazingly, Hearn has not missed a Laker broadcast since Nov . 20, 1965 -- a 
streak that recently exceeded 2,700 straight games. In 1991 he became only the 
third radio/TV personality to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the Lakers' improved play this season, Hearn recently talked about 
his career, pro basketball and the art of play-by-play announcing.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Does your streak ever feel like a burden? Would it be nice to be 
able to take a night off when you're not feeling well? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, not now, because I'm eager to keep it going. I'm so eager that I 
would go to great lengths, which I have a couple of times in the last two 
years, to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the closest you've come to missing a game during the streak? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Last season I got up the morning of a home game and I couldn't talk. I went 
down to a very fine specialist in Beverly Hills about 11 a.m. He said, "There's 
no way you can go tonight. You haven't any voice." I said, "I've got to." So he 
worked with me all day. He treated me in his office. He gave me medicine. He 
called me every hour when I got home. It got better, but the doctor still 
didn't want me to do it. We did the game, suffice to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is broadcasting NBA basketball still as rewarding as it used to be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The dollar that's being paid the players has hurt the game. The players now 
take advantage of coaches. The players' attitude is, "I make more than you, so 
don't tell me what to do." That's not true with every player, but some of the 
fun has gone out of the game. Players are spoiled by charter airplanes, the 
finest hotels, a big per diem every day. So I wonder if all the players all of 
the time are thinking about the game or what they're going to be doing after 
the game. As long as they respond and do their job as well as management's 
doing their job, then there's nothing wrong because that's the way it is today. 
If you don't pay the guy $15 million for three years somebody else will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what is it that continues to make the NBA game so attractive to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The artistry of the players. The players are so good now, they can jump so 
high and run so fast. I believe the new rules that have been implemented this 
year have taken some of the thuggery out of the game. The finesse has been 
restored. Last year the people of America responded with a lack of desire to 
watch the playoffs or even the finals because nobody could make a hundred 
points. It was a matter of who would knock each other down the hardest. The TV 
ratings reflected it. They went down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You can be tough on Laker players who don't play up to par. Do players ever 
confront you over your on-air criticisms of them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. All I would have to say is, "Let's look at the (video) tape. Maybe I 
did make a mistake." They would say, "Oh no, we don't need to see the tape!" 
They know. Years ago when you were just doing radio they could (challenge you) 
if they wanted to. But I've never had it done. When you're doing a simulcast 
for every game, it's there, baby, on tape. You can see it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But clearly you want to see the Lakers do well, right? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure I want the Lakers to win. But I don't want people to know it any more 
than I have to, particularly out here in California. When we play the Celtics 
or the Knicks we have as many people at the Forum yelling for them as we do for 
the Lakers. This area is built up of people from all over. So you try to go 
down the middle of the road as much as you can. Just tell the facts. If Magic 
(Johnson) makes a bad pass, it's a bad pass. If he makes a great play, it's a 
great play. You use the same expression whether (Larry) Bird did it or somebody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were selected by NBC to announce some of the pay-per-view basketball 
games during the 1992 Olympics. But why haven't we seen more of you on national 
TV broadcasting basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Years ago, before the Lakers came to L.A., I did national TV for NBC 
(mostly announcing college sports). But at that time there wasn't much interest 
in professional basketball. When that interest did develop the New York people 
usually got the job. I don't know why or whether it's fair or unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 I was pleased that they selected me to do the Olympics. Being in the Hall of 
Fame, having a star on Hollywood Boulevard, getting every award I guess you can 
get as an announcer, that's satisfying enough. I'm not out for any 
self-acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do your expressions, the Chickisms, such as "slam dunk," "air ball" and 
the others, come to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They just pop out. If I tried to (manufacture them) I don't think I could 
put it across. One night I saw a guy make a wrap-around pass and it went up 
into the stands and knocked somebody's popcorn over. That's when I (came up 
with) "the mustard's off the hot dog." I saw a player bouncing the ball up and 
down and it reminded me of a kid with a yo-yo, so I came up with "yo-yoing up 
and down." There's a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about other broadcasters using your Chickisms? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I feel very badly. Anybody that has to reach like that is making a fool of 
himself. But you can't patent them. They're out and if they want to use them I 
guess it's their prerogative. I listen to games and I hear them all evening! 
The trouble is some of them don't know how to work them in. It doesn't quite 
come out right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you do to prepare for a game? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I do something that I don't think anyone else does. I warm up before a 
game. Baseball and basketball players warm up, so why shouldn't the announcer 
warm up? When I get to the Forum, I go up into the booth and sit and (call an 
imaginary game). If we're playing Houston that night, I'll say, "Olajuwon 
out-jumps Vlade, knocks it into the backcourt where it's saved by Smith," and 
so forth. I play about a quarter with myself. Then when the game comes I'm 
warmed up. Every name flows off the end of your tongue. I don't think that all 
of the announcers prepare enough. That's the whole thing: preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What type of approach do you take when you sit down to call a game? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I always like to pretend two things: one, I'm sitting in the seat beside 
you watching the game together. I'll say, "Wasn't that a great shot? Boy, it 
sure was." The other thing I do is pretend I'm talking to people who are 
non-sighted. I try to create a word picture. I get more mail from blind people 
thanking me. Radio is the art form of sportscasting. If you're any good, you 
can do a great job on radio. You're a little limited doing a simulcast because 
you have to take a little bit off of the radio report -- about 20% of verbiage 
comes off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were also the assistant general manager of the Lakers during the '70s. 
Is it true that you cast the deciding vote to draft Magic Johnson in 1979? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if it was the deciding vote, but I was adamant. My selling 
point was this guy's got the whole package, he can play offense, defense and 
he's 6'9." There was no guard in the league that big at that time. And he's a 
showman. I said, "They'll eat it up here in California, in Hollywood 
particularly." After I made my speech, Mr. Cooke (then-Laker owner Jack Kent 
Cooke) said, "That's it, it's Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do Laker general manager Jerry West and the coaching staff still solicit 
your advice on personnel matters? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I don't know if they pay any attention to them. They do ask, "What do 
you think of this guy? Do you think he can help us?" My first question is, 
"What do you have to give up to get him?" Because if you take a wheel off from 
the left side of the car you still have to fix your machine. You have to be 
really careful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What type of advice would you give to an aspiring play-by-play announcer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To be himself. Don't try to imitate Chick. Most people can't talk as fast 
as I do. I'm not proud of that. That's God-given. Create your own personality. 
But prepare, prepare, prepare until you're sick of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long do you plan to keep working? 
</P>
<P>
 A: As long as I enjoy it. I think Mr. Buss (team owner Jerry Buss) would give 
me that privilege. If this streak keeps going I don't know what I'd do! But 
it's not the streak that keeps me going. I just enjoy the game. I hope the 
Lakers can continue to improve. I'd like to be around when some of it comes to 
a real fruition either in another championship or heights that they seemingly 
used to enjoy every year. I think they're on the right track. I sincerely do. 
</P>

RESTAURANT NOTES: HERE ARE SOME YEAR-END TIDBITS WORTH CHEWING ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if you threw a party and no one came? That's how restaurateurs must have 
felt this year. Splashy openings were far and few between, business was still 
down and, after the earthquake, staying at home was more appealing than ever. 
Even the restless chef Robert Gadsby only switched kitchens twice. And when 
people did begin to venture out, they stuck with pasta, pizza, pasta, pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a few people managed to lighten things up. Visa persuaded Wolfgang Puck 
to forsake American Express at Spago and Granita and he reportedly got $1 
million for his well-advertised defection; mogul Marvin Davis threw in the 
towel and closed his Carnegie Deli about the same time New York's Barney 
Greengrass moved into town. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hollywood got into the act too. Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg 
debuted Dive!, the first of a soon-to-be series of submarine-themed 
restaurants, in Century City; Kevin and Cindy Costner teamed up with Michael 
Roberts and opened the giant, tented Twin Palms in Pasadena (who gets it in the 
divorce settlement?), and B.B. King brought blues and bad (you decide which 
meaning) barbecue to Universal CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps representing some greater meaning, the venerable Chasen's -- a 
Beverly Boulevard landmark for 58 years -- will close April 1 to be replaced by 
a shopping center, it was announced this week. ENDINGS

THESE VIDEOS SHOW -- AND TELL -- THE SCENES ON SCREEN; TELEVISION: A COMPANY 
PREPARES TV PROGRAMS AND FILMS FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGHT LIMITATIONS. TAPES PLAY ON 
A STANDARD VCR.

 "Blinking back tears, Ray hurries to pick up a ball and glove lying on the 
field. He swallows hard and throws. John smiles tenderly. . . . Their smiles 
grow wider as they throw the ball easily back and forth. . . . Light floods the 
field as father and son continue to toss the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional conclusion to "Field of Dreams" would be lost to those who are 
blind or visually impaired. Normally, all one hears on the soundtrack during 
this fantasy's ethereal climax is welling music and the thwack of a ball being 
caught in a glove. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to Descriptive Video Service, such Hollywood hits, as well as 
selected PBS broadcasts and special-interest programs, are now accessible on 
videocassette in described versions. Just as closed-captioning aids 
hearing-impaired viewers, so do described videos open up a new world of 
programming to those who are blind or have low vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Boston's PBS station WGBH, a closed-captioning pioneer, DVS first 
provided narrated descriptions of its television shows. DVS programs are 
available to those whose TV sets are equipped with a Second Audio Program 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 DVS videos, however, require no special equipment. The tapes play on a 
standard VCR. The only difference is the added narration describing the 
program's visual elements, such as physical action, scene changes, costumes, 
sets or body language, without interfering with dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating studios and distributors include Paramount Home Video, Disney's 
Buena Vista Home Video, MCA/Universal Home Video and Time Life Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the nearly 80 titles in the DVS catalogue are the PBS documentary series 
by Ken Burns, "The Civil War," and the films "The Addams Family," "Patriot 
Games," "Beethoven," "Parenthood," Disney's "Aladdin" and "Raiders of the Lost 
Ark." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing is an exacting art. "The most important thing," said describer 
Leslie Wu Foley, "is finding the best way to describe a scene's key visual 
element and convey it in a way that is informative but never judgmental or 
obtrusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Describers may watch a film several times, first without looking at the 
picture to locate gaps in the dialogue or plot. Along with cartoons, in which 
animated actions do not conform to the physical universe, sex scenes present 
their own unique challenges, as Foley discovered when she was assigned "Fatal 
Attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to break the sex scenes down into physical actions and convey the 
sensuousness of what was going on," she said. Thus, Michael Douglas doesn't 
just kiss Glenn Close. Instead, his mouth "slides" down her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers have been supportive. "I thought it would be ridiculous," said 
"Field of Dreams" director and screenwriter Phil Alden Robinson. "But I loved 
what they did. The description was sensitively and tastefully done." 
</P>
<P>
 * Suggested retail prices start at $14.95. For a demonstration of DVS or to

ARDENT IS THE PERFECT WORD FOR FANNY ARDANT; MOVIES: THE FRENCH ACTRESS MAY BE 
UNFAMILIAR TO AMERICANS, BUT 'COLONEL CHABERT' -- IN WHICH SHE IS REUNITED WITH 
GERARD DEPARDIEU -- MAY CHANGE THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the course of an interview at Manhattan's chic Paramount Hotel, French 
actress Fanny Ardant twice mimics a dog. The first time, it serves as 
punctuation to a spirited defense of the cunning Countess Ferraud, the 
character she plays in "Colonel Chabert," the new Gerard Depardieu film set in 
19th-Century France, which opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a self-made woman," Ardant says in thick-accented English about the 
prostitute-turned-countess whose aristocratic world is suddenly thrown into 
jeopardy by the return of her first husband (Depardieu), long thought to be 
dead. "She shows herself stronger than she is, but she is not to be like a dog 
following the rules of society." 
</P>
<P>
 The second time comes when she is talking about her choice of a college 
thesis, a defense of anarchy written for a political science degree. "I chose 
anarchy," she says, smiling at her youthful rebellion. "Everyone else was 
choosing this party or that party, this system or that system. But power comes 
from the individual, not from some party. It is terrible to be told what to do, 
what to think, like a dog. I would hate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardant certainly needn't worry about ever being confused with the dumb 
obedience associated with man's best friend. For one thing, she cuts much too 
striking and sensuous a figure in her chic convent-girl outfit: mid-calf black 
jumper over a white blouse, her dark tresses falling over a swan neck. For 
another she exudes the same vitality that the late director Francois Truffaut 
-- who introduced her to film audiences in 1981 with his movie "The Woman Next 
Door" -- claimed to have been bewitched by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seduced by her large mouth, her large black eyes, her triangular face," 
the famous director said when he first spotted her in a 1979 French television 
miniseries. "I immediately recognized in her the qualities I most often expect 
in my protagonists: vitality, enthusiasm, humor, intensity -- but also . . . a 
taste for secrets, a wild side, a hint of savagery, and above all something 
vibrant." 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration between Truffaut and Ardant would yield another film, 
"Confidentially Yours," and a daughter, now 11. (She has two other daughters, 
19 and 5 1/2.) Although the well-known European actress went on to work with 
such stellar directors as Volker Schlondorff ("Swann in Love"), Alain Resnais 
("Life Is a Bed of Roses") and Costa-Gavras ("Family Lawyer"), American 
audiences have had few opportunities to see Ardant's work. "Colonel Chabert" 
may change that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Honore de Balzac's novel, the Yves Angelo film paints a compelling 
portrait of a shrewish, calculating woman caught in a vortex between two men in 
post-Napoleonic France. Money and love are the glue that cements the whore, 
Rose Chapotel, and the dashing Chabert, who wins her in a card game. Money and 
power bind Rose and her Count Ferraud (Andre Dussollier) after Chabert's 
"death" in battle leaves her wealthy enough to buy a precarious perch in French 
society. When the colonel returns to reclaim his wife, the stakes of their 
dangerous games grow considerably higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The materialistic countess Ferraud -- as grand and aristocratic as only a 
one-time whore can be -- is cloaked in the movie with more ambiguity and moral 
contradictions than in Balzac's book, to the delight of the woman who plays 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is greedy, a crook, a liar, but I like her very much," says the actress, 
a voracious reader who'd become acquainted with the book in her youth. "When 
you earn your life on your back, you understand where every penny comes from. 
But she is not ashamed of her past, and she is a very smart business woman. She 
invests the wealth Chabert leaves her, putting it into factories at a time when 
the opportunities for women were very limited. In that way, she is a very 
modern woman, a fantastic American woman!" 
</P>
<P>
 If Ardant is somewhat in awe of the entrepreneurial and independent spirit of 
American women, it is partly because of an upbringing in Monte Carlo that she 
describes as "very bourgeois and very classical." The youngest of five children 
born to a French military officer and his wife, Ardant was packed off to 
convent schools at an early age. She completely rejected the bourgeois 
lifestyle in favor of a Bohemian free-spiritedness that ran afoul of her strict 
mother who worried about the neighbors' gossip. Having three children out of 
wedlock no doubt has kept the tongues wagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monte Carlo was all playboys and very well-coiffed ladies, and my response to 
everything was 'No,' " she says. " 'Do you want to dance?' 'No.' 'Do you want 
to come with me?' 'No.' I thought I will never be a wife, never follow a 
husband, never do a boring job just to make money. I think, maybe now I was a 
little stupid. At my mother's home, you open the cupboards and everything is in 
order, sheets fresh and clean and perfectly ironed. I see this and I want to be 
a child again." 
</P>
<P>
 After college she began studying acting in Paris and was quickly playing the 
classics onstage, which eventually led to her role in the five-part World War I 
television drama "Women of the Coast." The fateful letter from Truffaut 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a concourse of shyness when we met," Ardant says. But they clicked, 
and Truffaut wrote his next film expressly for her, "The Woman Next Door." Her 
dark and sensual talents were showcased in the role of a woman on the verge who 
resumes an affair with a married man (Depardieu) to disastrous consequences. It 
brought her international attention, another film with Truffaut, and a 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ardant refuses to discuss her personal life (when asked who fathered her 
other two daughters, she smiles sweetly and says with a shrug, "Who knows?"), 
the actress praises Truffaut as a true romantic artist who influenced her with 
his generous and democratic spirit. "He taught me that it was not your 
profession that defined you but the passion that you put into it. For Truffaut, 
the film set was the most important place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardant claims the same generosity and passion for Depardieu, with whom she is 
reunited on screen for the first time in 13 years. "Like Chabert, Depardieu is 
a peasant," she says. "So his feet are rooted in the earth and his head is in 
the clouds. That makes him a genius. He is poetic and pragmatic, sensual and a 
little boy, sweet and suddenly like a bull." 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same might be said of Ardant, despite her middle-class roots. When 
she returns to Paris, where she lives with her three daughters, the actress 
begins rehearsals for a Marguerite Duras play, "La Musica." The stage is her 
real passion, "because I love the word," she says. "In the theater I want to 
sing, to fly. I don't want to say, 'Pass the salt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ardant says she knew she was destined for theater early on because she could 
never keep her mouth shut when she was reading books around the house. "If I am 
reading something that I loved, like 'Madame Bovary' or Henry Miller or (F. 
Scott) Fitzgerald, I would shout out sections of the book to my sisters, 
because when something is beautiful, you must share it with someone else, no? I 
am very primitive that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardant's enthusiasm for film is equally infectious and, by her own admission, 
naive. "Orson Welles' 'Magnificent Ambersons' . . . formidable!" she trills at 
one point. "And Woody Allen, and his 'Hannah and Her Sisters,' it gives me 
energy to live when I see a film like that. You are thinking before, 'Oh my 
life, it is such a disaster.' But then you see this movie and suddenly, your 
life is in focus. And then you think, 'Yes, it is a disaster, but it is my 
life, and I am going to live it!' This I learned too, first from my father and 
then from Truffaut: Life is a flying carpet. You take it and just go!"

JAZZ NOTES: NEW YEAR RELEASES WILL GIVE FANS PLENTY TO CELEBRATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the holidays are coming to a close, jazz fans still have something to 
celebrate. There's a bumper crop of CDs -- both new releases and reissues -- 
headed our way in the first three months of the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, look for new albums by McCoy Tyner, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Childs, 
Gonzalo Rubalcaba and debuts by Jacky Terrason and Christian McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyner, the renowned pianist, plays live at Sweet Basil's in New York on an 
Evidence release, and drummer DeJohnette's latest Special Edition album on Blue 
Note explores freer realms of jazz with performances by singer Bobby McFerrin 
and saxman Gary Thomas. Rubalcaba's "Diz" (Blue Note) finds the Cuban pianist 
lighting a torch to jazz classics such as "Hot House," and Childs' invigorating 
contemporary style enlivens "I've Known Rivers," featuring saxman Bob Sheppard 
and singer Dianne Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrason, the 1993 winner of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz 
competition, uses his trio to investigate both standards, such as "I Love 
Paris," and originals; and bassist McBride (he can be heard through Sunday with 
Joshua Redman at Catalina Bar & Grill) is aided by such notables as Redman, Roy 
Hargrove and Cyrus Chestnut on his long-awaited debut outing for Verve. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the January reissues include "Charlie Parker With Strings: The Master 
Takes" (Verve); "Conjure: Music for the Texts of Ismael Reed" (American Clave), 
with Kenny Kirkland, David Murray, Carla Bley, et al.; and Clifford Brown and 
Max Roach, "Alone Together: Best of the Mercury Years." 
</P>
<P>
 The much talked-about "Rush Hour" (Blue Note) pits saxman Joe Lovano against 
string and brass sections arranged by Gunther Schuller. The forward-looking 
session, the first in February's release schedule, contains everything from a 
lush "Angel Eyes" with strings to more heady numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Taylor's "Homage" (GRP) also employs strings, in this case the Turtle 
Island String Quartet. The group and Taylor's trio play the title piece, which 
pays tribute to such legendary jazz string players as Stuff Smith and Oscar 
Pettiford. A more modern fusion informs bassist John Patitucci's "Mistura Fima" 
(GRP), in which ethnic influences from Africa and other climes join the 
leader's brisk take on contemporary jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The February release roster also includes trumpeter Nicholas Payton's debut on 
Verve; Ornette Coleman's first album on Harmolodic Records; powerhouse saxman 
Chris Potter's "Pure" (Concord), a tribute to his late boss, trumpeter Red 
Rodney, with Larry Goldings on organ; and guitarist Kevin Eubanks' "Spirit Talk 
II" (Blue Note), with Dave Holland and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenorman Joe Henderson's third Verve album spotlights the March lineup. It 
focuses on the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, and the maestro of melody is 
along on several tracks. The wonderful pianist Kenny Barron is heard with the 
crack team of bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Roy Haynes on "Wanton Spirit" 
(Verve); and Native Colors, which features drummer Billy Higgins and tenorist 
Ralph Moore, makes its debut on Concord. 
</P>
<P>
 Also out in March are albums on Columbia by pianist Harold Mabern ("The 
Leading Man") and altoist Lou Donaldson ("Sentimental Journey"), and explosive 
reedman Kenny Garrett's trio on Warner Bros. Here, bassist Charnett Moffett and 
drummer Brian Blade join Garrett for takes of tunes such as "Giant Steps" and 
"A Time for Love." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Up Tempo: When Nino Tempo's straight-ahead Atlantic album "Tenor Saxophone" 
came out in 1992, a lot of listeners were surprised that he could even play the 
horn, let alone play it so well. After all, that was Tempo singing with sister 
April Stevens on "Deep Purple," which reached No. 1 on the 1963 Billboard Pop 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was a jazz musician long before I made that record," says Tempo, who 
appears tonight and Saturday at Cicada (8478 Melrose Ave., at La Cienega 
Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
 Tempo, who turns 60 today, will be recording his third Atlantic album this 
weekend, playing standards and jazz classics with a bang-up band that sports 
trumpeter Conte Candoli, pianist Mike Lang, bassist Brian Bromberg and drummer 
Terri Lyne Carrington.

 Sit back, if you will; watch us resist any cheap and easy jokes linking 
"bankruptcy" and "Orange County theater" in the same sentence, and take in a 
few critics' views of the distinctive (both good and bad) moments of 1994. Some 
things stayed the same: lots and lots of mediocre-to-paltry revivals, lots and 
lots of community and college groups way over their collective heads, lots and 
lots of warhorses and very few new plays.  
</P>
<P>
 Some things, however, were not the same. -- Robert Koehler Robert Koehler

 One Very Good Indicator That Terrence McNally May Not Be a Playwright for the 
Ages: Any revival of his plays, especially the Garden Grove Community Theatre's

 Company Least Deserving of the Nice Home It's In: The Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse.

 Biggest Lost Opportunity: Shakespeare Orange County finally managing to 
arrange for Alan Mandell to perform his long-cherished "King Lear," only to 
surround him with bad actors in a thoughtless staging.

 Biggest Lost Opportunity, Runner-Up: The Fullerton Civic Light Opera putting 
"Sleuth" in the awkward, cold Muckenthaler Cultural Center amphitheater and 
ignoring the center's elegant, adjacent mansion -- the perfect staging area.

After All: American Classic Repertory in Mission Viejo.

 Indisputable Reason Why No Theater Is Doing the Most Dazzling Work: Because 
it's being done by Long Beach Opera, whose recent double-bill of "Dido and 
Aeneas" and "Riders to the Sea" was typically distinctive and eccentric.

 Town With the Widest Choice of Theater: Fullerton. Only a few venues, but what 
variety -- the tried-and-true Fullerton Civic Light Opera, the counterculture 
Tribune Theatre and the well-endowed and daring Cal State Fullerton Theater 
Department. 
</P>
<P>

 Town With the Poorest Choice of Theater: Lots of competition, but the nod has 
to go to . . . Tustin. When was the last time you went to the theater in 
Tustin?

 Town That Should Have World-Class Theater but Doesn't: Anaheim, considering 
what it already does have (and even considering the team it's about to lose).

 Newt Gingrich's Worst Nightmare: That one of his key political bases, Orange

terrible season.

</P>
<P>
 The Ironman Award: To actor Richard Doyle, whose three-plus decades with South 
Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa keep pushing him to new heights instead of 
slowing him down. Consider his performances this year in "Waiting for Godot," 
"Playland" and "Later Life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ironwoman Award: To actress Kandis Chappell, Doyle's colleague at SCR. The 
only reason she isn't everyone's choice for Finest Working American Actress is 
that the East Coast media doesn't know her.

 The Patience-of-Job Award: To Orange County audiences, who keep going to the

</P>
<P>
 Professional productions, in order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
 1. "Playland," South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, January: SCR has been 
committed to bringing Athol Fugard's work to Orange County, and this 
production, directed by Martin Benson, was a strong example of this dedication. 
Intense and powerfully acted, it helped show why the South African writer is 
considered the most relevant voice in the world's theater when it comes to 
evoking the human consequences of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. "King Lear," Shakespeare Orange County, Orange, August: As Shakespeare's 
flawed British monarch, Alan Mandell slipped into rote oratory every now and 
then, but this production still had the authority to impress more often than 
not. In a year where quality Shakespeare was hard to find, Thomas F. Bradac's 
staging, while never reaching brilliance, was a needed addition. 
</P>
<P>
 (Editor's note: Ah! But see Robert Koehler above!)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. "A Streetcar Named Desire," South Coast Repertory, September: Tennessee 
Williams' classic about brutal Stanley and broken Blanche was given an 
emotionally satisfying revival, pitched with detail thanks to director Benson's 
careful eye and Michael Devine's alley-dark set. Jeff Meek's Stanley may have 
sounded distractingly like Bowser from Sha-Na-Na, but Kandis Chappell's Blanche 
was just fine, a tattered queen going nowhere but down. 
</P>
<P>
 Small and community productions, in order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
 1. "Inspecting Carol," the Laguna Playhouse, Laguna Beach, December: This 
biting, often-hilarious production of Daniel Sullivan's Christmas farce gave a 
holiday goose to, among other things, political correctness, the National 
Endowment for the Arts and multiculturalism. Director Andrew Barnicle took 
risks, and they resulted in a show that was able to scrape all the seasonal goo 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. "A Hatful of Rain," the Ensemble Theatre, Orange, September: a true "small 
theater" offering, in that it was pulled off with a pennyweight budget and a 
mix of mostly amateur actors. Director Roosevelt Blankenship Jr. turned this 
antiquated, very '50s junkie melodrama by Michael V. Gazzo into more than just 
a curiosity. The hard-working cast, led by David Boreanaz as addict Johnny, may 
have been overheated, but the performances were affecting nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 College and university productions, in order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
 1. "Six Degrees of Separation," Fullerton College, November: John Guare's 
nibbling urban comedy about a con man who tricks a grasping New York couple 
while posing as Sidney Poitier's son requires a dry touch -- which it got from 
director Gary Krinke and his capable cast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl," Irvine Valley College, February: 
The terrain covered by this one-woman show was painfully familiar -- think of 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" or "Roots" -- but still worthy, especially as a history 
lesson. Director Jon Sidoli and star Tamiko Washington leaned toward the 
overwrought, but they also showed the suffering of Harriet Ann Jacobs, a North 
Carolina slave who endured amazing hardships as a fugitive in the 1830s. T.H. 
McCulloh

<P>
 Outstanding productions, alphabetically:  
</P>
<P>
 "And a Nightingale Sang . . . ," Cal State Fullerton, October: The 
effervescent performance of Eve Himmelheber as the crippled daughter of a 
wartime British family illuminated a charming and evocative production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gingerbread Lady," Theatre District, Costa Mesa, August: The message of 
redemption in Neil Simon's play was strongly played out in this staging with a 
fierce sense of reality that almost let one forget the one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Glengarry Glen Ross," Ensemble Theatre, Orange, June: The perfect timing and 
fluent musicality of Roosevelt Blankenship's staging reinforced David Mamet's 
powerful writing and the play's inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Hair," Curtis Theatre, Brea, October: Director Gary Krinke gave today's 
audience an absolutely true picture of a past era with his buoyant and 
period-perfect production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamlet," UC Irvine, April: The right director, Stephen M. Burdman, found the 
right actor, Charles Huston, whose intuitive performance shed new light on 
Shakespeare's confused Dane. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud," Tribune Theatre, Fullerton, December: a mesmerizing staging of Irene 
Maria Fornes' play, with an equally mesmerizing performance by Stephen Spehar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Philadelphia Story," Vanguard Theatre, Fullerton, September: a crackling, 
silken staging that captured the frothy style of the play perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Shadowlands," Long Beach Studio Theatre, May: made memorable by its attention 
to the historical setting, and by actor Bob Fimiani's rich recreation of the 
character and intelligence of C.S. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Strange Snow," Laguna Playhouse, September: a powerful revival with a 
stunning Rob Campbell as a Vietnam vet who isn't as crazy as he looks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You Can't Take It With You," Cal State Fullerton, March: A thorough knowledge 
of the period and some offbeat, inventive performances made for an authentic 
and very honest staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Outstanding performances, alphabetically:  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Campbell, "Strange Snow." 
</P>
<P>
 *

<P>
 Charles Huston, "Hamlet."

 David Alan Nelson, "Greetings," Way Off Broadway, Santa Ana, November: 
Christmas was richer because of his insightful and delightful performance as a 
retarded man who channels a visitor from another spiritual level to straighten 
out his family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Spehar, "Mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Turkeys, alphabetically:  
</P>
<P>
 "Musical Comedy Murders of 1940," Saddleback College, Mission Viejo, November: 
overacted out of every laugh, with no comprehension of the play's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "RIP," Huntington Beach Playhouse, November: A musical desecration of 
Washington Irving's "Rip Van Winkle," this work-in-progress should not progress 
much further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tempest," Tribune Theatre, October: a production that had little to do 
with Shakespeare or common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Same Time Next Year," Theatre District, October: Unwisely, this production 
was rewritten to add new characters and dialogue. Bah, humbug!

1994: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; THE YEAR IN REVIEW: CHILDREN'S THEATERS YIELD SOME 
PRETTY FINE EFFORTS.; SHOWS KEPT KIDS LITTLE AND BIG ENTERTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much can be said for having kids five or more years apart. Only toting one set 
of baby gear at a time is easier on your back. And, because pricey little 
necessities such as orthodontics, prom dates and college tuition come at more 
widely spaced intervals, it's also a bit easier on your wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding entertainment to span the age gap, however, especially live theater, 
can be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional "Snow White" may enchant little Tiffany, but it will almost 
certainly bore the bejeesus out of an older sibling. And a show that caters to 
older audiences can leave young children squirming, whining and in general 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, several local youth theater groups this year managed to produce 
shows that, through a combination of clever dialogue and inventive staging, 
stretched to fit a range of age groups, up to and including adults. 
</P>
<P>
 And to this end, 1994 did yield some pretty fine efforts. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 * The new Paper Bag Players arrived in Mission Viejo with a bang. The troupe 
put a twist on youth theater by inviting audiences to pack a lunch and take 
part in a pre-show nosh with the actors as they prepared for the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The players got the premiere season off to a slow start with a somewhat frothy 
version of "Tom Sawyer" but picked up speed in August with a knockout staging 
of "Little Red and the Hoods." With a script that was heavily peppered with 
quips and puns and a chummy, audience-participation format that made even the 
youngest viewers feel part of the action, "Red" was by far the finest the 
company had to offer this year. 
</P>
<P>
 November's staging of "The Jungle Book" swung unsteadily between 
self-conscious drama and goofball comedy and, coming on "Red's" heels, was a 
bit of a disappointment. But judging from their earlier efforts, director Bunny 
Lawson and her adult ensemble are clearly a group that families will want to 
keep track of in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you just looked at the titles of the plays presented by Orange's Broadway 
on Tour, you'd think the group would not have much to offer older children. But 
director Dan Halkyard is one of those gifted people who can adapt his 
personality to blend just as easily with kids as with adults, and his shows 
reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 BOT's lineup, which began in January with "Sleeping Beauty" and ended this 
month with "Goldilocks and the Christmas Bears," featured shows that stayed 
close enough to familiar story lines to keep little ones comfortable while 
offering older viewers an engaging array of quirky characters and clever 
wordplay, all of it carried out by some very capable young actors.  
</P>
<P>
 Though BOT directors went overboard at times with the adolescent humor 
(please, guys, lose the Steve Urkel bits. . . .), several characters played 
extremely well to a wide range of ages, including Ryan Butte's wisecracking 
fairy godfather in "Sleeping Beauty," Keith Hancock's tender "Velveteen 
Rabbit," Nicholas McKim's simpering Mr. Smee in "Peter Pan" and Christina 
Davidson and Daina Baker's wonderfully oily cat and fox in "Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 By the by, Broadway on Tour, which will perform through February at its 
storefront theater in The City Shopping Center, will establish new digs this 
spring in a converted school auditorium behind the Mall of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because Diane Doyle, director of South Coast Repertory's Young Conservatory, 
took a year off starting in September, the SCR's Young Conservatory Players 
only put on one show open to the public. But what a show it was: Colin Thomas' 
"One Thousand Cranes" in June. Doyle's delicate directorial touch and SCR's 
usual high-quality production values helped make this one of the most memorable 
shows for any age in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is a moving retelling of the story of Sadako Sasaki, a young girl 
who died in 1954 of leukemia, presumably brought on by radiation exposure in 
the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 Though younger children may have had trouble following the play's jumpy story 
line and not fully grasped its anti-war message, even my 6-year-old companion 
was caught up by the play's bittersweet tone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the shows presented by the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater was "Sword 
in the Stone," Kathryn Schultz Miller's adaptation of the Arthurian legends. 
Written as two one-acts to be performed separately, the works were presented 
together for the first time by youth theater director Joe Lauderdale. Though it 
would have benefited from some trimming, the play was an admirable effort on 
all fronts. Finely tuned swordplay and some inventive visual effects helped 
young audiences stay tuned to the stories at hand, well-told by Lauderdale's 
youthful cast, masterfully anchored by Tim Dey's Merlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other 1994 productions also deserve quick mention: 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Depot Playhouse Young Actors Company put on a snappy version of Delia 
Ephron's "How to Eat Like a Child," a slick, savvy primer on behavioral dos and 
don'ts. The February staging was made snappier still by director Jack Millis' 
liberal additions of topical humor and an exceptionally talented teen-age 
ensemble, including Summer Wybacynskey, a tall blonde with a powerful set of 
pipes and knack for low-key comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, theatergoers were able to catch up with Wybacynskey again in the 
Buena Park Youth Theatre's "The Music Man." She played Marilyn the Librarian to 
Joe Alfred Lopez Jr.'s cocky Harold Hill in an all-youth staging that had more 
than enough bite to keep that old standard from being old hat to older kids.

</P>
</HEADLINE>

gave Cal State Fullerton a 61-59 victory over Pepperdine in a nonconference 
women's basketball game Thursday in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (4-3), which rallied after trailing by nine points at halftime, 
missed a shot at the buzzer.Koko Lahanas had 18 points and 11 rebounds and

Stoner had 17 to lead Lewis-Clark State (8-6). Ramin Bastani led Chapman (6-4) 
with 23 points. A 25-11 run early in the game proved costly for the Panthers.

<P>
 In the UC San Diego women's tournament:

<P>
 Millikan (Ill.) 63, Chapman 56 -- Melody Earle scored a game-high 20 points
