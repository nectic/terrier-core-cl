THEATER REVIEW; ALL'S NOT RIGHT WITH NEWPORT THEATRE'S 'WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 It's probably a good thing the Newport Theatre Arts Center neglected to 
mention in its program that the musical "Dear World" was based on Jean 
Giraudoux's "The Madwoman of Chaillot." The French playwright would probably be 
grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 The adaptation of the book, by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is 
simplistic and obvious, sometimes even Francophobic, and Jerry Herman's score 
is, well, Jerry Herman's score. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco critic once correctly stated that Herman didn't write songs, 
he wrote anthems. Nothing could be more improper and tasteless for the faded 
antique tones of Giraudoux's gentle fantasy about the evils of power and greed 
in this world, and the simple solution to the problem devised by the distracted 
but wise Countess Aurelia. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some directors who should not be told they are directing a comedy or 
a fantasy. Both have to be played dead serious to work. Embellishing comedy or 
fantasy with more of the same courts disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Larry Watts makes that mistake in this production, with the eventual 
result of doubling the simplistic tone of the book and making it look almost 
like a children's play. He allows mugging and overacting to go unchecked in a 
cast that seems to think that acting is nodding vigorously while another actor 
is speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 His Countess Aurelia, Lisa Gary, has a fine voice, rich and vibrant, that 
makes Herman's tunes, particularly her ballads, very listenable. When she 
speaks, she shrieks -- is it Dame Edith Evans she's trying to emulate? She is 
about five times too big in her readings and gestures. Who is this wild-eyed 
Aurelia? For we know her not. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a little more restraint in Justin Melbin's Julian, the young man who 
bolts from the evildoers to help the Countess' cause. Melbin's full-bodied, 
rock-bottom baritone is a highlight that Herman's score doesn't give enough to 
do. And he generally comports himself as a normal human being, a rarity in this 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His quiet moment ("And I Was Beautiful") with Aurelia, who speaks without a 
shriek for once, is the only time the show works the way it should. Megan 
Endicott's lilting soprano also is just right for Nina, the local girl for whom 
Julian falls, and she acts pretty normal, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the performances are pure cartoon, particularly Yvonne Houssels and 
Cindy Corbin as Aurelia's dim chums, who are sight gags only, and Theodore 
Phillip as the Prospector who discovers oil in Chaillot. Phillip has appeared 
elsewhere to much better advantage and should know better. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Steward's musical direction makes the most it can with the anthems and 
soppy ballads, but his lighting design is all over the place, which doesn't 
help Todd Faux's clever and workable scenic design.

THEATER REVIEW / JAN HERMAN; MIXED 'REP' ACTS LIKE BACKSTAGE COMEDY SANS PUNCH 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a theater troupe becomes a legend in its own time, chances are it's 
already on the way out. Fortunately, that does not seem to be the case with 
South Coast Repertory, the ostensible subject of Greg Atkins' new comedy a clef 
called "REP." 
</P>
<P>
 What Orange County's very own, somewhat famous professional company does have 
to fear from "REP" is not that playgoers will mistake this backstage comedy for 
real history or even for legend, but that SCR's founding artists might take a 
fit of nostalgia and dress up again in bunny suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Atkins is just kidding, too -- in the sense of laughable rather 
than funny. And that seems to have been the conclusion drawn by most of the 
audience Sunday at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse, where "REP" is in its world 
premiere production. 
</P>
<P>
 The amateurish first act, which features a grating pair of bunny-suited 
characters (OK, so one of them was in a tiger suit), started out playing to a 
full house of roughly 90. The audience cleared out in droves during the 
intermission, and by the second act (which didn't improve) the house was less 
than half full. 
</P>
<P>
 A million Frenchmen can be wrong. But this time I'd say it's Atkins who missed 
the target. To enshrine a legend you need more than bad gags about actors gone 
ga-ga for show-biz and schmaltz about mix-and-match love affairs and bromides 
about artistic growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a spoof, "REP" could use jokes that work. As a soap, it could use more 
conflict. As a script, it is, at best, a work in progress. The first thing 
Atkins could do to improve it would be to decide whether he's writing farce or 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins, who also directs, has some good satirical ideas. The troupe's bulletin 
board, for example, boasts a large sign pompously announcing: "LOOK WHAT THE 
CRITICS ARE SAYING." Posted below it is a clipping so tiny you can barely see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But a retrospective slide show capping the second act to illustrate the 
success of the rep troupe -- which has graduated from bunny suits to tuxedos 
for a 10th anniversary fund-raiser -- turns out to be a miscalculation. It 
plays like the photo album of a wedding you didn't attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is game but inexperienced and under-rehearsed.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SOME LESSONS FROM A BLUES MASTER: OTIS RUSH; HIS ARSENAL OF 
GUITAR LICKS AND HIS VOCAL STYLE ARE IMPRESSIVE, EVEN IF HIS PERFORMANCE IS 
SOMETHING LESS THAN INSPIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Alberts King and Collins to Buddy Guy, from Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page 
to Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan, at least two generations of blues 
musicians have reaped the harvest of seeds sowed as long as 40 years ago by 
singer-guitarist Otis Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 His slick, urban approach to the music remains, to a degree, the template for 
modern players -- even though Rush has been sadly ignored over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 So if in his performance Monday night at the Coach House Rush came off as 
something less than the innovator he undeniably once was, this is due at least 
in part to the fact that his style has been adopted and flat-out mimicked to 
the point of over-saturation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, little has changed or evolved in Rush's playing over the years, as 
Monday's concert demonstrated. While Rush remains in full command of his 
formidable arsenal of trilled, vibrato guitar licks and testifying vocal style 
(although a cold prevented him from a full workout on his pipes), his 
performance was something less than inspired -- as opposed to, say, a B.B. 
King, who performs as if every show might be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the stage in his now-trademark cowboy hat and shades, the 60-year-old 
Rush played a capable and professional if sometimes tiring set, which included 
signature tunes ("Homework"), a selection of material from his latest album 
("I'm a Fool for You," "It's My Own Fault") and a host of covers ("Crosscut 
Saw," "Matchbox"). 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-bar blues jams were uniformly overlong, but it was nonetheless a 
pleasure to witness Rush wring stinging, angry licks from his Stratocaster in 
his unconventional manner -- he plays a left-handed guitar, strung upside down, 
and picks with his thumb, as did the late Albert King. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, he belied his legendary reputation for surliness with a warm and engaging 
stage demeanor, playfully bantering with audience members and smiling from ear 
to ear throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If his backup band wasn't always fully up to the task of complementing the 
boss man, Rush himself gave a master's class on postwar Chicago blues, coming 
off as the knowledgeable if prosaic professor that he is. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the evening presented an opportunity for fans to witness one 
of the first-string patriarchs of the blues still plying his trade, showing one 
and all how to do it with style . With the recent passing of too many bluesmen 
of Rush's generation, that alone was worth the price of admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who had paid that price, however, spoke with their feet about 
his performance. The crowd thinned, minute by minute, until a mere trickle of 
the faithful remained by the end of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening band, Lee Rocker's Big Blue (led by the former Stray Cats 
bassist), provided a welcome dose of youthful energy and enthusiasm for the 
night, with a flaming set of rockabilly and jump blues that was much better 
received -- and attended -- than the main act.

 No Tony, According to Jackie: Comedian Jackie Mason is returning his 1987 Tony 
for "The World According to Me!" because he wasn't invited to appear on this 
year's awards show. In a sidewalk news conference held Tuesday in front of the 
New York theater where he stars in "Jackie Mason -- Politically Incorrect," the 
comedian said his decision to give back the prize was made not only for himself 
but for "all the hard-working Broadway performers and artists who are not as 
fortunate as I am to have a hit show, a big mouth and the ability to do what is 
politically incorrect." The award was to be returned to the office of the 
League of American Theaters and Producers, which presents the Tonys along with 
the American Theater Wing. Tony spokesman Keith Sherman said the show's 
producer had to be selective despite intense pressure from Mason to appear on 
Sunday's show. "There were a lot of stars who asked to be on the show," Sherman 
said, adding jokingly: "Our biggest worry is that Jackie's gesture will cause 
an avalanche of returned Tonys." TELEVISION

 'Maverick' Blackout: If the release of the film "Maverick" has made anyone 
consider looking for the original TV series on home video, they'll be 
disappointed with the limited selection. Warner Bros., which produced the 
1957-1960 Western for ABC, is not releasing anything beyond the two episodes 
that came out on video in 1992. James Garner, who starred as Bret Maverick on 
ABC and plays lawman Zane Cooper in the motion picture, said his understanding 
was that Mel Gibson insisted on the video blackout so as not to dilute demand 
for the film version and any possible sequels. A Warner Bros. spokesman 
confirmed the embargo but disputed that it was at Gibson's behest.

 Wilder's German Honors: Director Billy Wilder on Monday received the Goethe 
Medaille, an annual award from Los Angeles' Goethe Institut honoring 
individuals living outside of Germany. Wilder, an Austrian immigrant, was 
recognized for his artistic contributions in his career, which began in Germany 
and later took him to Hollywood. Noting that he was a screenwriter before 
becoming a director, Wilder commented that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 
Germany's famed poet for whom the institute and award are named, would have 
made a "wonderful screenwriter" for an entity called "18th Century Fox." "His 
first hit would have been 'Faust,' " Wilder continued, "and the studio would 
have been asking him, 'How about 'Faust II' ?" LEGAL FILE

 Parkinson's Suit: Longtime "Price Is Right" model Dian Parkinson made good 
Monday on her threats to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against the show's 
host, Bob Barker. Two weeks ago, the 70-year-old Barker waged a preemptive 
strike against Parkinson's charges, holding a press conference to say that he 
did have intermittent sex with her but that it was consensual. He said 
Parkinson threatened an $8-million lawsuit when she left the show after 18 
years, reportedly because of friction with other models. Parkinson's suit, 
which seeks unspecified damages, alleges Barker made sex a condition of her 
employment, in exchange for helping patch things up with those other models.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NANCY DUSSAULT TRANSFORMS CINEGRILL INTO DELIGHTFUL CABARET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Dussault has a refreshingly primal view of cabaret. A basic black dress, 
a string of pearls, some excellent songs and a strong accompanist.That's all 
she needed at the Cinegrill on Monday night -- that and the accumulated talent 
and experience to create her own mini-world of music and theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Dussault, whose far-ranging career has included stage, films and television, 
easily handled the smaller, more intimate requirements of cabaret. Alternately 
humorous, bawdy, sentimental and tender, she brought a strikingly diverse 
musical palette to her 80-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, her program assiduously avoided the chestnuts often favored by 
performers of her generation and background. Instead, she combined tunes in 
ways that added new perspectives to each: "I'm in Love Again" with "I'm Not 
Getting Married Today"; "On My Way to You" with "Heart and Soul." And she 
uncovered delightfully whimsical if sadly obscure material from the past: Noel 
Coward's "Chase Me, Charlie" and Morton Gould and Dorothy Fields' "There Must 
Be Something Better Than Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Dussault did it all with a constant awareness of the essential ingredients of 
good cabaret -- a respect for lyrics and music, a close interaction with the 
audience and a rich understanding of songs as stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nancy Dussault appears every Monday in June at the Cinegrill, Radisson 
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood Blvd., 8:30 p.m. $12 cover, $10 drink 
minimum. (213) 466-7000. DON HECKMAN

MOVIE REVIEW; 'HIGH LONESOME' CAPTURES STORY OF BLUEGRASS MUSIC; THE 
DOCUMENTARY CELEBRATES THE GENRE'S GREATEST PRACTITIONERS AND INCLUDES A 
BIOGRAPHY OF THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL, BILL MONROE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an indelible sound, soulful yet streamlined, often overlooked but once 
heard never forgotten. It is bluegrass, a.k.a. "folk music with overdrive," as 
vibrant an American musical synthesis as jazz and the subject of a thorough and 
thoroughly entertaining documentary titled "High Lonesome" after the haunting 
melodies it calls its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Written and directed by Rachel Liebling, "High Lonesome" is an exploration of 
bluegrass's roots, an almost poetic evocation of the world from which it 
sprang, a celebration of its greatest practitioners and a biography of the man 
who started it all, Bill Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound like a sizable order, but because it's been made with 
simplicity and care, "High Lonesome" carries it off. Liebling's film will 
please the initiated and introduce the subject to the uninformed, as well as 
providing a chance to hear parts of more than 100 songs with evocative titles 
like "Blue Moon of Kentucky" and "I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home." 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky native Monroe is "High Lonesome's" centerpiece and understandably so. 
The man who did the final combining of bluegrass's diverse elements back in 
1930, Monroe at age 83 is still playing and touring, a courtly yet indomitable 
legend whose trademark high country tenor voice and swift mandolin playing 
fingers have lost none of their emotional power. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of bluegrass's components were the Scottish-Irish ballads carried by 
immigrants to the hills of Appalachia. Gradually added to the mix was white 
gospel music, and, brought in by the railroad, African American rhythms in 
general and the banjo, a plantation instrument, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing everything together was the Great Depression, which drove people like 
Monroe, one of eight children who took up the mandolin because it was the only 
instrument not already spoken for, to the modern, industrialized north. There, 
exposure on radio stations like Indiana's WJKS ("Where Joy Kills Sorrow") and 
ultimately the Grand Ole Opry led to the music's increasing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its scintillating sound, what makes "High Lonesome" so effective is 
the footage the music is placed against. Writer-director Liebling scoured more 
than 50 archives, finding historical material (some so combustible it had to be 
transported in an armored car) that almost poetically evokes the physical world 
of chores, churchgoing and quiet beauty the music grew out of. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course there is rare performance footage as well, including country 
pioneers like Uncle Dave Macon, "the Dixie Dewdrop"; classic groups like the 
Stanley Brothers and Jim & Jesse; and folks like Jimmy Martin and narrator Mac 
Wiseman, who began as Monroe sidemen. For, as the great man likes to point out, 
his band has been through more than 65 fiddle players, as many on the banjo, 
"but there's been only one mandolin." 
</P>
<P>
 Bluegrass was nearly killed by the rock explosion, but it stayed alive long 
enough to inspire a current generation, like John Duffey and the Seldom Scene 
and Alison Krauss and Union Station, both of whom pay tribute to Monroe as the 
great progenitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "High Lonesome" seems so thorough, in fact, that it's a bit disappointing that 
Liebling doesn't find time for the classic citybilly bands of the 1960s -- the 
Charles River Valley Boys, the Kentucky Colonels and the influential Greenbriar 
Boys -- that provided a crucial link between Monroe and today's gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, the music wins out over everything. Everyone will have a 
favorite moment, from the great Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs performing with 
Monroe when their careers began as members of his Bluegrass Boys, to Monroe and 
his current band breaking into a impromptu version of "I'm Going Back to Old 
Kentucky" on their bus. Beautiful and spirited, these songs represent the music 
at its best, and we are fortunate that Liebling has packaged its history so 
thoughtfully.

TV REVIEW; 'LA BOHEME' AN ENERGETIC, UNEVEN OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baz Luhrmann's wildly popular 1990 staging of Puccini's "La Boheme" for the 
Australian Opera comes to PBS tonight in a 1993 performance sung in Italian and 
taped in the Sydney Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Luhrmann's film "Strictly Ballroom" will recognize the cartoonish 
approach to authority figures, the ironic humor in the central love 
relationship and the fascination with pop culture -- all present in the 
original libretto but heightened here in a version set in the late 1950s and 
cast with youthful singing-actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining literal pictorialism with bare-bones architectural stylization, 
Catherine Martin's setting revolves during the action, supporting the restless, 
energetic interpretation enforced by Luhrmann, the spirited cast and conductor 
Julian Smith. Even the English subtitles reflect their irreverent approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The result proves decidedly uneven -- with inspired horseplay at some moments 
and standard opera house tableaux at others. But, for once, the reckless 
eccentricity of these characters is given the proper weight, with only Mimi 
conventionally sentimentalized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though she seems out of place with antic '50s bohemians, Cheryl Barker sings 
the role with generous reserves of warm, burnished tone (with some thinning on 
top) and savors the full measure of heartbreak in it. As her puppyish and 
sometimes downright goofy Rodolfo, David Hobson sounds distressingly wiry but 
sings his heart out in a performance that anchors Luhrmann's concept with great 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Douglas' good-humored, vocally squally Musetta and Roger Lemke's 
bearish, rich voiced Marcello are more standard-issue performances. Gary Rowley 
fails to make much of an effect during Colline's great farewell to his 
overcoat. David Lemke, however, comes on like a whirlwind as Schaunard. John 
Bolton-Wood and Graeme Ewer prove interchangeable as Alcindoro and Benoit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baz Luhrmann's Australian Opera production of "La Boheme" (sung in Italian) 
screens at 9 p.m. tonight on KCET Channel 28 and KPBS Channel 15. The two-hour 
telecast can also be seen at 7 p.m. on KVCR Channel 24. LEWIS SEGAL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; AIRPORT BUDGET 
EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of capital projects and land purchases during the next fiscal year 
will more than double Burbank Airport's current budget, while operational and 
maintenance expenses should remain fairly static, according to a proposed 
financial blueprint unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the iscal year beginning July 1, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority plans a number of expenditures that will push the budget past $56.4 
million, more than twice the current $24.6-million budget.The expenses include 
expanding baggage-claim and parking-lot capacity, as well as buying adjacent 
land to help with noise mitigation and safety regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the projects will be paid for by $15 
million in federal grants, $14 million in a bond issue the authority hopes to 
float later this year and $3 million through a facilities surcharge that will 
add $3 to each passenger's round-trip ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials still expect to construct a 670,000-square-foot terminal 
over the next decade, the improvements planned for the coming year are mainly 
devoted to refurbishing the current buildings, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are related to making the current terminal livable for the 
remaining years," especially as passenger rolls continue to increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the airport more attractive to airlines, the budget also envisions 
lower landing fees. But with a greater number of flights, the airport expects 
to generate about the same revenue in landing fees next year as this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport authority is scheduled to vote on the budget June 20.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; 3RD BOMB 
FOUND AT MIDDLE SCHOOL WITHIN A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A steel-encased pipe bomb damaged an outside drinking fountain at Nobel Middle 
School in Northridge sometime over the weekend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third bomb to be exploded at the school in a week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two bombs, which were exploded at the school last Wednesday, were 
encased in plastic pipe, said Officer Lorie Taylor of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. Those bombs were taped to a window, said Robert Coburn, an 
assistant principal at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told school officials they heard an explosion at the school Sunday 
night, Coburn said.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest bomb was taped to a porcelain water fountain near the girl's gym, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb did minor damage to the pipes below the drinking fountain, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's bomb squad went to the school in the 9900 block of 
Tampa Avenue and picked up the remains of the bomb, Taylor said.

A GROWING TIDE AGAINST SMOKING; AMA URGES TOBACCO BE VIEWED AS ADDICTIVE DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Medical Assn. has now added its influential voice to others that 
are calling on the federal government to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug. 
The AMA isn't demanding a ban on cigarettes, only that the government have 
stronger authority to control their distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The action of the AMA follows an appeal to Congress by Dr. David A. Kessler, 
the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, for legislation that 
would more precisely spell out the federal agency's powers to regulate tobacco 
as an addictive drug. 
</P>
<P>
 As the AMA recognizes, to try to ban cigarettes would probably be to invite 
consequences even more devastating than those produced starting in 1920 by the 
constitutional prohibition on the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of 
intoxicating liquors" in the United States. Prohibition was essentially an 
attempt to stamp out what many at the time professed to regard as a vice. What 
it led to was rampant scofflawism, a murderous crime wave and widespread 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But smoking isn't as simple as just a vice. It is, as the AMA, the FDA and 
every current and former smoker knows, a demanding and pitiless addiction. A 
ban on tobacco that would separate tens of millions of addicts from their drug 
would no doubt, after considerable pain, forcibly convert millions of them to 
the status of relieved former smokers. What it would do to the nation's social 
fabric at the same time is too grim to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
 An addiction can't be eliminated by fiat. The legal challenge for Congress is 
to devise new ways to cut consumer demand for the toxic chemicals in tobacco by 
means short of outright prohibition. Two related points of attack are obvious. 
One is to dissuade people, especially teen-agers, from ever starting to smoke. 
The other is to encourage smokers to join the millions of those who have kicked 
their addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher taxes on cigarettes are a proven disincentive to smoking. Another 
approach is through unremitting education, using all the manipulative skills of 
contemporary advertising to drive home the profound truism that smoking sickens 
and it kills. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax-and-educate approach has helped in recent years to bring the smoking 
rate in California down. Nationally, though, the statistics are less 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, it will probably take at least a generation and maybe a lot 
longer to make the United States a society that's more or less smoke-free. 
Meanwhile, smoking-related diseases will go on killing up to 500,000 Americans 
a year. Anything that can feasibly be done to reduce that appalling toll is 
well worth trying.

GUN WATCH; NO SAFE PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Marino, like other affluent enclaves with manicured lawns, million-dollar 
homes and acclaimed schools, is not the kind of place one would expect to find 
gangs and guns. But with the shooting deaths of two teen-agers at a house party 
last Saturday, residents there got a tragic glimpse of the gun violence that is 
spreading across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar horrifying scenario played itself out in Venice Tuesday morning when 
assailants fired 20 rounds from an AK-47 rifle into a crowd of teen-agers. 
Again, police suspect the unholy combination of guns and gangs. Again, children 
got caught in the cross fire. Thankfully, no one was killed -- this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino killings occurred despite a security detail at the party and 
the use of a hand-held metal detector to check guests at the door. Authorities 
say that two gang members who had been asked to leave returned with 
semiautomatic weapons and raked party-goers with gunfire, wounding several 
students and killing David Heng, 15, and Dennis Buan, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Some San Marino residents are pushing for a youth curfew and/or stepped-up 
police presence for large parties. Such ideas are fine, but they don't strike 
at the heart of the problem. Over the past decade, there has been an 80% 
increase in the number of juveniles committing murders with guns. Gunfire now 
causes one in four deaths among people 15 to 19 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet does not discriminate by race, gender, age, economic status or 
geography. That was made brutally clear in San Marino Saturday night and Venice 
Tuesday morning.

THE PARIS-L.A. CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French-American cultural relations, contrary to some reports, do not consist 
exclusively of French resistance to American popular culture. True, the 
much-publicized coolness of French critics had something to do with the poor 
performance of EuroDisney. And French trade negotiators insisted on protecting 
their fellow citizens from the U.S. films they love too well. 
</P>
<P>
 But popular culture is not the whole of culture. In arts and sciences, France 
and the United States have had lively relations since Jefferson and Franklin 
were the toast of Paris. In this century, the "Lost Generation" of post-World 
War I American writers in Paris was followed by a post-World War II generation 
of only somewhat less famous writers -- James Jones, James Salter and others. 
Paris has played a particularly important role in providing a refuge and an 
intellectual reception for black American writers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 From its founding in 1931, the independent, non-governmental American Center 
in Paris has been a kind of clubhouse for American artists and writers living 
there and a magnet for Parisians interested in America. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last seven years, the center has been closed while it built itself a 
new home. Tuesday, the new home opened -- a spectacular building designed by 
Los Angeles-based architect Frank O. Gehry and offering "Pure Beauty: Some 
Recent Work From Los Angeles" as its inaugural show. (The art exhibition will 
open in Los Angeles Sept. 25.) 
</P>
<P>
 The warm reception Parisian critics have accorded the new center comes as a 
double reminder. First, culture and entertainment, though they overlap, are not 
quite the same thing, and the French reaction to American entertainment does 
not predict, either way, the French reaction to American culture. Second, 
though Los Angeles may rightly aspire to be the capital of the Pacific Rim, 
American institutions are obviously of European -- and in important regards of 
French -- descent, and the old ties still bind. 
</P>
<P>
 On a globe, no point can claim centrality. Is Los Angeles -- eight time zones 
east of Beijing and nine west of Paris -- central or twice peripheral? Whatever 
the answer, the American Center in Paris, celebrating Los Angeles as it 
reopens, deserves an appreciative look back. The City of the Angels may have 
much to learn, even at this late date, from the City of Light.

ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE FAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration's mishandling of the problem of turbulence 
caused by the Boeing 757 passenger jet warrants some kind of internal 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Dec. 15 a twin-engine jet crashed in Santa Ana, killing all five people 
aboard, including two executives of the In-N-Out hamburger chain. The plane was 
about two miles behind a Boeing 757 en route to John Wayne Airport, and 
investigators linked turbulence from the big jet to the crash. Such turbulence 
was also linked to an eight-fatality crash in Montana in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA was told twice in 1991 and twice two years later about problems 
associated with turbulence in the wake of the 757, but it did not formally warn 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now The Times has learned that the FAA's own top scientist, Robert E. Machol, 
predicted to FAA leaders that a "catastrophe" could occur due to 757 
turbulence. The warning came 11 days before the Montana crash, and a year 
before the Santa Ana crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has acknowledged that it may have violated disclosure statutes by not 
releasing the latest information in January and February, when The Times sought 
the records involved. If there was a violation, it too is a matter for 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until after the two fatal crashes did FAA Administrator David R. Hinson 
draw nationwide attention to the turbulence problem, telling air traffic 
controllers to warn pilots of the threat. Only last week did the FAA require 
planes following 757s to stay back four miles rather than three. Even that may 
be too little distance: The National Transportation Safety Board recommended a 
six-mile separation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is understandable that the FAA is concerned about the effect on the 
nation's commercial airlines of fewer revenue-producing flights if planes have 
to be spaced farther apart. But safety must come first. Hinson and his aides 
should have broadcast the information as quickly and widely as possible. 
Heeding the warning signs would have served the public better and might even 
have saved lives in Montana and Santa Ana.

 Re "For Richer or for Poorer," by Marlene Adler Marks, Commentary, June 1:  
</P>
<P>
 After years of incorrectly reporting the ultimate result of the Marvin vs. 
Marvin case, your newspaper, in recent years, has acknowledged that "the 
$104,000 finally granted (Michelle Triola)" was actually taken away from her by 
the California Court of Appeal, and that both the California Supreme Court and 
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to overturn that decision. In fact, the only 
monetary award that finally arose out of the case was an award of costs to Lee 
Marvin in the amount of several thousand dollars, which he graciously declined 
to enforce.

BORDER PATROL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students and staff at El Paso's Bowie High School did not drop their legal 
action against the Border Patrol when Operation Blockade began, as you reported 
on April 14. The two sides reached an agreement that had nothing to do with 
Operation Blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the Border Patrol agreed to stop using school campuses for 
enforcement, stop harassing people because their skin is brown, institute a 
complaint process to hold agents accountable and train agents in constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Blockade is no cure for Border Patrol abuse. When agents are let off 
the levee, as they surely must be someday, they will continue to abuse until 
systemic changes like those made possible under the Bowie settlement are taken 
seriously by the agency and monitored by the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the operation a cure for illegal immigration. Immigrants will continue 
to come by other routes because they flee political and economic conditions 
that would drive you and me to utter despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's name the real enemies: not immigrants, but the governments and 
multinational corporations whose greed creates intolerable living conditions 
for them, and whose moral insensibility makes public scapegoats out of them 
when they flee oppression to seek a better life.

SERVICE CUTS FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was upsetting to read that such a large fraction of Californians support 
the initiative to deny public services to illegal immigrant families ("Voters 
Back Service Cuts for Illegal Immigrants," May 29). 
</P>
<P>
 These services, including education and health care, mainly benefit the 
children in a family. The children are not the members of the family that make 
the decision to immigrate illegally; their parents may even have brought them 
against their will. By denying services essential to their development, we 
punish children for the sins of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is clearly wrong, and, because it punishes the innocent, can have no 
deterrent effect.

<P>
 The best hope for California is to provide the best possible education for 
these and all our children so they can contribute to improving the economy, as 
well as the social and cultural environment of the state, for the long term.

 This parade is more evidence that the invasion of the United States by illegal 
immigrants is growing and succeeding. We are giving away our country. This must 
stop. I am tired of hearing slogans such as "No Human Being Is Illegal" and, 
per a talk show radio program, "I am a citizen of the world, I have a right to 
live where I want." I still believe we are a sovereign nation and have a right 
to control our borders. We should take whatever steps are necessary to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, all benefits for illegal immigrants should stop. No health or 
education benefits should be given.

 I am a 23-year-old American, and a great admirer of Russian literature and

impressed me more than just the clever storyteller.Rightfully included among 
these giants of Russian literature stands Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose recent 
return to his homeland has sparked a controversy. The man has his motives, and 
I accept that without question. What concerns me is what Solzhenitsyn will 
encounter in his journey across Russia, particularly in its major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of communism in 1991, Russia has fallen victim to 
widespread crime, poverty, and increased political upheaval and ugliness. 
Despite the confusion, opportunities to profit from a "free" market have 
emerged for cunning entrepreneurs both in and out of Russia. This includes, of 
course, America, which some have labeled as the truest model of capitalism in 
the West. Well, I've lived for 23 years within this model, and have enough 
experience and exposure to formulate my own opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombarded daily by people vying for my money, I've decided that the capitalist 
wheel kicks up lots of mud, and it is beginning to manifest itself in Russia's 
centers. There we are seeing the proliferation of billboards, posters, and 
other types of advertisements endorsing American products. Russians are now 
watching their ancient cities, so rich in history and replete with beautiful 
structures, being littered by cheap American culture. I wonder what will go 
through Solzhenitsyn's mind when he sees the same flashy billboard from a 
highway in Vermont towering over the streets of Moscow.

TO INVITE FARRAKHAN IS TO INVITE RACISM; ANTI-SEMITISM: THE NAACP EMBRACE OF 
THE NATION OF ISLAM LEADER WILL IN THE END HARM BLACK PEOPLE AS WELL AS JEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LERNER, Michael Lerner's book Jewish Renewal will be published in 
September by Putnam. He is publisher of Tikkun magazine, based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Louis Farrakhan participates in the National Leadership Conference of the 
NAACP in Baltimore on Sunday, many Jews and others sensitive to anti-Semitism 
will be demonstrating outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's anti-Semitism and homophobia are well documented. They are not 
matters of the distant past, a time when he was talking about Judaism as a 
"gutter religion." Although he flirted briefly with lowering his anti-Semitic 
profile and tried to dissociate from the worst excesses of his lieutenant, 
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, during a recent television call-in show in California 
Farrakhan reverted his old hateful ways, suggesting that Jews had set up the 
Federal Reserve system and retained control over its money. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how black people would feel if a prominent Jewish leader were going 
around the country and drawing large Jewish crowds to hear him denounce "black 
crime." There are indeed a disproportionate number of black people who are 
arrested for crimes of violence, but there is nothing that makes their crimes 
black crimes. To talk about black crime suggests that there is something in the 
racial group that is the problem, and such a suggestion is false and racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there are Jews who have economic power, but they are not exercising 
that power for the sake of their community, under the auspices of the Jewish 
community or by virtue of being representatives of the Jewish community. To 
point to their Jewishness is to try to stir up resentments by others who have 
less economic power, and to suggest that it is "the Jews" who run things. This 
is false and racist. 
</P>
<P>
 It's false because it ignores the many Jews who are poor, the many Jews who 
are working-class, the many Jews who are struggling professionals and business 
people, and it falsely suggests that affluent Jews function in some corporate 
way, as Jews, to exercise disproportionate economic power, which they don't. In 
short, it falls into the old Nazi stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Semitic stereotypes were never publicly confronted and exposed as 
falsehoods in the United States in the way that sexism or anti-black racism 
were confronted in the past few decades. Anti-Semitism was prevalent in the 
1930s, then became unfashionable when the United States entered the war with 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because a full confrontation of anti-Semitic ideas would require a 
deep challenge to anti-Semitic depictions of Jews in the Gospel of John and 
some other sections of the New Testament, "polite society" has resisted doing 
more than keeping silent about the subject. When a small group of German and 
Polish theologians suggested recently that the Catholic Church might have to 
take some public responsibility for its role in creating the conditions that 
led to the Holocaust, they were quickly disavowed. So these ideas have 
continued to flourish, particularly at the economic margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Many African Americans have legitimate reasons to be angry about an economic 
system that has a structured rate of unemployment that guarantees that at least 
8% of the population won't get a job, and then concentrates that unemployment 
in a vastly disproportionate way on the black community. But instead of 
focusing anger at the real economic and political elites, Farrakhan and other 
demagogues encourage black people to express that anger against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there isn't real reason for black people to be angry at some Jews. 
Many of the mainstream Jewish organizations and publications have, over the 
course of the past 25 years, defected from the social-justice agenda, adopted 
neoconservative politics and prominently opposed programs that would alleviate 
the worst suffering visited on the African American community. Journals like 
Commentary and the New Republic can hardly contain their glee at the prospect 
of throwing young black mothers off welfare and young black men into prison. 
When Jewish intellectuals seek to blame poverty on "the culture of poverty," 
conveniently forgetting how just 100 years ago Jewish poverty was similarly 
attributed to Jewish pathologies, they participate in a racism that 
legitimately earns the ire of black people. 
</P>
<P>
 But African American leaders should also be vocal about the fact that Jews 
were, by and large, the only group to side with black people in opposition to 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 1980s and continue to back liberal 
programs of which they are the major beneficiaries. Moreover, if black people 
ignore racism in their own community, how can they expect others to fight its 
inevitable resurgence in the larger American polity should economic conditions 
worsen? Many Americans, caught up in the ethos of selfishness that continues to 
dominate this society, are only too happy to find excuses to lower their own 
taxes by voting against candidates who support social programs for the poor. It 
has often been Jews who have been in the vanguard of groups reminding their 
fellow citizens of their moral responsibility toward the oppressed. While many 
of us will continue to play this role out of commitment to Torah values, there 
are many more, torn between idealism and self-interest, who are increasingly 
resistant to a social-justice agenda when they perceive that the most oppressed 
are spitting in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan may be marginal at the moment, but the NAACP invitation has given 
him new avenues of entrance to more respectable communities. Taking the hint 
from its national office, the Fresno chapter of the NAACP sponsored a major 
rally at the Fresno Convention Center at which Farrakhan was the featured 
speaker, and Arsenio Hall hosted him on national television. The more his voice 
is legitimized, the more his poison will seem acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Farrakhan is only the tip of the iceberg, as was made clear last month 
when black students at San Francisco State University unveiled a mural portrait 
of Malcolm X, decorated in the margins with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel 
symbols. So we who will be demonstrating against Farrakhan will also be making 
a much more positive demand: that black leadership join with us and other 
progressive Jews to instigate a joint campaign against racism in the Jewish 
community and anti-Semitism in the black community. To keep it honest, the 
anti-racism campaign in the Jewish community should be supervised by black 
people, and the campaign against anti-Semitism in the black community should be 
supervised by Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 I continue to respect the NAACP and support its leadership. But we Jews want 
the black community to assure us that Farrakhan and a culture of anti-Semitism 
are not the wave of the future and that Jews will not be alone in facing this 
kind of racist assault. While some black leaders have been reluctant to 
challenge anti-Semitism publicly, fearing that they will be seen as "giving in 
to Jewish pressure," others realize that anti-Semitism is a poison that does 
damage to blacks as well, providing an excuse to those who wish to ignore the 
continuing economic deprivation and police brutality facing a significant 
percentage of black people. Joining with Jews to combat black anti-Semitism 
should in no way weaken the credibility of black leaders, except among people 
so hostile to Jews that they are willing to sacrifice the best interests of the 
black community.

DISPUTE-SCREENING AND ARBITRATION ARE ALTERNATIVES TO MILLION-DOLLAR AWARDS, 
WHICH PENALIZE ALL. ; STOP THE LITIGATION LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADELA de la TORRE, Adela de la Torre is an economist at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasing litigation against public servants portends a blow to the delivery 
of public services. Across the nation, million-dollar award settlements are 
rendered against urban police departments. And police departments are not the 
only victims: Litigation costs both in civil rights and personal injury have 
forced many municipalities to forgo youth sports programs due to lack of 
adequate insurance coverage. Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida 
says some researchers in this field consider the cost of insurance, lawyers and 
trials a "hidden litigation tax." 
</P>
<P>
 As with any tax, consumers must dig deep to either maintain the same level of 
services or accept reduction in services. Despite the growing need for improved 
services in public safety, education and public-health services in the urban 
core, the concern within many public-service delivery systems is shifting to 
avoiding financial liability. This culture of fear strips many public-sector 
employees of the ability to develop innovative programs and elevates, within 
many organizations, risk avoidance and mediocrity as primary objectives. We all 
have been accomplices in this self-destructive mentality, which seeks punitive 
damages even if it destroys rights for the community. The wisdom of Solomon is 
no match for justice corrupted by greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal system needs to provide meaningful boundaries to all individuals in 
society. But allowing the tort system to replace the market system in 
allocating resources should not be tolerated, either in the public or private 
sector. The new "litigation tax" provides a windfall of benefits to a few at 
the expense of all consumers. Each multimillion-dollar award that is paid out 
by a school district, police department or county health facility is paid by 
all of us, without regard to whether we can afford it. The regressive nature of 
this tax can only be seen as we drive through our cities and see locked 
schoolyards, no patrol officers and the decaying public infrastructure.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent study commissioned by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan suggested 
that shifting costs to city departments rather than using city reserves for 
payouts may help reduce the annual $140.5 million the city pays to settle 
lawsuits and workers' compensation claims. Theoretically, this would force 
department heads to scrutinize their employees' activities. But what happens if 
there is a human error that results in a multimillion-dollar mistake? Do we 
immediately lay off city employees and stop providing services to pay the 
damages? Or is it time to stop the emphasis on managing potential lawsuits and 
claims and focus on limiting our right to sue public entities? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and Great Britain have recognized this problem and have curtailed these 
costs by placing barriers to litigation and making it harder to win a suit. The 
problem is made worse in the United States by a payment system in which the 
lawyer gets a percentage of the award. Trial lawyers argue that such a payment 
system provides greater access to the courts for indigent clients. Yet look at 
all the television advertisements that do not speak of justice but of windfall 
wealth. Have we reached the point where the poor must play the litigation 
lottery to move ahead?  
</P>
<P>
 A viable mechanism to reduce litigation against public entities may be to 
resurrect the doctrine of sovereign immunity for school districts and local and 
county government. This doctrine prevents a litigant from bringing suit against 
public entities without their consent. It also provides the government with 
immunity from tort liability resulting from their provision of government 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 Although we may not want to provide such blanket immunity to government 
entities, we could adapt the doctrine to allow for an impartial screening of 
disputes that merit exceptions. We could also invest in more effective and less 
costly alternatives to dispute resolution such as mediation or arbitration.  
</P>
<P>
 Without meaningful tort reform in the public sector, we cannot honestly expect 
government to provide cost-effective services. Reforms in health care, schools 
and the police will become empty promises unless we include alternatives to 
costly litigation.  
</P>
<P>
 If we destroy our public-services delivery system, there will be no one in the 
private sector to provide these services. The litigation lottery must stop so 
that our efforts and resources may be focused on improving the delivery of 
public services to all.

PLATFORM; STRIKING PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONJA CASSELLA of Irvine comments on ways parents can take direct action to 
influence public schools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We parents may feel politically impotent regarding the schools, but we aren't. 
Public schools are funded by the number of days our children show up.If your 
kid is absent, the school loses tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever American parents are disgruntled, wherever we come to the conclusion 
that education is not happening at our local school, that schools are not 
serving the needs of our children, not teaching our values, and yes, not 
listening to us, we need to band together and strike. 
</P>
<P>
 If half the parents stopped sending their children to a particular school, 
even for a week, it would cost the school a lot of money -- and that gets 
administrators' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's demand education, not excuses: smaller class sizes; art, music and 
cultural-enrichment programs; opportunities for children to work individually 
at their own pace. Funds need to go directly to classrooms, not to 
administration. And parents should be consulted about what schools teach. If we 
want an Afrocentric curriculum, it should be taught. I don't care what teachers 
and theorists suggest. They've had their chance to improve schools. They've 
failed and we parents are the last line of defense our children have.

TITANS GET SLAM, BEAT SEMINOLES; BASEBALL: KOTSAY BATS IN SEVEN RUNS AS CAL 
STATE FULLERTON WINS, 10-3, AT COLLEGE WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Kotsay had gotten the word from Cal State Fullerton batboy Marco 
Martelli. He told Kotsay he was going to hit a home run Tuesday against Florida 
State in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay made the son of volunteer assistant coach Joe Martelli a seer when he 
hit a grand slam while tying the CWS record with seven runs batted in as the 
Titans won, 10-3, in an elimination game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay said the batboy told him, " 'I told your dad that you were going to hit 
a home run today.' It was in the back of my head all day when I was at the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
 The left fielder had a sacrifice fly in the fifth inning, a two-run double in 
the seventh and the grand slam in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other players had seven RBIs in a CWS game -- Carl Thomas of Arizona in 
1954 and Stan Holmes of Arizona State in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, seeded No. 7, moved into today's semifinal game against No. 2 
Georgia Tech (49-16). The Titans (46-15) were 2-0 losers to Georgia Tech in 
Friday's first round, and would force a third game between the teams Friday if 
they beat the Yellow Jackets. A Fullerton loss would let Georgia Tech move into 
Saturday's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-seeded Seminoles (53-22) opened with a three-run first inning on 
Colby Weaver's RBI single, a run-scoring double by Link Jarrett and a 
ground-out by Steve Nedeau. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedeau's grounder knocked out starter Chad Rolish, and Dan Ricabal (12-1) shut 
down the Seminoles the rest of the way. He allowed three hits and retired 15 in 
a row before giving up a leadoff walk in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Ricabal certainly was the story of that ballgame -- what a performance," 
Florida State Coach Mike Martin said. "That kid can pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan pitching coach George Horton said the decision was made to start Rolish 
because "Ricabal is a weapon we want to use over and over again rather than in 
a one-game format such as this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal said: "I was a little disappointed (in not starting). But I knew where 
(Horton) was coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 D.C. Olsen singled home the Titans' first run in the second, then Kotsay's fly 
ball scored Jack Jones, who had led off the fifth with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is capable of the exceptional," Fullerton State Coach Augie Garrido said 
of Kotsay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he was going to be a tough out," Martin said. "We tried to have a 
left-hander in there against him whenever he came up, except when he hit that 
double. He just took that pitch the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton chased Seminole starter Charlie Cruz (3-4) after two one-out walks 
in the seventh. Jeff Ferguson singled off reliever Phil Olson to load the bases 
for Kotsay, who doubled to left to drive in two. Dante Powell walked, and Adam 
Millan followed with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Two walks, an error and a fielder's choice filled the bases for Kotsay in the 
eighth, and he hit his fourth homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Hemphill capped the scoring with his sixth homer of the year in the 
ninth.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS IT TIME TO BOND?; YIELDS EDGING DOWN SLOWLY WHILE 
STOCKS RECOUP LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has Wall Street turned the corner, after a dismal winter and early spring? 
</P>
<P>
 Without much fanfare, many investors are seeing their stock and bond assets 
rise in value once again, if at a snail's pace: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bonds have been appreciating as market yields have slowly edged lower since 
May 9, after rocketing almost nonstop since late January. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, the benchmark for long-term interest rates, 
has dropped to 7.26% now, after surging from 6.35% at year's end to 7.65% as of 
May 9. Yields on other types of bonds also have edged lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market, taking a cue from bonds, has rallied modestly since 
mid-May, raising hopes for the proverbial "summer rally" on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which slumped 5.2% between 
Jan. 1 and May 9, has gained 3.6% since. And the Dow Jones industrial average, 
at 3,755.91 at Tuesday's close, has recouped all of its losses and now is 
slightly above its year-end close of 3,754.09. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit for the markets' healthier tone, of course, goes largely to the 
same entity responsible for driving investors into a selling frenzy earlier in 
the year: the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's decision to begin tightening credit on Feb. 4, for the first time in 
five years, was the equivalent of yelling "fire!" in a crowded movie theater. 
By raising short-term interest rates from 30-year lows, the central bank in 
effect booted speculators out of the stock and bond markets, and focused bond 
owners in particular on the idea that the economy was growing fast enough to 
reignite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But just four months after the Fed's policy shift, the principal goal of that 
shift -- to slow the economy to a moderate pace, with low inflation -- appears 
to be working. Or at least, that's what the Fed apparently believes. 
</P>
<P>
 In public and private statements over the past few weeks, Fed officials have 
strongly projected the idea that they're satisfied with their decisions so far 
this year, and that they're comfortable leaving short-term interest rates alone 
for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the promise of stability has proved to be a powerful tonic. A 
key moment for the markets occurred last Friday, when the government reported a 
sharp drop in the May unemployment rate, but stock and bond markets failed to 
view the report as a reason to resurrect old worries about too-fast economic 
growth and inflation. Bond yields actually edged lower on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed's recent soothing tone, "The market is accepting that these 
yields (on bonds) are appropriate for the likely events in the economy" over 
the near-term, says Kevin Logan, economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Anderson, president of money manager IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis, 
notes that the market isn't just taking the Fed at its word. Despite the 
puzzling unemployment report, many of the economic indicators reported in 
recent weeks have suggested "that the economy is slowing just a tad," Anderson 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bond market has been helped by other factors, Anderson says. 
A plunge in grain and soybean prices over the past week, as much-needed rain 
fell on the dry Midwest, has helped further reduce inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
 And a strengthening dollar has given foreign investors new incentive to buy 
U.S. bonds and stocks, because each increase in the dollar's value causes 
foreigners' assets here to appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many experts caution investors against expecting a sharp decline in 
long-term interest rates from current levels. More likely is that yields will 
trade in a narrow range for at least a few months, until it's clear that the 
economy is either slowing further, accelerating again or continuing to grow at 
the same moderate pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss Bank's Logan, for example, figures the 30-year Treasury bond yield, now 
7.26%, will bounce between 7.1% and 7.6% this summer as traders push the market 
to and fro, alternately starting rallies and then selling into them. 
</P>
<P>
 William Gross, a principal at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co. in 
Newport Beach, figures the T-bond yield range this summer will be 7% to 7.5%. 
"There's probably not going to be a lot of excitement in the bond market, 
relative to what we've seen" in recent months, Gross says. 
</P>
<P>
 For many bond investors, a lack of excitement would be welcome, after the 
losses incurred in the market in winter and early spring. But experts also 
caution investors to use this period of relative calm to assess whether they 
should stay in bonds. If the economy accelerates again later this year or in 
1995, interest rates could surge again, causing more principal losses for bond 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pros worry that the next shock to the bond market will happen sooner 
rather than later. Alfred Kugel, investment strategist at Stein, Roe and 
Farnham in Chicago, expects to see some "un-rallying" in the bond market over 
the next two months, with yields jumping again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think some of the economic and inflation numbers ahead will be a little 
stronger than the consensus view now discounts," Kugel says. The first such 
test could come Friday, when the government reports on wholesale inflation in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the consensus view is in fact correct -- and the economy continues to 
moderate -- what are the smartest bond market investments today? 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond pros say the high-yield "junk" corporate bond market is a good bet, 
because junk yields haven't dropped in line with yields on Treasury bonds since 
mid-May. "I think the high-yield market is in great shape fundamentally and 
technically," says Frederick Cavanaugh, manager of the $410-million John 
Hancock Strategic Income fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 For a simpler bet, Pacific Investment Management's Gross says investors should 
look at intermediate-term Treasury securities. The yield on 5-year T-notes, for 
example, is 6.52% now. At that level, Gross says, the market is assuming that 
the Fed will raise short-term interest rates another full percentage point or 
more by year's end. If the Fed doesn't take that strong a step (Gross doubts 
they'll have to), then there's room for 5-year T-note yields to come down, 
Gross says. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the stock market? Anderson of IDS says the market may be about to 
replay the cycle of the last two years, only in condensed version. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank and other financial stocks have already rallied over the past month, he 
notes, as bond yields have fallen. The next move, Anderson says, should be in 
some of the economy-sensitive stocks that have been beaten down hardest since 
winter -- autos, retailers and airlines, for example.

RANGERS POWERED BY LEETCH; GAME 4: NEW YORK BEATS THE CANUCKS, 4-2, AND CAN WIN 
THE STANLEY CUP ON THURSDAY AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their paths were intertwined, the two young stars who carried their teams to 
the Stanley Cup finals. For several memorable moments, New York Ranger 
defenseman Brian Leetch and Vancouver Canuck right wing Pavel Bure reached new 
heights until Leetch took the Rangers a giant step down the path to their first 
Cup in 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch sparked a Ranger rally Tuesday night with his 10th goal of the playoffs 
and set up three more as the Rangers scored a 4-2 victory at the Pacific 
Coliseum. He also figured in a pivotal play for the Canucks by pulling down 
Bure on a breakaway that resulted in a penalty shot. Bure, who had set up 
Vancouver's second goal, shot the puck into Mike Richter's right leg and was 
not heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do a lot of the things Pavel can, so I just look for opportunities," 
Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed to be little Leetch couldn't do Tuesday in giving the Rangers a 
3-1 lead in the series. Only the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs have rallied from a 
3-1 deficit to win the Cup, and if the Canucks are to duplicate that, they must 
start to do it at New York's Madison Square Garden on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is going to be a madhouse," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said. "The fan 
support is bordering on fanatical.' 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Vancouver crowd of 16,150 that seemed fanatical as the Canucks 
took a 2-0 lead. Trevor Linden's re-direction of a Jyrki Lumme shot from the 
slot at 13:25 gave the Canucks their first power-play goal of the series, and 
Cliff Ronning banged in the rebound of a Bure shot at 16:19. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean made a glove save on Leetch on a breakaway 
at 18:43, the game seemed to belong to the Canucks. But the Rangers clawed 
back, first on Leetch's long goal through a screen at 4:03 of the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Canucks had a chance to win after Leetch pulled Bure down and 
referee Terry Gregson pointed to center ice, signaling a penalty shot. "It was 
a good call," Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure tried the same move he used against Calgary's Mike Vernon in Vancouver's 
first-round series. He scored a double-overtime goal against Vernon but wasn't 
as successful against Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out from the net and that's why I couldn't shoot," said Bure, who 
skated in on Richter and tried to slip a forehand shot past the goalie from 
about five feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter got his right toe on the puck, no more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen (Bure's use of that same move)," he said. "I wasn't looking for 
that particular move, though. He's too good to think he has only one move." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keenan: "It was a classic confrontation between one of the most, if not 
the most, electrifying forwards in the game right now and an outstanding 
goaltender who hasn't been given much recognition throughout the playoffs. That 
was the biggest stop he's ever made in his career, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty shot was the seventh ever taken in the finals. None have been 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure it was a factor," Canuck Coach Pat Quinn said. "We were 
playing well up until that time. I'm not so sure it was a downer for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence suggests otherwise. The Rangers, who had only five power plays to 
11 for the Canucks, tied the score on a power play with 15.2 seconds left in 
the second period. Sergei Zubov, after taking a pass from Leetch, held onto the 
puck while several Rangers went to the net to screen McLean or be in position 
for rebounds. As Canuck defenseman Dave Babych skated through the goalie's 
sight, Zubov let loose and the puck slipped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei Kovalev broke the tie on another Ranger power play. Leetch dodged Brian 
Glynn at the blue line and feathered a pass to Kovalev, who had sneaked behind 
Lumme. All Kovalev had to do was lift it over McLean's left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2:04 to play, Steve Larmer's dump-in attempt bounced off Babych's leg and 
past a startled McLean.

ANDERSON, ANGELS TUNE OUT EARLY, LOSE TO TWINS, 8-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anderson family was home in Geneva, Ohio, scanning the channels Tuesday 
night on their satellite dish trying to tune into the Angels' game against the 
Minnesota Twins, which would end up an 8-6 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't stand the idea of not being able to watch their son, Angel 
starter Brian Anderson, pitch his first game in a month. But if they had to, 
they would resort to the archaic method. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds ridiculous," said Janice Anderson, Brian's mother, "but 
we've sat up all night just keeping it on CNN and watching the ticker 
constantly update the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be maddening, but sometimes, you don't have any choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice and Jim Anderson were finally able to locate the game on their dish and 
stayed up past 2 a.m. watching the Angels (24-34) lose for the eighth time in 
nine games, but they did have one question when the game finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that really their son who started for the Angels in front of 16,045 at 
Anaheim Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 The reception was fuzzy, and sometimes it was difficult to tell who was 
pitching, but it sure didn't look like the son they remembered. He gave up five 
hits, walked four batters and allowed four earned runs in 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mechanically, I was brutal," Anderson said. "Throwing strikes is usually what 
I'm best at. I fell behind everyone early." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Janice Anderson: "Well, I guess everybody's entitled to a bad one now and 
then. But really, I'm just amazed that he's back as fast as he is. His spirits 
were good during the whole time. He never got down." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson (3-1), making his first start since May 6 when he broke his left 
thumb, was annoyed with his control problems. He can't remember walking four 
batters in a game in his life. He walked only six batters his entire junior 
season at Wright State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make any excuses," Anderson said. "You're supposed to come 
back at 100%. I'm not going to get down on myself because I can't afford to 
mope around. Just come back at them in five (days)." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson fell behind eight of the 17 batters he faced, walking three in the 
second inning. Yet, the Angels still provided him a 3-1 lead entering the third 
inning, thanks to shortstop Gary DiSarcina's two-run double in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the third inning, Anderson could no longer contain the Twins. 
DiSarcina rescued him by leaping to catch Shane Mack's line drive for the first 
out. Kirby Puckett followed by hitting a double to left. Dave Winfield walked. 
Pedro Munoz then flied to right for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson got ahead of Scott Leius, but helplessly watched Leius hit a two-run 
double to left center. David McCarty followed with another double, and Anderson 
was out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it appeared that the Angels could win the game after they took a 5-4 
lead in the fifth inning when Chad Curtis hit a one-out double. Tim Salmon 
scored him with another double. And Chili Davis followed with a run-scoring 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead stood while Mark Leiter continued to shut down the Twins until the 
eighth inning. He got the first two outs in the eighth when pinch-hitter Chip 
Hale hit a single up the middle. Chuck Knoblauch followed with another single, 
advancing Hale to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, deciding that Leiter had enough after five innings, summoned closer 
Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe hit Mack on the second pitch, loading the bases for Puckett. Then, he 
hit Puckett, forcing in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield slapped a single up the middle, scoring Knoblauch and Mack for a 7-5 
lead. The Twins added another run in the ninth when Leius led off with a homer 
to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels scored a run and had runners on second and third with one out in 
the ninth with Jim Edmonds at bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Aguilera struck out Edmonds on a full count, and after falling behind 
3-and-0 to J.T. Snow, winced when Snow hit a long drive to center. The ball 
reached the front of the track and fell into center fielder Alex Cole's glove 
for the final out.

COLLEGE BASEBALL WORLD SERIES; RICABAL, KOTSAY BRING TITANS BACK, 10-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 When reliever Dan Ricabal went to the dugout after retiring Florida State in 
the first inning Tuesday, the Cal State Fullerton pitcher said to himself: "Get 
me four runs and we'll win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who trailed at that point, 3-0, did that and more. And Ricabal can 
be especially grateful to freshman Mark Kotsay, who drove in seven runs, 
including four with a grand slam in the eighth, as Fullerton scored a 10-3 
victory over Florida State in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay's RBI total tied a series record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal, who has become a key factor in the Titans' bid for a national 
championship, gave up only three hits in the final 8 1/3 innings after taking 
over for Chad Rolish with two out in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sent Fullerton (47-15) into today's rematch against Georgia Tech 
(45-15) at 4:36 p.m. (PDT), with the same starting pitchers as in Friday's 
opener, Brad Rigby (14-4) for the Yellow Jackets and Mike Parisi (11-4) for the 
Titans. Rigby won that game, 2-0. Fullerton must defeat Georgia Tech, unbeaten 
in the tournament, tonight and Friday to reach the title game against the 
lower-bracket winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricabal was the story of this game," Florida State Coach Mike Martin said. 
"What a tremendous job of pitching. . . . We've seen him before, but this was 
clearly one of his better moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Augie Garrido and associate head coach George Horton, who handles 
the pitchers, didn't decide on a starter until about two hours before the game, 
opting for the left-handed Rolish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny has been our best pitcher," Horton said. "He was our best in the 
regional, but we wanted to save some pitches for him if we could. He's a weapon 
we want to use over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal said he was "a little disappointed but not mad" when he learned he 
wasn't starting, and added: "You always want to start in a (big) game, but 
Coach Horton explained it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal (12-1), who struggled early in the season, won two games in the NCAA 
regional and has been the winning pitcher in nine of Fullerton's last 17 
victories. His college record is 23-4. Not bad for a guy the major leagues 
didn't bother to draft last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so focused today that I couldn't compare it to any other game I 
pitched," Ricabal said. "I just wanted to go out and throw strikes and keep us 
in the game, and little by little we seemed to get our momentum back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans picked up single runs in the second and fifth innings, the latter 
on Kotsay's sacrifice fly, then pulled ahead with three runs in the seventh, 
the big blow being Kotsay's two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Titans leading, 5-3, in the eighth, two walks and a fielding error 
loaded the bases for Kotsay, who hit his fourth home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed to happen naturally," Kotsay said of his blast to right field. 
"I don't even know what was in my head at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Bret Hemphill hit a bases-empty homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 9, Miami 5 -- Jacob Cruz and Antone Williamson each hit two home 
runs to lead the Sun Devils, who kept alive their absent coach's hope for a 
third College World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brock, who is fighting cancer, returned to Phoenix earlier Tuesday on the 
advice of his family physician and was resting comfortably in a Mesa hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils tied a CWS record with five home runs -- Todd Cady also hit one 
-- as they gave Brock his 1,100th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (45-17) handed top-seeded Miami (49-14) both of its losses in 
the tournament, having scored a 4-0 victory in the opening round Saturday.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Salmon was the best rookie in the American League last year, but not the 
best in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said about his sophomore year so far. . . . Salmon is an 
exceptional young talent who happens to be taken for granted sometimes because 
of the presence of Mike Piazza in the next county. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, new Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann appreciates his right fielder to 
the fullest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a guy who will bat between .280 and .300, drive in between 
90 and 100 runs, hit between 25 and 35 home runs and be an above-average 
fielder for a lot of years," Lachemann said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salmon is a streak hitter who last month put together the kind of streak that 
only Joe Cronin in 1933 and Walt Dropo in 1952 had enjoyed in the American 
League -- 13 hits over three consecutive games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 During the 13-for-15 binge that included seven singles, three home runs, two 
doubles and a triple, his teammates asked him if they could touch his bat. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody made such a request during his recent mini-slump, but most of Salmon's 
numbers project even better than a year ago, when he hit .283 with 31 home runs 
and 95 RBIs before missing the last two weeks because of a broken finger that 
required surgery. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't worry about the sophomore jinx, saying that the pitchers got to 
know him and he got to know them the second half of last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Timothy James Salmon is 25 years old, 6 feet 3 and 215 pounds.He was born in 
Long Beach and grew up in Phoenix, where he was a marketing major at Grand 
Canyon College, an NAIA school whose basketball team used to be coached by Paul 
Westphal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is a "third or fourth" cousin of Academy Award-winning actress Holly 
Hunter. He has never met her, but she once left a message on his phone machine 
and their grandparents have exchanged letters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tim's brother, Mike, who was a safety at USC, is expected to try out in the 
NFL as a free agent this summer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tim liked playing football better than baseball in high school but was a much 
better hitter than a wide receiver or defensive back. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He and wife Marci are the proud parents of infant daughter Callie, who's first 
birthday will be June 18. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salmon enjoys hiking in the mountains near his Phoenix home, bike riding, and 
playing golf. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What is his handicap on the golf course? "Very serious," he says. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You've heard about players having the Tommy John surgery," Tommy John said 
the other night at Anaheim Stadium. "Well, I had the Bo Jackson surgery." . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the old left-hander underwent left hip replacement surgery. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 But now he is able to pitch batting practice occasionally for the Minnesota 
Twins, as well as serve as analyst on 73 of their telecasts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The hitters have passed the pitchers by in work habits, strength, and 
technique," John said. "These guys pump iron and they're strong." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John looked out to the destruction in the upper-deck seats in left field 
caused by the January earthquake and cracked, "Some of the balls I threw here 
must have started that damage." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The new Anaheim Stadium scoreboard, which will be the second-largest in 
baseball, behind the Skydome's in Toronto, is expected to be installed before 
September. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's games, American League West teams were a combined 44 games 
under .500. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If I were Tom Lasorda, I would stay with my starting pitchers as long as 
possible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants apparently are serious about signing Darryl 
Strawberry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Davis is on the disabled list for the eighth time in his career. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Johnson, who has pitched 27 consecutive shutout innings, has refused to 
have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal Expos quietly have compiled the second-best record in the 
National League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Righetti, who won't give up, is pitching at Knoxville of the double-A 
Southern League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Chris Antley says he gets extra pumped for Friday night racing at 
Hollywood Park, and the results show. He has 11 winners in 28 mounts under the 
lights. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Forum will have two fight shows in three days -- what was supposed to be 
the undercard to the Riddick Bowe-Buster Mathis card, that was canceled, on 
Saturday and a regular program on Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks play basketball the way the Philadelphia Flyers used to 
play hockey and Freddie Blassie used to wrestle.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ALVAREZ LEARNS HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilson Alvarez said his fastball was "real good." Toronto's hitters liked it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez's 15-game regular-season winning streak was stopped Tuesday night when 
the Blue Jays beat the White Sox, 9-5, at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those nights I felt real good, but I couldn't get anybody out," 
Alvarez said. "I felt I had a real good fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Alomar hit a two-run home run and an RBI single as the Blue Jays 
scored in each of the first six innings and handed Alvarez (8-1) his first loss 
since Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the streak is over. Now, I have to start one all over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who won his last seven regular-season decisions in 1993 plus Game 3 
of the American League championship series, shared the club record with LaMarr 
Hoyt, who won 15 in a row in 1983-84. Cleveland's Johnny Allen and Baltimore's 
Dave McNally share the AL mark at 17 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez allowed six runs and eight hits in three innings, walking two and 
striking out one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he had real control of his pitches and we were fortunate to get 
to him early," said Mike Huff, who homered and doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrin Jackson drove in all five Chicago runs, including a grand slam off Pat 
Hentgen (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 7, Baltimore 3 -- David Cone became the first nine-game winner in 
the American League when the Royals rallied for five runs in the sixth inning 
at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Chico Lind and Wally Joyner each had two-out, two-run singles in the rally as 
Cone (9-2) outpitched Ben McDonald, who was also seeking his ninth victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone had won eight in a row before losing a game and then getting a 
no-decision in his last start on June 1 at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald (8-4), who was knocked out in the sixth, was making his first start 
since he sustained a groin injury on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 10, New York 9 -- David Hulse and Jose Canseco each hit a home run to 
key a six-run first inning at Arlington, Tex., as the Rangers outlasted the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark also homered, and Esteban Beltre went three for four with two RBIs. 
Texas won for the seventh time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly, Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams hit homers for the Yankees, 
who have dropped five of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Milwaukee 5 -- Ruben Sierra's second home run of the game snapped 
an eighth-inning tie as the Athletics won at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's had blown a 5-0 lead before Sierra hit a 1-and-2 pitch from Doug Henry 
(2-2) over the right-field wall. Sierra, who has 14 homers, hit one 
right-handed and one left-handed for the fourth time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Taylor (1-3) picked up the victory, despite giving up a game-tying 
three-run homer to B.J. Surhoff in the seventh inning. Dennis Eckersley pitched 
the ninth for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee's Teddy Higuera was hammered for the third consecutive time. He 
allowed five runs, four of them earned, and six hits in three-plus innings. 
Higuera has not pitched past the fourth inning in any of his last three starts, 
allowing 18 earned runs in 8 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 5, Detroit 1 -- The Red Sox broke a four-game losing streak in the 
usual way, behind Roger Clemens' pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens is 101-36 in games after Boston losses -- 3-0 this year. He struck out 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Rowland hit a two-run homer to help out at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 9, Cleveland 5 -- Felix Fermin hit an RBI single, and pinch-hitter 
Torey Lovullo added a three-run homer in the eighth inning for the Mariners in 
a victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Buhner doubled off Derek Lilliquist (1-2) to lead off the eighth, and 
Brian Turang's sacrifice put Buhner at third. Mike Blowers walked, and Fermin 
hit an infield single off Jose Mesa to make it 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, pinch-hitting for Bill Haselman, homered on Mesa's first pitch. 
Lovullo's second homer gave the Mariners 83 this season, tops in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey, Jr. hit his major league-leading 24th homer, and Tino Martinez 
also homered for the Mariners.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GIANTS' MCGEE HURT, MAY BE OUT FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker watched the recurrence of a nightmare 
in the sixth inning at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 When Matt Williams homered in the 10th for a 3-2 victory over the Pirates, it 
seemed to pale in significance with the memory of Willie McGee's crashing into 
the right-field wall earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis was a torn left Achilles' tendon, and McGee will be sidelined 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has seen it before and he knows it usually means repair and 
rehabilitation for the rest of the season, but he doesn't want to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough. I played with two players who had that -- Reggie Smith and Rick 
Monday -- and it took them some time (to come back)," Baker said. "But it 
doesn't mean all year. It means, 'who knows?' There can be different degrees of 
tears in there." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee, a four-time All-Star batting .282 with five homers and 23 RBIs, will 
return to San Francisco today to be examined by Giant orthopedist Warren King. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hurt when he unsuccessfully tried to make a back-handed, over-the-head 
catch of Orlando Merced's run-scoring triple in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran face first into the right-field wall and came down awkwardly on his 
left leg. His left foot appeared to snag between the bottom of the fence 
padding and the outfield warning track. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' home run, his 21st, led off the 10th inning and came against 
reliever Rick White, who knew he had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I threw it, I just yelled, 'Damn,' " White said. "My only hope was 
I yelled so loud that it might scare him and he might not do anything with it. 
I knew it was gone. You don't throw letter-high pitches to the leading home-run 
hitter in the National League and get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 0 -- Erik Hanson rebounded from two miserable starts 
by pitching one-hit ball for eight innings as the Reds won at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson (4-5), who had surrendered 13 earned runs and 22 hits in 7 2/3 innings 
in his two previous starts, and who had been passed up for his last scheduled 
start, gave up a single to Ozzie Smith with one out in the first inning, then 
retired 20 batters in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds broke open the game with a five-run sixth inning against Bob 
Tewksbury (8-4), who lost for the fourth time in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 7, Chicago 6 -- Pinch-hitter Billy Hatcher's first hit for the 
Phillies drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning at Philadelphia as the 
Cubs lost their eighth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Daulton singled with one out against Randy Myers (0-3), moved up on a 
groundout and was running on the pitch when Hatcher singled to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Quantrill (1-0), who retired one batter in the eighth inning, got his 
first NL victory. Doug Jones pitched the ninth for his league-leading 15th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Houston 2 -- Marquis Grissom's single in the seventh inning scored 
the go-ahead run at Montreal and lifted the Expos to their sixth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom's one-out liner off David Veres (2-3) scored Sean Berry and made Gil 
Heredia (2-2), who pitched 1 1/3 innings of hitless relief, the winning 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 12, San Diego 3 -- Fred McGriff homered for the third time in four 
games and drove in five runs as the Braves won at Atlanta for their seventh 
victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves continued to play the numbers game with McGriff, who has 17 homers. 
They are 29-3 in games in which he has homered, 15-1 this season. They are also 
89-36 since acquiring him from San Diego last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Mercker (4-1) gave up two runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 10, New York 8 -- Shortstop Jose Vizcaino's error enabled the Rockies 
to score the go-ahead run in the eighth inning at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado scored five runs in the seventh inning to take an 8-4 lead, but the 
Mets rallied with four in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Liriano led off the Rockies' eighth with a double against Roger Mason 
(2-3). Andres Galarraga was intentionally walked and Liriano scored when Dante 
Bichette's grounder squirted under Vizcaino's glove.

OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS: HOLY MACKEREL! LOST KING SALMON FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICH ROBERTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fishermen can never be certain what they're going to catch when they start the 
day. Dan Gefis had planned to get in on the recent run of thresher sharks off 
Dana Point. That's why he was fishing for mackerel -- to use as shark bait -- 
when he caught a king salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills angler motored his 33-foot sportfisher Kat Dan Du out of Dana 
Point Harbor early Saturday with his wife and four friends aboard. They started 
drift-fishing for baitfish near the "barber pole" race marks on a 10-foot-deep 
shelf about a mile out, throwing anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
 When his spinning rod bent double, Gefis suspected it wasn't a mackerel, and 
when he boated it 20 minutes later, it looked like something that had lost its 
way. Could it be . . . a salmon? 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hayes was on duty at the fuel dock when Gefis returned. He weighed the 
fish at 16 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a salmon," Hayes said. "I just wasn't sure what kind. It's the 
first one I've seen come in here in two years, but years ago, they used to run 
up the San Juan River right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gefis: "I was told that if it had dark lips, it's a king." 
</P>
<P>
 No reason to believe it wasn't, said Steve Crooke, a senior sportfish marine 
biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game in Long Beach. 
Although catching one is rare, the presence of king salmon off the local coast 
is "not unusual for this time of year," Crooke said.

<P>
 "The San Joaquin run of king salmon in California are the ones that go out the 
(San Francisco) Bay and turn left. Some of them just keep on going south." 
</P>
<P>
 Crooke recalled that during the winter of 1981-82, salmon were so thick off 
San Martin Island 160 miles south of the border that Mexican fishermen were 
collecting them in gill-nets. A few are also caught off Newport Beach each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 About once a year, a salmon is reported taken at Cabo San Lucas, but that's a 
running hoax perpetuated by an American who smuggles in a dead salmon, sneaks 
it onto his boat and then produces it at the dock as a catch. If he ever really 
catches one, nobody will believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Gefis' story has a mixed ending. He has been competing in Dana West Yacht 
Club's Rodbusters fishing tournament, but the thresher bite turned off this 
month, and there is no salmon category. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Larry Edwards' mission is to see every marlin caught at Cabo San Lucas 
returned to the sea alive. Edwards is president of Cortez Yacht Charters and 
thus has a stake in preserving the resource, as well as an aversion to wasting 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for a guy to take a billfish, but they do," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said his Gaviota Fleet has a release rate of 79.8% for 1,054 striped 
marlin caught this year, and now he is offering charter masters for commercial 
sportfishing cruisers a year's membership in the Billfish Foundation, which 
promotes the ethic worldwide. The Baja Mar and Ixtapa fleets have signed up. An 
angler releasing a marlin gets an attractive piece of parchment certifying what 
a conservationist he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless an angler wants a live mount, as against an ecologically correct 
fiberglass mount, a kept fish is usually given to the crew, anyway. Because 
Mexican sportfish crews work for poor wages and can't eat or sell a fish that's 
been released, to make up for the loss, Edwards said, "We encourage the anglers 
to tip generously." 
</P>
<P>

FISHING REPORT: A WEEK TO REMEMBER FOR FRESHWATER CATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California and the Eastern Sierra offered something for everyone in 
freshwater fishing last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego City lakes weighed in with six largemouth bass, from 10 pounds 9 
ounces to 14-7 at Otay, and a 42-pound 3-ounce blue catfish -- largest of the 
year -- at San Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
 Posing for a picture, 5-year-old Jonathan Murata of Rosamond strained to hold 
the 5 1/2-pound rainbow trout he caught at Convict Lake, and veteran bass 
expert Bob Crupi drew attention by taking an 11 1/4-pound largemouth while 
"field testing" a new plastic lure at Castaic.

DECISION '94: THE PRIMARIES; 4 TO FACE RUNOFF FOR 2 SUPERVISOR SEATS; 
ELECTIONS: VOTER TURNOUT AT RECORD-LOW 38%. APATHY, LACK OF COMPELLING BALLOT 
INITIATIVES CITED.

<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo took the early lead in a tight race for 
one east county supervisor's seat Tuesday, while Moorpark City Councilman Scott 
Montgomery and two Simi Valley council members battled for runoff spots in a 
separate supervisorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White easily beat out defense attorney James 
Farley in a highly charged race for Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo was followed in the early voting by former Supervisor Madge Schaefer 
and attorney Trudi Loh. Taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings and rancher Carter 
Ward trailed in the race for the 2nd District supervisorial seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th District race, Simi Valley council member Judy Mikels took a slight 
early lead over Montgomery and Simi Valley council member Barbara Williamson. 
Parks official James Meredith was running fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial race between White and Farley was one of the most heated in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm humbled by it," White said of her victory. "I'm gratified by it. We 
worked real hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the law-and-order scare tactics worked," Farley said. "I hope someday 
we can get past Willie Horton and talk about the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout was at a record low with only about 38% of the county's 339,356 
registered voters casting ballots in the governor's primary. Election officials 
blamed voter apathy and a lack of compelling ballot initiatives for the low 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 In other county races Tuesday, appointed incumbent Auditor-Controller Thomas 
O. Mahon topped a field of five candidates, but appeared headed for a runoff in 
November. He was followed most closely in the voting by Ventura accountants 
Scott Weiss and Richard A. Morrisset. 
</P>
<P>
 County Clerk Richard Dean deflected the aggressive challenge of Daniel 
Schmidt, the owner of a legal publishing business, while acting Tax Assessor 
Glenn E. Gray beat Ventura City Councilman Jack Tingstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 And Charles Weis, appointed incumbent Ventura County Superintendent of 
Schools, led aggressive challenger Dan Flynn, principal of the county's schools 
for juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Three top county department heads -- including Sheriff Larry Carpenter, Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Tax Collector Hal Pittman -- were automatically 
returned to office because they faced no opposition. Two Superior Court judges 
and two Municipal Court judges were also unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County voters will have to wait until the fall to decide 
races for the two county supervisor seats. The two top vote-getters in each 
race will go head-to-head in a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2nd District race to replace retiring incumbent Maria VanderKolk, 
Schillo, a 10-year veteran of the Thousand Oaks City Council, and Loh, a 
political newcomer, both ran aggressive campaigns that took on a nastier tone 
in the final days before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates spent the past week trading jabs over Schillo's record and 
Loh's lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, who portrays herself as a staunch environmentalist, attacked Schillo and 
Schaefer in a mailer as "failed politicians" who stood by and watched as the 
east county has been overrun with development and crime. Schillo hit back with 
a newspaper ad that declared: "Now is not the time for a learn-as-you-go 
supervisor. Now is the time for experience and leadership!" 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said she was outraged by Loh's mailer, saying it was full of 
inaccurate and misleading information. For her part, Schaefer ran on a campaign 
to increase gang prevention services as a way to curb increasing incidents of 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings pledged to cut government waste and perks for county officials. And 
Ward promised to ease regulations to allow more development in the county's 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th District race to replace retiring Supervisor Vicky Howard, 
Williamson painted Mikels as a defender of the status quo and questioned her 
fiscal priorities in electing to spend $2.8 million in redevelopment funds to 
convert an abandoned church into a cultural arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels questioned Williamson's commitment to her job as a Simi Valley council 
member, saying she avoids committee assignments and has missed numerous 
meetings. She also said that Williamson, who was elected to the council in 
1992, lacks the experience necessary to serve as a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mikels, Montgomery trumpeted his experience serving on a number of city 
and county committees and promised to reduce government regulations on 
business. Meredith, who re-entered the supervisor's race last week after 
dropping out early in the campaign, pledged to promote more tourism in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for an open seat on the Superior Court bench produced a fierce 
campaign that pitted a pair of legal opposites against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, Farley criticized White for her lack of courtroom 
experience. White has served as a top administrator in the district attorney's 
office for 11 years, but with little time spent in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent debate, White shot back, calling Farley a "born-again crime 
fighter" for choosing to run for a judge's seat after spending 27 years as a 
defense attorney.

DECISION '94: THE PRIMARIES; PORT HUENEME TAPS TAX HIKE; OAK PARK OPTS FOR 
STATUS QUO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In local ballot initiatives Tuesday across Ventura County, Oak Park residents 
showed early support for remaining an unincorporated community, while Port 
Hueneme voters in early returns were narrowly favoring a tax increase to keep 
their city police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a countywide measure that would enable transit officials to tap 
into a statewide gas tax fund was receiving widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Santa Paula, an initiative that would raise property taxes to salvage 
services in the ailing local library appeared headed for victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, Valorie Morrison, chairwoman of the campaign to pass Measure 
Z, said she was optimistic that the initiative would get the two-thirds margin 
required for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know we're going to win," Morrison said. "We've been working seven 
months on this campaign and the feedback we've been getting has just been 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hopkins, Port Hueneme's chief of police, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the people who were against us really weren't against us as a police 
department, they were against the idea of more taxes," Hopkins said. "But the 
support we got on this makes us feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oak Park, 19-year resident Michael Haas voted to keep Oak Park 
unincorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incorporation would rob us," Haas said. "Communities as small as this, they 
incorporate and now they're poor all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Advisory Council member Ron Stark, who co-authored the 
pro-incorporation argument on the ballot, said Oak Park's quality of life would 
have to be threatened to persuade residents to support a change from the 
community's unincorporated status. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be something very drastic that would impede the kind of 
living we've had," Stark said. "Maybe if the state did away with special 
districts and Oak Park had to rely on the county for everything" residents 
would support incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Measure X, a countywide initiative that would allow officials to access a 
statewide gas tax fund for public transit, "yes" votes were outpacing "no" 
votes by a comfortable margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow us to tap a fund we are already paying into whenever we buy 
gas," said Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission. "It will be a real benefit to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A gave Oak Park voters three options for their community: 
incorporation, annexation to Thousand Oaks or remaining an unincorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of incorporation argued that it offered the community greater 
decision-making power over police, library and public transit services in the 
15,000-resident bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
 As a separate city, Oak Park could assume control of $16 million in taxes each 
year, supporters said. Those funds are now controlled by the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also had the option of throwing Oak Park's lot in with neighboring 
Thousand Oaks, or maintaining the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk led the effort to place the advisory measure on 
the ballot, enabling residents to decide if they wanted more control over 
spending and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of higher taxes seemed to be the prime motivating force for many Oak Park 
residents casting their ballots Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Chambers said that fear led her to cast her vote to annex to Thousand 
Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded good," Chambers said. "Becoming a city would raise our taxes. Why 
not go with an established city that's doing well?" 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, in a high-profile Port Hueneme election, voters cast 
ballots to determine whether the city will retain its 19-member police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure Z asked voters to decide if the city's 7,000 homeowners should pay $56 
a year to maintain the force. The measure also asked whether commercial 
buildings should be taxed 2 1/2 cents per square foot for the same purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure generated a broad-based coalition of supporters, eager to cover a 
shortfall in the Police Department's $2.2-million annual operating budget with 
the $500,000 a year the tax would generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters countywide cast ballots on Measure X, deciding whether to access up to 
$1.2 million or more annually in gas tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Measure X, the amount of money available to Ventura County annually 
varies, depending on the amount the state Legislature sets aside during budget 
negotiations. The total is then divided among eligible counties. 
</P>
<P>
 State law stipulates that the money be matched with local funds. Use of the 
funds is strictly limited to the construction and purchase of public transit 
facilities and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said the funds would come out of existing transit 
funds and that residents would not be required to pay any additional money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula library measure, which required a simple majority to pass, was 
the final hurdle for residents hoping to salvage services at their local 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, residents approved a $25-a-year increase in property taxes to 
benefit the city library. Under Proposition 13, voters must approve an 
additional measure that sets a spending limit before new property taxes are 
appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Measure Y, that cap was set at $555,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Library backers said the parcel tax would add an estimated $170,000 to the 
library's $210,000 annual budget, helping make up for state funding cuts during 
the past two years that have forced a cutback in hours, book purchases and 
janitorial services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Robles, the city's head librarian for 17 years, said the additional funds 
would be a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my career here, there's the chance that I might be able 
to expand, rather than downsize," Robles said. "It's a challenge I'm looking 
forward to."

DECISION '94: THE PRIMARIES; FORMER WILSON AIDE LEADING IN 24TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson narrowly led a group of Republican 
candidates seeking to challenge Thousand Oaks' congressman, while an art 
history professor closed in on the Democratic nomination for an open Assembly 
seat representing western portions of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In early returns, former Wilson aide Richard Sybert took a slight lead over 
Robert K. Hammer and three other Republicans competing for the chance to take 
on Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) in the 24th District that 
includes Thousand Oaks and portions of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly better to be ahead than to be behind," Sybert said. "Anytime 
you have five candidates and a turnout as low as this, you can expect a certain 
amount of volatility." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson handily defeated his Democratic opponent, a Sherman Oaks businessman 
and follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, and said he will take any 
Republican challenger seriously. "No matter who it is, it is going to be a very 
competitive election." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th Assembly District, Mindy Lorenz jumped to an early lead over 
former legislative aide Bob Ream in the Democratic primary -- a remarkable feat 
for a politician who ran as a Green Party congressional candidate two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be happier," Lorenz said Tuesday night. "I think my message has 
really gotten out that I'll be a legislator who makes the legislators really 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 If her lead holds up when all ballots are counted, she will face Santa Barbara 
winery owner Brooks Firestone in the general election. Firestone ran 
uncontested in Tuesday's Republican primary in the 35th District, which covers 
Ventura, Ojai, Santa Paula and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In the congressional district that covers most of Ventura County, Kevin Ready, 
Santa Barbara County deputy counsel, racked up an early lead over Democratic 
rival Frank Stephenson, a college placement consultant, for a shot at incumbent 
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 And in the state's 18th Senate District, former San Luis Obispo County 
Supervisor Steve MacElvaine held a slim lead over Santa Barbara businessman 
Steve Decker with about half the vote counted. The winner of that GOP 
nomination will go up against Democrat Jack O'Connell of Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, a 12-year veteran of the state Assembly, has already raised more 
than $316,000 in contributions and ran unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th Assembly District, incumbent Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) and 
challenger Dorothy Maron ran unopposed in their respective party primaries and 
will square off in November to represent a district that covers most of 
Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th Assembly District -- which includes Simi Valley and Fillmore -- 
Simi Valley attorney Donald A. Cocquyt and 18-year-old Josh Arce of Chatsworth 
were neck and neck in the Democratic primary. The winner will challenge 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two local politicians made their first step toward claiming 
statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) had a substantial lead over a 
Northern California assemblyman for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor. 
If the lead holds, she will face Democrat Gray Davis, now the state controller, 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 And former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) leads a Los Angeles 
businessman for in the Republican primary for controller. If he wins, he will 
be matched against Democrat Kathleen Connell, an investment banker making her 
first bid for elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24th Congressional District, which covers most of Thousand Oaks, is 
considered one of the most politically competitive in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, seeking his 10th term in Congress, has proved a resilient 
politician even after being thrust out of his solidly Democratic district in 
Los Angeles' Westside and forced to run in the decidedly more conservative 24th 
District after the 1990 redistricting. Two years ago, he easily withstood a 
challenge from former Assemblyman McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Republicans who wrangled over their party's nomination in Tuesday's 
primary agreed on one point: that the 18-year congressman can be defeated by a 
popular Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP primary, voters chose from among five candidates: Sybert; Hammer; 
Mark Boos Benhard, a one-time aide to former Rep. William Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton); Sang Korman, a Newbury Park businessman, and Emery Shane, a 
commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the GOP candidates support legislation to curb illegal immigration, cut 
taxes, reduce crime and slash government spending. Most of them have focused 
their attacks on Sybert's recent move into the district and his large personal 
loan to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, president of a small toy design firm and former head of Wilson's 
Office of Planning and Research, held a huge political cash advantage over his 
GOP opponents, boosted by a $430,000 loan to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County's other congressional race, Gallegly said he believes the 
campaign leading to the November election will show clear philosophical 
differences between himself and his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ready and Stephenson ran as strong supporters of President Clinton's 
economic and health care plans -- programs that Gallegly delights in skewering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in this community for 27 years and I think I know the issues," 
Gallegly said Tuesday. "Democrats and Republicans alike are not going to 
embrace larger tax hikes, unchecked illegal immigration and the remaking of our 
health-care system." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a dozen years, the state's 18th Senate District will be 
represented by someone other than Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who is 
leaving public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Hart announced his retirement, O'Connell announced that he would 
seek to fill the seat of his political mentor. Hart immediately endorsed 
O'Connell, saying he wanted to avoid a bruising Democratic primary in a 
district where Democrats hold just a slight advantage over Republicans in 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican leaders say 1990 reapportionment, which shoved the district 
into conservative San Luis Obispo County, has increased the party's chances of 
taking the seat away from a Democrat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the race to fill O'Connell's Assembly seat has focused on the 
Democratic primary, where a 20-year age difference separated the two 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, 47, focused on her life's experiences, explaining how she went from 
being a single mother living on food stamps to earning a doctoral degree and 
becoming a college professor. At age 27, Ream was among the youngest candidates 
running for the state Assembly this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Firestone, 57, was unopposed in the primary.

 Ventura County employees arriving at work in twos and threes at the Government 
Center and 140 other county offices will be tallied next week as the county 
takes its semi-annual survey to learn how many share rides to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is intended to determine whether the county government is meeting 
its goals for reducing air pollution by cutting down on the number of people 
who drive alone to work. Officials will count how many of the county's 5,063 
eligible employees share rides, walk, bus or bike to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's trip-reduction regulation, known as Rule 210, requires all public 
and private employers with more than 100 workers to provide incentives to 
car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rule 210, large employers must show that their companies have an average 
ridership of 1.35 people per car. By January, 1996, that requirement will rise 
to an average of 1.5 people per car. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixie Hollingsworth, executive secretary for county Auditor-Controller Thomas 
O. Mahon, said she has been car-pooling for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it for the preferential parking," she said. Government center employees 
who car-pool have access to the more convenient spots in a vast parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a rainy day, that's a real convenience for me," she said. "And I like the 
interaction in the morning. It gets me off on the right foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollingsworth's department boasts the best rate of any in the county, with an 
average of 1.65 people per car. During survey week last year, when employees 
knew they were being counted, the number of car-poolers shot up to 2.4 people 
per car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Brandl of Oak View shares a ride to and from work every day with her 
fiance, who works in the assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you time to talk and visit so when you get home, you don't have to 
talk about work anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors on Tuesday declared that the survey would be conducted next 
week, essentially warning employees that they would be counted and possibly 
skewing results to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard H. Baldwin, the county's air pollution control officer, said he 
has little concern that departments would pad numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employees have a tendency to call us when those kinds of things happen," 
Baldwin said. Still, to ensure that the count is accurate, Baldwin said the Air 
Pollution Control District is beginning an audit program. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, he said, the county and its large employers have done well with 
the regulation, which was implemented to comply with the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason to comply is that the law requires it," Baldwin said. "And the 
reason the law requires it is that motor vehicles are the largest contributor 
to our smog problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has designated Ventura County as an area with a severe 
air quality problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Private employers with more than 100 workers must also perform annual or 
semi-annual surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 One such company, Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays in Westlake, is conducting its 
employee survey this week. Employees there receive incentives ranging from the 
right to wear casual dress to work to free nights in one of the company's many 
hotels and other properties, said Ken Phillips, director of corporate 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "They earn points when they do trip reductions," Phillips said. "It's a 
program that works." 
</P>
<P>
 Average vehicle ridership at the company, which has 334 employees at its 
Westlake office, has exceeded the regulation's goal for 1996, at 1.54 people 
per car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble in Oxnard uses a different strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 220 employees affected receive preferential parking, and the company has 
provided protected bicycle racks and guaranteed rides home for car-poolers. But 
the real incentive is pollution control, said company spokesman Robert E. 
Paulger. 
</P>
<P>
 Average ridership at the company has averaged 1.42 people per car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue is that it's the right thing to do, from the standpoint of 
freeway congestion, and cleaning up the air," Paulger said. "People have 
responded well."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; NEIGHBORHOOD, BUSINESSES DEBATE MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just looking at the new mural splayed across the south wall of Avenue Liquor 
Store in Ventura makes Wilma Kenyon miffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a friend who wanted to change the color on (his business') sign from 
white to black, and they wouldn't even let him do that, but then they let them 
put up that mural," said Kenyon, owner of Kenyon Auto Shop on Ventura Avenue. 
"Well, it doesn't seem quite fair. And anyway, it's not stopping anything. It 
just looks cluttered and ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 A raucous palette of color, the 70-foot-wide by 12-foot-high painting, on 
Ventura Avenue near Simpson, depicts the struggles of homeless people and the 
aging neighborhood's fights against drugs, alcohol and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is splattered with exhortations such as "Stop the violence" and "It's not 
cool to target kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The children who live on and around Ventura Avenue created the mural with a 
grant from the Ventura County Alcohol and Drug Program and the help of local 
artist M.B. Hanrahan. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 20 residents and business owners, including Kenyon, signed a 
petition last week that they recently turned in to City Hall, protesting the 
painting of the mural when city code enforcers are so strict on approving 
individual businesses' signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to be fair to one, be fair to all," said Ginger Thompson, 
who crafted and circulated the petition among her friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff say a mural and a business sign are two totally different issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know (some residents) don't like it, but I don't know what to do about it," 
said Laurie James, a code enforcement officer for Ventura. "We look at it as a 
freedom-of-speech issue." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, James said, a sign is advertising and a mural is art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigo Aguirre, 16, who lives on Prospect Street, labored more than a dozen 
hours on it during the last two weeks in May, helping to paint the mural after 
school let out for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he puffs up with pride now every time he walks by. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you'll look back on later," Rigo said with a broad smile. 
"Hopefully, it will still be there 10 years from now and still giving out the 
same message." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Padilla, who owns a cellular phone store down the street from Avenue 
Liquor, agreed that there is no comparison between art and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mural is for the community," he said. "It doesn't bring in business to 
the liquor store." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the employees of the store itself, they have started their own petition 
in support of the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 They have gathered 90 signatures since June 1, just from leaving the petition 
out on the store's counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't like it, they say it's graffiti," said Richard Hernandez, 
the store's manager. "I told them, hey, it's from the kids' hearts." CONSTANCE

<P>
 A 25-year-old Oxnard man who may face charges under the state's new "three 
strikes and you're out" law was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for murder in 
the April 2 slaying of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Santos Castaneda is charged with murder and unlawful possession of a 
firearm in the death of 25-year-old Mina Castaneda.He has two previous robbery 
convictions, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's preliminary hearing, acting Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Herbert Curtis III set arraignment for June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the three-strikes law, defendants face a sentence of 25 
years to life. The statute prescribes the sentence for anyone with two prior 
serious or violent felonies who commits a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia M. Murphy said a decision on whether to charge 
Castaneda under the law will probably be announced at the arraignment. DWAYNE

 Flavin will be required to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chart a strategy for reinvigorating Ventura's business climate.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL OKS PAY RAISE FOR CITY CLERK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of dispute and threats of a lawsuit against the city, the Oxnard 
City Council on Tuesday approved a pay raise for its city clerk, effective Nov 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote, the council agreed to increase Daniel Martinez's salary from 
$300 per month to $450. 
</P>
<P>
 During the City Council meeting, Councilman Michael Plisky -- the only council 
member to oppose the raise -- accused Martinez of being inefficient and said a 
raise would encourage poor performance by city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who said he was pleased with the council's action, had no comments 
on Plisky's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is entitled to have his opinion and I am ready to go on and get my work 
done," Martinez said. "Hopefully, my next evaluation will be better." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after the city manager evaluated Martinez and concluded that he was 
too inexperienced to run the clerk's office, the council denied Martinez a pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez then threatened to sue the city, arguing that the raise was 
guaranteed by city law. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CHANNEL ISLANDS; CHEVRON REQUEST IS DENIED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An emergency request by Chevron Corp. to resume tanker shipping from its 
terminal at Gaviota to Los Angeles Harbor was denied again -- the fifth time in 
as many months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter M. Douglas, executive director of the California Coastal Commission, on 
Monday denied the oil company's request to resume tanker shipping because 
Chevron could not prove that an emergency exists warranting such a permit and 
because the company has failed to secure a pipeline -- with all necessary state 
permits -- in which to carry its Point Arguello crude after 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's shipping permit was suspended Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy, the company has made five 
requests to both Santa Barbara County and to the commission for an emergency 
shipping permit. It claimed that damage to a pipeline by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake is causing the company economic hardships because of the increased 
costs of using alternative pipelines and other methods of moving its Point 
Arguello crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The company processes an estimated 80,000 barrels of Point Arguello crude a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, environmental activists hailed Douglas' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "What part of 'no' don't they understand?" said Linda Krop, acting chief 
counsel for the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center. "Obviously, 
there is no need for Chevron to tanker. We will do everything in our power to 
oppose further tankering, as it leads to increased air pollution and risks of 
oil spills off our coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy said Chevron will appeal Douglas' decision to the full commission at its 
meeting next month in Huntington Beach. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY POLICE TOW CARS WITH UNPAID TICKETS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first day of a crackdown on parking scofflaws, Ventura police on 
Tuesday towed eight cars with unpaid tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight cars all had five or more unpaid parking tickets worth a total of 
$8,665, said Ventura Police Lt. Steve Bowman.Another four car owners paid about 
$2,000 on the spot to prevent their vehicles from being towed, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new initiative -- known as the Delinquent Repeat Offender Program -- 
targets cars that have five or more unpaid parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be more tows," Bowman said. "This will be done on a sporadic basis." 
</P>
<P>
 As of April 30, the city had 155 vehicles with five or more unpaid parking 
tickets, for a total of more than $94,000 in fines owed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each offender received repeated notices, police said, plus a warning letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police plan to hold the cars until payments are received. If owners do not pay 
up and claim the vehicles, they will be sold by one of the city's three tow 
companies. PEGGY Y. LEE

 The $248,000 reimbursement was for services provided between July and 
December, 1993. The money will be used to hire a nurse and a psychologist, 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the district has had only one nurse, who provides services to 
nearly 13,000 students, Fitzgerald said. The district has six psychologists.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TEEN-AGER CLEARED OF ASSAULT CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager who was arrested twice in one week in connection 
with two separate gang-related incidents will not be charged in one of the 
cases, his lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard T. Ferko said Acting Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Herbert Curtis III dismissed an assault charge against 18-year-old Brady 
Willmon.The charge was dropped after a Ventura County prosecutor said his 
office decided against pursuing the case against Willmon, Ferko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon, a former Westlake High School football player, still faces a charge 
of conspiracy for allegedly engaging in a series of street fights on Wendy 
Drive on April 14. The fights -- which allegedly included gunfire -- involved 
three different gangs and occurred within 30 minutes of each other, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While free on bail in that incident, Willmon was rearrested seven days later 
and charged with bursting into a Thousand Oaks boy's home and beating him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Willmon's attorney has contended that his client was at his own house when 
the alleged attack was to have occurred. Prosecutors dropped the charge related 
to the attack because they did not have enough evidence against Willmon, Ferko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli, who is prosecuting the case, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a question that an assault even took place," Ferko said. "This 
victim said that he was hit with a baseball bat, stabbed with knives, beaten 
with fists and kicked. But he didn't have any injuries." DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; KMART CANCELS PLAN TO BUILD NEW STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years of planning, and one day before its project was to come before 
the Simi Valley Planning Commission, K mart withdrew its application to build a 
second Simi Valley store, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that surprised city planners, the discount chain's Fresno-based 
architect faxed a letter to the city Tuesday announcing its decision to 
withdraw the application.The letter gave no explanation for the decision. K 
mart officials had met twice with neighborhood groups to gather input and work 
through complaints about the proposed 117,000-square-foot store's design. 
</P>
<P>
 And they had been meeting with city planners on and off for nearly two years 
trying to design a store that met both K mart's needs and the city's vision for 
the parcel on the southwest corner of Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said K mart architects had been unable to design a shopping 
center that was "campus-like" and encouraged people to walk from neighboring 
city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, we were recommending that they redesign their project, 
but they were unable to do so," said Wolf Ascher, deputy director of current 
planning. "It is regrettable that they could not see their way clear to become 
consistent with the city's plans." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, K mart officials said they were optimistic about plans to build a 
second store in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel as though there's still potential," project manager Michael Theisen 
said in an interview. "All of (the city's) concerns deal with things that we 
think are workable." MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies have arrested three Los Angeles County men 
they believe to be responsible for a rash of car burglaries in the Oak Park, 
Agoura and Thousand Oaks areas over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Campos, 18, William Villegas, 28, and Jose Cisneros, 26, all of Los 
Angeles, are scheduled to be arraigned on burglary violations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were arrested early Saturday in Oak Park after they ran a stop sign 
at the intersection of Sunnycrest Drive and Kanan Road. When deputies stopped 
them, they found several car stereos and burglary tools in their car, Detective 
Joe Braga said.

 Braga said he has linked at least five car burglaries to the three, and 
suspects they may have been responsible for at least 30 to 40 car burglaries in 
the Oak Park, Agoura and Thousand Oaks areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting hit big time," said Braga, who said he suspects the 
burglars specialize in car stereos and cellular phones. "They're not fancy; 
they pull and grab and go." 
</P>
<P>
 Braga, who is still looking for other victims, asks that anyone who was 
burglarized and who saw a 1981 black Toyota two-door coupe in the area during 
the last two months call him at (805) 494-8223. PEGGY Y. LEE

MOORPARK STRAINS TO CUT BUDGET; PUBLIC SAFETY: PROPOSED INCREASES IN THE COST 
OF SHERIFF'S SERVICES THREATEN THE PLAN TO OPEN A STOREFRONT STATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steep increases in the cost of police services have Moorpark officials 
scrambling to cover a quarter-million-dollar deficit in next year's budget, 
city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Moorpark City Council members might have to postpone plans to 
increase police presence in town with a proposed police storefront, said 
Councilman Bernardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may also have to reduce the number of Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department deputies who patrol Moorpark from 20 to 19, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real eye-opener when you look over these numbers," said Perez, who 
serves on the city's budget committee. "It doesn't much matter what we think of 
the (police storefront) idea, we're going to have to make some tough choices to 
correct this deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the budget committee began grappling with how to balance 
Moorpark's budget of more than $4 million. Last year, the city spent $2.4 
million of its operating budget on police services. This year, the department 
is asking for $200,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things considered in this budget year, that sort of increase is 
unacceptable," said Mayor Paul Lawrason, who serves on the committee with 
Perez. "It's always been the biggest item on the budget. When a single item can 
make up 60% of your total budget it drives a lot of what happens everywhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Geoff Dean, who heads the Moorpark division for the Sheriff's Department, 
said the steep increase was in line with annual hikes in the cost of services. 
The additional funding is needed to cover cost-of-living increases for deputies 
and other department personnel, and to cover a 25% increase in the cost of 
maintaining patrol cars and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark has had the lowest crime rate of any Ventura County city since 1992, 
sheriff's figures show, but city officials continue to stress the need for 
increased police presence in the city. Deputies assigned to patrol Moorpark 
work out of the station in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Pat Hunter, who introduced the idea of opening a police storefront 
in town, said even with budget constraints the idea would still be feasible. He 
said the actual cost of staffing the facility would amount to less than 
$20,000, and would add measurably to public safety in town.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite Hunter's optimism, the budget deficit could make the downtown facility 
infeasible, budget committee members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will discuss options to make up the budget 
shortfalls. The meeting begins at 7 p.m. at Moorpark City Hall, at 799 Moorpark 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage it's a little early to speculate, but all cuts should be 
considered," Lawrason said.

VENTURA OKS COMPETING FOR CITY WORK WHILE SERVING ON PANEL; GOVERNMENT: ACTION 
STEMS FROM RESIGNATION OF A PLANNER WHO ACCEPTED A CONTRACT TO REDESIGN A 
PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura residents may serve on city commissions and committees at the same 
time they are competing for contract work with the city, council members said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after landscape architect Curtis Stiles resigned from the city's 
Planning Commission, a majority of council members said they should not have 
forced him to leave the city board just because he had contracted with Ventura 
to design a downtown plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, four of the seven council members decided Monday night that no 
one will be asked to leave a committee post in the future because of conflict 
of interest problems -- unless the state attorney general rules that his or her 
particular situation violates state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I voted the wrong way, and I want to apologize for that," Councilman 
Jack Tingstrom said. "I would hate to see us lose the talent of the business 
community because we state that (a situation creates) a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura council members had considered adopting a strict conflict of interest 
policy that would prohibit city appointees from accepting city work. Such a 
policy would have gone beyond state law, which merely requires appointees not 
to use their post to lobby for city contracts or discuss or vote on a contract 
in which they have a personal stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 3 to stay with the standard outlined by the state law, 
with council members Gary Tuttle, Steve Bennett and Gregory L. Carson opposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle and Bennett said allowing city appointees to take work with the city 
creates a perception of cronyism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the perception is equally as important as the law," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said in an interview Tuesday that he thought the council needed to send 
the matter to a committee and spend more time studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council reacted emotionally when it voted last time, and it 
didn't really look at the issues this time," Carson said. "I don't think we 
comprehensively looked at the ramifications of (the policy) and how far it 
would reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson added that even those committee members with the highest standards 
might find their judgment compromised when they stand to gain financially from 
decisions they make on city boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are beholden to staff for contracts, your perspective might change," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate began last month, when city planners asked the council to approve a 
$25,000 contract with Stiles for the redesign of California Street Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is now a cluster of vacant storefronts at the south end of California 
Street, next to the beach promenade and across from the Holiday Inn. City 
officials hope to renovate the plaza as part of an overall downtown 
redevelopment project. Plans include a new restaurant with outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members had already asked the state attorney general to review the 
situation, since Stiles served on both the Planning Commission and the city's 
architectural review board. The attorney general said the city would not 
violate state law by allowing Stiles to take the contract and keep his seat on 
both commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, said they nevertheless found the predicament 
troubling, and told Stiles he would have to choose between the committees and 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 An infuriated Stiles turned down the contract, resigned from both committees 
and stormed out of City Hall. He has since agreed to accept the contract, but 
says he is not yet ready to return to the Planning Commission or the Design 
Review Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, other city appointees said they thought the council made the best 
possible decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had voted for a stricter policy, then I probably would have 
resigned," said Planning Commissioner and local architect Mike Jones. 
"Perceived conflict of interest is such a nebulous concept . . . just like 
beauty, it's in the eye of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who has never worked on a city contract, said he worried that under 
such a policy even working for a private client whose project came under city 
review would become a problem for him as a commissioner.

SIMI RAISES HOMEOWNERS' LANDSCAPING FEES BY 17%; PUBLIC WORKS: NEXT FISCAL 
YEAR, RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOW PAYING $776 YEARLY WILL PAY $899 FOR MAINTENANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley will charge residents about 17% more per year to prune hedges, 
plant flowers and water hillsides in median strips and other public areas, 
despite homeowners' concerns that the fees for landscaping are already too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed unanimously to the increase over the protests of 
several homeowners, who argued that they pay too much for maintaining public 
grounds near their homes. The new fees will be as high as $900 per residence in 
some newer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to a staff report, residents are only paying part of the cost of 
landscaping near their residences. 
</P>
<P>
 When a new development is built, the city bills residents for a portion of the 
cost for landscape maintenance and pays the rest out of developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 As the developer fees dwindle, the city increases the share charged to 
residents. Eventually, homeowners end up paying the entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in Indian Hills the actual annual cost for maintaining median 
strips, roadways and grassy slopes is $974 per homeowner, with the residents 
charged a portion of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For the current fiscal year, the city charges Indian Hills residents $776 and 
makes up the difference with developer fees. Beginning in 1994-95, with the 
council-approved increase, those residents will pay $899. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees in different areas vary depending on how much landscaping is required, 
ranging from nothing to $900 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's council meeting, Indian Hills resident Charles Padalecki told the 
council the charge is too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the amount due is totally unjustified," Padalecki said. "We need to 
either look for another landscaper or give the parcels back to the residents to 
maintain themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton invited residents interested in doing the landscaping 
themselves to contact the city Public Works Department. But he said he believes 
the costs are justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping lawns and trees watered and paying all the costs associated with that 
is not cheap," Stratton said. "It's just a fact we have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in state law last year that required cities to give residents 45 days 
notice of plans to increase rates prevented Simi Valley from raising its fees, 
so residents are being hit with two years worth of increases, City Manager Lin 
Koester told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the council, residents Betty and Jack Lewis criticized the 
timing of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have any additional assessments at this time, when residents are borrowing 
money to pay for earthquake damage, seems very untimely," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to ease the financial burden on residents hit hard by the Jan. 17 
quake, Councilman Bill Davis suggested reducing or holding off on increases for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members opposed postponing the fee hike, saying that without 
an increase this year, the bill next year would jump twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not accomplishing anything by postponing," Councilwoman Judy Mikels 
said. "We're just delaying, and next year it will just be worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked staff members to include with the annual fee increase 
notices sent to residents an explanation of the actual cost of service, 
including how much homeowners pay and the share covered by developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people understand how this works," Mikels said. "We could save 
everyone a lot of grief if we let them know what the service really costs."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; MONDESI, ON STRIKE, TAKES A STRIKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second inning of Tuesday's game against the Florida Marlins, Raul 
Mondesi took too long to step into the batter's box after his name was 
announced. Home plate umpire Joe West signaled Marlin pitcher David Weathers to 
throw the first pitch and called it a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have been anything else. Rule 6.02 (c) says: "If the batter 
refuses to take his position in the batter's box during his time at bat, the 
umpire shall order the pitcher to pitch, and shall call 'strike' on each such 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda argued to no avail, and, after the game, West explained: 
"He (Mondesi) wouldn't come to the batter's box. I said 'C'mon' and he said, 
'No.' So I said, 'fine, Strike 1.' 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . He evidently wasn't ready. I said, 'Let's go.' He defied me. So I 
said, 'OK, we'll play without you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to stand over there and hear his name announced, that's too bad. 
We're going to play. I've never seen a player defy an umpire when he says let's 
go. We're supposed to keep the game moving. We don't play these games for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi then singled to left field, driving in Eric Karros, and later scored 
on Ramon Martinez's single. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman was summoned to a meeting with Fred Claire, Lasorda and a couple 
of coaches before the game. The meeting was triggered by published remarks 
Offerman made about his being benched for three games. Claire said Offerman 
remains the team's shortstop, but that he wanted Offerman -- who said he was 
unclear why he was being benched -- to know what is expected of him. "Whatever 
it takes," said Claire, referring to the tantrum Offerman had after being asked 
to bunt with a pitcher on deck in a game last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it was time for a talk," Claire said. "He went through an 
experience here and he didn't handle it well. He has been our regular shortstop 
and has been on the bench, and I thought it was a good time to talk about where 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman started Tuesday night's game, batted second and doubled off the wall 
in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler said he could barely get out of bed Tuesday morning because he 
was so sore from running around the outfield in the seventh inning Monday. The 
Florida Marlins scored six runs on seven hits, including three doubles and a 
triple, and hit each to whatever gap Butler was the farthest from. "I haven't 
done that much running in a long time," Butler said. "If I played them to the 
left, they hit it to the right. I felt like I was on Candid Camera or 
something." . . . Delino DeShields joined the team Tuesday night and said he 
hopes to return to play by Monday. . . . With an expected move coming up in the 
bullpen, Claire said he would rather not call up Chan Ho Park from San Antonio, 
preferring to keep Park in a starter's role. 
</P>

 The Dodgers signed 13 draft picks: left-handed pitchers Christopher Ochsenfeld 
of Bethel High, Va.; Edilberto Oropesa, formerly of Cuba, and Jason Reed of 
Grossmont College; right-handed pitchers Ronald Hollis Jr., from the University 
of Michigan; Jeffrey Paluk, from Saginaw Valley State; Ricky Stone of Hamilton 
High, Ohio; Elias Tapia, from Los Angeles, and Gregory Thompson of Robert H. 
Goddard High in New Mexico; outfielders Johnny Hilo of Cal State L.A. and 
Donald Sell of the University of the Pacific; infielders Kevin Faircloth of 
North Carolina State; Adams Riggs of the University of South Carolina and Kevin 
Zellers of Kent State. MARYANN HUDSON

 Italy's soccer team, warning that tough competition awaits in the World Cup, 
arrived in the United States on Tuesday, greeted by cheering fans in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Arrigo Sacchi said the team trained hard in Italy "to give Italian and 
Italian-American fans a lot of satisfaction in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident, but there are several teams which are as good as we are," 
Sacchi said at Newark International Airport. "And we will need some luck as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, who knew six months ago that their first two games would be in 
the New York area, are expected to be virtually a home team at Giants Stadium 
in East Rutherford, N.J. They will play Ireland at Giants Stadium on June 18 
and Norway on June 23 before playing Mexico in Washington on June 28. Italy 
will train at the Pingry School in Somerset, N.J.

 The Saudi ambassador, Ghazi Algosaibi, expressed his concerns to the

 Brazilian Dream: The 1956 Brazilian World Cup champion team was an offensive 
marvel. Players freelanced out of a 4-2-4 alignment that was all but impossible 
to stop. Pele lined up in the middle next to Vava and the two routinely 
switched sides. Garrincha, the right wing, was a devastating one-on-one players 
who freelanced all over the field. Djalma and Nilton Santos were fullbacks who 
overlapped into the offensive end. Left wing Mario Zagalo was fast enough to 
drop back on defense.

<P>
 While Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi continues to shop for pitching -- 
dangling left fielder Dwight Smith on the trade market -- he may soon call up 
one of the remnants of the Angels' last big trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Russ Springer, who was acquired along with first baseman J.T. Snow and 
reliever Jerry Nielsen for Jim Abbott, has been told that he could be joining 
the Angel rotation, possibly by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, 7-4 with a 3.04 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver, was put on 
call Tuesday when the Angels learned that they might have to put starter Phil 
Leftwich on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, suffering from an inflamed lower right leg, underwent a magnetic 
resonance imaging test that proved normal and he will take inflammatory 
medication. He said that he probably will have to miss at least one start, but 
no decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been getting steadily worse," said Leftwich, who lasted only two innings 
Monday in the Angels' 8-2 defeat to the Minnesota Twins. "Now might be the time 
to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it first started hurting, I thought I had shin splints. But it hasn't 
gone away. It's like a toothache. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more annoying than anything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Starting pitcher John Farrell, saying that it's time to sever ties, rejected 
the Angels' triple-A Vancouver assignment and will become a free agent if he 
clears waivers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are one of several teams that have expressed interest in Farrell 
(1-2, 9.00 ERA). He is expected to clear waivers, however, because his $200,000 
contract stipulates that he must be paid $45,000 for every start beginning with 
his eighth of the season, and he already has made three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to go into whether I got a fair chance or not," Farrell said, 
"but these guys took a chance on me before I could even throw the ball again. 
They worked with me a lot, and I appreciate what they did. I gave it everything 
I had to make things go, but things just didn't work out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The best scenario would be if I'm claimed off waivers, but no matter what 
happens, I feel I can still contribute to a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "But obviously at this point, it won't be the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, 31, considered one of the most popular players on the team, said that 
he also will explore opportunities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who are prepared to vote in favor of authorizing a strike by July 
1, voted Mark Langston as their player representative and Gary DiSarcina as the 
assistant. . . . The Angels, believing it might be best for second baseman 
Kevin Flora's welfare, probably will put him on the suspended list until he's 
able to recover emotionally from his wife's death of a year ago. He has played 
only six games at Vancouver. . . . McKay Christensen, the Angels' first-round 
pick in last week's June free agent draft, has agreed on a $700,000 signing 
bonus in his contract that is expected to be finalized Friday. Christensen, who 
will begin a two-year Mormon mission this summer, becomes the highest-paid 
draft pick in franchise history. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington, who heads baseball's expansion 
committee, said his group isn't ready to make a recommendation on major league 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix and St. Petersburg, Fla., are pushing for the major leagues to expand 
by 1998, but Harrington said that no vote would be taken today when he advises 
the other owners at baseball's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the election of Gene Budig as American League president is at the top 
of the owners' list, and after that attention will turn to the labor situation. 
Management negotiator Richard Ravitch is seeking a go-ahead from owners to

RICABAL, KOTSAY KEEP TITANS GOING; BASEBALL: RELIEVER GIVES UP THREE HITS AND 
NO RUNS IN 8 1/3 INNINGS AND FRESHMAN DRIVES IN SEVEN IN CAL STATE FULLERTON'S 
10-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Dan Ricabal went to the dugout after getting the final out in Florida 
State's three-run first inning, the Cal State Fullerton pitcher thought of only 
one thing: "I said to myself, 'Get me four runs and we'll win this game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans and freshman Mark Kotsay did that and more. Kotsay drove in seven 
runs, four of them on a grand slam in the eighth, and the Titans went on to a 
10-3 victory Tuesday in the College World Series. His RBI total tied a CWS 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal, a key ingredient in Fullerton's bid for a national championship, gave 
up only three hits in 8 1/3 innings after taking over for Chad Rolish. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sends Fullerton (47-15) against Georgia Tech (49-16) at 4:36 (PDT) 
today in another do-or-die game, one similar to what the Titans faced in the 
1992 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton must beat Georgia Tech twice to reach the championship game against 
the lower-bracket winner, Arizona State or Oklahoma. In 1992, the Titans beat 
top-ranked Miami twice to reach the final but lost to Pepperdine in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game is expected to be a rematch of the starting pitchers from 
Friday's opener, Brad Rigby (14-4) for Georgia Tech and Mike Parisi (11-4) for 
the Titans. Rigby and the Yellow Jackets won that game, 2-0. Fullerton had won 
the regular-season game between the two teams, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one more chance at them," Parisi said. "I like the situation we're 
in. Georgia Tech is the team with all the pressure, the stars, the first-round 
picks. We're just another team trying to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans stayed alive Tuesday, thanks to Ricabal and Kotsay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricabal was the story of that game," Florida State Coach Mike Martin said. 
"What a tremendous job of pitching. We've seen him before, but this was clearly 
one of his better moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido and pitching coach George Horton had gone back 
and forth on whether to start Rolish or Ricabal. About two hours before the 
game, they decided on the left-handed Rolish because of the strength of the 
Seminoles' left-handed hitters. They also wanted to try to preserve Ricabal for 
possible middle-inning relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny has been our best pitcher," Horton said. "He was our best in the 
regional, but we wanted to save some pitches for him if we could. He's a weapon 
we want to use over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal said he was "a little disappointed but not mad" when he learned he 
wasn't starting. "You always want to start in a College World Series game, but 
Coach Horton explained it to me," Ricabal said. "He was up front, and I 
understood where he was coming from. But I knew it was a big game, and I want 
the ball in a big game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal, now 12-1 for the year after struggling early in the season, won two 
games in the NCAA regional, and has been the winning pitcher in nine of 
Fullerton's last 17 victories. His college record is 23-4. Not bad for a guy 
Major League Baseball didn't bother to draft last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so focused today that I couldn't compare it to any other game I 
pitched," Ricabal said. "I just wanted to go out and throw strikes and keep us 
in the game, and little by little we seemed to get our momentum back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles chased Rolish with three runs on three hits in the first. Martin 
said he doubted that it would be enough to win. "Not against an Augie 
Garrido-coached team, the way they scratch out runs against you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans scored once in the second and fifth innings. Hits by Jim Betzsold 
and D.C. Olsen helped the Titans to one run in the third. Shortstop Jack Jones 
had a lead-off triple in the fifth and scored on Kotsay's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans went ahead with three runs in the seventh. Walks to Craig Skyberg 
and Jones sent Florida State starter Charlie Cruz to the bench. Jeff Ferguson 
singled to load the bases, bringing Kotsay to the plate. He drilled the first 
of his two big hits, a double down the left-field line, scoring two runs. The 
third run scored on Millan's hit after Dante Powell was intentionally walked. 
Powell had singled in the second, ending his 0-for-22 stretch in two College 
World Series appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Titans leading, 5-3, Kotsay sealed the victory in the eighth. Two 
walks and a fielding error by the FSU shortstop Link Jarrett loaded the bases, 
and Kotsay cracked his fourth home run of the season to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed to happen naturally," Kotsay said of the home run. "I don't 
even know what was in my head at the time."

CONTROL FADES AS THE ANGELS LOSE TO TWINS; BASEBALL: ANDERSON MAKES SHAKY 
RETURN, LASTING 2 2/3 INNINGS AS MINNESOTA WINS, 8-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Anderson family was back home in Geneva, Ohio, scanning the channels 
Tuesday night on their satellite dish trying to tune in to the Angels' 8-6 loss 
to the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't stand the idea of not being able to watch their son, Angel 
starter Brian Anderson, pitch his first game in a month. But if they had to, 
they'd resort to a different method. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds ridiculous," said Janice Anderson, Brian's mother, "but 
we've sat up all night just keeping it on CNN and watching the ticker 
constantly update the score. It can be maddening, but sometimes, you don't have 
any choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice and Jim Anderson were finally able to locate the game on their dish, 
and stayed up past 2 a.m. (EDT) watching the Angels (24-34) lose for the eighth 
time in the last nine games. They had one question when the game finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that really their son who started for the Angels in front of 16,045 at 
Anaheim Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 The reception was a bit fuzzy, and sometimes it was difficult to tell who was 
pitching, but it sure didn't look the son they remembered. He yielded five 
hits, walked four batters and gave up four earned runs in just 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mechanically, I was brutal," Anderson said, "Throwing strikes is usually what 
I'm best at. I fell behind everyone early, and that doesn't make it very 
interesting for them. They know what's coming." 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing strikes is usually what I'm best at." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Janice Anderson: "Well, I guess everybody's entitled to a bad one now and 
then. But really, I'm just amazed he's back as fast as he is. His spirits were 
good the whole time. He never got down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The part he hated the most was when the team went away and he was left 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson (3-1), making his first start since May 6 when he broke his left 
thumb, was annoyed with his control problems. He can't remember walking four 
batters in a game in his life. He walked only six batters as a junior at Wright 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make any excuses," Anderson said. "You're supposed to come 
back at 100%. I'm not going to get down on myself because I can't afford to 
mope around. Just come back at them in five (days)." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson fell behind against eight of the 17 batters he faced, walking three 
in the second inning alone. Yet, the Angels had a 3-1 lead after two innings, 
thanks to shortstop Gary DiSarcina's two-run double in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the third inning, Anderson could no longer contain the Twins. 
DiSarcina rescued him by leaping to grab Shane Mack's line drive for the first 
out. Kirby Puckett followed by hitting a double to left. Dave Winfield walked. 
Pedro Munoz then flied to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson got ahead of Scott Leius, 1-and-2, but three pitches later, watched 
Leius hit a two-run double into the left-center gap. David McCarty followed 
with another double, and Anderson was out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, however, took a 5-4 lead in the fifth when Chad Curtis hit a 
one-out double. Tim Salmon scored him with another double. And Chili Davis 
followed with a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead stood as Mark Leiter continued to hold the Twins until the eighth. He 
got the first two outs in the inning, then pinch-hitter Chip Hale singled up 
the middle. Chuck Knoblauch followed with a single, moving Hale to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, deciding that Leiter had enough after five innings, summoned closer 
Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two pitches until Grahe got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit Mack in the tricep on the second pitch, loading the bases for Puckett. 
Then, again on the second pitch, he hit Puckett on the thumb, forcing in the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Winfield then singled up the middle, scoring Knoblauch and Mack for a 7-5 
lead.

SOUTH COAST STARS LEAD WAY

<P>
 South Coast League pitchers proved to be too much for the North in the 27th 
Kiwanis Orange County All-Star baseball game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The South, led by its South Coast League contingent, came away with an 8-3 
victory at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives the South a 14-13 advantage in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Four South Coast League pitchers limited the North to four hits and three 
runs, only one of them earned, through seven innings. Dana Hills' Seth Etherton 
started and got the victory, giving up two runs, one of them unearned. He 
struck out four batters in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's Adam Harris, San Clemente's Chad Wanders and Capistrano Valley's 
Peter Zamora followed. Zamora gave up the only other run, which was unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Tony Zuniga, La Quinta's Jim Livernois and Edison's Todd Belitz 
finished up. 
</P>
<P>
 The South led, 4-3, after seven innings, and broke the game open with a 
four-run eighth. Consecutive singles by Ryan Fullerton, Miles Hughey and Jeff 
Pickler got one run home. Jeff Bowman then doubled for a 7-3 lead. Geoff 
Wilson's triple scored Bowman.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; GASTON'S WOES WITH PUTTER ELICIT SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People couldn't wait to pat Andrea Gaston on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone could relate. After all, misery loves company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew what I was fighting," Gaston said. "It was really amazing how 
people came out to root for (me)." 
</P>
<P>
 They knew the root of her problem was her sporadically miserable putting. 
They'd been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston's headline-stealing comeback continued over the weekend in Colorado 
Springs when she placed second in the 53rd Broadmoor Ladies Invitational, one 
of the nation's premier amateur tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston advanced to the 36-hole match play final Sunday before falling, 3 and 
2, to USC's Jill McGill, who completed her college eligibility last month. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 36-year-old Gaston, a Canoga Park resident, the turnaround has been 
nothing short of spectacular. After a 14-year layoff from the sport -- 
attributable to her pitiable and debilitating case of the putting yips -- 
Gaston began playing anew two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She still suffers an occasional setback with her putter, but more often than 
not has won her recent skirmishes with the ugly stick. In fact, over the past 
few months, Gaston's competitive fire has returned as her putting stroke has 
become downright, well, tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Broadmoor, a story outlining her putting travails appeared in the local 
newspaper. She instantly became the favorite of many in the gallery, some of 
whom could identify with her frustrations and told her so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there are lots of people out there with the same problem," Gaston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, who played at San Jose State and once was a top junior player, has 
jumped back into tournament play with a head-first dive. Considering the length 
of her layoff, it's almost shocking how quickly the laurels have piled up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how much I loved the game until I was away from it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Gaston placed second at the U.S. Publinx Championships, 
and won both the Women's State Amateur and the L.A. City Women's Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've pretty much decided to give it everything I can right now," said Gaston, 
who works for an acoustics engineering firm in Westlake Village. "I'm at that 
age when I have to give it a shot. . . . It's killing my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Things are going so well that Gaston has stopped looking in the rear-view 
mirror at opportunity gone by. She's even looking ahead to the 1996 Curtis Cup, 
a biennial event pitting top amateurs from the United States and Europe. At 
this pace, she could earn a spot on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 More immediate are qualifying attempts next month for the Women's U.S. Open 
and Women's U.S. Amateur. If she continues to can those putts, look out. 
</P>

<P>
 Holding pattern: Heidi Voorhees completed her college career last week by 
leading USC to a second-place finish in the women's NCAA Division I 
Championships. She finished 12th individually for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bummed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision she faces isn't making the cold-turkey withdrawal from college 
golf any easier. Voorhees, a graduate of Notre Dame High, has a couple of 
options, of course. She can turn pro by enrolling in the LPGA Tour qualifying 
school in August or she can continue to rank among the nation's best female 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Voorhees is riding the fence. Laying up. She plans to play in some 
top amateur events to gauge the shape of her game, then will decide on whether 
to turn pro later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to say yes (to turning pro), but I'm going to wait to see how things 
go," said Voorhees, 21, who earned her degree in four years. "It's really hard 
to go down to qualifying school and not play well. I think it would be tough to 
keep going back."

 Cuts like a knife: The mortality rate was 100% for area players attempting to 
land one of four available berths in the U.S. Open during sectional qualifying 
Monday at Lake Merced Golf and Country Club in Daly City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those with ties to the area who failed to advance at Daly City were Tom 
Stankowski of Ventura (75-74 -- 149), Darren Angel of Granada Hills High (76-74 
-- 150), Ron Hinds of Westlake Village (77-74 -- 151), Scott Heyn of Alemany 
High (79-77 -- 156) and former Rio Mesa High standout Lawrence O'Neil (77-82 -- 
159). 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Klein Jr., (77-78 -- 155), older brother of Emilee Klein, also failed to 
qualify. The U.S. Open is June 16-19 at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 In other sectionals this week, former Alemany standout Dave Berganio Jr. 
advanced in Purchase, N.Y. Duffy Waldorf, formerly of Taft High, was one of 
five players who survived a 14-man playoff to advance at Rockville, Md.

 Crash and burn: For area high school players, the season skidded to a halt in 
the final event of the season, the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. 
Championships at Redlands Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 City Section team entries Grant and Granada Hills finished ninth and 10th in 
the 10-team field and no player on either squad broke 80 -- though both teams 
were missing major cogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills was playing without Angel, the City Section individual champion, 
and Grant played without Allison Wilson, one of the region's top girl players. 
Wilson was playing in a junior tournament in Louisiana while Angel was 
attempting to qualify for the U.S. Open. Both are juniors.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; MURDER-THRILLER PUTS HISTORY TO GOOD USE; THE ALIENIST BY 
CALEB CARR / RANDOM HOUSE $22, 496 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caleb Carr is, among other things, a historian and biographer capable of 
writing a monograph that reads like an adventure story. And so it's no surprise 
that his latest book, "The Alienist," is a novel that makes good use of history 
in telling the tale of a 19th-Century serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Alienist" is set in New York in 1896, when the raw and roiling metropolis 
is panicked by a murderer who preys on "boy-whores," luring his victims out of 
the brothels and leaving behind their cruelly dismembered bodies.  
</P>
<P>
 Beneath its rich historical trappings, however, Carr's novel is a breathless 
and sometimes brutal detective story that carries us through mean streets and 
glittering mansions in pursuit of a bloodthirsty sex fiend. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the while, a voice was whispering in the back of my head," observes John 
Schuyler Moore, the crime reporter who serves as the narrator, " 'Hurry up or a 
child will die!' " 
</P>
<P>
 An alienist, according to 19th-Century usage, is what we would now call a 
psychiatrist or psychologist -- and the alienist in Carr's book is the 
unforgettable Laszlo Kreizler, a gifted but troubled doctor whose use of 
psychological theory in the pursuit of the killer becomes a grand obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreizler, a psychiatric Sherlock Holmes, assembles an antique (but quite 
politically correct) version of the A-team to assist him in identifying and 
tracking down the killer. There's Moore, of course, but also an African 
American man named Cyrus, a former whorehouse piano man and reformed 
cop-killer; a pair of comical Jewish cops who are presented as the Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern of the NYPD but turn out to be masters at everything from 
gross anatomy to handwriting analysis; and a derringer-toting secretary named 
Sara who invents herself as a police detective -- and always seems to show up 
when her brains and her pistol are in urgent demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, Carr manages to decorate his story with cameo appearances by 
various historical personages, including Theodore Roosevelt ("Bully! This is 
what I like -- a scientific approach!"), J.P. Morgan, William James, Lincoln 
Steffens and Anthony Comstock, all of whom are given roles in an elaborate 
subplot that makes the murder investigation a focal point of ward politics, mob 
rivalries and social turmoil in New York on the verge of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let this man keep killing," cries Kreizler at one point, when archbishops, 
moguls and mobsters combine to suppress his investigation because they all fear 
the unsettling social and political implications of his psychological theories. 
"It's what they want. He's part of their precious social order -- without such 
creatures they've no scapegoats for their own wretched brutality!" 
</P>
<P>
 Even more crucial to "The Alienist," however, is Carr's marvelous use of the 
streets of New York as a stage on which to play out his story of crime and 
punishment. Turn-of-the-century New York is rendered in glorious and intriguing 
detail -- Carr gives us not only the flash and glitter of a night at the opera 
or a 12-course midnight dinner at Delmonico's, but also the hellish poverty of 
tenement life and the medieval horrors of the lunatic asylums. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of the story unfolds in the brothels, where 10-year-old boys are 
dressed up as girls and offered up as playthings for men with especially 
twisted sexual yearnings. And the particulars of how these boys live -- and, 
especially, how they die at the hands of the mysterious killer -- are so 
graphic, so bizarre, that certain passages are horrific and sometimes downright 
repulsive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Carr manages to enlist our wholehearted sympathies for the young 
victims of the serial killer and the intrepid team of self-styled detectives 
who pursue him, and we can hardly put aside the book until we find out whether 
it is the killer or the alienist who prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Carr's book sometimes resembles, say, "The Seven Percent Solution," 
it's entirely successful on its own terms -- a high-spirited, charged-up and 
unfailingly smart thriller that puts Carr's scholarship to good use.

ROBERTI FELLED BY LITTLE-KNOWN FOE ANGELIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON and PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two months after he fended off a recall effort, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti was defeated Tuesday night by a rich, little-known political insider in 
the Democratic race for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Angelides, a 40-year-old Sacramento developer and recent leader of the 
state Democratic Party, buried Roberti in his first statewide election. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than half the vote counted, the 30-year veteran lawmaker conceded 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bon voyage and happy sailing," Roberti told his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I don't have enough rich friends, and it's very difficult to 
fund an election after an expensive recall and to match a $3-million 
(Angelides) campaign that was highly negative against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angelides: "I believe in the end that voters in this critical year will 
be looking for new people and new energy, and that's why I won tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps the most unexpected among the early results in the seven 
statewide races below the governor's office -- wide-open offices, only one of 
which is still held by an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Democratic contest that was looking like it might defy political 
pundits, Tony Miller, the acting secretary of state -- all but anonymous 
outside the office six months ago -- was elbowing his way past two veteran 
politicians, former Los Angeles City Councilman and ex-mayoral candidate 
Michael Woo and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more votes out there," Woo told reporters late Tuesday night. 
"This is going to be a long night. We'll wait for them to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the appointed successor to longtime Secretary of State March Fong Eu 
and the man whose name appeared on the official election pamphlets sent to 
millions of homes, would be the first openly gay man to win statewide office in 
California, and perhaps in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres, a longtime Los Angeles political figure, was keeping a 
safe distance ahead of his leading challenger in the Democratic race for state 
insurance commissioner. Torres and Los Angeles Assemblyman Burt Margolin had 
exchanged heavy-artillery campaign fire in the last days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said late Tuesday that his victory was proof that "the voters rejected 
the politics of anger and negativity and accepted the politics of change." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican contest for insurance commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, the 
best funded of the group, was holding a nearly 2-1 lead over his closest 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Women candidates were performing strongly on both partisan and nonpartisan 
ballots: state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) was comfortably ahead of 
Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run) in the Republican struggle for the 
lieutenant governor's nomination. Democrat Gray Davis had only nominal 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Democratic race for state controller found businesswoman Kathleen 
Connell outdistancing both Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata and Assemblyman 
Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) by 2 to 1. Republican Tom McClintock, who describes 
himself as a taxpayers' advocate, was handily ahead of John Morris, a real 
estate developer and son of the founder of Mervyn's department stores, in the 
race to carry the Republican banner into the general election for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest to succeed convicted felon Bill Honig as state superintendent of 
public instruction -- a nonpartisan position that drew a dozen candidates, 
Republicans and Democrats, professional educators and political veterans -- 
appeared headed for a runoff. The top vote-getters in the early counting were 
Democratic Assemblywoman and educator Delaine Eastin and Gov. Pete Wilson's 
education adviser, Maureen DiMarco. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing her and DiMarco, both longtime education insiders, Eastin said 
voters showed "they do want school reform, because we both ran as reformers, 
but they don't want fringe reform." 
</P>
<P>
 A bitter, at times mean-spirited race had characterized the Democratic Party 
duel in the treasurer's contest between Roberti and the better-funded but 
little-known Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides attacked Roberti for his opposition to abortion and for leading the 
Senate at a time when three senators were convicted of political corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, 55, the former Senate president pro tem, began the campaign with 
higher name recognition, thanks in part to his survival in a recall election 
organized by gun rights activists angered over his assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides will face Republican Matt Fong, 40, now a State Board of 
Equalization member, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for lieutenant governor the key fight was between Republicans 
Wright, 65, and Statham, 55. Wright promised to boost the programs of GOP Gov. 
Wilson, a goal that would require both of them to win in November. 
</P>
<P>
 State Controller Davis, 51, a former assemblyman who was once chief of staff 
to Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., had only token opposition in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowded nonpartisan contest for state schools chief, Eastin, 46, was 
endorsed by the state teachers union and the Democratic Party. DiMarco, 45, is 
Gov. Wilson's secretary of child development and education. 
</P>
<P>
 In a particularly nasty fight for the Democratic nomination for state 
insurance commissioner, Torres, 47, and Margolin, 43, exchanged last-minute 
charges through the mails and the airwaves. Margolin targeted Torres' two 
drunk-driving convictions; Torres accused Margolin of taking campaign money 
from insurance-related sources. Both candidates promised to pressure insurance 
companies into giving consumers the rebates promised 5 1/2 years ago under 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief Republican candidates were Conran, 42, who recently stepped down as 
Gov. Wilson's consumer affairs director; Quackenbush, 40, and Wes Bannister, 
57, who won the party nomination four years ago. Quackenbush tried to 
capitalize on his being a co-author of the "three strikes and you're out" 
anti-crime statute, and pledged late Tuesday not to discuss Torres' two DUI 
convictions in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In the secretary of state's race, the best known Democrat in the field of 
three was Woo, 42, who pledged to change the way campaigns are financed and to 
initiate an enforcement program against companies that counterfeit brand-name 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 53, promised to streamline the office, which is responsible for 
maintaining records and coordinating elections. She also proposed to boost 
voter turnout -- which appeared headed for a notorious low on Tuesday. Miller, 
45, emphasized his experience in the office, where he has worked since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones, 44, of Fresno, the 
author of the "three strikes and you're out" statute, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Few statewide offices are as obscure as controller, the state's top accountant 
and fiscal officer. But the job has sometimes proved a springboard to higher 
office. Democrats Connell, 46, Perata, 49, and Areias, 44, all proposed using 
the office to reduce government waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary race for the District 4 seat on the Board of 
Equalization, the board's current chairman, Brad Sherman, 39, took an early 
lead over four challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican primary for District 4, which includes most of Los Angeles 
County, Ernie Dynda, president of a taxpayer organization, held a 2-1 lead over 
Hal J. Styles Jr., a Woodland Hills businessman.

 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic challenger, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, both will hobble into the general election campaign under a 
cloud of voter disaffection about the two candidates' performance and 
potential, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Brown appears to face the more formidable task in winning over 
the moderate, independent voters who will be decisive as Californians choose 
the state's next governor, according to the results of a survey of voters as 
they left the polls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue Brown has chosen to stress above all others -- the economy -- is 
headed down on voters' list of priorities, while crime, a topic that appears to 
favor Wilson, remains atop the public's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both candidates face a good deal of opposition within their own 
parties, the Angst about Brown among Democrats runs broader and deeper than the 
dissatisfaction with the GOP governor among Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also found that Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who only a few 
weeks ago was considered an overwhelming favorite to be reelected, is in for a 
wide-open race with Rep. Michael Huffington, the Santa Barbara Republican who 
is spending millions from his own bank account to try to unseat her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, directed by John Brennan, interviewed 5,234 voters at 110 
precincts representing a cross-section of California. Among those interviewed 
in this exit poll were 2,656 Democrats and 2,275 Republicans, plus 303 
independents and members of minor parties. The margin of sampling error was 3 
percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interviewed were asked to name the top two issues concerning them as 
they went to the polls. Nearly two out of five respondents -- 36% -- cited 
crime, while 25% named education, 23% said immigration and 20% cited the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Republicans cited crime and immigration as their top concerns, and Wilson 
won handily over challenger Ron Unz among these voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson won every major Republican voting group. His challenger, however, 
tapped into a strong streak of anti-Wilson sentiment, attracting younger voters 
motivated more by dislike of the governor than by ideological differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wilson has significant liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them: More than two-thirds of those who went to the polls Tuesday 
believe that the state is on the "wrong track," while just 31% say it is going 
in the right direction. Even among Republicans, 66% say they are unhappy with 
the direction the state is taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's job approval rating remains precariously low for an incumbent seeking 
reelection. Just 39% of those polled Tuesday said they approved of the job the 
governor was doing, while 61% disapproved. Two out of five Republican voters 
said they were unhappy with Wilson's performance in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Democrats, Brown led Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state 
Sen. Tom Hayden in every region of the state. She won decisively among blacks 
and Latinos and held smaller leads among whites and Asian Americans. She 
defeated Garamendi among poor, middle income and wealthy voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's margin belied a major problem confronting her in the fall: She is 
the clear favorite of her party's liberal stalwarts but had more trouble 
winning support from the elderly and the independent, moderate Democrats who 
must be in her column if she is to defeat Wilson in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Democrats who consider themselves liberals divided their vote this way: 
60% for Brown and about 20% each for Garamendi and Hayden. But among moderates, 
Brown slipped to 49%, while Garamendi got 36% and Hayden received 10%. Among 
conservatives, 45% voted for Garamendi, while 35% sided with Brown and 10% went 
for Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown won big among younger and middle-aged Democrats, Garamendi was 
even with her among the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown won among women by a margin of 55% to 28% but did less well among men, 
winning 46% to 35% for Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown appears to have won the primary on the strength of large margins she 
built on two issues important to many Democrats -- education and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most concerned about education went for Brown over Garamendi by a margin 
of 62% to 21%. Voters most interested in economic issues broke for Brown 63% to 
25%. Brown also bested Garamendi and Hayden on several other issues, including 
bringing business back to California, health care and the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But on crime -- the top issue of the day among voters in both major parties -- 
Brown did not do as well. 
</P>
<P>
 She was only even with Garamendi on that topic, with each drawing around 40% 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On the death penalty -- which Brown opposes but says she would carry out as 
governor -- the Democratic nominee appears vulnerable to a fall attack by 
Wilson, a strong supporter of capital punishment. Among Democrats for whom the 
death penalty was an important influence, Garamendi trounced Brown 63% to 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also defeated Brown among Democrats who said immigration was the top 
issue facing the state today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are four main issues in this governor's race," poll director Brennan 
said. "Wilson has an advantage on crime and immigration and Brown has the 
advantage on education and the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Brown has a difficult chore ahead of her as she seeks to woo back 
those Democrats who voted against her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Democratic voters who sided with Garamendi and Hayden, just 36% said 
they intended to vote for Brown in the fall, while 33% said they would choose 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, among Republicans who voted against Wilson on Tuesday, 46% said 
they would support him in November while only 17% said they would vote for 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who waged an unconventional long-shot bid for the Democratic 
nomination, did best among Jewish Democrats, 28% of whom voted for the onetime 
anti-war radical. He also drew support from liberals and Bay Area residents -- 
although even among these voters, only two in 10 supported him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, Feinstein, an incumbent Democrat who faced only token 
primary opposition, appears headed for a tight fall campaign against 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was doing no better than Huffington, a freshman Republican 
congressman who weathered a tough primary challenge, in solidifying a partisan 
core for November. Of those who voted in the Democratic primary, 66% said they 
intended to vote for Feinstein in the fall, while 16% said they would vote for 
Huffington. On the Republican side, 68% said they would vote for Huffington, 
while 10% said they would go with the Democratic incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty percent of those who voted for Garamendi in the governor's race -- 
mainly moderate and conservative Democrats -- said they intended to vote for 
Huffington over Feinstein for the Senate in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, it appears, has made significant inroads with the conservative 
Republicans who were expected to be a problem for the more moderate 
congressman. Huffington defeated former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 50% to 20% 
among self-described moderate Republicans and 48% to 36% among conservatives.

</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,234 voters, including 2,656 Democratic and 2,275 
Republican primary voters as they exited 110 polling places across the state. 
Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past primary 
elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The margin of sampling 
error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. For some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Because the 
survey does not include absentee voters or those who declined to participate 
when approached, actual returns and demographic estimates by the interviewers 
were used to slightly adjust the sample. Assisting The Times in this poll was 
Davis Market Research Services Inc. of Calabassas. THE TIMES POLL: The Race for

CLINTON BACKS PLAN TO DIVIDE BOSNIA IN TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, discussing the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, told French 
leaders Tuesday that he supports a partition plan that would give Bosnian Serbs 
almost half of the former Yugoslav republic's territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said for the first time that he supports a U.N.-sponsored 
cease-fire plan that is opposed by the Bosnian Muslims, who have been the 
victims of more than two years of aggression and land grabs by Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare speech before the French National Assembly, Clinton endorsed a 
proposal by U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi for a four-month cessation of 
hostilities. The Bosnian Muslims want a much shorter cease-fire, fearing that 
the Serbs will use the time to consolidate their gains and fortify their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials traveling with Clinton said that both U.S. positions represent a 
shift from earlier policies on Bosnia. The Administration had opposed the 
partition plan, which would give 51% of Bosnian territory to Bosnian Muslims 
and Croats and 49% to Bosnian Serbs, as unfair. But in recent months, the 
Americans have reluctantly come to accept the plan as the best the Bosnian 
Muslims can hope to get, given their inferior military position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration endorsed the Akashi cease-fire plan in part to pressure the 
Bosnian Muslims to make concessions to bring a speedier resolution of the civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said the length and the terms of the cease-fire remain to be 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying that the cessation of hostilities has to be four months," a 
senior Administration official said. "If the parties were to agree to some 
other period of time, we would support that as well. The essential thing is to 
support the cessation of hostilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech before the National Assembly, Clinton cited the conflict in 
Bosnia as painful evidence of the need for European unity against racial and 
ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech -- given from the podium of the imposing, semicircular hall where 
the Assembly meets -- marked the first time in 75 years that a U.S. leader has 
been accorded the honor of speaking to the French Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 President Woodrow Wilson addressed the Assembly in February, 1919, telling 
France it was the "frontier of freedom" and elaborating on his proposal for a 
League of Nations. Two other foreign heads of state -- King Juan Carlos of 
Spain and Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands -- have spoken before the French 
Parliament in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used the occasion to call for greater social and economic integration 
in Europe, including the states of the former Soviet Union, and the 
strengthening of freedom against threats from anti-democratic forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can already see the grim alternative," Clinton said, as marble statues 
representing Liberty and Public Order gazed down on him. "Militant nationalism 
is on the rise, transforming the healthy pride of nations, tribes, religious 
and ethnic groups into cancerous prejudice, eating away at states and leaving 
their people addicted to the political painkillers of violence and 
demagoguery." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the slaughter in Bosnia and the random violence of skinheads in Europe 
and the United States are symptoms of this disease. 
</P>
<P>
 He said weaving the various European nations and cultures together in peaceful 
alliance will be the work of "years, even decades." It is a particularly 
difficult challenge, Clinton said, because the peoples of Europe "do not feel 
themselves in imminent peril to confront more distant threats" like Nazism or 
Soviet expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
 During his day in Paris, Clinton met with French business leaders and top 
government officials, including Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of Bosnia came up in each of the official meetings, and Clinton 
went out of his way to express solidarity with the French. "All of us want to 
bring an end to the fighting," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington and Paris, after having 
been at odds for months over Bosnia policy, now have "very convergent" views. 
</P>
<P>
 Another top aide said that over the past weeks, the United States has 
"reluctantly" come closer to the European view of the conflict in the former 
Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton accompanied her husband to the National Assembly but 
had a full schedule on her own the rest of the day. She had breakfast with 
Social Affairs Minister Simone Veil, an outspoken advocate of legalized 
abortion and state support for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks at the event, Mrs. Clinton said that France is "far ahead of 
the U.S. on children and family issues. There is much the United States can 
learn from that kind of national commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the day's final official event, a state dinner, Clinton took a 
half-hour jog along the Seine and through the Tuileries Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 One stroller in the gardens, surprised to see a major world leader jogging in 
small blue shorts, commented: "Mitterrand ne jog pas. Il est trop vieux." 
("Mitterrand does not jog. He is too old.") The French leader is 77.

STUDY STRENGTHENS CANCER LINK TO SECONDHAND SMOKE; HEALTH: EXPOSURE DURING BOTH 
CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD POSES GREATEST RISK. TOBACCO INDUSTRY DISPUTES 
FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, researchers in four 
states reported Tuesday that long-term exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke 
can increase the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women by as much as 86%, and 
that women exposed both during childhood and adulthood were particularly at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the five-year study, which appears in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Assn., provides the best proof to date that secondhand smoke 
is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, and backs the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's controversial 1993 decision to deem 
secondhand smoke a human carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that, on average, a nonsmoking woman who has lived with a 
smoker at any time in her adult life faces a 30% increased risk of lung cancer. 
The research found a clear "dose-response" relationship, meaning the risk grew 
dramatically as exposure increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendously important paper," said Stanton Glantz, a UC San 
Francisco researcher who has done extensive work on secondhand smoke. "The 
scientific evidence that passive smoking causes lung cancer is pretty ironclad. 
This makes the iron quite a lot thicker." 
</P>
<P>
 The article comes at a time of intense debate over the dangers of secondhand 
smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS. Nationwide, more than 
600 state and local ordinances restrict smoking. Congress is considering a bill 
that would ban smoking in nearly every public building in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry is waging a campaign to persuade Americans that 
secondhand smoke is less harmful than most people believe, and contends that 
government efforts to regulate it are not supported by science. Today's JAMA 
article drew immediate criticism from the Tobacco Institute, the industry's 
chief lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute asserted that the study, "like 12 of the other 13 ETS studies 
conducted in the United States," failed to show a statistically significant 
increase in risk. The group said the article "confirms the insubstantial and 
uncertain nature" of the dangers of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead author of the article, epidemiologist Elizabeth T.H. Fontham of 
Louisiana State University, countered: "The body of data available is not 
consistent with the Tobacco Institute's contention." After 40 years of denial 
that active smoking causes lung cancer, Fontham said, she did not expect the 
tobacco industry to acknowledge the risks of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontham and her colleagues, including epidemiologists at USC and UC Berkeley, 
tracked women in Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
Their research, a continuation of their work that was cited in last year's EPA 
report, compared 653 nonsmoking women with lung cancer to a control group of 
1,253 randomly selected women. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other secondhand smoke studies, which have focused primarily on women 
who were married to smokers and exposed in the home, the Fontham group also 
examined exposure in the workplace and social settings. The researchers used 
detailed questionnaires to determine when and where the women had been exposed, 
and for how many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators found that women who had been exposed to secondhand smoke 
only during childhood did not face an increased risk of lung cancer. But women 
who were exposed during childhood and adulthood faced twice the risk of women 
exposed as adults only. 
</P>
<P>
 The research also demonstrated that workplace exposure may pose a greater risk 
than exposure at home. Women who had been exposed to secondhand smoke in the 
workplace for more than 30 years faced an 86% greater risk of lung cancer than 
women who had never been exposed at work, the study found. Women exposed for up 
to 15 years faced a 30% increase in risk, and women exposed for 16 to 30 years 
faced a 40% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In the home, women exposed to more than 30 years of secondhand smoke faced a 
23% increase in risk over those never exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz theorized that the reason for this is because smoking at work occurs in 
closer quarters than at home. But Fontham and her colleagues were unwilling to 
speculate on their results, and cautioned against interpreting the statistics 
to mean that exposure in the home is less risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are equally significant," said Anna Wu, a USC epidemiologist who 
participated in the study. "This simply points out that exposure, whether it is 
at home or the workplace or in a social setting, if it is intense enough, it is 
going to be bad for you." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also addressed some specific criticisms leveled by the tobacco 
industry against previous studies: that statistics have been culled from people 
who lied about their smoking habits, and that other risk factors -- such as a 
high-fat diet -- were responsible for lung cancer in nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontham said the researchers excluded 2% of the study participants after urine 
samples showed levels of cotinine -- a nicotine byproduct -- that were 
consistent with smoking. And, she said, the researchers adjusted their figures 
to account for participants' eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study looked only at women, the researchers said their findings 
hold for men as well. Most secondhand smoke studies have focused on women 
because women are more likely to be the nonsmoking partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings prompted the American Medical Assn. to call for further 
restrictions on smoking in public places, and for the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to regulate cigarettes as drugs because of the addictive nature 
of nicotine -- a move the FDA is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigarettes are no different than syringes," Dr. Randolph Smoak Jr., a member 
of the AMA's board of trustees, told a Washington news conference at a joint 
appearance with Fontham. "They are a drug delivery device for nicotine. They 
should be regulated just as we regulate morphine and heroin."

MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS.

<P>
 California prison officials have long shown deliberate indifference to the 
suffering of thousands of mentally ill convicts and should make sweeping 
reforms in psychiatric care, a federal court magistrate has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of Magistrate Judge John Moulds of the U.S. District Court in 
Sacramento came in response to a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 28,000 
mentally ill prisoners -- the largest such legal action filed by convicts in 
California history. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Prison officials) have for years ignored the considered advice of their own 
experts about the woeful deficiencies in their system," wrote Moulds in a 
blistering decision handed down Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the interim," he continued, "untold thousands of mentally ill inmates have 
gone undiscovered, undiagnosed and untreated while, at the same time, being 
subjected to conditions that aggravate their illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The magistrate said state officials presented no effective defense against the 
lawsuit's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defendants have effectively acknowledged that the delivery of mental health 
care within the California Department of Corrections is, and for many years has 
been, grossly inadequate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Corrections officials had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been reviewing the decision since we received it (Monday)," said 
information officer Christine May, "and until we have a chance to complete the 
review, we won't have a comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds is calling for a court-appointed "special master" to oversee a raft of 
reforms, such as screening new inmates for mental illness and establishing an 
efficient system for dispensing and monitoring psychiatric medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal procedure, Moulds' ruling must be affirmed by a federal judge, 
and prison officials have 20 days to file a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it was considered a significant victory for prisoner rights 
advocates, whose lawsuit contended that the prison system has imposed cruel and 
unusual punishment on mentally ill inmates, who make up about one-fourth of the 
prison population of more than 120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled," said Alison Hardy, attorney with the Prison Law Office, a 
small inmate rights firm that filed the suit three years ago. "It's a 
tremendous decision, and we hope it's implemented as soon as possible so we can 
relieve the terrible suffering (of) our clients." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which was joined by three private firms in San Francisco that 
charged no fees, sought reforms in the treatment of mentally retarded inmates 
as well as the mentally ill, but Moulds asked for further information from 
attorneys on that issue. The suit alleged that prison officials have no method 
for identifying mentally retarded inmates and have no idea how many are 
incarcerated in the state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The main thrust of the suit was on behalf of mentally ill prisoners and 
presented evidence that such inmates were routinely denied medication and 
treatment and were instead locked in solitary confinement and shot with stun 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence in the case showed that in 1990 the psychiatrist at the California 
state prison in Solano refused for two years to dispense medication to any 
mentally ill inmate, no matter how disturbed, because some convicts had hoarded 
or abused drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Moulds' recommendations, the special master would be responsible for 
appointing experts to help prison officials develop plans to carry out reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other recommendations, Moulds said the Department of Corrections 
should be required to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop adequate staffing ratios between employees and mentally ill inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill all mental health staff positions now authorized in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recruit mental health professionals to work in penitentiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Train prison staff members to recognize signs of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop a policy governing the lockup of mentally ill prisoners in solitary 
confinement and the use of such weapons as stun guns on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop a plan to guarantee prompt access to psychiatric hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are sensible recommendations," said attorney Hardy, "in that they permit 
the Department of Corrections to fashion a plan that it can work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reforms could be costly and are being urged at a time when state 
prison officials are expecting spiraling costs connected with a flood of new 
inmates because of get-tough "three strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison Law Office attorneys insisted, however, that public safety would 
benefit from the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of prisoners are going to be released," said Hardy, "and if 
we have a system that exacerbates their mental illness before it releases them, 
the public is in a worse position than if they were treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds also recommended making permanent a previous preliminary injunction 
dealing with the treatment of prisoners receiving heat-sensitive medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction came after three inmates on such medication died at the 
Correctional Medical Facility at Vacaville during a severe heat wave in the 
summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials are required under the injunction to ensure that prisoners 
taking such medication are not subjected to high temperatures.

BROWN WINS, TO FACE WILSON; QUAKE RELIEF BONDS TRAIL; HUFFINGTON COASTS; 
ELECTION: 'I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN,' THE DEMOCRAT TELLS HER SUPPORTERS IN THE 
GUBERNATORIAL RACE. NEWCOMER RON UNZ IS CRUSHED IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BY 
THE GOVERNOR.

 Kathleen Brown cruised to victory in the Democratic primary for governor 
Tuesday and said she is eager to begin a long-awaited showdown with renominated 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson for the right to lead California through economic 
and social turbulence to the edge of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown, 48, who becomes the third Brown chosen by Democrats as 
their gubernatorial standard-bearer in the past four decades, rode a 
well-heeled bandwagon to victory over Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 
49, and state Sen. Tom Hayden, 54. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, after being consigned to political oblivion by some pundits just a 
year ago, crushed upstart challenger Ron Unz, 32, a computer software 
entrepreneur who had never run for office before and spent about $2 million of 
his own money in a vain attempt to upset the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing supporters at the Los Angeles Airport Westin Hotel, Wilson said of 
his victory: "We have completed the first step. We are going to continue making 
the kind of change that will make California all that it can be and all that 
you deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claimed victory at a Democratic Party celebration at the Biltmore Hotel 
in Downtown Los Angeles, telling supporters "how proud I am to be the 
Democratic nominee for governor. I will not let you down." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said her male opponents had teamed up against her during the primary 
campaign, but "I am stronger and more determined and tougher than ever, and 
determined to lead this party to victory in November." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi reluctantly conceded to Brown, saying: "I suppose the die is cast 
and I wish Kathleen Brown well." Hayden also congratulated Brown and urged all 
Democrats to unite behind her in the effort to elect what would be the party's 
third governor in half a century -- all of them Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 60, who won the last two years of Wilson's onetime 
Senate seat in 1992, was nominated by Democrats without major opposition for a 
full six-year term. She will face Republican Rep. Michael Huffington, 46, who 
defeated former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 A generally lackluster campaign culminated Tuesday in possibly the lowest 
voter turnout for a California primary election since the secretary of state's 
office began keeping such records in 1916. The turnout could be as low as 37% 
of registered voters, even smaller than acting Secretary of State Tony Miller's 
official forecast of 39.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief talk to cheering supporters at the Los Angeles Airport Westin 
Hotel, Wilson did not refer directly to Brown, but said: "We have completed the 
first step. We are going to continue making the kind of change that will make 
California all that it can be and all that you deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary campaign was fought against the backdrop of a California in 
trouble: The Golden State now suffering severe recession, state services 
strained by illegal immigrants, and a public that is alarmed over violent 
crime. Since Wilson took office in 1991, California also was battered by a 
perplexing array of disasters, including the 1992 Los Angeles riots, floods, 
fires and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cachet of the Brown family name and a bi-coastal network of 
influential supporters, Brown established herself early as the front-runner. In 
mid-1993, she already had $3.5 million in her campaign treasury and by this 
spring, had raised about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Garamendi began the campaign in debt and the Hayden and Unz 
candidacies were not even on the horizon. Wilson also was taking a pounding in 
the opinion polls, suffering the lowest job approval ratings of any governor in 
modern California political history. 
</P>
<P>
 National commentators began writing Wilson's political obituary and 
forecasting Brown as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tried to reinforce this impression by focusing almost exclusively on 
Wilson, as if the primary election was already behind her. Until the final two 
weeks of the campaign, she virtually ignored her primary opponents, Garamendi 
and Hayden. She emphasized her family's deep roots in California history and 
their determination to stay in the state despite adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 She alluded to the happier, booming days of California in the late 1960s under 
her father, Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., now 89 years old and in frail 
health. Brown blamed Wilson for the state of the economy and adopted a theme of 
creating 1 million jobs in the first four years of a Kathleen Brown 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's front-runner's campaign began to backfire when it was beset by a 
series of miscues and questions by critics -- and some prominent supporters -- 
about her seeming lack of passion to be governor, and her inability to 
articulate what she would do if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Brown delivered a series of heavily promoted policy addresses, 
but they were criticized as shallow compendiums of familiar programs. Some of 
her proposals for reviving the California economy were strikingly similar to 
Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Brown dumped her campaign management team and hired a new strategist 
who repackaged her candidacy this spring under the motto of "America's Best 
Treasurer to Revive America's Worst Economy" and the theme of creating 1 
million jobs. Brown went on the road via chartered bus to point out the impact 
the recession had on California during Wilson's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson adopted a simple campaign strategy beginning last summer as 
his popularity was inching back to respectability in the polls. He used crime 
and illegal immigration as his key issues and dismissed Brown's economic 
attacks by declaring that recovery was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson seized on the "three strikes and you're out" campaign to impose tough 
new sentences -- up to life in prison -- for any criminal convicted of a third 
felony. The "three strikes" campaign caught fire after paroled convict Richard 
Allen Davis was arrested in the abduction-slaying last fall of 12-year-old 
Polly Klaas, who was taken from her home in Petaluma during a slumber party. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also attempted to blame much of the state's budget problem on the 
federal government, charging that it was ducking its legal obligation to 
compensate California for the costs of providing services to illegal immigrants 
and their families -- as much as $3 billion a year. But Congress and the White 
House never have provided more than a few hundred million dollars in 
compensation to the state, nor were they expected to. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also proposed a series of controversial restrictions on illegal 
immigration, including a U.S. constitutional amendment that would repeal the 
provision that any child born in the United States automatically enjoys U.S. 
citizenship, even if their parents are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ignored his own primary foe, Unz -- except for a single radio debate -- 
and went after Brown, hoping to soften her up for the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi built his cash-poor campaign around what he called "workdays," in 
which the candidate toiled by the side of some ordinary Californian for a few 
hours -- in each of the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience provided Garamendi with useful speech anecdotes, but he never 
afforded the sort of media campaign to make the workday idea connect with 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi forces also had looked forward to the three campaign debates -- on 
consecutive days in late May -- as the vehicle for a breakthrough against 
Brown. But Garamendi's attacks -- which were considered contrived and harsh -- 
failed to ruffle Brown. Brown's successful front-runner strategy was to survive 
the debates without making any major mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden emerged as the real winner of the debates, in which he played the role 
of wry, avuncular conciliator between Brown and Garamendi as they pummeled each 
other. Hayden cited their charges and countercharges over alleged fund-raising 
indiscretions as absolute evidence of the need for ridding California campaigns 
of special interest money.

BOND ISSUES THAT RAISE DEBT HEADED FOR DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 Debt-weary voters appeared Tuesday to be soundly rejecting billions of dollars 
in spending measures, including an earthquake recovery bond that Gov. Pete 
Wilson had counted on to help ease the state's budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong support in Los Angeles County, where the Northridge earthquake 
wreaked devastation, the proposal appeared to be falling victim to voter 
distaste for increasing the state's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns showed they were also turning down a tax break for renters and 
spending proposals for park acquisition, improvements for college campuses and 
new construction for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters paid little attention to the propositions during the campaign, 
their dislike for the biggest debt load ever presented on one California ballot 
was foreshadowed in pre-election polling done by higher education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases they're saying: 'We're just afraid of adding any more debt 
service,' 'We'd love to do it but we don't think there's enough money around,' 
and in some instances, 'You haven't really tightened your belt enough and you 
have to first show us you're really cutting deeply before we're willing to 
help,' " Cal State Chancellor Barry Munitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet frugal voters did approve measures that registered their fear of crime and 
concern for people with disabilities. The only two propositions winning by 
comfortable margins would increase prison terms for those convicted of 
second-degree murder in drive-by shootings and give tax breaks to businesses 
that improve access to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rejection of most measures simply means that the state would not 
take on added debt, the apparent defeat of the earthquake bonds would throw 
state budget deliberations into disarray. Already struggling with a $5-billion 
revenue shortage, Wilson and lawmakers were counting on the measure to pay the 
state's share of earthquake repairs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, voters were asked to consider nine ballot measures involving issues as 
sweeping as the expenditure of $2 billion for new parks and as narrow as a 
technical change in sentencing for drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past elections, the June propositions were decidedly low-key. There 
were no television ads; nearly all ran bare-bones campaigns and some had almost 
no campaign at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The only big budget effort was conducted by the promoters of the park bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Without as much hype, voters paid almost no attention. A Times Poll conducted 
nine days before the election showed most voters knew little about the 
propositions and had to have them explained before they would venture an 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this round of proposals included four measures that could have a 
far-reaching combined effect on the state's treasury. The four authorized bond 
issues totaled nearly $6 billion -- the largest sum of indebtedness ever 
presented to voters for approval in a single election. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming an interest rate of 6%, repayment of all four would cost taxpayers an 
estimated $10.6 billion over the 25-year life of the bonds. State taxpayers are 
now paying off a $13.6-billion general obligation bond debt at a cost of about 
$1.8 billion a year. Voter approval of the new issues would add about $422 
million a year to that cost. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on one measure, Proposition 1-A, voters faced a dilemma: If it passed 
it would add to the state's long-term indebtedness, but if it failed it could 
spark a short-term budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure authorized nearly $2 billion in bonds to pay the state's share of 
earthquake recovery costs and $950 million of the cost of strengthening highway 
bridges considered vulnerable to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the budget implications of all four bond proposals, only the park 
bond, Proposition 180, attracted organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as CALPAW, the California Parks and Wildlife initiative, it was also the 
only proposition to qualify for the June ballot as a citizens initiative rather 
than through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), assailed the 
Yes on 180 campaign for accepting large donations from landholders with 
parkland for sale who stood to gain if the massive measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said CALPAW would benefit future generations of Californians by 
saving open lands from development at a time when depressed real estate prices 
ensure that the public would get the most for its money. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of millions of dollars in Proposition 180 was earmarked for Los Angeles 
County, with more than $85 million set aside for properties to be purchased by 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and a sister agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two bond proposals provided funds to upgrade school facilities and 
college campuses. Proposition 1-B authorized $1 billion in bonds to help 
finance construction, renovation and seismic-safety projects for public 
schools. Proposition 1-C authorized $900 million to pay similar costs for 
public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the bond measures, the other main money-related issue involved an 
initiative that would reinstate the state's income tax credit for renters and 
make it a permanent part of the state Constitution. Proposition 175 would 
guarantee a renter's tax reduction of $60 per year for individuals and $120 for 
married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining ballot measures included Proposition 178, which would provide a 
property tax exemption for agricultural improvements that involved the 
installation of water-saving devices. It was failing, while Proposition 176, 
which would prohibit local governments from levying business license taxes and 
fees on nonprofit organizations, was too close to call.

VOTER TURNOUT AT POLLS COULD BE RECORD LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California voters stayed home from the polls in numbers headed straight for 
the record books Tuesday, but don't blame Joe Davison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes before the polls closed Tuesday night, in the tiny mountain 
enclave of Follows Camp, Davison got in his Jeep, got on his citizens band 
radio, and badgered his neighbors -- all 140 or so who are registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to reach them . . . at around a quarter to 8 to remind everybody who 
hadn't made it to the polls," says Davison, owner of the Follows Camp mobile 
home park, which is in the San Gabriel Mountains above Azusa. "I think we got 
three more voters." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tiny precinct couldn't crack a 40% voter turnout no matter how hard 
Davison tried. And, as goes Follows Camp goes, so goes California. Ninety 
minutes before Davison took to the airwaves, acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller lowered his already dismal Election Day prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had predicted a pathetic, historic low of 39.8%," Miller said. "Based upon 
what we know right now, it could be closer to 37%. That would be the lowest 
turnout in a major election since we started keeping records in 1916." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Whitehall wouldn't be surprised if the turnout was even lower than 
that. She has been a precinct worker for 35 years, all near Wilshire Boulevard 
and Western Avenue, and this election will be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since 6:30 this morning," Whitehall said as she sat in the 
polling place at James Barber Shop and waited grumpily for the voters to 
arrive. "It's been terrible. Out of 500 registered voters, we only have 100 
regular ballots. This is too much, to sit here all day." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for Frank Genardi, barbershop owner and violinist 
extraordinaire, "We'd all be bored to death," she said. "He plays classical and 
he plays modern and he plays the themes of the '40s when I could dance." 
</P>
<P>
 But can he explain a 20% turnout? He certainly cannot. "We gave 'em all that 
we usually give: happy faces, pretty music," Genardi insisted as the clocked 
ticked down to closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the lifeguard headquarters garage in Venice, another makeshift polling 
place, a disgusted Delilah Bolden waited for crowds that never arrived. "The 
weather's beautiful, but the voting's lousy. We don't have more than about 100 
who have voted already and it's 5 o'clock. We have about 600 voters. That's 
very low. It's nothing. I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some obvious reasons turnout was low in this election. This wasn't a 
presidential election year, and neither primary in either of the top two races 
-- for governor and for U.S. Senate -- ended up being very close. Also, none of 
the ballot propositions were of the sensational, high-spending kind that can 
draw voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 As Miller points out, it's not like this turnout is an aberration, a stunning 
drop in a stellar record. The last several elections have seen fewer and fewer 
people come out to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an historic pattern here," he said. "And there's not any single 
factor that's causing it. There are not a lot of hot-button measures on the 
ballot. The candidates for even the top offices haven't excited voters. More 
basic than that, people don't think it makes any difference who's elected . . . 
People are giving up on the ability of the process to respond to the issues 
people face." 
</P>
<P>
 If Miller's prediction holds, less than one-sixth of California's population 
will have made decisions on the primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 p.m. Tuesday, only 15.72% of the registered voters in Los Angeles County 
had turned out at the polls, nearly 2 percentage points less than those who had 
voted by the same time in June, 1990, the most apathetic Election Day in county 
history, said Marcia Ventura, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County 
Registrar-Recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be even lower than the 37.7% in 1990," Ventura said. "It may be voter 
apathy. There may be nothing of interest to the voters on the ballot. It might 
be that the politicians have not campaigned enough. It's a difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
 In person-on-the-street interviews, no one said the dog ate the sample ballot, 
but excuses for not voting on Tuesday were right up there. "I'm underage," 
insisted one young woman as she headed toward her Civic Center bus stop. "I'm 
20." 
</P>
<P>
 Gently informed that the voting age was 18, she stopped and stared and found 
another reason: "I didn't even know you were supposed to vote today." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Fiji, who hadn't voted by 7 p.m. and wasn't anywhere near his West 
Covina home and his waiting wife, blamed his boss. "Caltrans is being asked to 
deliver a lot of projects. I'm one of the project engineers. Right now I'm 
working overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so how would he vote if he got to the polls on time? "I haven't really 
paid much attention," he said. "I'm too busy. I'll just vote what my conscience 
tells me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Culley was an even harder case. The overworked mother of a toddler was 
roused via CB by Joe Davison, her boss: "He was saying: 'OK, you guys, it's 
down to the wire. We gotta get going.' " Her response: "I have a 3-year-old 
daughter. I went from one eight-hour job to a part-time job. Cindy didn't have 
a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 In D&S Plaza, a Winnetka mini-mall, four election officials waited for the 
voters at a card table wedged between carpet rolls and vinyl tile samples at 
Valley Discount Carpet. By noon, they had processed 69 of 550 registered 
voters. And with hours to go before after-work voters would show, they did 
their best to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to look at all the pretty colors and pick out carpets for our 
earthquake-damaged houses," said Gloria Weber of Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about food, decorating, anything," added Ruther Chappell, also of 
Winnetka. "What do ladies talk about?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least one voter, however, apparently was willing to go to any extreme to 
vote -- anywhere, that is, except his neighborhood polling place in Central 
Orange County. The problem, he told county officials, was the power line. He 
was afraid to cast his vote because of a high voltage line located at his 
polling place. Could he go somewhere else? Sure, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I've heard everything," a clerk at the county office said.

ON CALIFORNIA: THROUGH THE GLASS -- DARKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for governor begins today. Expect few surprises. Both Pete Wilson and 
Kathleen Brown are modern, well-disciplined candidates. They have surrendered 
their hearts, minds and souls to the campaign handlers, and the campaign 
handlers control the script. For this reason, it is possible to report with 
full confidence that, between now and November. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will remind Californians 456 times that he was a Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will tell audiences at least twice a day that she is a grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will produce $10 million worth of television commercials blaming 
undocumented workers from Mexico for California's problems. Wilson will argue 
that illegal immigrants have drained the state of money needed to reform public 
schools, put down riots, retrain rocket scientists, break the Sacramento 
stalemate, fill potholes, cleanse the environment and fight tooth decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will produce $10 million worth of television commercials blaming Pete 
Wilson for California's problems. She will make the case that Wilson caused the 
recession and was culpable in the untimely end of the Cold War, an event which, 
of course, led to so much economic misery in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates will position themselves as tough on crime. Every Wilson 
speech will contain a reference to poor Polly Klaas, the Petaluma child whose 
murder energized the so-called "three strikes" movement. Brown, conversely, 
will make frequent reference to Melvin Carter, the serial rapist whose bungled 
parole ignited a political firestorm for Wilson. Wilson will promote locking up 
criminals and throwing away the key. He'll talk frequently about the death 
penalty. Brown will promote locking up criminals and throwing away the key. 
Questions about the death penalty, she'll leave to her handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates are state officeholders -- with records to review. Wilson will 
describe how he steered the ship of state through the shoals of natural 
disaster. Brown will tell how efforts to retrofit freeways and purchase 
firefighting seaplanes became stalled on Wilson's watch. Wilson will boast to 
voters about his winning stance on NAFTA, but none will remember what NAFTA 
was. Brown will ignore her failed opposition to NAFTA and instead brag to 
audiences about her record as state treasurer selling bonds. The audiences will 
yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 It will get personal and mean. Wilson won't let anyone forget that Kathleen 
Brown is Jerry Brown's sister. Brown won't let anyone forget that she is Pat 
Brown's daughter. Wilson will revisit Medflies and Rose Bird. Brown will 
compare the number of jobs gained during the administrations of her father and 
brother to the number of jobs lost during Wilson's tenure. Wilson will hint at 
Brown's "softness." His aides will keep calling her "Kathy," because it annoys 
her. They'll suggest she's a "cheerleader." This all is code talk aimed at the 
ESPN crowd. Brown is a woman, a plain fact of nature that the Wilsonites will 
seek to exploit. So will she. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will want it both ways on the gender question. At some photo ops, she'll 
arrive by station wagon, brood in tow, California's mom. At other times, she'll 
rumble up in a Peterbilt and arm-wrestle with a reporter or two. A woman, but a 
tough woman -- that will be her stance. Comparisons to Ann Richards and 
Margaret Thatcher will not be discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forsaking party ideologues, Wilson will present himself as a moderate 
Republican -- hard on crime, friendly to the environment, tough enough to raise 
taxes, a former Marine. Brown will cast herself as a new kind of Democrat -- 
hard on crime, friendly to the economy, tough enough to say no to new taxes, a 
grandmother. Barry Goldwater's famous line about there "not being a dime's 
difference" between the two parties will be quoted on cable television 42 times 
apiece by Patrick Caddell and Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. 
</P>
<P>
 As the race unfolds, the consultants will survey the populace constantly and 
fine-tune the messages whenever needed. It's inevitable that the polls of both 
sides will produce pretty much the same results. Both sides will see at once 
what Californians fear most. And make no mistake. Fear will be the operative 
emotion in this race. Hope is for suckers. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result will be a political contest almost devoid of competing 
political ideology -- a truly modern phenomenon. Wilson and Brown are two 
centrists, both heaving to the middle, both better it seems at reading polls 
than leading them, both primed to campaign around the premise of a failed 
California, to tickle the same fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they will disagree. They will brawl fiercely over questions of character 
and personal history, over particulars of government process. In truth, 
however, they will split on only one fundamental question -- who to blame? It 
will not be a campaign to lift the spirits of Californians. It will be a 
campaign to endure.

HUFFINGTON WINS BID TO CHALLENGE FEINSTEIN; SENATE: LOPSIDED VICTORY OVER GOP 
RIVAL SETS STAGE FOR FALL RACE THAT IS LIKELY TO SET A RECORD FOR CAMPAIGN 
SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Dianne Feinstein will defend her U.S. Senate seat in November against 
a wealthy freshman Republican congressman, Michael Huffington, who easily won 
the GOP nomination Tuesday night with a campaign financed from his personal 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), a former executive in his family's Texas 
petroleum company, spent as much as $8 million of his own to turn the 
Republican primary into a one-sided romp over his nearest GOP rival, William E. 
Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the primary campaign, Huffington hardly acknowledged Dannemeyer, 
whose support did not appear any better than it was two years ago when he lost 
the GOP Senate primary to appointed incumbent John Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with about two-thirds of the votes counted, Dannemeyer was winning in 
Huffington's home county of Santa Barbara, where the congressman sparked a 
controversy by abandoning his House seat for the Senate campaign just months 
after he won it. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely an hour after the polls closed Tuesday, both candidates spoke to 
cheering crowds at the state Republican Party campaign celebration in Los 
Angeles. Dannemeyer hinted that he may run for office again and Huffington 
aimed his sights squarely at the upcoming race against Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in the right place, right?" Huffington asked his jubilant supporters. 
"This is the Dianne Feinstein retirement committee, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein and Huffington are recent arrivals in Washington, but the 
Republican has indicated he will make an issue out of his opponent's 24-year 
record in politics as a local government official in San Francisco and a 
two-time statewide candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne Feinstein says government is her life," Huffington said. "Well, maybe 
it's time for her to get a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington shouted to be heard over a crowd that punctuated each line with a 
cheer, finally erupting into a chant: "Get a life!" 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Feinstein stayed in Washington on Tuesday and retired to her home 
before the California polls closed. She did not plan any celebration and 
suggested that her presence in Washington and nose-to-the-grindstone dedication 
was a notable contrast to her Republican challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to get the job done for California, to create jobs, to reduce 
violence and to stop illegal immigration," she said Tuesday evening. "If you 
compare records, I have produced much more for California than Michael 
Huffington. . . . He doesn't know California. He is a Texan by and large." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary results set the stage for a fall Senate race that is likely to set 
a new high for campaign spending and is sure to be one of the most closely 
watched in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are unusually high because Democrats are fighting to keep control 
of the Senate and the Republicans would get a big boost if they stole an 
unexpected seat in California. Also, if the Democrats lost in such a key state, 
it would send an ominous signal to the White House about President Clinton's 
chances for reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heightened awareness about this race is recent. Just a few months ago, 
Washington insiders and many California Democratic leaders were counting on 
Feinstein's reelection as one of the surest bets of 1994. She is still 
considered a formidable incumbent who would be difficult to unseat. But today, 
the campaign observers regard her race as a serious one. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Feinstein campaign headquarters has been treating the contest 
ever since Huffington entered the race last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her advisers studied the way Huffington, as a virtually unknown businessman 
and newcomer to California, had upset a veteran congressman in 1992. Huffington 
pounded his surprised opponent with negative commercials and spent more than 
$5.2 million of his own money to set a national record for spending in a House 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's staff expects to see the same this summer and fall. When the polls 
tightened in the last few weeks, Feinstein broke out of her campaign's low 
profile with a sharp television attack ad that sought to convince voters that 
Huffington was a Texas carpetbagger who once dodged his California taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge stemmed from the fact that Huffington and his wife, Arianna, 
claimed separate residences from 1988 to 1991. Huffington said he remained in 
Texas, where there is no state income tax, until the 1990 sale of his family's 
oil and gas company was finalized. At the same time, his wife and two daughters 
lived in the couple's new Santa Barbara mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign said they had no proof of wrongdoing, but they suggested 
that the state Franchise Tax Board should conduct an investigation into whether 
Huffington's Texas residency was legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, seemed prepared for the attack. His campaign responded 
quickly with a new television commercial that shot back, charging that 
Feinstein was also a millionaire and that she did not pay federal taxes for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign acknowledged that it had no proof of wrongdoing and that 
its source for the information was the income tax returns that Feinstein had 
made public during her 1990 race for governor. Those returns also indicate that 
the reason Feinstein did not owe taxes for two years -- 1978 and 1979 -- was 
that her first husband was dying of cancer and the family was saddled with huge 
medical bills as it lost an income. 
</P>
<P>
 One outcome of the exchange is likely to be an ongoing effort by Feinstein's 
campaign to insist that Huffington disclose his income tax returns. Feinstein's 
staff contends that details about Huffington's fortune are especially pertinent 
because the candidate is using his own money to pay for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his last campaign finance report and on recent television purchases, 
Huffington was expected to spend as much as $8 million of his personal money on 
the primary. If so, that is already close to the record for the most personal 
money ever spent in a Senate race, set by West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller's 
$10 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has raised at least $6 million, meaning the candidates together are 
more than halfway to a record for the most expensive Senate race in history. 
The current record is $25.9 million, set in the race won by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) in 1984.

YAROSLAVSKY, BLOCK, HAHN TAKE LEADS; COUNTY: FRONT-RUNNERS HOLD HEFTY MARGINS 
IN RACES FOR 3RD DISTRICT SUPERVISOR, SHERIFF AND ASSESSOR. SUPERVISOR GLORIA 
MOLINA IS REELECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky built a commanding lead in early 
election returns Tuesday in his bid for a seat on the County Board of 
Supervisors, and Sheriff Sherman Block ran well ahead of his challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn also took a comfortable lead over a field of 
15 challengers in his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, running unopposed in the 1st Supervisorial District, 
which spans the eastern portion of the county, was reelected for a second term 
on the powerful five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks very good, but I would like to get more votes in," Yaroslavsky said 
from his campaign headquarters at the Westwood Marquis. "I had no reason to 
believe at any time in this campaign that we couldn't win in the primary and I 
hope that by the end of the night we will achieve our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The four county posts up for election this year are all nonpartisan offices in 
which candidates from all political parties run in the same primary. Any 
candidate who gets more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins without 
further balloting. If no candidate gets a majority, a runoff between the top 
two vote-getters will be held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this system, coming in second can mean the chance to fight another day, 
and as results were tallied Tuesday some candidates took solace in being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite trailing Yaroslavsky in early returns, supervisor candidate Don 
Wallace said he remained hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, we are keeping hope alive," Wallace, a retired fire captain, said 
from his Woodland Hills home. "This is going to be a long night." 
</P>
<P>
 Block, seeking his fourth term, has never been forced into a runoff. He said 
he was pleased with early returns that showed him running well ahead of his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am feeling very good about what I have seen to this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessor Hahn said he was "guardedly optimistic" that he could hold onto an 
early lead and win the race outright in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lynch, who was unseated by Hahn four years ago and was seeking to reclaim 
the assessor's post, trailed by a wide margin in early returns. But he said he 
was hopeful that the gap would narrow. Lynch launched an eleventh-hour 
television and radio advertising campaign in the last several days, after most 
absentee ballots had been returned. Absentee ballots are the first results 
tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for county supervisor in the 3rd District was thrown wide open in 
January when five-term incumbent Supervisor Ed Edelman decided to retire. 
Yaroslavsky immediately announced his intention to run for the seat, and seemed 
to discourage other well-known officeholders from joining the race. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hoping to succeed Edelman at the county just as he succeeded him on the 
City Council 18 years ago. In addition to Wallace, Yaroslavsky faced Elgin 
Trammell Sr., a former gang member and youth counselor, and Michael Hirsch, an 
environmental consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky entered the race with a $1-million campaign fund, a long list of 
endorsements and high name recognition in a district that overlaps most of his 
Westside and San Fernando Valley-area council district. The 3rd Supervisorial 
District encompasses the Westside, including the cities of Malibu, Santa Monica 
and West Hollywood, and most of the San Fernando Valley, including the cities 
of San Fernando, Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Hidden Hills and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Block faced a field of five competitors who claimed that the department is 
poorly administered and suffers from low morale. Reserve Sheriff's Capt. Robert 
J. Irmas mounted the most serious challenge to Block, spending an estimated 
$200,000 on a last-minute barrage of TV and radio advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Block's challengers -- Deputy Gil Carrillo, Deputy Tab Rhodes and 
Sgt. John R. Stites II -- are uniformed officers in the department, and Robert 
H. Lewis Jr. is a sergeant with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff oversees 8,000 sworn deputies and about 4,000 non-sworn personnel. 
The department is the fourth-largest law enforcement agency in the country, 
with jurisdiction over 42 cities and unincorporated county areas with a 
combined population of more than 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political analysts said Assessor Hahn's victory four years ago was a 
fluke, noting that he has the same name as popular former county Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn. This year the assessor was hoping to win on the strength of his 
own record. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn is responsible for preparing property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan race for the $151,000-a-year post was dominated by Hahn and 
former Assessor Lynch. As in the 1990 election, many of the candidates are 
current or former employees of the assessor's office who are dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of these county offices will be sworn in Dec. 5.

EMBATTLED REPS. KIM, CALVERT LEAD CHALLENGERS; BONO AHEAD; CONGRESS: THE TWO 
INCUMBENTS EXPRESS CONFIDENCE AFTER BEING DOGGED BY UNFAVORABLE STORIES. FORMER 
ENTERTAINER IS AMONG SIX REPUBLICANS SEEKING VACANT RIVERSIDE COUNTY SEAT.

<P>
 Freshmen Reps. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) and Ken Calvert (R-Riverside), both 
burdened with unsavory political baggage, took early leads in their bids to 
retain their congressional seats in Tuesday's primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with more than half the vote counted, erstwhile entertainer Sonny 
Bono was ahead in the race for the Republican nomination in the 44th 
Congressional District in eastern Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim faced four challengers in the 41st District, which includes parts of Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. Political analysts had speculated 
that the large number of candidates opposing Kim, the first Korean American 
elected to Congress, could dilute the vote against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's best-financed opponent, businesswoman Valerie Romero, attacked the 
incumbent on ethical grounds, hitting hard at the ongoing federal inquiry into 
possible violations of election, tax and labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's early lead had him backslapping supporters at his campaign party in 
Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all the negative publicity I had, all the problems I had, they 
still have faith in me," Kim said of his supporters. "They want to send me 
back. You know what that means to me? I am absolutely, deeply touched. I can't 
ask more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the congressman became the target of the federal probe after The 
Times reported that he had used about $480,000 from his engineering corporation 
to finance his 1992 election campaign despite federal prohibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim described the recent campaign as "very negative primarily from the L.A. 
Times." He added: "I was surprised how bitter it was . . . pictures, canceled 
checks, my coverage was bigger than Feinstein, bigger than any serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
 In western Riverside County's 43rd District, Calvert sought to overcome an 
embarrassing sex scandal. After months of denying it, in April he admitted 
having sex in his car in November with a woman police say is a known 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert has since referred to the incident as a lapse in judgment after an 
emotionally trying year that included the death of his father and his divorce 
from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than half the vote in, Calvert led Republican opponent Joseph (Joe) 
Khoury, a UC Riverside business professor. Khoury tried to take political 
advantage of Calvert's encounter with the alleged prostitute. But Calvert 
struck back, claiming that Khoury is a carpetbagger whose primary residence is 
in Orange County -- outside the congressional district, which covers western 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 As his small lead held into the early evening, Calvert said he was confident 
that he would win -- perhaps by the largest margin he has ever enjoyed. "I have 
always been in close elections, so this is a landslide for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Calvert makes it into the general election, he will likely encounter a 
familiar face. Two years ago, he squeaked by Democrat Mark Takano by only 519 
votes. Early returns showed Takano with a 2-1 lead over his nearest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have a 30-22 advantage in the California House delegation, the 
largest in U.S. history, but face some unpleasant realities of midterm election 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In other congressional races that have attracted notice, Republicans Susan 
Brooks and Ron Florance were locked in a bitter battle in the coastal 36th 
District, which runs from Venice to San Pedro, for the chance to meet 
first-term Democratic Rep. Jane Harman of Marina del Rey in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24th District, encompassing the southwest San Fernando Valley, Malibu 
and the Thousand Oaks section of Ventura County, Republican Richard Sybert was 
thought to be the strongest of five GOP challengers seeking to oppose veteran 
Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a wealthy businessman and former director of planning and research for 
Gov. Pete Wilson, poured more than $400,000 of his own money into the campaign 
and is viewed as a potentially worrisome foe to Beilenson, whose district was 
made less safe in the 1990 redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents did not seek reelection in three of the state's House districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman GOP Rep. Michael Huffington left open his 22nd District, centered in 
San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, when he chose to run for his 
party's Senate nomination. Three Democrats and three Republicans vied to 
replace him. The district leans Republican but its independent-minded voters 
show a preference for environmental Democrats in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns showed Walter H. Capps leading the Democratic primary, and 
Andrea Seastrand ahead among the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta) announced his retirement, and his 44th 
District seat, encompassing the eastern Riverside County cities of Moreno 
Valley, Palm Springs, Indio and Blythe, was being sought by an array of three 
Democrats and six Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono, the former mayor of Palm Springs, is the best-known Republican 
candidate. He was trailed by GOP moderate Patricia (Corky) Larson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of that rhetoric about me not being taken seriously is over," 
Bono said. "I was the most articulate candidate in this race and able to define 
the issues for the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Democratic Assemblyman Steve Clute took the early lead in his party's 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Also retiring is the dean of the state's delegation, Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), who has served in Congress for 32 years. Six Democrats competed to 
replace him in the 16th District that leans heavily toward their party. They 
included former San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery and Santa Clara County Supervisor 
Zoe Lofgren.

S. AFRICA TO PROBE ABUSES, OFFER AMNESTY; HUMAN RIGHTS: PANEL TO FOCUS ON 
RECONCILIATION. THOSE WHO CONFESS TO POLITICAL CRIMES WILL BE PARDONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An official commission will investigate state-sanctioned murders and the 
catalogue of other human rights abuses committed under apartheid, this nation's 
African National Congress-led government decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But eager to allay fears within South Africa's security forces of 
Nuremberg-style trials, officials also offered a new amnesty for politically 
motivated crimes to those who are prepared to confess before the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Dullah Omar said the commission will focus on reconciliation 
efforts, highlighting victims' suffering as well as perpetrators' 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental issue for all South Africans is to come to terms with our 
past on the only moral basis possible -- namely, that the truth be told and 
that the truth be acknowledged," Omar said. "We cannot forgive on behalf of 
victims. The identity of the victims and what happened to them and the identity 
of perpetrators must be made known." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the commission will investigate abuses by both the state and 
liberation movements, including the ANC. But he argued that the two are not 
comparable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not and will not equate those who fought in the struggle against 
apartheid with those who participated in all kinds of activities in order to 
keep apartheid in place," he said. "I do not see the two sides as having the 
same moral claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's precise mandate will not be defined until the government presents 
legislation to Parliament later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides investigating the assassinations of prominent individuals and the 
torture of those in police custody, human rights lawyers say the commission 
could be expected to take up issues such as mass detentions during the state of 
emergency and involvement by security forces in massacres, such as the killings 
of 39 in Boipatong in June, 1992. That incident led the ANC to suspend its 
negotiations with the white government. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups are pressing for the commission to examine apartheid's 
broader harm -- abuses such as the forced removal of blacks from their land, a 
deed that the whites-only Parliament deemed legal but the United Nations 
declared a crime against humanity. More than 3 million blacks were driven from 
their homes to desolate areas called "homelands." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims groups see the Truth Commission as a mechanism to restore their land 
rights or obtain compensation. But some victims fear that the government plan 
for the commission will sacrifice full disclosure of the truth -- including 
names of those responsible for crimes -- in favor of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposing the past threatens to conflict with President Nelson Mandela's 
efforts to win the confidence of whites who still dominate the economy and the 
hierarchy of the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission were given a free hand, a large proportion of those 
implicated in political murders and other abuses are likely to be Afrikaners in 
the police and army; revelations about them, some in the ANC fear, could 
destabilize the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Full disclosure could also be expected to implicate white members of the 
former administration who are part of the new government of national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, delving into the role of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's 
Inkatha Freedom Party in political violence might spark new rounds of killing. 
And an investigation of the ANC role in township violence -- including the 
notorious "necklace" killings in which victims were burnt alive -- and abuses 
in its Angolan prison camps could prove embarrassing to Defense Minister Joe 
Modise, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC came under increasing pressure from victims, human rights lawyers and 
its own supporters to investigate apartheid crimes after the government -- in 
an effort to promote reconciliation -- said it planned to grant amnesty to many 
of those convicted of political crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar said the government still plans to go ahead with its amnesty for those 
convicted of political crimes, or indemnity for those facing charges. But it 
will require a confession to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 While white segregationist political parties and paramilitary groups have 
demanded the unconditional release of their supporters held for politically 
motivated crimes, human rights activists have argued that a blanket amnesty 
would remove the incentive to testify before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar also said there would be no amnesty for crimes committed after Dec. 5, 
1993, when a power-sharing administration was installed. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that the killers of Chris Hani, a top leader of the ANC and 
Communist Party, and Amy Biehl, an American Fulbright scholar, could be 
eligible for an amnesty if their crimes were deemed politically motivated. But 
unless Mandela exercises his presidential prerogative, that rules out the 
release of 36 neo-Nazis accused in election-week bombings that killed 21. 
</P>
<P>
 There were further calls for a Truth Commission last week after an inquest 
concluded that Matthew Goniwe, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, and three 
colleagues were murdered in 1985 on state orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Neville Zietsman said a secret army signal ordering Goniwe's "permanent 
removal from society" was his death warrant. But the judge said he could not 
prove that Gen. Joffel van der Westhuizen, the officer who ordered the signal, 
was responsible for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Goniwe's outraged widow, Nyameka, said the judge's decision made the case for 
why South Africa needs a full accounting of its past. "I can't forgive and 
forget, or go on with my life, until I know the actual killers," she said. "We 
cannot close this chapter yet."

COLOMBIA QUAKE STARTS AVALANCHE; AT LEAST 100 DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 An earthquake unleashed an avalanche that roared down the slopes of a 3 
1/2-mile-high volcano, burying at least 100 people in ice, mud and rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, which had a preliminary magnitude 
of 6.4, was the strongest in Colombia since one measuring 6.8 on May 24, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 64 of the dead from the Monday afternoon disaster were from the 
village of Toez, which was buried by debris that tumbled down the slopes of 
Nevado del Huila volcano, said Gen. Jose Serrano, a commander of the National 
Police. The volcano, at 18,865 feet, is one of the highest in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy on a grand scale," Julio Enrique Ortiz, governor of Huila 
state, told Caracol radio. He flew over the site, which was cut off overland, 
in a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many deaths, but we have hopes that people were able to seek refuge 
on higher ground," Ortiz said. "But the village of Toez has disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 Toez is at the base of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six people died in other villages that were in the path of the 
avalanche, Miguel Munoz, director of the regional prosecutor general's office, 
told Caracol radio. The office is responsible for investigating deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil defense authorities said at least 2,000 people were made homeless by the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers arrived by helicopter Tuesday to begin searching for survivors. 
Helicopters were also ferrying in food and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 A survivor in the town of Belalcazar said the avalanche created a strong wind 
and arrived in a huge cloud of black dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grabbed our kids, but some didn't have time to save theirs," Luis 
Castaneda told Caracol radio. "Those children perished. Others tried to flee to 
the other side of the river, but the avalanche swept them away. It was 
terrible."

UPDATE; SPY CHARGES AIMED AT A-BOMB PIONEERS DRAW COUNTERATTACK; EMINENT 
SCIENTISTS RISE TO THE DEFENSE OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, OTHER PHYSICISTS 
CHARGED IN BOOK WITH LEAKING SECRETS TO THE SOVIETS IN THE '40S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Did J. Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr and other renowned Western physicists 
who helped develop atomic weapons in the 1940s knowingly leak some of their 
secrets to the former Soviet Union? 
</P>
<P>
 An explosive revelation if it were true. A dynamite book. And a bombshell of a 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just such an allegation has burst on the scene, and it has produced 
enough literary fallout to worry its authors and publisher alike. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of eminent scientists who were involved in America's first nuclear 
weapons program has attacked the charges as erroneous, pointing out errors of 
fact in the story that they contend cast serious doubt on the credibility of 
the basic allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Editorial writers have denounced the allegations as inaccurate. And -- worse 
yet from the publisher's point of view -- sales of the book in which they 
appear have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges are contained in "Special Tasks," the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, 
a former Soviet spymaster who oversaw many of Moscow's secret intelligence 
operations -- including those seeking information about the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chapter 7, titled "Atomic Spies," Sudoplatov alleges that Oppenheimer 
helped leak atomic secrets to the Soviets and arranged for Klaus Fuchs, a 
British scientist later convicted of spying, to work at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico, where the bomb was built. 
</P>
<P>
 He also asserts that Bohr, the respected Danish physicist who did pioneering 
work on nuclear weapons for the West, met with a Soviet scientist in Holland 
and helped him correct a problem in Moscow's design for a nuclear reactor that 
helped Russia develop a bomb more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 And he contends that besides Oppenheimer, other famous scientists who came 
here to work on the project, including Enrico Fermi of Italy, Leo Szilard of 
Hungary and George Gamow of Russia, allowed Soviet moles to copy documents and 
"were knowingly part of the scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, Sudoplatov seemingly ought to know. A general in the Soviet 
KGB -- and its director of atomic intelligence during the World War II years -- 
he was in charge of the Soviet Union's efforts to get hold of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors also lend the book apparent credibility. It is co-authored by 
former Time magazine Moscow correspondent Jerrold L. Schecter -- who was 
instrumental in the publication of the memoirs of the late Soviet premier 
Nikita S. Khrushchev -- and his wife, Leona P. Schecter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the volume has set off a chain reaction of criticism that would be enough 
to give pause to any reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Physicist Hans A. Bethe, who was head of the theoretical division at Los 
Alamos in the 1940s; Richard Rhodes, author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb"; 
and Roald Sagdeev, former director of the Soviet Institute of Space Research, 
all have contradicted key details. 
</P>
<P>
 And the American Physical Society, a 43,000-member organization of physicists 
based in College Park, Md., has held a press conference in which five nuclear 
experts denounced the charges as inaccurate and probably fictitious. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, critics who have pored over the volume say Sudoplatov, now 87, 
provides little real evidence to support his assertions. Indeed, except for a 
stray phrase or two, he does not suggest that they committed treason. He 
portrays them more as naive or undisciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to debunk Sudoplatov's specific allegations, critics say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oppenheimer could not have hired Fuchs. The British scientist went to Los 
Alamos as part of a scientific investigative team appointed by the British 
government, and Oppenheimer could not have had any influence over who was 
picked. All team members had full access to the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bohr did meet with a Soviet scientist, but faithfully reported the session 
to Western authorities, and did not reveal any secrets. Moreover, the first 
Soviet reactor was not built until a year after that session -- well beyond 
what should have been the case if Bohr had leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oppenheimer, Bohr and Szilard all shared a conviction that the United States 
should tell the Soviets about the bomb project before using the weapon and 
should begin discussing international control of the device. But they were not 
for giving Moscow any technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major details are just plain wrong. Examples: Szilard never worked at 
Los Alamos, despite Sudoplatov's claims. Denmark was liberated by the British, 
not the Russians. And Sudoplatov never actually calls the scientists spies -- 
he just implies that they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer, Fermi, Bohr, Szilard and Gamow all are dead, although Oppenheimer 
was exonerated of any disloyalty charges. And Sudoplatov himself, in the 
hospital until recently, has remained quiet through the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Schecters -- and Little, Brown & Co., the publishers of 
"Special Tasks" -- are standing their ground. The co-authors argue that it was 
intended mainly as an oral history, and that it should not necessarily be taken 
as fact. 
</P>
<P>
 But the controversy about the book goes on, with hints that the flap may soon 
spark an official investigation. As the American Physical Society said, the 
accusations "are made by a man who has characterized himself as a master of 
deception and deceit."

NEWS ANALYSIS; ARAFAT'S HEALTH WOES RAISE FEARS ABOUT PEACE PROCESS; MIDEAST: 
POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS LACK CHARISMA OF CHAIRMAN. BUT PLO SAYS CAUSE GOES BEYOND 
ONE LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, professed 
himself to be in fine health last week when, recovering from a bout of flu, he 
discussed his fears for the future under Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But on closer scrutiny, in his interview with CBS television anchorman Dan 
Rather, Arafat's hand appeared to shake. It was merely a quiver, but it was 
enough to send chills through those most committed to making peace work between 
Palestinians and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like he was cracking, that the pressure has gotten to him. He 
should have been in command in such an interview, but instead he was shaking," 
said Samir Masri, a businessman in Nablus who, like thousands of other 
Palestinians in the West Bank, watched the interview rebroadcast on Israeli 
television -- and worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason for him to go on American television like that was to show he 
wasn't hospitalized or dying," Masri said. "But doesn't that mean he is close 
to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's hospitalization of Arafat, attributed to a vertebrae problem 
followed by a cold and sore throat, was dismissed by senior PLO officials as a 
minor flare-up that followed weeks of exhausting travel and long hours. But it 
was enough to raise new concerns about how long the 64-year-old chairman can 
travel the strenuous road toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Assassination threats against Arafat -- made by Palestinian radicals since he 
signed the controversial peace agreement with Israel last fall -- have fueled a 
nagging question: What if he died? Could the peace process, carried virtually 
alone on Arafat's back amid a storm of opposition in the Palestinian ranks, 
survive? Is there a successor in the wings? 
</P>
<P>
 Farouk Kaddoumi -- Arafat's most prominent heir apparent in the PLO hierarchy, 
and currently PLO political department chief -- has been a strong critic of the 
"Gaza-Jericho first" interim peace plan; only a bare majority of the PLO 
Executive Committee has backed Arafat in implementing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A PLO with Kaddoumi at the head might well lack the determination it will take 
to make a success of interim peace in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, skeptics 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither Kaddoumi nor the other PLO leader most often mentioned as a 
potential successor -- peace plan architect Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Maazen) -- has 
much in the way of a following in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men certainly lack the charisma and history that Arafat calls on to 
muster unity among mutinous ranks when his peacemaking efforts run into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Israel -- and even the wealthy Gulf Arab states that have fruitlessly 
sought an alternative PLO leader to back since Arafat enraged them with his 
support for Iraq in the Gulf War -- have been forced in recent years to pray 
quietly for the health of the kaffiyeh-clad guerrilla they loathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Arafat dies today or tomorrow, it would be incredibly destructive to the 
peace process, absolutely paralyzing at a time when it should gather speed," 
said Barry Rubin, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University and author of a 
history of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO leaders close to Arafat insist that the peace process has gone beyond 
the health of a single leader. "If Arafat died, the Fatah Central Committee 
would meet and it would select a new leader within 24 hours," said Mohammed 
Sobhieh, secretary general of the Palestine National Council and PLO ambassador 
to the Arab League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a collective decision for peace, a decision that goes beyond one 
man, starting with 1974, when we voted to establish a Palestinian state on any 
territory vacated by Israel, (and) going on in 1988 in Algiers, when the PNC 
adopted (U.N. Resolutions) 242 and 338" establishing the principle of land for 
peace, Sobhieh said. "Now it is too late to turn back." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation and outright alarm about the possibility of his demise are nothing 
new for Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodging bombs and bullets through years of turmoil in Jordan and civil war in 
Lebanon, Arafat was left standing alone at the PLO helm after the assassination 
near his headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, of the only two men besides Arafat 
ever considered serious candidates for political supremacy in the PLO: Khalil 
Wazir (Abu Jihad) and Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad). 
</P>
<P>
 When three of his men were killed when his plane went down in a sandstorm in 
Libya in 1992, Arafat, huddled in blankets and pillows in the back of the 
plane, survived. He emerged in apparently excellent health after surgery to 
remove a blood clot on his brain not long after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom is that the mercurial PLO chairman has survived wars, 
international isolation and countless threats to wash Arab streets in his blood 
but that finally, if he died, peace would not survive him. 
</P>
<P>
 A new dynamic has entered the turbulent world of Palestinian politics since 
the day Arafat signed his historic peace deal with Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin in September. The new politics carry the seeds not only of more 
political pluralism within the PLO hierarchy -- an organization where the first 
and last decisions may one day not be made by Arafat alone -- but of a new era 
when peace might outlast the men who made it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Palestinians are looking at the possibility later this 
year of electing a ruling council for the West Bank and Gaza; Arafat's Fatah 
organization will run like any other political party for votes. Even PLO 
leaders like Kaddoumi who have opposed the peace plan have agreed to work to 
begin implementing it -- lending a momentum that may be difficult to stop as 
self-rule bears fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Palestinians say Arafat's successor would almost certainly be a PLO 
member from outside the occupied territories, most likely Kaddoumi, Abu Maazen 
or someone else from within the central committee of Arafat's Fatah 
organization, the largest component of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there is a substantial minority that sees West Bank Fatah 
leader Faisal Husseini emerging as leader if the succession occurs after the 
Palestinian Authority is up and running, particularly if it holds elections 
Oct. 15 as announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the PLO officials who say Kaddoumi would most likely succeed Arafat 
also say his ascension would not be fatal to the peace process. On the 
contrary, it might help hold the PLO ranks in and outside the territories 
together while a final peace solution is negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaddoumi's preference, say PLO officials close to him, probably would be to 
leave the Palestinian Authority to handle issues in the territories while he 
focused on international contacts and on negotiations for Palestinian statehood 
and freeing Arab East Jerusalem from Israeli control. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Israelis agree with senior PLO leaders who say the peace 
process has moved beyond a single man. "We are dealing with not an individual 
but with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. The peace 
process, including the agreements signed in Oslo, Washington and Cairo, has its 
own strength and own roots now," said an Israeli Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Israeli involved in the peace negotiations said the realization that 
Arafat will not live forever "is a question that has occurred to us and has 
grown larger in recent days, but it is an issue that, from the outset, we 
worked into our negotiating assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, our best judgment was that a political struggle would follow, both in PLO 
Tunis and inside the territories, but it would probably -- I stress the 
probably -- not be bloody and would not bring total chaos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the optimism. Meantime, most talk about Arafat's health, after the 
usual booming assertions that all is well, turns to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Riad Malki, a West Bank leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, observed of Arafat: "He looked unwell, worse than we have ever seen 
him. He certainly could use a rest. . . . I wouldn't like to say more than 
that."

<P>
 Palestinian TV completed its first day of broadcasts Tuesday, beaming a test 
pattern that did not reach much beyond the hotel room where it originated. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would have been a contender in the ratings sweepstakes in the five-mile 
radius from Hisham's Palace Hotel.Children sat watching the red, black, green 
and white colors of the Palestinian flag, plus the words Palestinian 
Broadcasting Corporation, fade in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling Palestinian effort -- which also includes a few newspapers and 
plans to set up radio broadcasts -- is part of the changes seen as crucial to 
convincing the public that the limited autonomy deal will lead to real 
independence from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper journalist Abdallah abu Sayyam said he doesn't mind the modest 
beginnings because he no longer has to submit copy to Israel's military censor.

DENNIS POTTER; SCREENWRITER FOR BRITISH TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Potter, screenwriter for the acclaimed British TV series "The Singing 
Detective" and "Pennies From Heaven," died Tuesday at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter died of liver and pancreatic cancer at his home in Ross-on-Wye, 100 
miles west of London. 
</P>
<P>
 He had suffered more than 30 years from a painful form of arthritis called 
psoriatic arthropathy, which makes the skin blister and joints swell. The 
disease, which he called his "strange, shadowy ally," was responsible for 
turning him away from journalism and politics to television writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not many people have had the chance to address themselves in prolonged crises 
in the way I have," he told The Times in 1988. "That's what the illness has 
given me. I gave up all my public aspirations -- journalism and politics, my 
original careers. Everything I thought about myself had to be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you turn a very hard eye inward and really look, then it is creative. You 
have to remake what you thought you were, and what you make is better. It was 
like an enforced lesson in what it's like to be a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 The illness influenced his best-known and most acclaimed work, the six-part 
series "The Singing Detective" in 1986. The story unfolds in the mind of the 
central character -- played by Michael Gambon -- who suffers the same illness 
and lies in a hospital bed contemplating himself and the world with disgust. He 
hallucinates about characters from his past. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter used the romantic and popular music of the 1940s, lip-synced by his 
characters, as a startling counterpoint to his bleak vision. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was shown in the United States, New York Times film critic Vincent 
Canby said Potter "single-handedly restored the reputation of the screenwriter, 
at least in television." 
</P>
<P>
 Old music in lip-sync was a device that Potter first used with the tunes of 
the '30s in "Pennies From Heaven," a similarly dark tale made as a TV series in 
1978 but later compressed for a Hollywood film starring Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter earned an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay, although the 
film did poorly at the box office. "I built up record-breaking losses for MGM," 
he later joked. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the device again with "Lipstick on Your Collar" in 1993, with the 
music of the 1950s, calling it the third part of a trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Dreamchild," a movie about the real little girl who was Lewis Carroll's 
"Alice in Wonderland," he also merged fantasy and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was pleased when the archbishop of York defended "The Singing 
Detective" as a "classically Christian drama" after much press criticism of 
shocking scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter was almost always controversial. The BBC did not broadcast "Brimstone 
and Treacle" until 1987, 11 years after it was made, because of a scene in 
which a handicapped girl was raped by the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blackeyes," which Potter intended as a condemnation of the pornography 
industry, was criticized as misogynist and voyeuristic when it was broadcast in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Potter's most innovative plays was 1979's "Blue Remembered Hills," 
about the cruelty of children, in which children were played by adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter's childhood was spent in the Forest of Dean, in western England, where 
his father was a coal miner. Potter won a place at Oxford, where he was editor 
of the university magazine and became interested in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost a bid for a seat in Parliament in 1964, the year his illness began. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Margaret, died from cancer last month. He is survived by a son, 
Robert, and two daughters, Jane and Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last months of his life, Potter gave a television interview in which he 
spoke of his latest projects and impending death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a coward when I was young," he said. "It's nice to know that at the 
end, I'm not."

ROBERT H. BITZER; FOUNDER OF HOLLYWOOD CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert H. Bitzer, who founded the Hollywood Church of Religious Science and 
served as its minister for 64 years, has died at the age of 98. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitzer, who spoke at weekly services until a short time ago, died May 30 in 
Hollywood, the church announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The indefatigable minister also served 15 years as president of the 
International New Thought Alliance, a federation of about 500 metaphysical 
churches, and 10 years as president of Religious Science International. Bitzer 
also founded Creative Thought magazine and served for many years as its 
chairman and editor. 
</P>
<P>
 When he established the church in 1930, he conducted services in the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel. In 1941 the congregation acquired a small building on Sunset 
Boulevard that was enlarged many times and remains the church's permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitzer, who lectured around the world as well as from his own pulpit, espoused 
positive thinking as a means of shaping one's destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lack of personal responsibility is the weakness of most religions today," 
he once told 3,000 delegates to the International New Thought Alliance. "There 
are lots of people who don't want to think they can change their lives. They 
like to think of themselves as the victim of circumstances over which they have 
no control." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and reared in Alexandria, Va., Bitzer studied piano and at 15 became 
organist and choirmaster for his church. He was an Army pilot in France during 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Bitzer enrolled as a premedical student at Columbia University. 
But his career took a new direction after he attended lectures by W. John 
Murray, founder of the Church of Divine Science in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitzer started lecturing for the League of the Larger Light, and then won a 
post as pastor of the New Thought Church in Boston. He also served for four 
years as president of the New England Federation of New Thought Centers before 
moving to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitzer is survived by his wife of 53 years, Marguerite C. Bitzer, also an 
ordained minister of Religious Science. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. June 25 at the Hollywood Church of 
Religious Science, 7677 Sunset Blvd.

W. HUMPHREY; JAZZ CLARINETIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Willie Humphrey, a patriarch of traditional New Orleans jazz musicians, died 
at home Tuesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey, a clarinetist and teacher, last performed May 27 at Preservation 
Hall, a home of old-time New Orleans jazz.After the show, he suffered a mild 
heart attack but was expected to recover and return to the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said he apparently died in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey, the oldest regularly performing musician on the New Orleans 
traditional jazz scene, toured worldwide with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band 
and appeared on the public radio program "Prairie Home Companion." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his age, he always stood for his solos, dancing small shuffle steps 
and engaging audiences with his charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Dec. 29, 1900, into a musically gifted family, he was a grandson of James 
B. Humphrey, a music teacher important in the early years of jazz. A brother, 
trombonist Earl Humphrey, died in 1971. Another brother, Percy, a trumpeter, 
still performs in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz historian Dick Allen called Humphrey's death a great loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "One should never forget how much he loved performing and how much people 
loved hearing him," Allen said. "Even though he was in his 90s, he would get up 
and dance and sing and entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If other band members left the stage, he'd sit there and play little solos. 
He loved to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Ora, four children, 16 grandchildren and nine 
great-grandchildren.

U.S. RULES OUT IMMEDIATE MILITARY ACTION IN HAITI; CARIBBEAN: ADMINISTRATION 
WILL RELY INSTEAD ON STEPPED-UP SANCTIONS TO DRIVE OUT THE REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has decided against immediate military action in 
Haiti, hoping instead that stepped-up economic and political sanctions can 
drive the military regime from power there, senior officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of debate between White House aides seeking a quick solution to 
the Haiti impasse and a Pentagon wary of using force, the Administration has 
settled on a series of diplomatic actions in hopes that the sanctions can be 
made effective, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton may reopen the internal debate over military intervention if 
the sanctions fail, but he has set no deadline for that decision, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, they said, the Administration is trying to make the sanctions work 
-- and seeking commitments for a multinational peacekeeping force of 2,000 to 
4,000 troops to pacify Haiti if the regime falls. "We really do want to find a 
peaceful multilateral solution in Haiti," Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott said after returning from a trip to Latin America that focused on 
efforts to tighten the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott, the Administration's diplomatic point man on the issue, argued that 
new U.N.-sponsored sanctions can succeed in driving the Haitian military regime 
from power, despite the doubts of the policy's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Administration has made progress in winning support from Latin 
American countries for the new sanctions. And, he said, several countries have 
agreed to contribute to a new, more muscular U.N. peacekeeping force that would 
police the island once the military regime is toppled. 
</P>
<P>
 "That . . . sends a tough signal to them that the international community is 
serious about this," he said. "It also sends a signal to the many Haitians that 
are staying in their country that there is hope for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott and other officials refused to say which countries have agreed to 
participate. But Canada, France, Venezuela and Argentina have all been involved 
in discussions about the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 The new force is being designed as an "expanded" version of the U.N.-sponsored 
military training force, which was scheduled to land in Haiti in October but 
turned back when armed Haitian thugs gathered at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Some countries said, however, that they would participate only after a 
peaceful transfer of power in Haiti and warned that they might not join if the 
United States invades the island, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Organization of American States, meeting in Brazil, passed a resolution 
Tuesday endorsing the expanded force and urging all its members to join the 
stepped-up economic embargo. The OAS resolution was something of a diplomatic 
victory for the Administration. Some Latin American countries initially sought 
a resolution formally ruling out any use of military force in Haiti, but 
Talbott and other U.S. officials lobbied to avoid such a prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials explained that even though Clinton has not decided on military 
action, he does not want to face an OAS prohibition -- and, more immediately, 
he does not want to relax pressure on the Haitian military by taking the option 
off the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign policy aides, frustrated by the failure of previous sanctions to 
budge the military regime, had urged that military intervention be actively 
considered. Although Defense Secretary William J. Perry dismissed the idea, 
Pentagon officials later acknowledged that they had been forced to consider the 
step because of the depth of Clinton's commitment to solving the Haiti issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The main new sanctions against Haiti include a complete trade embargo, 
including efforts to stop smuggling across the nation's border with the 
Dominican Republic; a ban on commercial air flights; a halt to financial 
transactions; a freeze on overseas financial assets of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
Haiti's military ruler, and others in the regime, and cancellation of the entry 
visas of the rulers and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In additional moves to enforce the sanctions, the Pentagon said it may send a 
small number of U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic to maintain helicopters 
and other equipment for the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have decided to move ahead with plans for a U.S.-funded 
ship-borne radio station to allow exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to broadcast to his people. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important now is that we are seeing more cooperation from other 
countries in implementing the sanctions as well," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States has also been slow. Aristide's chief U.S. adviser, 
former Rep. Michael D. Barnes, said the State Department canceled Cedras' 
wife's U.S. visa -- which she had used for shopping trips to Miami -- only last 
week.

NAVIGATOR REPORTED WINGS SHAKING BEFORE FATAL CHINA CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The navigator of a Russian-built airliner that crashed, killing all 160 people 
aboard, radioed before impact that the plane's wings were trembling, an 
official report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The China Northwest Airlines Tupolev-154 crashed into a field and broke in 
pieces minutes after takeoff Monday morning from Xian, a popular tourist city 
in northern China. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, China's worst aviation disaster, renewed fears that safety is 
suffering as China's airline industry grows faster than its supply of 
experienced crew and modern equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The official New China News Agency said the navigator radioed about the 
shaking wings 14 minutes after takeoff. The plane crashed moments later, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dead were two Americans, an Italian family of four, two young 
British male tourists and an Australian woman, their embassies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Toly, the U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, identified the dead Americans as 
Mark Stoel of Michigan and Mark Woodrum of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodrum's family said he was 25 and had lived in Ripley, W. Va. Stoel was from 
Manistee, Mich., according to Manistee High School Principal Bob Riemersma. He 
graduated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 China's Foreign Ministry identified another foreigner as Swiss, but the Swiss 
Embassy in Beijing said it was awaiting confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the crash was under investigation and refused to comment on 
possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The official China Daily newspaper said experts were analyzing the flight 
recorder recovered from the wreckage. It quoted three witnesses who said they 
heard two loud explosions overhead and then saw a ball of fire crashing to the 
ground, scattering debris across a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
 But video footage of the crash site broadcast on state television showed 
little evidence of an explosion. The main body of the plane, which ended up on 
its back in a field, appeared uncharred, as did a wing lying some distance away 
in a shallow stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Americans were recent college graduates who taught English at an 
engineering institute about 125 miles southwest of Xian, said Wei Shuiyi, the 
school's foreign affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they had planned to take the plane to Guangzhou, near Hong Kong in 
southern China, and then fly on to the United States for a summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said the victims' bodies were 
recovered Monday from the crash site about 600 miles southwest of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 China Northwest has no relationship to the U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines.

12-YEAR-OLD PILOT CROSSES ATLANTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old American became the youngest female pilot to fly the Atlantic 
when she landed her single-engine plane at Glasgow airport Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard flight," Vicki Van Meter said when her blue-and-white Cessna 
210 touched down after a five-hour final leg from Reykjavik in Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 2,000-mile flight started Sunday in Augusta, Me., the U.S. airport where 
Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, started her 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Earhart, Van Meter was accompanied throughout by a flying instructor -- 
she is too young to fly alone legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Meter earlier became the youngest female pilot to cross the continental 
United States when she flew from Augusta to San Diego. Her feat was later 
topped by a 9-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 After stepping down from her plane, Van Meter said she was looking forward to 
seeing her parents, who were due to arrive in Glasgow two hours later on a 
commercial flight from Reykjavik. 
</P>
<P>
 After Glasgow, she plans to visit London, France and Germany.

VETERANS SUE 11 U.S. FIRMS, BLAME THEM FOR DESERT STORM DISABILITIES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Desert Storm veterans are suing 11 American firms they say are responsible for 
illnesses they contracted during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26 veterans are seeking more than $1 billion in a class-action lawsuit for 
the disabilities they say they suffered as a result of biological and chemical 
weapons used by the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed Monday in Angleton, just south of Houston, where one of 
the defendants, Rhone-Poulenc Inc., has a plant. A call to the Rhone-Poulenc 
headquarters in Shelton, Conn., was not returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants are accused of manufacturing biological compounds that they 
knew were "unreasonably dangerous," said David Bickham, who is a lawyer for the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms are also accused of conducting business in such a way that "an 
outlaw country like Iraq" could acquire the compounds and use them to make 
chemical and biological weapons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attorney for the plaintiffs said his clients suffered from several 
disorders including memory loss and speech impairment.

ARMY CHIEF MAY PUSH ROLES FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Army Secretary Togo West Jr. is considering opening a key field artillery job 
to women, as well as jobs piloting commandos behind enemy lines, Pentagon 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing women to serve in units equipped with Multiple Launch Rocket Systems 
would overturn a recommendation from the Army's top uniformed leadership, said 
one Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting women in special operation helicopters could throw women into fights 
similar to the costly street battle in Somalia last October. 
</P>
<P>
 West has informally discussed the options with Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry. Any change is subject to Perry's approval, and he has indicated he would 
like to report to Congress by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the changes take effect, it would be a victory for those in the 
Administration and the armed services who want to grant women a wider role on 
the battlefield. Opening such jobs to women is widely opposed by many senior 
generals in the Army, further reason why Perry will have the final word. 
</P>
<P>
 West has consulted extensively with uniformed and civilian specialists on 
combat and the growing role of women in the military, the Pentagon official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 West is also considering opening slots for women in certain sectors of 
air-defense artillery and combat engineers, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 West is not scheduled to make a decision until Army Chief of Staff Gen. Gordon 
R. Sullivan returns from an overseas trip Saturday, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the field artillery job to women would affect only several dozen women 
immediately but could open up a whole field to women in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLRS is a mobile system that carries a battery of rockets that can be 
launched at targets up to 20 miles away. The tank-like vehicle carries a crew 
of three and is designed to focus intense firepower on enemy air defenses, 
troops and other targets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the piloting job, women would ferry highly trained commandos behind enemy 
lines to conduct secret missions. Opponents to the placement of women in such 
jobs argue that they could be forced into hand-to-hand combat should a mission 
go awry. 
</P>
<P>
 West must make a decision because of steps taken in January by then-Secretary 
of Defense Les Aspin, who moved to open more ground combat jobs to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Navy officials indicated that Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has 
suggested that women continue to be barred from submarines, but that a new 
class of submarine under study could carry accommodations for women.

EX-ACTRESS, SEN. DILLS TAKE EARLY LEADS IN LEGISLATIVE RACES; LEGISLATURE: 
ATTORNEY SHEILA JAMES KUEHL LEADS FIVE DEMOCRATS IN THE 41ST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. 
STATE SEN. RALPH DILLS, 84, IS AHEAD OF THREE CHALLENGERS IN A DISTRICT 
STRETCHING FROM VENICE TO LONG BEACH.

 In Tuesday's primaries for state legislative seats, an octogenarian senator 
battling for one more term and an actress-turned-lawyer vying to become the 
first openly gay member of the Assembly each took early leads in their races. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Los Angeles-area Senate district stretching from Venice to Long Beach, 
incumbent Ralph C. Dills, 84, trumpeted his experience as an asset in seeking 
another four-year term. Dills, a Democrat from El Segundo whose legislative 
career began in 1938, declared in campaign mailers that he was "too old to 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 After scattered early returns gave him the lead, Dills said: "We'll take it 
and that feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 He faced three Democratic opponents, including Torrance Councilman George 
Nakano, in the extensively redrawn district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano and Dills' other foes argued that the incumbent had been in the Capitol 
too long and was out of touch with voters in the coastal district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Westside's 41st Assembly District, Sheila James Kuehl, a Santa Monica 
women's rights attorney who starred in the old "Dobie Gillis" TV series, was 
leading five other Democrats in their party's primary for an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl would be the first openly gay member of the Legislature, but her sexual 
orientation was not a campaign issue. The other leading contenders for the seat 
were two attorneys, Edward Tabash and Roger Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity was center stage in two spirited Democratic contests. In an Assembly 
district comprising northeast Los Angeles, a white legislative aide and a 
Latino community activist squared off for an open seat in an area long 
represented by Latinos. In a nearby district comprising several San Gabriel 
Valley communities, a rookie Latino assemblywoman sought to hold off a 
challenge from a Chinese American. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County, freshman Assemblyman Ray Haynes, who enjoyed strong 
backing from members of the Christian right, appeared headed for victory in a 
Republican Senate primary. Critics say he is so conservative that if nominated, 
a potentially safe GOP seat could fall to the Democrats in November. 
</P>
<P>
 All 80 Assembly seats and half the state Senate's 40 seats were on Tuesday's 
ballot. Many of these seats are in heavily Republican or Democratic districts, 
so capturing the primary will probably be tantamount to winning in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggered by voter-enacted term limits and dissatisfaction with the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, 29 lawmakers were seeking higher office or 
retiring. The open legislative seats created new opportunities to move up the 
political ladder, especially for Latinos and women. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marin County, first-term Assemblywoman Vivien Bronshvag, appeared in danger 
of losing the Democratic nomination in the 6th District to Kerry Mazzoni, a 
member of the Novato school board. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spirited Westside race, five Democrats, including school board member 
Mark Slavkin, were bunched together in early returns in the 42nd Assembly 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic primary in the nearby 47th Assembly District also attracted 
attention, as candidates vied to succeed incumbent Gwen Moore, who was running 
for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily Democratic district, anchored around Baldwin Hills, was drawn to 
favor the election of an African American. The nine Democrats running in the 
primary included Jimmie Lee Gray, who is active in the teachers union, and 
Kevin Murray, son of Paramount Democratic Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. 
Other leading contenders were attorney Geoff Gibbs and Ed Johnson, a longtime 
aide to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 The 45th Assembly District, in northeast Los Angeles, has been the scene of a 
political brawl with ethnic overtones. Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles) is vacating the seat to run for the Senate and has endorsed his chief 
of staff, Bill Mabie, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
 A competing faction in the local Latino community headed by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina is backing Antonio Villaraigosa in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco heads the Legislature's growing 12-member Latino caucus. But some 
critics charged that in promoting Mabie's candidacy, he was undercutting the 
continuing efforts of Latinos to add to their numbers in the Legislature. 
Polanco responded that he viewed Mabie as the best qualified among the 
candidates who filed for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 49th District, Judy Chu, the mayor of Monterey Park, fell behind in 
early returns in her bid to become the first Chinese American in the Assembly 
since 1974. Chu was trailing rookie Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead). 
The primary winner is virtually a shoo-in in November in the strongly 
Democratic district, which includes the communities of Alhambra, San Gabriel 
and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third race of special interest to the Latino community, first-term 
Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) is seeking the Democratic nomination 
in the 24th Senate District. If she wins and is elected in November, Solis 
would become the first Latina in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican primary to succeed state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) 
resulted in one of the spring's most spirited campaigns, with Riverside County 
Sheriff Cois Byrd squaring off against Haynes, whose candidacy has won strong 
support from the Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican strategists believe that they must win this seat if they are to 
wrest control of the Senate from Democrats (the current lineup is 22 Democrats, 
16 Republicans and two independents). Democrats maintain that Haynes is too 
conservative for the district and would be vulnerable to defeat in November.

O'NEILL HAS NARROW LEAD IN LONG BEACH MAYORAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former community college President Beverly O'Neill was narrowly leading City 
Councilman Ray Grabinski with almost half the votes counted Tuesday in a hotly 
contested runoff election for mayor of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner succeeds Ernie Kell, who has been the city's only mayor since 
voters made the job a full-time elected position in 1988. Kell finished fifth 
in the April primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In another of the county's handful of municipal elections, a $27.1-million 
plan to redesign Santa Monica's Civic Center complex was receiving a narrow 
majority in early returns. The proposal calls for up to 1.1 million square feet 
of development, creating a web of parks, ponds and walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's proponents said it would rejuvenate the 45-acre site near the Santa 
Monica Pier into a vibrant town square. Critics contended that it would allow 
RAND, which owns land within the Civic Center area, overly generous development 
rights that could lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, both O'Neill and Grabinski said their styles were best suited 
to help the city's transition from a sleepy port town to a vital urban center. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, the top vote-getter in April's primary, presented herself as the 
genteel academic, a coalition builder adept at winning over critics. O'Neill, 
63, said five years as president of Long Beach City College gave her experience 
administering large budgets and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, an eight-year council veteran, positioned himself as a maverick 
leader with regionwide experience. Known as a blunt, blue-collar politician 
with support in the city's mostly working-class north and west areas, 
Grabinski, 50, also told voters that his insider experience, as a member and 
president of the regional Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, gave 
him contacts the city needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach's three City Council runoffs, there were no clear leaders in 
early returns. Two candidates in separate districts were vying to become the 
first Latinos elected to the council in a city whose population is almost a 
quarter Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Former school board member Jenny Oropeza held a slim lead over community 
activist Dianne McNinch, while former museum President Tonia Reyes Uranga was 
losing to Mike Donelon, a general contractor, in a bid to take over Grabinski's 
seat. Warren Harwood, a 12-year council veteran, was in a virtual tie with 
challenger Jerry Shultz, a sheriff's deputy.

SAN DIEGO D.A. TRAILS IN BID FOR A 7TH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr., the dean of California 
prosecutors, was trailing three challengers Tuesday and apparently headed for 
an inglorious end to an illustrious career. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 68, who was first elected in 1970, was trailing former star prosecutor 
Paul Pfingst, Municipal Judge Larry Stirling and Deputy City Atty. Casey Gwinn. 
Miller was barely ahead of a perennial candidate, Michael Schaefer, who has a 
quixotic history that includes a wife-beating conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 With no candidate getting a majority, Pfingst appeared sure to be in a 
November runoff against Stirling or Gwinn. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has served longer than any district attorney in the state and has 
long been lauded by prosecutors nationwide as an innovator, had been 
politically damaged by a controversial and failed prosecution of a former 
Sunday school teacher on charges of child molestation. His opponents hammered 
at him as being arrogant and out of touch with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Carlsbad, on the ocean north of San Diego, were approving plans for 
a 40-acre, $100-million children's theme park to be built by the makers of Lego 
blocks. It would be California's first new theme park in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition D in Carlsbad pitted Denmark-based Lego against a determined bunch 
of local property owners. After arduous wooing by Gov. Pete Wilson, Lego 
selected Carlsbad as the site of its first American theme park, but local 
opponents warned of traffic, crime and degradation of the coastal city's 
peaceful lifestyle. The vote is only advisory but Lego has said it will abide 
by local wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County Sheriff Jim Roache, dogged by a no-confidence vote by his 
deputies and a rash of jail escapes, was being crushed by Bill Kolender, former 
San Diego police chief and now director of the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 And county voters were divided over an advisory vote that calls for shifting 
the region's major airport from Lindbergh Field near downtown San Diego to the 
property now occupied by Miramar Naval Air Station if the military ever 
abandons the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, two dead men were on the ballot: George Shirakawa, 
listed for reelection to the San Jose City Council, and Dan Hallisey, a 
candidate for Contra Costa County assessor. Shirakawa won, but Hallisey lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when public fear of crime is running high, voters in a handful of 
locales from Mt. Shasta to Borrego Springs were considering tax levies to 
improve police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those was in Petaluma, the Sonoma County town traumatized by the murder 
of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, where voters were asked to approve a tax increase 
to boost law enforcement. In absentee ballots, the first to be counted, the 
measure was losing. A similar measure in Port Hueneme in Ventura County was 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural Imperial County, Brawley voters handily defeated the idea of selling 
alcoholic beverages at their town's top annual social event -- the Cattle Call 
rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle Call officials said that the annual weeklong celebration needs to sell 
beer to make enough money to keep the rodeo grounds in repair and to continue 
as a venue for the professional rodeo circuit. Educators and ministers had 
responded that selling beer at the Cattle Call would undercut efforts to 
educate Brawley youth about the dangers of alcohol.

FATAL OCEANSIDE FIRE BLAMED ON CHILDREN PLAYING WITH MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fire that killed five people Monday morning in an apartment was caused by 
children playing with matches, Fire Marshal Ted Wackerman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is an education for all parents," Wackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one or more of the young victims had apparently been playing with 
matches in the closet of the master bedroom. The fire filled the apartment with 
smoke so thick that firefighters had trouble wading through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego County medical examiner's office said Joseph Arriola, 21, and 
his nephews Joshua, 4; Jesse, 3; Joseph, 2, and Jeremiah, 6 months, died of 
smoke inhalation. The boys' parents, Marine Lance Cpl. Jesse Arriola and his 
wife, Angela, were at work when the fire was reported shortly after 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoke alarm in the apartment was melted so badly that it may never be 
determined if it sounded an alarm, Wackerman said. The fire was reported when 
the smoke set off an alarm in an upstairs apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Joseph Arriola was found on a bed in one of the smaller bedrooms. 
He had arrived from South Carolina on Sunday night to visit his brother and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' bodies were found in a hallway. The boys may have been trying to 
escape when they were overcome by smoke, Wackerman said.

JUSTICES LIMIT DEFENSE ACCESS TO SEARCH WARRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys do not have the right to review search warrants that they 
have challenged, the California Supreme Court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the warrants should be submitted to a trial judge for a closed-door 
review, and the defense will have to abide by the judicial determination, the 
justices said in a decision released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 ruling involved a Marysville case, People vs. Hobbs, in which the 
defendant challenged a search warrant that led to her arrest on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense argued that it should have access to everything in the warrant 
except the name of a confidential informant. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices disagreed.

CAPITOL HILL SENDS WARNING TO CLINTON ON HEALTH CARE REFORM: MOVE IT OR LOSE 
IT; CONGRESS: THE LEGISLATION IS STILL PLODDING IN SEVERAL COMMITTEES. SOME 
INSIDERS SAY IT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT TO SAVE IT FROM A SLOW DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the fate of health care reform in Congress within weeks of being decided, 
some on Capitol Hill have concluded that the White House strategy for enactment 
is a disaster and that the entire effort may collapse unless a change is made 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has "an Alice in Wonderland perspective," said Sen. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.), one of the key lawmakers positioned to help broker a deal. 
"It's June in the last year of this Congress, and I would have hoped that the 
politics of health care would be in better shape." 
</P>
<P>
 At this advanced stage of the legislative process, lawmakers had expected that 
several benchmarks would have been reached. There should have been a general 
understanding on the minimum elements of the program, at least among the 
majority Democrats. Committees negotiating the details should have produced 
their legislation or, at least, should be meeting regularly and making headway. 
And the outlines of the crucial compromises that would make the package salable 
should be clearly visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, none of those auspicious signs are in sight. And insiders agree 
that if the five committees working on the issue cannot produce legislation by 
the end of the month, the idea of sweeping overhaul of the nation's health care 
system is probably in trouble for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obvious danger signs, the Administration continues to insist that 
-- while it is willing to provide analysis and guidance on policy questions -- 
it will not get involved in the back-room negotiations until Congress formally 
presents it with a package. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux and others say it is time for the White House to shift gears from its 
strategy of disengagement -- which congressional leaders themselves had 
encouraged -- and to send a strong signal of the kind of political deal it is 
willing to accept on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 They are particularly anxious to learn whether the President will remain 
determined to impose a mandate on all employers to pay for their workers' 
health benefits and, if so, how the requirements will be applied. Opposition to 
mandatory coverage, particularly by small businesses, has become perhaps the 
biggest stumbling block to enactment of President Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers also say that the President should set a benchmark for his 
bottom-line demand -- universal coverage -- by making it clear what percentage 
of the population must receive guaranteed benefits and how quickly the benefits 
must take effect. Only the most zealous reform advocates have argued that it 
would be technically possible for every person in the country to have health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we decide how we are going to get someplace, we need to know where we 
want to get," Breaux said in an interview last weekend in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who is right, the fact that ostensible allies are at odds over 
strategy so late in the process is an indication of how tenuous the survival of 
the health care effort has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers are keenly aware that this is the time in the life span of a major 
legislative initiative when they must practice their political craft. The time 
for policy debate and philosophical argument is past. The question now is a 
more simple one: Will there be a deal? 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, it is like the monumental fight in 1986 over tax reform. Then, 
as now, the battle was a messy one and its outcome was uncertain until very 
close to the end. Ultimately, members of both houses raised the legislation 
from near death by abandoning their ideological purity in favor of closing a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they would not speak on the record about health care reform's dimming 
prospects, several key figures in Congress agreed that the Administration 
should become more deeply involved, at least in behind-the-scenes negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've arrived at the presidential moment here. It's your bill, Mr. President, 
you got it started. Where are you really?" said one top Democratic 
congressional aide. "You're going to hit a moment where everybody has to put 
their cards on the table, and the White House has cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the criticism has centered on the White House operation itself, 
particularly on the man who was brought in to bring coherence to the health 
care effort, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so damned inept, it's just pathetic. They can't keep their eye on the 
ball," said a Democratic lawmaker who has been one of the Administration's most 
prominent allies on health care and who sits on one of the crucial committees 
where a deal is likely to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes, the legislator added, has "virtually no relationship with any members 
on the Hill." Making the situation worse, he and others said, is the fact that 
Ickes' portfolio, originally expected to center almost exclusively on health 
reform, has been expanded to include many other areas, including overseeing the 
midterm elections and White House embroilment in the Whitewater controversy. 
Lawmakers say they are uncertain who -- if anyone -- is really running the 
political show for the White House on an issue that is its priority. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Ickes insisted that the White House is happy with its 
strategy and is convinced that it is working. He noted that last year, the 
Administration was criticized as "overly involved" in congressional 
deliberations over Clinton's economic program -- in effect, giving away the 
store and leaving less negotiating room for congressional committee chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the committee process ends and bills are formed to go to the floor, you 
will see the Administration more actively involved," Ickes added. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority leaders of both the House and the Senate also defended the 
Clinton team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the President has been handling the matter well. I don't think it's 
wise for him to get involved in this kind of one-on-one negotiations," said 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who has taken the lead role 
on health care in the Senate. "Of course time is tight, but that's not the 
President's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Added House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.): "I really see them as 
out of it, in terms of what we have to do. It really now is our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, too heavy an involvement by the White House -- particularly with 
senators -- would likely make the House even more nervous about moving ahead. 
Democrats there have not forgotten the difficult votes they made last year on 
Clinton's economic plan, only to see the President bargain away what had been 
achieved in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Breaux's complaints are significant, given the position that he is in. For 
starters, he is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, the most difficult 
testing ground for health reform and the panel that skittish lawmakers in both 
the House and Senate are watching closely as the most likely place for a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Breaux -- the leading sponsor of a competing proposal that was 
once considered the chief competition for the Clinton plan -- is now floating 
the compromise that many consider the best hope for breaking the deadlock over 
employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Breaux is playing a very constructive role in this process," Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Lawrence O'Donnell, the Finance Committee's staff director: "Sen. 
Breaux's frustrations are well-earned. He's spent a year trying to come up with 
the right compromise to make this work." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan to require companies to pay for their workers' health benefits 
is the single biggest stumbling block and has been all along. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his allies insist that it is crucial to assuring that all 
Americans have health coverage. Opponents are just as adamant in their 
assertion that it would force businesses to lay off workers or shut down 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux's idea is to give both sides political cover. With the legislation 
adding new incentives to help businesses provide coverage to their workers, 
market forces would have a chance to work for three to five years after the new 
system is put into place. Only if large numbers of workers remain uninsured 
after that time would the government require businesses to start paying for 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to find something that both sides can support and be true to their 
philosophies," Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar approach is under discussion in the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, which has been the most paralyzed over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the White House has yet to say whether such an approach would be 
acceptable. When asked, officials say that they will not comment on any part of 
the plan until they see it placed in the context of an entire bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But history also shows that gambling on a last-minute rescue does not always 
work. Thus, the Administration must step in now to help move things along, or 
risk losing the battle over an issue that Clinton himself raised to the top of 
the national agenda, Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Difficult problems have to be solved from the center out," he said.

COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING SOARS, STUDY FINDS; ALCOHOL: THE NUMBER OF FEMALE 
ABUSERS IS FOUND TO HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY. PANEL RECOMMENDS A CAMPAIGN TO 
DEGLAMORIZE CAMPUS CONSUMPTION.

<P>
 America's colleges are witnessing a "startling" increase in binge drinking, 
particularly among women, and as many as one in three students qualify as 
alcohol abusers, according to a study released Tuesday by a Columbia University 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that widespread drinking leads to violence, vandalism and declining 
academic performance, the report issued by Columbia's Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse calls for campus campaigns to deglamorize alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol abuse is rampant on campuses across the country, even though about 
three-fourths of college students are below the legal drinking age, the report 
notes.

 The percentage of college women who deliberately consume enough alcohol to get 
drunk has soared from 10% in 1977 to 35% last year, according to the study, 
conducted by the Center's Commission on Substance Abuse at Colleges and 
Universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Binge drinking -- defined as the consumption of more than five cans of beer or 
five glasses of wine at a single sitting -- is practiced by 50% of all 
students. Among college women, the percentage has increased from 14% to 37% 
over the last 15 years, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Women drinkers are more at risk than their male counterparts because sex-based 
differences in metabolism tend to cause them to become intoxicated after 
drinking smaller quantities of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once thought of as a male rite of passage, alcohol abuse has now become a 
woman's rite of passage," said Pamela Ann Rymer, a federal appeals court judge 
and a member of the Columbia commission. "Yet drinking to get drunk . . . can 
destroy the lives of the best and the brightest of our young women." 
</P>
<P>
 "This prevalence of binge drinking has devastating consequences," added Father 
Edward A. Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame and chairman of the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 90% of all campus rapes involve drinking on the part of the 
assailant, the victim, or both, the report says. And some 60% of women who 
contract sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, are under the influence 
of alcohol when they have intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Center President Joseph A. Califano Jr. said that young women feel more 
pressure today to compete with men, even in self-destructive activities such as 
drinking. "It's the worst aspect of the macho world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 College students spend an estimated $5.5 billion a year on beer, wine and 
liquor -- more than their combined outlays for books and all other beverages, 
the report says. On a typical campus, per capita student spending on alcohol is 
$446 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The study indicated that collegians tend to drink more than young people who 
do not attend college. For example, 42% of college students reported that they 
had engaged in binge drinking at some point during the preceding two weeks, 
compared to 33% of non-college youth. 
</P>
<P>
 White male college students were the heaviest drinkers, averaging nine drinks 
per week, or roughly twice the amount consumed by white females. Black students 
on predominantly white schools drank far less, the study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Academically, alcohol is a downer, the study reported: 40% of students with 
academic problems drink too much and alcohol is a factor in 28% of dropout 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol . . . is a stumbling block to academic success," said Malloy. "We 
must recognize that alcohol abuse is a debilitating, not a liberating, 
experience and we must work together to deglamorize it." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission proposed a series of steps to change campus attitudes about 
alcohol abuse, including increased education on the problem and coordinated 
strategies involving faculty, alumni, parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 It suggested a national "Alcohol Awareness Index" to rate colleges and 
universities on how well they address alcohol problems. The index would be 
published in college catalogues and national college guides. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel advocated a ban on alcohol-related advertising and promotions, along 
with strict regulation of drinking at campus functions. It called for a change 
in the Campus Security Act of 1990 to require that crime reports specify if 
alcohol abuse was involved.

PANEL RETAINS ABORTION IN HEALTH BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENA BUNIS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle began Tuesday over whether abortion should be included in a 
national health benefits package, with abortion rights forces victorious in the 
initial skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 By an 11-6 vote, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee defeated an 
effort by Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) to strip abortion from the package except in 
cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is jeopardized. The 
committee also rejected an effort by Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) to give states 
broader powers in restricting abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate opened on a civil note, but after an hour emotions began to run 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying the states can opt out with regard to disability, we're not 
saying the states can opt out with regard to mental illness. . . . We're just 
taking one issue," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the committee 
chairman. "We all know what is going on here," he said, referring to a series 
of Republican proposals to curb abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), who is facing reelection in a state that requires 
parental notification and waiting periods for abortions, warned that the issue 
could derail the already shaky effort to overhaul the nation's health care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "However passionately many Americans feel about abortion, we cannot allow that 
one issue to overwhelm and stalemate health care reform," Wofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford, who made health care the central issue in his first Senate campaign, 
said the measure could fail unless abortion becomes an optional part of the 
health insurance package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) warned: "If abortion is not in the bill, 
it will be a big fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Under President Clinton's bill and Kennedy's version, all insurance plans 
would have to cover pregnancy-related services, including abortion. And the 
federal government would pay for abortions for the poor and uninsured, 
something that would effectively render moot the so-called Hyde Amendment, 
which currently bans federally funded abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills do include conscience clauses allowing individual doctors and 
hospitals to refuse to perform or have abortions performed at their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying a woman does not have a right to an abortion," Coats said. 
"What we're addressing is whether we're going to force those who believe it is 
wrong to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats said that right effectively would be taken away from poor women 
if abortion is not part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're middle income, if you're upper income, you can have a safe 
abortion," said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). "The only people we're saying we're 
not going to guarantee the right to have a safe abortion are poor women."

RADON MAY POSE GREATER RISK THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Radon may be more hazardous than previously believed, and scientists should 
conduct a major reassessment of the health threat the gas poses, the National 
Research Council recommended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent radon studies by American and foreign researchers indicate that the 
radioactive gas may constitute a greater risk than currently assumed, the 
council said in a new report.A reassessment would allow specialists to evaluate 
the studies and perhaps recommend an updated radon risk model. 
</P>
<P>
 Radon, an odorless gas produced by the natural decay of radium in the earth, 
can seep into homes and water systems. It causes 7,000 to 30,000 lung cancer 
deaths in the United States every year, the Environmental Protection Agency 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency suggests that home dwellers take action to lower radon levels in 
dwellings if it is found to occur at rates exceeding four picocuries per liter 
of air. But about one in 15 American homes has more than that amount, and some 
have concentrations hundreds of times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies confirm the link between lung cancer and radon and show that 
increased exposure to the gas increases the risk of disease, the council report 
said.

FEDERAL RULES PROPOSED TO REDUCE FAT IN SCHOOL MEALS; NUTRITION: CONTENT IN 
LUNCHES COULD NOT EXCEED 30%. AMBITIOUS PLAN WOULD NOT PAY ANY INCREASED COSTS, 
AND SOME CRITICS SAY IT FALLS SHORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Public schools across the country would be required to prepare meals 
containing no more than 30% fat -- and 10% saturated fat -- under an ambitious 
federal nutrition initiative, but the government does not intend to reimburse 
them for additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules, to be unveiled today, will affect the food served to about 
25 million schoolchildren every day and represent the most extensive change 
since the inception of the school lunch program almost 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of banning certain foods, schools will be required to analyze the 
menus they serve each week to ensure that they do not exceed federal limits for 
fat and saturated fat. Higher-fat meals may be served one day, for example, if 
lower-fat meals are served the next. 
</P>
<P>
 While some school officials are likely to balk at the new responsibilities and 
added costs, schools that fail to comply with the rules would no longer be 
eligible for federal subsidies. After the regulations are published today, the 
public will have 90 days to register comments for consideration by Department 
of Agriculture officials. Unless they are rescinded, the rules will take full 
effect in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Agriculture contends that it should not cost more to serve 
meals that satisfy the new guidelines, but some food preparation specialists 
have expressed doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be cost problems," said Kevin Dando, manager of government 
affairs for the American School Food Service Assn., which represents 65,000 
members. "Schools could be asked to analyze meals using computers they don't 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 A Department of Agriculture report released last fall showed that meals served 
at 99% of participating schools violated the proposed nutrition guidelines, 
with an average of 38% of calories coming from fat and 15% from saturated fat. 
It also showed that average sodium content was almost twice the recommended 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 The new school lunch standards, a priority of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
are compatible with pending legislation sponsored by by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy 
(D-Vt.), a key proponent of federal nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time the federal government realized the indisputable link between 
nutrition, health and learning," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Congress directed the secretary of agriculture to ensure that school 
lunches comply with federal nutrition guidelines. The proposed rules represent 
the first effort to comply with the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health advocates praised the new regulations for limiting fat and 
saturated fat, which have been shown to be major contributors to obesity, heart 
disease and cancer. But some criticized the initiative for not going far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disappointing . . . that USDA did not propose lower sodium levels," 
said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest. "A diet high in sodium clearly contributes to heart disease 
and stroke -- two of our nation's leading killers." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules urge schools to decrease the sodium content of the food they serve 
but do not specify the actual amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutrition advocates complained that the rules do nothing to regulate the fat 
content of food offered on an a la carte basis or sold from vending machines at 
many schools. They also criticized the lengthy phase-in period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dairy producers expressed concern that the new requirements could be used to 
justify an attack on whole milk, which currently must be offered as an optional 
beverage with school lunches. Milk served with school lunches accounts for 
about 5% of all milk consumed in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the natural tendency will be to take the easy way out and not offer 
whole milk," a dairy industry spokesman said.

STUDY FINDS JOHNNY CAN'T WRITE TOO WELL; EDUCATION: MOST U.S. STUDENTS CANNOT 
EXPRESS THEMSELVES EFFECTIVELY, THE ADMINISTRATION REPORTS. RESEARCHERS LINK 
POOR SKILLS AND TV VIEWING. 
</P>

 For the 15 years Gwen Faulkner has been teaching fourth-graders here, she has 
faced a constant challenge: motivating her students to write. 
</P>
<P>
 She devotes large blocks of classroom time to writing and employs five Apple 
computers in her crusade. "Just giving them confidence that they can write is 
very important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner's youngsters are the lucky ones. A nationwide study released at 
Faulkner's school Tuesday by Education Secretary Richard W. Riley found that 
fewer than 20% of American students can write a detailed, well-developed 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time most students graduate from high school, they can pen at least 
"minimally developed" stories or essays, the study concluded. But "mediocrity 
is the norm and quality is the exception," said Michael J. Guerra, executive 
director of the National Catholic Education Assn.'s secondary school division 
and a member of the study team. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 "Writing Report Card" was prepared by the Education Department's 
National Assessment of Educational Progress, which examined writing samples 
from 30,000 fourth-, eighth- and 12th-graders. The study also included a 
questionnaire for students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other conclusions, researchers found a correlation between poor writing 
skills and frequent television viewing. For example, 83% of fourth-graders 
reported watching more than one hour of television per day, while only 16% said 
they spent more than one hour per day on their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tough new test tells us that we have our work cut out for us to improve 
the writing of American students but the good news is we know how to fix the 
problem," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He outlined what he said are keys to improving student writing proficiency: 
ask students to write lengthy pieces of at least three pages, expect students 
to plan their writing and work through several drafts and encourage students to 
read and write at home, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But television and Nintendo are tough habits for schoolchildren to break, 
teachers said. And in many cases, schools cannot afford tools -- such as 
computers -- to help teachers point their students in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded, however, that schools have improved the way they teach 
writing since the last time the Education Department studied writing quality in 
1989. Teachers are assigning longer writing projects more frequently and are 
spending more time on student writing in the classroom, the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they said, writing still is emphasized less than mathematics and 
other subjects. More than half of the eighth-graders in the study reported that 
their teachers "never or hardly ever" assigned long writing projects. In 
addition, teachers of eighth-graders said that the majority of their students 
spent less than two hours each week developing writing skills, compared to five 
hours per week on math. 
</P>
<P>
 And although most students grasp the basic stylistic features of both 
narrative and informative writing, many at each grade level failed to produce 
effective work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the best students who could write relatively effective narrative and 
informative pieces had difficulty with persuasive tasks," according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker said that 
"pathetically small numbers of our students are becoming proficient writers" 
because of a lack of high standards and demanding writing instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 For Marilyn Whirry, a 12th-grade English teacher at Mira Costa High School in 
Manhattan Beach, the study results come as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "A commitment must be made to continue the task so that when they leave high 
school all our young people will feel comfortable with writing and all will 
write well," Whirry said. "We owe this to our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the report's other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * White and Asian students generally outperformed black, Latino and American 
Indians at all three grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls wrote more effectively than boys at all three grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private school students did better than public school students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Students in wealthier urban areas outperformed those in poorer ones. Writing 
Report Card 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-grade persuasive writing samples. Spelling errors are included in the 
samples. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Minimally developed" writing was defined as a brief, vague or somewhat 
confusing response. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Developed" papers included necessary writing elements. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Elaborated" papers showed well-developed and detailed responses to the 
question and sometimes went beyond the specific requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In this test question, fourth-graders were asked to write a letter telling the 
director of the United Space Center whether creatures from another planet 
should be kept here for study by scientists or be allowed to return to their 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 MINIMALLY DEVELOPED 
</P>
<P>
 Dear director, 
</P>
<P>
 I think you should let the space creatures go. If you landed on a different 
planet would you want to look at by a whole bunch of scientists? I don't think 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: The paper contains "clear advice accompanied by an emotional appeal 
about the propriety of studying the space creatures. However, the ideas offered 
are unelaborated -- unexplained and undefended." 
</P>
<P>
 DEVELOPED 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Space Center, 
</P>
<P>
 I think you should let the space creatures go back to their own planet because 
they probabley need to live on their planet. They probeley have different food 
then us and they probeley have different water and different houses and other 
things like that. They could maybe even die if they don't get the food that 
they need and the water that they also need. So I don't think that you should 
keep them and run the testes that you want to. That is my pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: The example contains "both a clear plan and a short argument about 
why the space creatures should be allowed to return to their own planet." 
</P>
<P>
 ELABORATED 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Director of the space center, 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's unfair to keep the creatures and their spaceship here. I know 
that we would know more if we keep them here. I personally think that they 
should have freedom to leave just as we have freedom to keep them here. Please 
let them go back to their planet. If I went to a different place they wouldn't 
keep me as their hostage, so please don't make these poor, harmless creatures 
stay as hostages. I think we would learn more if we let them go, because you 
would learn that you cannot know everything, somethings have to be secrets. If 
we let them go they just might let us in on a few secrets about them, how they 
live, and where they live. So I'm begging you to let them go, and live their 
own lives, on their own planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yours truly, 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: "Responses in this category either included a number of reasons why 
their suggested plan might work or a coherent plea."

PRIMARIES IN 8 STATES SET FALL BATTLEGROUND; POLITICS: FROM THE STATEHOUSES TO 
CAPITOL HILL, FEW INCUMBENTS FACE TOUGH CHALLENGES. BUT NOVEMBER LINEUPS WILL 
FIND GOP FIGHTING FOR HOUSE CONTROL.

 On a busy primary day across the nation Tuesday, South Dakota Gov. Walter D. 
Miller was defeated, while the governors of Iowa and Alabama survived 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans picked New Jersey's Assembly speaker to challenge Democratic Sen. 
Frank R. Lautenberg, and a former Pentagon official to challenge Democratic 
Sen. Jeff Bingaman in New Mexico. Also, freshman Rep. Michael Huffington easily 
won the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 There was voting in eight states in all, and lineups for more than 80 House 
races were being set. But only a few House incumbents faced significant primary 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 South Dakota's Miller, one of five governors who faced a primary challenge 
Tuesday, was defeated by former GOP Gov. Bill Janklow, 54% to 46%. Janklow 
served as governor from 1979 to 1986. South Dakota Democrats nominated former 
Dakota Wesleyan University President Jim Beddow. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Republican Pete Wilson won easily but still faced protest votes 
from conservatives who supported his little-known opponent, high-tech executive 
Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico Democratic Gov. Bruce King was surviving a tough challenge from Lt. 
Gov. Casey Luna in his bid for a fourth, non-consecutive term in November. With 
86% of the vote counted, King had 39% to 36% for Luna. The Republican race was 
too close to call early today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa, three-term Gov. Terry E. Branstad got a scare but defeated moderate 
GOP Rep. Fred Grandy, the former "Love Boat" actor, by a margin of 52% to 48%. 
Branstad will face state Atty. Gen. Bonnie Campbell, who easily won her 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Democratic Gov. Jim Folsom won the right to seek a full term by 
defeating Paul Hubbert, a teacher's union leader and the party's 1990 
gubernatorial nominee. Folsom was lieutenant governor and moved up last year 
when GOP Gov. Guy Hunt was removed from office because of a conviction on 
ethics charges. Republicans face a June 28 runoff, with former Democratic Gov. 
Fob James one of the two GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans need to gain seven seats to control the Senate for the first time 
since 1986, a daunting but not impossible task given recent Democratic setbacks 
and the high number of competitive contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of five Senate primaries Tuesday, three figured prominently in the GOP's 
hopes: New Jersey, New Mexico and California. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, Lautenberg easily defeated two primary opponents, but he is 
considered among the weakest Democratic incumbents this fall. State Assembly 
Speaker Chuck Haytaian coasted to victory in the GOP primary and immediately 
took aim at Lautenberg as a big-spending liberal who has lost touch with New 
Jersey voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman was unopposed in the New Mexico primary. He will face former 
Undersecretary of Defense Colin McMillan, who routed two opponents to win New 
Mexico's Republican nomination. Bingaman is favored, but Republicans hope to 
make his support of President Clinton's budget plan -- and its tax increases -- 
an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the GOP's target list is Feinstein of California, who defeated two 
token opponents Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi GOP Sen. Trent Lott cruised to victory over two little-known 
challengers and is heavily favored to win a second term in November. Two 
Democrats will face off in a June 28 runoff for the right to oppose Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana also had a Senate primary. GOP Sen. Conrad Burns was unopposed. In the 
Democratic race, attorney Jack Mudd easily beat former Sen. John Melcher, who 
lost the seat to Burns in 1988.

 "It's come back, or it's learned a new trick," said Vincent Fischetti of 
Rockefeller University in New York, who directs one of the nation's leading 
laboratories for research on streptococcus bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at infectious diseases, they run in cycles," said Dr. Edward 
Kaplan of the University of Minnesota, director of a World Health Organization 
laboratory devoted to the study of strep. "The Phoenix returns." 
</P>
<P>
 The overwrought headlines, such as "Killer Bug Ate My Face," first appeared in 
England, where 15 people have been afflicted with the deadly bacteria since 
Jan. 1. Eleven have died. Some did indeed lose skin or muscle as a result of 
the infection, which can spread as rapidly as an inch an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, such reports have touched off a series of news stories 
warning of the bacteria's dangers. Two people were hospitalized in Connecticut, 
and both have had "radical surgery," a hospital official in Norwalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in Coral Springs, Fla., and a man in Alhambra, Calif., also were 
recovering after surgery for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news coverage is more widespread than the bacteria. Deadly strains of 
streptococcus remain rare, and the outbreaks are isolated. The federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention said 500 to 1,500 infections occur each year 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Milder strains of strep bacteria are common, infecting perhaps 10% to 15% of 
Americans, the CDC said. They cause strep throat and a mild form of scarlet 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly strains produce a toxin that poisons skin and muscle tissue or 
internal organs, causing the body's own disease fighters to careen out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that's begun, you're in trouble. There's no way to reverse it," 
Fischetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly strains appeared in the United States about five years ago, he 
said. "It's a highly toxic group-A strep," Fischetti said. "Strains like this 
have been around since the turn of the century, when scarlet fever was a deadly 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, scarlet fever is rarely serious, Fischetti said. But in the 1800s, it 
was often accompanied by the same kind of tissue poisoning seen in the recent 
cases. The bacteria are spread primarily through wounds or cuts in the skin. If 
caught early, the infection is treatable, usually with penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors treat advanced infections not only with antibiotics but also by 
cutting out the infected area, including amputating an infected arm or leg, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our physicians have reported seeing cases where this moves as rapidly as an 
inch an hour, so it is vital that people see a doctor very, very quickly," said 
Bob Howard, a spokesman at the CDC.

STATUE OF A CASUAL JIMMY CARTER IS FORMALLY UNVEILED IN GEORGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bronze, life-size statue of former President Jimmy Carter was unveiled 
Tuesday on the state Capitol lawn to a crowd that included many of the 
Georgians who went with him to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the crowd stood as former First Lady Rosalynn Carter helped remove 
a cover to reveal the statue of Carter in work clothes, with his sleeves rolled 
up and his hands outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really did a wonderful job," said Jody Powell, the former press 
secretary. "I just think that's very appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptor Frederick Hart, whose other works include a statue of servicemen at 
the Vietnam War memorial in Washington, said he hoped to capture Carter's 
humanity. Carter said he liked the portrayal. "It was that image that put me in 
the White House and the governor's office, and I hope I can remain . . . (like 
that) in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue is the focal point of an elliptical plaza in which a six-ton stone 
of a rare type of pink granite forms a backdrop. Four granite benches encircle 
the plaza, each inscribed with phrases paying tribute to Carter's work as 
humanitarian, peacemaker, teacher and poet. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue and monument cost about $400,000.

GIRL BURNED IN SUSPICIOUS FIRE IN OJAI VALLEY; BLAZE: ARSON IS SUSPECTED IN 
DESTRUCTION OF OAK VIEW HOME. VICTIM, 13, HAD EARLIER BEEN THE TARGET OF RACIAL 
TAUNTS. NINE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS ARE DISPLACED.

<P>
 A 13-year-old black girl who transferred from an Ojai Valley school because of 
racial taunts was seriously burned Tuesday in a suspected arson fire that 
gutted her family's home and displaced nine other family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana Stanford suffered first- and second-degree burns after the fire broke 
out about 4 a.m. in the living room, where the girl was sleeping on a couch, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a big pop, then I felt heat on my head and I woke up," Shuwana said 
from her Ojai Community Hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana was in stable condition Tuesday, with two silver-dollar-sized burns on 
her forehead and lesser burns on her head and body. She was expected to be 
released from the hospital Tuesday evening, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other family members were treated for smoke inhalation and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said they have not determined the cause of the fire. They 
said there is a 50-50 chance that it resulted from arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's still under investigation," said Norman Plott, spokesman for 
the county Fire Department. "We're taking this house apart piece by piece to 
determine the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 But family members said a hole in their living room window, a pop they heard 
before the fire erupted and the fire's initial single stream of flame all make 
them suspect that a firebomb may have been thrown into their residence, located 
on a quiet street in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members, who had moved from Ventura to the predominantly white Ojai 
Valley 10 months ago for security reasons, said they were awakened by the 
breaking window and then Shuwana's piercing scream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up and I saw a stream of fire," said Charles Stanford, 29, the burned 
girl's uncle. "Then I saw a hole in the glass where it looked like someone had 
thrown something through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Stanford, the girl's grandmother, said: "I heard her yell, 'Grandma! 
Come help me! My face is on fire!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the fire remains uncertain, the top NAACP official in 
Ventura County, John Hatcher, called for an FBI investigation into the incident 
and Ojai city officials expressed sadness and regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley said she has heard about white supremacist 
activity in the Oak View area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is incredibly disturbing," Shelley said of Tuesday's fire. "Most of us 
feel that it couldn't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, Shuwana allegedly was insulted and threatened by a group of 
white girls who scrawled epithets across her locker and carved a swastika just 
yards away, according to James Berube, principal at Matilija Junior High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were counseled, but no disciplinary action was taken because of lack 
of proof and conflicting accounts of the incident, Berube said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana was so afraid she refused to return to campus. She chose instead to 
enroll in a home-schooling program, said Lonnie Stanford, the girl's 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the fire follows the racial incident, family members said they did 
not yet want to conclude that they are victims of a firebombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana said she has no idea whether the fire was racially motivated. She said 
she has not received any nasty notes nor has she been subjected to racial 
harassment since she left school in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford family, including three members who were visiting the destroyed 
home, was relocated to an Ojai motel by the Red Cross.

SAN DIEGO TO RAISE HOTEL ROOM TAX TO FUND NEW SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Diego City Council has voted overwhelmingly to increase the city's 
hotel room tax to raise money for a downtown sports arena and renovations at 
the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's vote raises the transient occupancy tax, or TOT, 1.5 cents, to 10.5 
cents on the dollar, beginning Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Golding and tourism officials have lobbied for the tax hike, 
claiming that it is crucial to the development of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank the council," Golding said after the vote. "I think the step 
that the council has taken today is a decision to make a major investment in 
this city, produce thousands of jobs and produce millions of dollars in 
additional TOT money." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, passed by the City Council 7 to 1, had been opposed by advocates 
of affordable housing because none of the revenue is slated to go into the 
city's Housing Trust Fund. Instead, the money is earmarked for arts and museum 
programs and improvements at Balboa Park, among other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jack McGrory has said the hotel tax increase could net the city 
an additional $6 million in its first 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown growth plan calls for $6.9 million to be used next year on the 
Convention Center expansion.

 WHOSE MONEY? You think all those business magazines at the newsstand are full 
of expert advice? Better watch out for the latest from Your Money. Financial 
writer James Millar advises in the June/July issue that it's good business to 
invest your retirement funds with a specialized company. His recommendation: 
First Pension Corp. of Irvine. . . . Think again. Just recently it was revealed 
that First Pension is bankrupt and deep in scandal, with millions of investor 
dollars missing. . . . The toll-free number it lists to call First Pension has 
been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT PURRFECT: You think it's easy being the mayor of a major city? Think of 
Tom Daly of Anaheim: He was supposed to be official greeter for some of the 
elite cats headed for the annual International Cat Show at the city's 
Convention Center. He had to get Councilman Irv Pickler to sub -- the mayor is 
allergic to cats. . . . Says Daly: "Maybe Irv can pick up the cat-lover vote." 
More than 800 blue-ribbon felines will be competing and on display Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ANGELS: Gone soon will be those Caltrans Orange Angels -- the people who 
rescue you when you're stalled on the freeway. But John Standiford of the 
county Transportation Authority says they aren't going away, they're just 
getting better. . . . They're merging with the local Freeway Service Patrol and 
will concentrate on the traffic mess where the Santa Ana Freeway meets the 
Costa Mesa Freeway. Says Standiford: "It's going to mean better service more 
often." The service's arrival time to stranded motorists is under 10 minutes in 
75% of its calls. 
</P>
<P>
 TONIGHT: Ben Harper sings folk/blues at 8, the Coach House, San Juan 
Capistrano. (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 WEATHER: Mostly sunny with a high near 80 inland. Patchy low clouds and fog 
tonight, otherwise fair. Low in the upper 50s. (B8)

DANA PARSONS: CRIMES OF PASSION CAN BE MURDER ON PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They fascinate us. They appall us. They torment us. 
</P>
<P>
 They're crimes of passion, and everyone from Shakespeare to Spillane knew the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 As studies in human nature, crimes of passion leave us to wonder: Could we 
kill for love? Or, more precisely, could we kill for those evil twins born of 
love -- jealousy and suspicion? 
</P>
<P>
 We never seem to run out of cases. Currently, a Rancho Santa Margarita woman 
is on trial for killing her husband's mistress and their love child. In another 
case, a former Fullerton high school "teacher of the year" was charged last 
week with shooting her former lover and another woman after the two had become 
involved. In another long-running case, a South County man is back in jail 
without bail and awaiting trial for allegedly poisoning his unfaithful wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Love gone wrong is a world the private detective knows only too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's always going to be around," says Joe Sampson, an Orange County 
private investigator with more than 30 years in the business. "It's suspicion 
that leads to it. That suspicion -- within a normally contained person -- they 
can swallow it, they can rationalize it or they can reason it out. For someone 
who's emotionally disturbed, even if it's not apparent, that suspicion gnaws 
like a cancer till it's literally too late to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, Sampson says, suspicious clients paid for information to use 
in court. "Now they come in for quite another reason. They come in for what I 
like to call emotional solace or satisfaction. In other words, the only purpose 
it can serve is to confirm what they already think, like, 'Yeah, he's a 
sonofabitch and he's doing this to me' or 'She's a bitch and look what she's 
doing to me.' And that leads to all kinds of conjecture as to what might come 
about. No decent individual wants to be the instrument for someone being hurt. 
When and if I do these cases, I'm very, very selective and the person has to 
really convince me it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, self-preservation takes precedence over a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you one tragic case," Sampson says. "There was a guy out in the 
Valley, a p.i. had a domestic case and he got the woman shacked up in a hotel 
in Vegas. And his client, who was a professional guy and mild-natured, takes 
him up there because he wanted a confrontation. He went right to the door, 
gives a whack on the door, the door opens, there's his wife with a guy behind 
her, and the guy pulled out a gun and shot her, shot her husband and shot the 
p.i. That's an absolutely true story, and that's what makes you walk on 
eggshells when you get a domestic issue." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Sampson if anything amazes him after all these years. "I'm amazed at 
how quickly so-called love can turn to absolute hatred, so much so that it 
leads to murders. They're not just going out and slashing tires and beating 
them up or nailing a dead cat to the door . . . it's the extra inch that 
worries me." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sandberg, who has a detective business in San Clemente, says, "My 
concern is that there were always violent people, but there seemed to be an 
order and system amongst it. There seemed to be almost an honor among thieves, 
a certain line you didn't pass, you didn't disrespect someone in a particular 
way, whatever. Now it seems like everything's open and every time you see a 
case or open a newspaper, you say, 'I can't believe one human being could 
conceive, contrive and put together these actions against another." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sampson, Sandberg is wary of domestic surveillance cases. Sometimes, the 
case is important because it involves alleged child abuse or has large 
financial implications, but if the case is simply "to confirm someone's 
fidelity, I have talked myself out of a lot of business," Sandberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Sandberg's work is for lawyers preparing for trial. As such, he 
prepares background information on key players in the case. "When I think of 
all the cases, I don't think many of the clients had planned to go out and 
murder someone. They are reactions. The emotion and adrenalin at the moment has 
caused them to react a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Sampson if murder-for-love is human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure whether it's human nature," he says. "You and I might have an 
emotional distress and may suffer in a very real way through it, but the next 
day we get up and it doesn't seem as acute as the day before and we gradually 
simmer down. But other people, and luckily, it's still a minority, they get up 
the next day and they keep building up a head of steam and up it goes and up it 
goes and up it goes and, bingo, the top blows off." 
</P>
<P>
 Are you ever amused, I ask. "There are amusing episodes, but they're few and 
far between. When you've been around as long as I have -- and I'm 71 so I've 
seen it all -- there are some incidents that have their humor. But when you 
think about it, the humor is not very well-placed, because I'll sit back and 
think about something that may give me a chuckle and say, 'What the hell am I 
laughing about?' " 
</P>

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; SAMUELS TRIAL NOT 
MENENDEZ EXTRAVAGANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past two months, a steamy little courtroom drama has been playing in 
Department Q of the Van Nuys Courthouse. Unlike other, similar trials, getting 
a seat here never has been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Salacious details of allegations involving erotic letters, child molestation, 
a dysfunctional family, insurance money, limousines, cocaine snorting, 
beer-guzzling hit men, a nose and boob job, male strippers, shopping sprees and 
a gigolo boyfriend have failed to draw in either spectators or speculators from 
the book- and movie-of-the-week world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabloid TV film crews pop in from time to time. But on most days, Judge 
Michael Hoff's courtroom has been nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels, 45, is charged with soliciting a hit man to kill her 
estranged husband. Then she allegedly got two beer buddies to kill the first 
hit man so he wouldn't give her up to the police. Between the deaths, she 
inherited and spent about half a million bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors start deliberating this week and, if they find Samuels guilty of 
first-degree murder, they must then decide whether she deserves the death 
penalty -- a rarity for women in California. Right now, there are only five 
women on death row. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial has revealed plenty of allegations of money-grubbing and duplicity, 
usually sure-fire dramatic grabbers. But the bottom line is, People vs. Mary 
Ellen Samuels "ain't no Menendez," as defense attorney Phil Nameth has said, 
referring to the publicity circus surrounding the Beverly Hills brothers that 
packed a courtroom just three floors below for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Menendez brothers, Mary Ellen Samuels and her look-alike daughter, 
Nicole, who prosecutor Jan Maurizi alleges is an unindicted co-conspirator in 
the two murders, have told uncorroborated tales of alcoholism and child abuse 
by the dead man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez family preferred ferrets. Samuels had a foul-mouthed parrot. 
According to testimony, Samuels taught the bird to say nasty things about the 
investigating officer. On the stand, she denied teaching the bird anything, 
saying she grew frustrated when it wouldn't say her name. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry provided another glittery common thread. But while 
Jose Menendez was a powerful executive, Robert Samuels was a lowly camera 
operator's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the key. Samuels is lowbrow stuff. When it comes to 
crowd-pleasing prurience, a restless housewife from the San Fernando Valley who 
sold beepers and ran a sandwich shop is no match for Beverly Hills' 
tennis-playing scions and their pastel sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the Menendez boys, the Samuels women are trailer park-adjacent. If 
Joan Didion were writing this, she might call it "Slouching Toward Reseda." 
</P>
<P>
 That did not keep away one faithful spectator, a very normal-looking woman 
with waist-length blonde hair: Susan Conroy, Robert Samuels' younger sister. 
Although she lives more than two hours away, in Corona, she rarely misses a 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she has never felt so alone in her life. "I do it for Bob, because I 
know he would have done it for me," Conroy, 44, said during a lunch break last 
week. "It's something I have to do, something I can't explain except that I 
have to be here for Bob. He can't be here for himself to say these (abuse) 
stories are lies. So I guess I'm here as his voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day in court is emotionally exhausting, Conroy said. "I'd say I go home 
more frustrated and angry than anything else because I have to believe that the 
truth will come out. You have to sit there, showing no emotion. None of it! You 
can't express yourself in a courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the trial has only reinforced her animosity toward her former 
sister-in-law, who grew up a block away from her family. "He was such a 
fun-loving guy, but Bob didn't have a chance," Conroy said. "It's the ultimate 
betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy is amazed to find herself in the middle of such a courtroom soap opera. 
"I'm such an ordinary person," Conroy said. "Like everybody else out there, I 
never thought this was going to happen to my family, or even to people I know. 
But I guess it just goes to show you it can happen to anyone."

WALTER BARANGER, LONGTIME LAWYER IN COUNTY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter Raymond Baranger, a longtime Orange County attorney with such clients 
as actor Dick Powell and singer Pat Boone, died Sunday in Waterbury, Conn., 
from complications of liver cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 During his career, which spanned 40 years, Baranger represented a number of 
clients in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. He served as a temporary judge in 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach and was treasurer of the Orange County chapter 
of the American Cancer Society during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles on Dec. 17, 1917, he graduated from La Verne High School 
and UCLA. In 1941, he joined the U.S. Navy and served as an officer on 
destroyers in the Pacific. He took part in the Battle of Midway and in 
campaigns in the Aleutians, South Pacific and the Philippines. He survived the 
sinking of the destroyer Worden in the Bering Sea in January, 1943, and later 
retired as a lieutenant commander after serving as executive officer on the 
destroyer Abbot. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he worked as a probation officer in Los Angeles County before 
attending Loyola University Law School and establishing a law practice in 
Beverly Hills. He moved his practice to Newport Beach in 1960, specializing in 
criminal defense and corporate law. He also represented a group of investors 
who established the Oakland Oaks of the American Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Baranger lived in Costa Mesa for five years and in Irvine for 27 years before 
retiring in 1992 to Southbury, Conn. In his later years, he started an antique 
business, which often brought him to Southern California for antique shows. He 
was also an avid amateur radio operator and rock collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Baranger is survived by his wife of 40 years, Ann Baranger of Southbury, 
Conn.; a brother, John D. Baranger of Kenai, Alaska; a son, Walter Baranger Jr. 
of Fairfield, Conn.; a daughter, Louise Mills of Tampa, Fla.; and three 
grandchildren.

MIKE PENNER: RAM FANS WOULD VOTE FOR BETTER FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Survey says seven out of 10 Orange County voters couldn't care less if the 
Rams stay or go. 
</P>
<P>
 Record book says seven out of 10 games played by the Rams in the 1990s ended 
in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? 
</P>
<P>
 I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of that Times Orange County poll certainly grab one's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the county voters say it is not important to them personally if 
the Rams remain in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-fourths oppose the county government offering financial enticements to 
keep the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half believe there is no special prestige or civic pride in having 
the Rams stay in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant conclusion to be drawn? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County to Rams: Don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the numbers cut deeper than just that. John Shaw will undoubtedly 
use these percentages to further prod Georgia Frontiere to pick up the phone 
and dial Bekins. He will tell Georgia, "See, what did I tell you? The interest 
simply isn't there. Orange County cannot and will not adequately support a 
professional football franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 And he will be dead wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The way I look at this poll, Orange County has no problem at all with 
professional football. To the contrary, this poll tells me that Orange County 
loves the game. Appreciates it. Relishes it. Has become something of a 
connoisseur of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Orange County wouldn't mind at all if the Rams were sent back to 
the kitchen with the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough of this swill, the fans are saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring us something better. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, even an expansion franchise would suffice. Anything different, 
anything new. After 15 years of half-hearted commitment to the product on the 
field, of assembling The Best Team Pennysaver Coupons Can Buy, the Rams have 
poisoned the well. That's the thing about playing your home games in the 
consumer capital of the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, they know the difference between fine and shoddy merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the poll respondents complained that the Rams give very little back 
to the community and have never fully embraced Orange County as their home, 
pointing to the simple fact that the Rams of Anaheim Stadium are still known 
officially as the "Los Angeles Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 This annoys Orange Countians more than Frontiere and Shaw, both devout 
Angelenos, could ever imagine. Orange County cut the umbilical cord from L.A. 
years ago. It wants its name on the marquee, not somebody else's, which is why 
Michael Eisner's naming of his hockey team was such a stroke. They are not of 
the Mighty Ducks of California or the Mighty Ducks of Golden State. They are 
the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 When Eisner held a press conference to reveal the franchise name, he quickly 
pointed out that his Ducks would be Orange County's first major league 
franchise to use the designation "Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting ovation rattled the rafters in the arena roof over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Countians also contend that they derive no great personal satisfaction 
or sense of pride in having the Rams stay in Anaheim. This is a surprise? 
Losing the footrace to the goal line, getting wiped off the field, botching 
personnel decisions, losing to Cincinnati and Cleveland -- this is not the 
image the average Orange County executive wishes to project to the rest of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If most of the Anaheim Stadium private-suite dwellers conducted their 
businesses they way the Rams have conducted theirs, they'd be out of their 
private suites and hunched down in the parking lot, scrounging for unused 
ticket stubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Countians want a team that represents them and the way they live. The 
Rams fall far short of this ideal, and so do the Angels. When Orange County 
looked at Buck Rodgers, it saw one of its own. Same with Jim Abbott. Same with 
Nolan Ryan. These are doers, and do-gooders, but most of all, they are keepers. 
After 3 1/2 decades, the Angels still are unable to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Fan living in Huntington Beach knows that four years of declining 
production from Jim Everett is two too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Fan living in Mission Viejo can tell you that when you swear you're going 
to draft Trent Dilfer if he's there, and your turn is up and Trent Dilfer is 
there, you go with your first thought, not your third. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunderheads are not suffered here for long. Nor malingerers. Winning isn't 
everything, but effort and competence are. Go 0 for 3 in those departments, or 
create the impression that you have, and, sure, attention spans are going to 
wane and newspaper polls are going to turn up 68% take-em-or-leave-em. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven out of 10 Orange County voters say it's no skin off their noses if the 
Rams board up the shop and leave town for Baltimore or Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 What I want to know is: Has anybody bothered to poll Baltimore or Hartford?

WRIGHT ENJOYS HIS REWARDS; HARD-THROWING KATELLA PITCHER IS COUNTY PLAYER OF 
THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good baseball coaches understand their personnel, so Katella Coach Tim 
McMenamin knelt in front of pitcher Jaret Wright, gave him a congratulatory 
slap on the back and shared the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had been selected The Times Orange County player of the year. McMenamin 
told Wright about the award while the senior right-hander was stretching in 
preparation for his start against Servite in the opening round of the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 For some players, that's not exactly the type of thing they want to hear 
moments before a big game. Wright, however, welcomed the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was joking," Wright said. "I kept asking him, 'Are you serious? 
Are you serious?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of guys might not want to hear that at a time like that, but 
coach knows me well enough to know that's something I want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently so. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by his selection, Wright overwhelmed Servite. He pitched the visiting 
Knights to a 2-0 victory, striking out 12. Seven batters returned to the dugout 
after looking at third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of former Angel pitcher Clyde Wright (1966-73), Jaret's playoff 
performance was another high point in a dazzling season. For all of his 
father's accomplishments, Jaret now has received at least one honor Clyde did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great feeling," Jaret said. "There are a lot of good ballplayers in 
Orange County, so it wasn't even on my mind that I had a chance to win this." 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions are seldom as simple. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2 and 220 pounds, Wright, 18, is an imposing figure. Wright makes 
batters look foolish almost every outing with a fastball that has been clocked 
at 94 m.p.h. He was 7-2 with a 2.98 earned-run average during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he led the county in strikeouts with 100 in 75 innings. No slouch 
at the plate, Wright batted .430 with seven home runs and 32 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-captain, Wright helped lead Katella to a share of the Empire League 
championship, the Knights' first baseball title since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had the most fun this season," Wright said. "Our league championship was 
the best thing because a lot of people picked us to finish last." 
</P>
<P>
 His physical ability and fierce will to win impresses the Cleveland Indians, 
who picked him 10th overall in the June free-agent draft. The Wrights are 
negotiating with the Indians, but Jaret also has scholarship offers from BYU 
and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 While such success and attention -- in addition to possible pending wealth -- 
is exciting, it also has its downside. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to try real hard not to think about all the pressure," Wright said. 
"You have to try to keep it all in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've matured having to deal with all this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 McMenamin agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He handles all the acclaim he gets pretty well," McMenamin said. "A lot of 
kids would feel a lot of pressure, but not him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows he's good and he wants to win as bad as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 With everything that has happened to him this season, Wright sometimes wonders 
if he's been dreaming the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has all been pretty amazing," Wright said. "Looking back on all this 
stuff now, I wonder if it really happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are, this is only the beginning.

NBA FINALS; TIRED? KNICKS SAY THE EDGE IS THEIRS; GAME 1: THEY TAKE ON THE 
ROCKETS TONIGHT AFTER 18 PLAYOFF GAMES AND LITTLE REST -- THE WAY RILEY LIKES 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How long has it been since the Houston Rockets beat whoever it was in the 
Western finals? 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days? 
</P>
<P>
 In the East, powers rose and fell in that time. The Indiana Pacers became 
Cinderellas. Reggie Miller got famous. Spike Lee got publicity. The New York 
Knicks got behind, came back and changed their image from bullies to 
big-hearted lugs. Spike and Reggie did David Letterman's show together, 
suggesting it was all a plot in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, if the Knicks could only ride off into the sunset now, or at least rest 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, ready or not, emotionally spent, running on empty, whatever, they 
have to face the Rockets in tonight's opener of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my wish," the Rockets' Robert Horry said. "(The Pacer series) was a 
very, very physical battle and, hopefully, (the Knicks will) come in here and 
be really tired and their legs will still be weary from the battle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a toll on you. They had to fight hard to win those last 
two. Emotionally, it takes a lot out of you and, physically, it takes a lot out 
of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Horry forgets one thing: The Knicks are not allowed to be tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to be sharp," said Coach Pat Riley, who has no control 
over the schedule but great influence on his players' psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of time to prepare. Three days, I think is perfect. We 
had a great meeting yesterday. We had a good meeting this morning at the hotel 
and walked through everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, physiologically, at this time of the year, athletes are in such 
great shape that the body really needs -- you know every two days they need 
major competition. Otherwise you can get a little bit sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days would, indeed, have been great, but Riley is counting the day of 
the game. The Knicks had two days off and on the first, had to fly across 
country. They had that great meeting on their chartered jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it merely seemed like a lot because this is the first time they have had 
two consecutive days off in two weeks. Since the playoffs started 41 days ago, 
they have played 18 games and taken nine airplane flights. If this series goes 
seven games, they will have broken the record for the longest postseason 
schedule -- 24 games -- set by Riley when he coached the '88 Lakers to the 
second consecutive title he had guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a school of thought that says the rested team loses as much because of 
being away as the other team loses because of fatigue. Riley is a leading 
teacher in this school; as Laker coach, he hated sitting around waiting for 
opponents to finish up. In his first Knick season, his team finished a 
five-game series against the Detroit Pistons and two days later went to Chicago 
and stunned the Bulls, who had been sitting around for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not tired," center Patrick Ewing said. "We're very happy to be here and 
we feel all those games, they just helped us to prepare to go against the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to do what we have to do and get past Houston and have our 
parade down Fifth Avenue." OLAJUWON VS. EWING 
</P>
<P>
 As any kid who knows the market value of his trading cards can tell you, this 
series features Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon in the first great center matchup 
since the 76ers' Moses Malone vs. the Lakers' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon blew Ewing away in their two meetings this season, outscoring him, 
66-24, outrebounding him, 33-19, and topping him in assists, 7-4, and blocks, 
5-2. The Rockets routed the Knicks in both games, and now it is commonly noted, 
even by Knick insiders, that Olajuwon, a ballerina compared to the more 
mechanical Ewing, totally dominates the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Olajuwon has always been a better rebounder and shot blocker. Neither 
is a good passer, but Olajuwon has improved more and is also surrounded by 
better players. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before this season, there was not a lot to choose between them in 
scoring. In 14 previous games, Olajuwon scored 352 points, Ewing 327, an 
average of 25.1 to 23.4. If Ewing wants to go to Fifth Avenue other than to 
shop, he will have to hold Olajuwon to the old numbers, not the new ones. 
ROCKET 'O' VS. KNICK 'D' 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers might be unfair because Olajuwon will get help with Ewing, according 
to the Rocket scheme in which Coach Rudy Tomjanovich tries to keep his 
foul-prone center out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing will try to play Olajuwon alone, according to the Knick scheme. Riley 
likes the theory of his assistant coach, Dick Harter, who set up Detroit's Bad 
Boys defense and thinks you get yourself in trouble somewhere else when you 
double-team. The Knicks never double-teamed Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley is stubborn, besides. Olajuwon, used to playing inside a beehive of 
defenders, can count on one-on-one coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley intends to contain Olajuwon and hold down the Rocket perimeter players 
-- Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Mario Elie, Sam Cassell -- who are used to 
wide-open looks at the basket and are erratic even playing like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live off of their post game," Riley says. "Their shooters become 
parasites off it when you begin to double-team and triple-team too much." KNICK 
'0' VS. ROCKET 'D' 
</P>
<P>
 This is a no-frills series because the teams are so similar. Whichever center 
gets the most help from his jump shooters figures to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley got some distinguished gray at his temples this season, waiting for his 
players to make a jump shot, and losing John Starks to arthroscopic knee 
surgery almost finished him off. 
</P>
<P>
 When Starks could only hobble back into action and Hubert Davis realized he 
was in the playoffs and iced up, the offense threatened to seize up altogether. 
They set a playoff record low with 68 points against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Starks began putting something together midway through the Pacer series. 
In his last three games he scored 16, 26 and 17, which was why the Knicks were 
able to rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in the two schemes is that Riley wants to guard the Rocket 
shooters, turn them off and then deal with Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomjanovich will lean more toward daring the Knicks to prove they can make an 
outside shot. It has worked for a lot of other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks, who said the finals "will be like a breeze" compared to the Pacer 
series, skipped Tuesday's practice to attend a funeral. Coach Pat Riley took 
great pains to explain what Starks really meant: "He was relieved to get 
through two seven-game series. . . . I mean, he has great respect for this 
team. I think he was talking from the standpoint that it was a relief to get 
here and now they don't have to worry about the trapdoors and the land mines 
that could have happened in the early rounds. I think that's where John was 
coming from." . . . East teams have won 13 of the last 14 games on Western 
floors: The Pistons won all three at Portland in 1990, the Bulls swept the 
Lakers at the Forum in 1991, the Bulls won two of three at Portland in 1992 and 
went 3-0 at Phoenix last spring.

 The Houston Summit is filled with 16,000 people, 5,000 of whom wiped their 
cowboy boots on the mat by the door, 3,500 of whom pronounce Olajuwon's first 
name "Hack-keem," 2,000 of whom pronounce Patrick's last name as "Ewin'," 250 
of whom think Nigeria is that place with the waterfall where people go on their 
honeymoons, 4,000 of whom hate picante sauce made in New York City, 1,250 of 
whom work in the oil bidness and all of whom have never seen Houston win 
anything in anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The national anthem is sung by Billy Bob Harry Dean Joe Clint Travis. It goes: 
"Oh, oh, say, can y'all see, bah the dawn's early lot. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks take the floor, John Starks head-butting the guy who sang 
the anthem, Derek Harper throwing two of Houston's players to the floor, 
Anthony Mason kicking a cheerleader in both shins and Charles Oakley punching 
the Houston radio announcer's lights out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets win, 91-88, as Olajuwon gets 41 points and 21 rebounds in front of 
his very proud parents, who had no idea this was what their son did for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2: 
</P>
<P>
 The Summit is filled with 16,000 people, 14,000 of whom come dressed exactly 
like Pat Riley, except, of course, for the gigantic belt buckles and turquoise 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The national anthem is sung by Wynonna Emmylou Loretta Crystal. It goes: "And 
the Rockets' red glare, the bombs burstin' in air, don't y'all hate New York, 
how can anyone live there? . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes into the game, Vernon Maxwell is ejected for pulling Marv Albert's wig 
off. Maxwell chases two TV cameramen down a hallway, out Gate B, through 
Greenway Plaza, down the freeway toward Intercontinental Airport and into the 
gift shop near the barbecue-honey-roasted peanuts before he is restrained. This 
could be a rough series. 
</P>
<P>
 Without him, the Rockets lose, 87-84, and trade Robert Horry to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 3: 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Square Garden is filled with 19,000 people, 9,000 of whom think the 
Alamo is a rent-a-car chain, 2,500 of whom ask if Houston's basketball floor 
was covered with AstroTurf, 7,250 of whom haven't had their garbage picked up 
for two weeks and 250 of whom arrive late for the tipoff because they came from 
Texas and didn't understand a single word their taxi drivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The national anthem is sung by Madonna and five NBA players she currently 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing is the hero for the Knicks, who win, 70-69, when one of the 
referees claims that Ewing was fouled by Maxwell on the final play. This call 
was somewhat surprising, seeing as how Maxwell was not in the game at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 4: 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Square Garden is filled with 19,000 people, 19 of whom can't wait to 
get home to watch Conan O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 The national anthem is sung by the rap group Kill the 24-Second Clock. At the 
end of the song, all four rappers take out automatic weapons and destroy the 
clocks at both ends of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the Knicks win, 50-49, on a free throw by Charles Smith, who is given 
six chances to sink one by a referee who keeps calling a Houston player for a 
lane violation. Afterward, the Knicks are so happy that six of them decide not 
to punch Rudy Tomjanovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 5: 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Square Garden is filled with 19,000 people, most of them caught by 
surprise at finding the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks still skating in 
quintuple-overtime from the previous night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The national anthem is sung by Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty, who follow 
with a selection of other hits from the motion picture "Ishtar." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks expect little trouble in defeating the Rockets, who have been 
shocked by Olajuwon's last-minute decision to skip the game and fly back to 
Texas so that he can watch Nigeria prepare to play Bulgaria in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the Rockets give the Knicks a good game, at least until a 
referee calls six fouls on every player on Houston's roster and awards New York 
the championship by forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 During the celebration, Pat Riley says: "I guarantee we will repeat next 
season," after which he is beaten to a bloody pulp by his own players.

RAIDERS' STEVE WRIGHT DISAPPEARS INTO THE MIST; PRO FOOTBALL: NO RETIREMENT 
PARTY FOR OFFENSIVE TACKLE WHO PLAYED 13 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retirement usually means gifts and parties at work for the faithful employee. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the case, however, at the Raiders' El Segundo practice facility 
last week when offensive tackle Steve Wright decided to hang up his cleats 
after 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who spent the entire 1993 season on the injured-reserve list, told the 
Raiders of his decision in late May, but when the team gathered for its annual 
three-day mini-camp on June 1, nary a cake, gift or balloon was in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reference to Wright's retirement was a seven-paragraph Raider news 
release found in the team's media room. 
</P>
<P>
 Which was no surprise to Wright, who played most of his career in the NFL 
shadows as an offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 He realized that his announcement would not be front-page news, as was former 
teammate Howie Long's when he quit last February. After all, it had been more 
than a year since Wright's last regular-season game and he had no All-Pro 
selections to his credit. "I have no complaints because I've enjoyed my years 
playing in the NFL and I know its time to move on," said Wright, 35, who joined 
the Raiders in 1987. "Deciding to retire was not tough, but saying it was." 
</P>
<P>
 After "kicking around" the idea of retiring for the last couple of months, 
Wright said he decided to do just that after noticing the effect of the NFL's 
new salary cap. Veterans, especially those making high salaries, were being cut 
all over the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who earned $600,000 last season, will concentrate on his water-misting 
company, which specializes in equipment providing light water spray over small 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright left his mark on the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years at Northern Iowa, Wright signed with Dallas in 1981 and 
played two years with the Cowboys, blocking on Tony Dorsett's record-tying 
99-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was traded to the Colts before the start of the 1983 regular season and 
spent two seasons in Baltimore and Indianapolis before jumping to the Oakland 
Invaders of the United States Football League in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with the Raiders, Wright became a starter at right tackle for 48 
of the 79 games he played, before injuring his right shoulder four games into 
the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Wright was a true professional," said Art Shell, who coached Wright for 
seven seasons. "He worked very hard and gave every ounce of energy while 
preparing for and playing the game. He is really a true Raider, on and off the 
field. "His work ethic and enthusiasm can only make him as successful in his 
new business ventures as he was in football." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who has dropped 25 pounds from his playing weight of 305, said: "I 
feel good about my decision because I played 13 years longer than I ever 
expected to. I'll miss those fights in the trenches, playing alongside (Steve) 
Wisniewski and (Don) Mosebar, but I'll leave it up ato the younger guys now."

KOTSAY HITS HIS WAY INTO THE RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He handled the game, the interview with ESPN and the postgame news conference 
with all the savvy of a veteran. Pretty cool character, that Mark Kotsay, Cal 
State Fullerton left fielder. Routine stuff, this College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kotsay was informed that his seven runs batted in against Florida State 
Tuesday was a Series record, and one more than former Titan standout Phil Nevin 
had in a 1992 Series game against the Seminoles. Then the 19-year-old kid, a 
true freshman, emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay's eyebrows shot up. His eyes widened. His jaw dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" Kotsay said, when told he tied a mark set by Arizona's Carl Thomas 
against Oregon in 1954 and Arizona State's Stan Holmes against Oklahoma State 
in 1981. "I didn't know that at all. Wow! Oh my God, it hasn't hit me yet. I'm 
very honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Some great players have passed through Omaha on their way to the major 
leagues. Mike Schmidt, Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Paul Molitor and Fred Lynn 
played in the College World Series, but none had seven RBIs in one game.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say Kotsay, who put Fullerton ahead, 4-3, with a two-run double 
in the seventh and broke the game open with a grand slam in the eighth, will 
become a major league all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will have to rewrite the Series record book because of him. And the 
Titan sports information office also will have to rewrite Kotsay's biography in 
next season's media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay's most memorable sports thrill before Tuesday, according to the guide, 
was pitching the final out in the Mickey Mantle World Series title game for a 
summer league all-star team in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this beats that by far," Kotsay said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier, Kotsay was cowering with fear. He had walked with two 
outs in the third inning and took a big lead, leaning back toward first base. 
</P>
<P>
 This is known as a one-way lead, with the purpose of drawing a throw so the 
Titans could get a good look at Florida State left-hander Charlie Cruz's 
pickoff move. Kotsay had no intention of stealing and every intention of going 
back to the bag the moment the pitcher started his motion. 
</P>
<P>
 And he still got caught off first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous, anxious and just froze," said Kotsay, a former two-sport 
standout at Sante Fe Springs Santa Fe High who didn't crack the Titans' 
starting lineup until late March. "I was in no-man's land. I was really scared 
what the coaches were going to say when I got into the dugout." 
</P>
<P>
 All these thoughts ran through Kotsay's mind during the ensuing rundown, which 
had a strange ending. One throw, two throws, three throws, four throws, and 
Kotsay was still hung up between first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 The last relay went to Seminole first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, who swiped 
Kotsay with a tag but dropped the ball. Kotsay made it back to first and had 
this sudden feeling that this might be a good day, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a big relief," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay's next at-bat resulted in a sacrifice fly, which followed Jack Jones' 
fifth-inning triple and pulled the Titans to within 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans loaded the bases on two walks and Jeff Ferguson's bloop single in 
the seventh, and Kotsay, a left-handed hitter, slapped a two-run double down 
the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Millan's RBI single extended the lead to 5-3, but Kotsay gave the Titans 
plenty of breathing room in the eighth. Jones' potential inning-ending grounder 
squirted under shortstop Link Jarrett's glove, and Ferguson walked to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay then turned on Mike Bell's pitch, lining it over the right-field fence 
and off the light tower for a grand slam to make it 9-3. Game, set and match, 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't pulled the ball all series," Kotsay said. "I was looking for 
something down the middle to drive. I couldn't tell you what was in my head at 
the time. I wasn't thinking. I just let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 7-year-old batboy, Marco Martelli, predicted it would happen. 
Martelli, the son of Titan volunteer assistant Joe Martelli, has become quite 
the media darling in Omaha, gaining his share of notoriety for his 
prognostications. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido, Marco predicted before Sunday's 
game against Louisiana State that the Titans would win big. They did, 20-6. 
Fullerton center fielder Dante Powell said Marco predicted he would get a hit 
Tuesday. Powell did, a third-inning single that stopped an 0-for-22 skid in 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco was playing in the hotel pool Monday and told Kotsay's father, Steve, 
that Mark was going to hit a home run Tuesday. Kotsay was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shrugged my shoulders and said, 'Yeah, sure,' " Kotsay said. "He's a great 
kid, but I didn't believe him. But I did have that in the back of my mind all 
day. When I crossed the plate after the grand slam, Marco was standing there 
and said, 'I told you.' "

ARIZONA STATE COACH BROCK, BATTLING CANCER, GOES HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arizona State baseball Coach Jim Brock, battling life-draining cancer, was 
resting comfortably in a hospital Tuesday, hours after leaving his team at the 
College World Series in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Tammaro, Arizona State assistant sports information director, said Brock 
was recuperating at Desert Samaritan Hospital in suburban Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Omaha, Arizona State Athletic Director Charles Harris said doctors felt 
Brock, 57, a lifelong resident of the Phoenix area, would feel more comfortable 
being treated at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock came to Rosenblatt Stadium Monday night but left before the start of 
Arizona State's 4-3 loss to Oklahoma in 11 innings. It was only the second game 
Brock had missed all season, according to his players, who had expected their 
coach to be present Tuesday night. Arizona State eliminated Miami, 9-5, 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock had surgery to remove 80% of his liver and some of his colon after last 
year's trip to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock has brought 13 teams to the series in Omaha in his 23 years as coach, 
winning two titles.

THE TIMES 1994 ALL-COUNTY BASEBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; TERESCHUK'S TEMPO 
ON PACE FOR SERVITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Tereschuk, The Times Orange County coach of the year, didn't have any 
expectations when he became the Servite High School baseball coach last summer. 
But then, who did? 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars were coming off back-to-back losing seasons. They had finished 9-15 
in 1993 and 3-22 in 1992. Their coach had resigned for personal reasons. They 
hadn't been to the Southern Section playoffs since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So there wasn't a lot to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to try to set a tempo," Tereschuk said. "I wanted to make us a 
very solid fundamental team. We were going to do things right. Then, we were 
going to let everything take its natural course." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the line turned out to be the Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tereschuk returned the Friars to prominence. They were 15-10 overall and 9-5 
in the tough Sunset League, good enough for a second-place finish. Tereschuk 
accomplished that with a group of overachievers, who were solid but not overly 
talented. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars were 4-4-1 and 1-3 in league play before the Dole Big West 
tournament. They finished the regular season with an 11-5 run. Two of those 
loses were to Fountain Valley, which won the Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was pretty demanding in practice," Tereschuk said. "I wanted us to 
be prepared. But I tried not to put any pressure on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tereschuk knows the drill well. He was 98-66-2 in seven years at California 
High in Whittier. The Condors, who had won only three games before his arrival, 
won the Whitmont League championship and reached the 3-A quarterfinals in 1988.

K2 DEMANDS. . .; TIPTOP SHAPE; THE BURGESS BROTHERS WILL NEED THAT, MORE TO 
SCALE IMPOSING PEAK 
</P>

<P>
 For all their splendor, the world's highest mountains are nothing but piles of 
dirt, rock, ice and snow. To some that happen to be piled higher than most, man 
has attached a mystique related to life's successes and failures manifested in 
his attempts to ascend their summits. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the mountains, it's hard to believe they are anything but cold, 
impersonal and totally indifferent to those who climb them, or die trying. 
Logic says mountains can't feel. They can't project pity or malevolence, save 
in man's mind. They're simply there . . . which, it has been said, is why 
people climb them. 
</P>
<P>
 So what keeps drawing Adrian Burgess back to K2? Certainly not the name, which 
is as romantic as a bingo card. Certainly not the locale, unless he's hiding 
out from civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess is there now, leading the 1994 Reebok K2 Expedition with his twin 
brother, Alan, and four friends, waiting and preparing for the right time to go 
for the top. 
</P>
<P>
 K2 is the world's second-highest mountain, reaching 28,250 feet. Everest, 800 
miles distant, is 29,028. K2's name, hardly worthy of its stature, was bestowed 
in 1851 by a singularly unimaginative officer of the British Survey of India, 
Capt. T.G. Montgomerie, who found it straddling the border between Pakistan and 
China. Actually, Montgomerie thought it was only the second-highest peak in the 
Karakoram range northwest of the Himalayas -- hence, K2. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also know it as Mount Godwin Austen, for the English lieutenant who 
surveyed its height in 1861. But Montgomerie's name is the one that has stuck, 
perhaps because it best represents the mountain's character: stark, simple and 
straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it's a different kind of mountain, except for the 
top, and I haven't been there," Burgess said before leaving for Kathmandu, 
Nepal, in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 Greg Child and Steve Swenson of Seattle climbed K2 by the same, more 
difficult north ridge route that the Burgess group will try this summer. Ten 
other teams will try from the less demanding south side. 
</P>
<P>
 Child said, "As a climber, you're drawn to architecture, and this is an 
amazing piece of natural architecture, like someone just took a block of rock 
and ice and chiseled a very sharp, knifelike ridge. It's a lovely thing, and it 
goes straight to the top (in) a very direct line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If K2 has a soul, it's a nasty one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some mountains have very nice personalities," Child said. "Others are pretty 
damn mean. K2's on the mean side. It's killed a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine through last year alone, compared to the 90 who have reached its 
summit. Its best and worst year was 1986: 27 summits, 13 deaths. Everest's 
ratio is far less grim: about one fatality for every 10 successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad Carter, editor of the American Alpine Journal, recounts '86 on K2: "An 
avalanche killed a couple. Another one who was climbing solo fell into a 
crevasse. Eight or so got trapped high up in very bad weather, and a couple 
more slipped and fell. It was a perfectly awful year." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, most of those victims had reached the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Child said, "On K2, coming down is the part that gets you. What nearly got us 
and killed several people before us, on K2 you get about four good days (of 
weather) in a row maximum, but you need about six good days to climb it and 
then get down safely. It's almost inevitable that you get to the summit just as 
the weather is closing in, so you spend two days trying to get down in a 
white-out and a storm." 
</P>
<P>
 In '86, eight climbers descending into a storm hunkered down in their tents to 
wait it out. Child pictured the scenario: 
</P>
<P>
 "Your bodies deteriorate, the tents collapse, you run out of (stove fuel) to 
melt water, you dehydrate and you just get further and further into a dream 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of those died. 
</P>
<P>
 Child said, "Adrian's group will probably have a similar experience . . . get 
to the top and be battling the weather to get down." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess knows what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been twice to K2 -- once in '86," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team split, with each Burgess brother leading a group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team was not strong enough to climb all the way to the top," Adrian 
Burgess said. "Eventually, when I found myself at the front without a partner 
and my brother found himself at the front without a partner, we came together 
and realized there was no one else behind us, and we called off the climb." 
</P>
<P>
 They regrouped for an attempt on the easier Abruzzi route but were thwarted by 
bad weather and had to start home with their porters. A companion, Alan Rouse, 
stayed on for one more try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rouse went up and managed to climb it, but on the way back down. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse didn't make it down. Two years later Burgess returned as part of a 
four-man American team and ran into a small feudal war on the way to the 
mountain. Borders in the region are in constant dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got hijacked in the middle of this squabble," Burgess said. "They laid 
siege to the town and we got caught inside it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a week's delay, they proceeded to base camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather came good almost immediately," Burgess said. "We raced on up the 
mountain and after 10 days we were in position to try for it, although we 
weren't really acclimatized (for high elevations)." 
</P>
<P>
 They descended for four days to regain their strength, but by the time they 
were ready the weather had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we'd been there a week earlier. . . . " Burgess lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, 45, is English by birth but has lived in Utah for four years. This 
time he leads a hand-picked group that includes his brother, Americans Brad 
Johnson and Mark Wilford and Brits Paul Moores and Alan Hinkes. 
</P>
<P>
 "K2 is a climber's mountain," Burgess said. "Everest has become somewhat of a 
trophy mountain for less-experienced climbers. I've climbed Everest, and I 
enjoyed climbing it, but it will be a different experience on K2." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Child and Swenson, Burgess' team will use no oxygen, rather than exhaust 
their small party toting 20-pound bottles up and down to stash along the route. 
But there will come a time when they would pay dearly for one. K2 is much 
steeper than most mountains, including Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of walking up a slope you're pulling up with your hands," Child said. 
"After 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) every 100 meters gets 10% harder. You take 
seven or 10 steps, then you lean on your ice ax and take a half-dozen very 
rapid breaths. You take another seven or 10 steps and do the same thing. 
Imagine two or three thousand feet of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your body's telling you to go down, saying, 'This is too much punishment.' 
But when you really want it, your mind keeps you going . . . your mental 
toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess' most recent report was a fax via satellite May 17 from base camp at 
12,600 feet, following a seven-day trek with 47 camels bearing food and 
supplies. Earlier, they passed through Urumqui, an oil and mining center 
farther from the sea than any city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to climb the mountain between mid-June and mid-August. Meanwhile, 
they will wait for good weather and brew English beer from kits they brought. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's just because we want to drink beer at base camp," Burgess 
said. "There's a psychological reason behind it. We're away from home for a 
long time. Base camp has to be home. A beer is a way of showing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok also is lifting the team's spirits by providing uncommon sponsorship to 
such an expedition, perhaps annoying the sport's purists a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad Carter said, "Everybody would much prefer if they didn't have to, but it's 
really quite a thing just to get to the northern side of K2. Money has to be 
provided." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burgesses will wear prototype mountaineering boots made from material used 
in the Stealth bomber. Reebok understands the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Pompel, the company's director of outdoors, said, "My preference, and 
Adrian knows this, is that he comes back, versus (reaching the) summit." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said, "For a sponsor to understand that, as they do, is a healthy 
image. I think it's a success if everyone comes back. Alive. If we reach the 
summit, that's a double success. If everyone reaches the summit, it's a 
tremendous success." 
</P>
<P>
 Child gives them a good chance -- depending on the weather: 
</P>
<P>
 "Determination, commitment and teamwork have to really be going harmoniously. 
They're good. The Burgess twins are like hill-climbing machines. All they need 
is the weather and they'll do it."

IT'S STILL TIME FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soccer in England has always been considered a culture unto itself, one that 
had no reason to fear intrusion -- or even more than occasional scrutiny -- 
from those who presume themselves to be truly cultured. 
</P>
<P>
 But as writer Tom Shone recently reported in the Sunday Times of London, even 
though England is absent from this summer's World Cup, soccer is more popular 
than ever as a subject for authors, playwrights and composers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most humorous and poignant books of recent years, Nick Hornby's 
"Fever Pitch," which details his lifelong love affair with the English team, 
Arsenal, is touring as a stage play and is soon to appear on the big screen, 
and two plays -- "An Evening With Gary Lineker" and "Fair Game" -- have been 
adapted for television. Another play with a soccer theme -- "Come On, Stan!" -- 
opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
 One rock group named itself after a French team, St. Etienne, and another 
named itself after a Portuguese star, Eusebio, and still another, The Wedding 
Present, named an album for the former bad boy of British soccer, George Best. 
Billing itself as the first soccer opera, "Playing Away," is playing in Leeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunday Times, Shone wondered if perhaps those searching to find more to 
soccer than the game itself have gotten carried away, noting that the London 
Review of Books recently featured caddish Paul Gascoigne, known as Gazza in 
soccer circles, on the cover and called him a "priapic monolith." 
</P>
<P>
 That reminded Shone of the classic Monty Python skit involving Eric Idle as a 
pretentious interviewer and John Cleese as a soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 Idle: "Jarrow United came of age in a European sense with an almost Proustian 
display of modern existentialist football, virtually annihilating, by midfield 
argument, the surely obsolescent defensive philosophy of Signor Alberto 
Franfrino." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese: "Well, I hit the ball first time and it went in the back of the net."

FOR CHATSWORTH, THE REPLAY IS EVEN MORE PAINFUL; CITY BASEBALL: THE DAY AFTER 
ANOTHER ONE-RUN, TITLE-GAME LOSS TO EL CAMINO REAL, CHANCELLOR PLAYERS SEARCH 
FOR A BRIGHT SIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Another year, another heartbreaker for Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 While El Camino Real celebrated defeating the Chancellors, 7-6, in the City 
Section 4-A championship Monday for the second consecutive season -- by 
identical scores, no less -- Chatsworth players were left to cope with a loss 
even more painful than last year's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the underdog Chancellors almost upset their powerful West Valley 
League rivals under the bright lights at Dodger Stadium. This year, the roles 
were reversed, and Chatsworth was top-seeded with the gaudy statistics and 
powerful lineup. And with their seventh-inning comeback, the Chancellors seemed 
to have fate on their side as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Camino Real still beat them, and one day later, the Chancellors were 
searching for silver linings where they could find them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after, I was pretty amazed that we even came back," shortstop Bryan 
LaCour said. "We had two outs to score five runs off (El Camino Real pitcher 
Randy) Wolf. The thought of coming back wasn't in my mind -- the thought of 
losing was more in my mind. But that inning was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour, the team's senior leader who will play for Stanford next season, 
referred to the top of the seventh inning when the Chancellors' previously 
dormant offense exploded for five runs against Wolf, the all-everything senior 
who had allowed only one hit to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth tied the score, 6-6, but El Camino Real won the game in the ninth 
when a single followed by a throwing error by Chatsworth center fielder Ray 
Daryabigi allowed Conquistador catcher Steve Riback to score the winning run. 
Fewer than 24 hours later, even Daryabigi tried to accentuate the positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night was pretty horrible," he said. "When it happened, I was like, 'Why 
me?' But good things happen from bad things. It's a good learning experience 
for me, I guess. You just keep things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 One perspective -- the one Coach Tom Meusborn shared with his players after 
the disappointing defeat -- is that they should take pride in their clutch 
play. And not just in those five runs. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pitcher Oscar Bocanegra relieved starter Jim DeBiase in the third inning and 
allowed only one hit until the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pitched a hell of a game," LaCour said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth left fielder Tony Ardito threw out Wolf at home plate when Wolf 
attempted to score from third on a shallow fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the bottom of the seventh, El Camino Real's Craig Carlton hit a line 
drive down the right field line that seemed to be a sure extra-base hit, but he 
was robbed on a diving catch by Mike Amado. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth third baseman Tony Montiel made two consecutive smooth fielding 
plays in the eighth to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed a lot of guts," LaCour said. "Coach told us he was really proud of 
us because we showed a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But so did El Camino Real. Wolf and the Conquistadores endured their rough 
stretch without folding, and when Riback crossed the plate more than three 
hours after the game began, El Camino Real became the first team to win 
back-to-back City titles since Granada Hills did it 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf finished his high school career with a 5-0 record and two saves in the 
playoffs the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say this is a little more emotional than last year," Wolf said. "Last 
year from the first day, we knew we were going to win. This year there was some 
doubt. I don't think we had the total talent that we had last year. But had the 
heart to win it this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad, my last game and all playing with this group of guys," he 
said. "But it's good that we went out that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth seniors LaCour, DeBiase, Montiel and Brandon Murphy finished their 
high school careers by coming oh-so-close two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot tougher this year," LaCour said. "Partly because I was a senior. 
Plus, when we came back in that (seventh) inning, I was just thinking how 
awesome it would have been if we won the game."

ADAMSON FAMILY VALUES; SON OF FORMER MAJOR LEAGUER LEARNS THE HARD WAY FROM 
DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Dad is a former major league pitcher and the answer to a draft-day trivia 
question, you figure you know a few things about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 You learn a love for the game; how to appreciate the smell of brick dust and 
the sensation of freshly manicured grass under your cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 You also learn something about the business end of the sport; and all the 
reasons why a young player should listen intently, nod approvingly and accept 
absolutely nothing that is said as gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Adamson grew up around baseball. His father was the first drafted player 
to skip the minors and go from college directly onto a big league club's active 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Baltimore Orioles signed Mike Adamson on June 27, 1967, it was to one 
of the richest rookie contracts at the time -- a package worth, including 
provisions for finishing school, $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal earned Adamson an instant nickname: "Cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson pitched in relief for the Orioles against the Cleveland Indians the 
same evening he agreed to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason wouldn't be born for another nine years, but he has been treated to his 
grandparents' scrapbook and his father's recollections of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 None of it prepared him for his own draft-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason, a strong, fast and graceful athlete who patrolled center field and 
batted cleanup for three Moorpark High league championship teams, was 
recognized as being among the nation's top amateur players. 
</P>
<P>
 A respected baseball publication -- one which rated him as a fifth or sixth- 
round pick -- gushed, "projects as one of the better all-around athletes in 
greater Los Angeles." Scouts from several major league teams told him he was a 
lock to go in the draft's first 10 rounds; possibly as high as the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Jason attempted to remain skeptical. "It's a business," his 
father told him. "You can't believe everything you hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words echoed in Jason's ears. He understood. But he got his hopes up 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, the day of the draft, Jason Adamson went to school and waited 
for a call from his father relaying the good news. Friends planned to dog pile 
on him just as soon as they received word. 
</P>
<P>
 By lunchtime, still no call. Jason called his stepmother, Suzie, at home. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet. 
</P>
<P>
 School ended. By this time, Jason figured he would be treating his friends to 
a pizza party. The call hadn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 He went home. The phone was ringing constantly. Reporters. Friends. His 
father, who was on a work assignment in San Jose, called at least a dozen 
times. Jason's heart skipped with each ring. 
</P>
<P>
 So many calls. None of them the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors started flying. Players rated below Adamson already had been selected. 
Maybe, friends allowed, Jason had been drafted too, but the team was waiting to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., family members decided that it was time for everyone to go to bed. 
Seventeen rounds of the draft had been completed. Still no call. 
</P>
<P>
 About midway through the second day of the draft, Jason Adamson received a 
call at school from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been taken, by the Pittsburgh Pirates. "I was excited. I felt good," 
Jason said. "I thought maybe I went in the 18th or 19th round, or maybe even 
the 24th or 25th." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-third, dad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh. All right," Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Adamson could sense the disappointment in his son's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Remember what's happening now,' " Mike Adamson said. " 'Love the 
game, but remember it's a business. From here on, that's exactly what it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jason, of course, knew that. He had heard it a thousand times before -- and 
learned the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting to go higher," Jason said. "It was my fault. I believed what 
everybody was saying. I thought I was going to be a top-10 pick and go party 
with my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 A question still gnaws at him: What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching, his father had warned, always goes first. "They'll take a guy who 
can throw 90 m.p.h. even if he can barely hit a barn," Mike Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the first 32 rounds weren't all pitchers. Ed Roebuck, the Pirates' 
representative who scouted Jason, said a rumor circulated that Adamson would 
not sign if he wasn't selected in the first 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adamsons say they have no idea how such a rumor got started, especially 
because Jason lacked the grades to attract a college scholarship offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I made it clear that I was willing to sign for a decent package," 
Jason said. "I wasn't going to give myself away for three Snickers bars and a 
plane ticket, but, basically, you take me, I'm yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Several clubs called before the draft to ask what the Adamsons were looking 
for in terms of a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 They were never given a figure. "Whatever's fair for the round I'm taken," was 
the family's reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jason: "We're never going to know what happened for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Adamson's draft experience was far more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Pt. Loma High in San Diego, he was the 18th player selected in 
baseball's first-ever draft, in 1965. The Phillies took Adamson, but they 
couldn't sign him. He accepted a baseball scholarship to USC instead. 
</P>
<P>
 By Adamson's sophomore year with the Trojans he was the ace of a pitching 
staff that included major leaguers-to-be Tom House and Bill Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no guessing about Adamson's place in the supplemental phase of the 
1967 draft. The Orioles made no secret about who would be their first choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it all up front," Mike Adamson said. "It was a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
 But he still had hopes that his son's experience would be just as pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up and playing baseball are hard enough without having to do it in 
the shadow of your dad," he said. "This should be Jason's time." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is. It just hasn't been the time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to look at the big picture," Jason Adamson said. "A lot of people 
would kill to get drafted in the 50th round. You're disappointed, but you have 
nothing to be disappointed about. I'm a high school kid, 18 years old. How can 
I complain?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Roebuck called on behalf of the Pirates after the draft, he initially 
sounded as if the club held little hope of signing Adamson. Then Jason hinted 
he would still be interested in signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I said that," Adamson said. "The whole conversation changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Roebuck has called every day and had an initial informational 
meeting at the family's home on Monday. A second bargaining session is set for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson said he probably will play for Moorpark College next season if he does 
not come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason has his dad's strong arm, and also has home run power and can sprint 60 
yards in 6.8 seconds. He is 6-foot-3, 190 pounds, and is convinced he can put 
on another 20 pounds without losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know you don't make your long-term money in the draft," Mike Adamson said. 
"You make it by getting to The Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason always has wanted to be a prime-time player. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls sitting in a near-empty Dodger Stadium a few years ago, hours 
before a game between the Dodgers and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just looked around as the players started coming out and thought, 'This is 
where I want to be. This is what I want to do, right here,' " Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Adamson lasted only a couple of seasons, bouncing between the Orioles and 
triple-A Rochester, N.Y., before he severely injured his pitching shoulder 
during spring training, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 He last pitched competitively a few years ago when he took his family to 
Rochester for a triple-A old-timers' game. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, as Mike entered the Orioles' clubhouse with Jason, he was greeted by 
Curt Motton, the triple-A team's third base coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's Cash!" Motton chirped. Then, looking at Jason, Motton added, "And 
this must be Small Change." 
</P>
<P>
 Small change. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to dad, that's probably what Jason will get -- to start. But if he 
can make it to the big leagues and manage to stick, the family will be in for a 
reversal of fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, someday, Jason might be asked to advise his own son on the perils of the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 What would he say? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the same things my dad told me," he said. "I'd say, 'Don't you dare 
believe what everybody tells you. Take it from me. I lived it.' "

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: RESPITE FOR INVESTORS; YIELDS EDGING DOWN SLOWLY 
WHILE STOCKS RECOUP LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a dismal winter and early spring, financial markets have taken a 
surprising turn for the better in recent weeks. Without much fanfare, many 
investors are seeing their stock and bond assets rise in value once again, if 
at a snail's pace: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bonds have been slowly appreciating as market yields have edged lower, after 
rocketing almost nonstop since late January. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, the benchmark for long-term interest rates, 
has dropped to 7.26% now, after surging from 6.35% at year's end to a peak of 
7.65% on May 9. Yields on some other types of bonds, such as tax-free municipal 
issues, have fallen even faster than Treasury rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market, taking a cue from bonds, has rallied modestly since 
mid-May, raising hopes for the proverbial "summer rally" on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which slumped 5.2% between 
Jan. 1 and May 9, has gained 3.6% since. And the Dow Jones industrial average, 
3,755.91 at Tuesday's close, has recouped all of its losses and now is slightly 
above its year-end close of 3,754.09. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit for the markets' healthier tone, of course, goes largely to the 
same entity responsible for driving investors into a selling frenzy earlier in 
the year: the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's decision to begin tightening credit on Feb. 4, for the first time in 
five years, was the equivalent of yelling "Fire!" in a crowded movie theater. 
By raising short-term interest rates from 30-year lows, the Fed in effect 
booted speculators out of the stock and bond markets, and focused bond owners 
on the idea that the economy was growing fast enough to reignite inflation, 
bonds' No. 1 fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But just four months after the Fed's policy shift, the central bank's 
principal goal -- to slow the economy to a moderate pace, with low inflation -- 
appears to have been achieved. Or at least that's what the Fed apparently 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
 In public and private statements over the past few weeks, Fed officials have 
strongly projected the idea that they're satisfied with their policy and now 
are comfortable leaving short-term interest rates alone for the foreseeable 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the promise of a benign Fed has proved to be a powerful tonic. 
A key moment for the markets occurred last Friday, when the government reported 
a sharp drop in the May unemployment rate, but stock and bond markets failed to 
view the report as a reason to resurrect old worries about excessive growth and 
inflation. Bond yields actually edged lower on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed's recent soothing tone, "the market is accepting that these 
yields (on bonds) are appropriate for the likely events in the economy" in the 
near-term, says Kevin Logan, economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Anderson, president of money manager IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis, 
notes that the market isn't just taking the Fed at its word. Despite the 
puzzling unemployment report, many of the economic indicators of late have 
suggested "that the economy is slowing just a tad," Anderson notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bond market has been helped by other factors, Anderson says. 
A plunge in grain and soybean prices over the past week, as much-needed rain 
fell on the Midwest, has helped further reduce inflation worries. And a 
strengthening dollar has given foreign investors new incentive to buy U.S. 
bonds and stocks . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone knew bond yields would stabilize eventually. The big question now 
is whether they can continue to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts don't expect a sharp decline in yields from current levels. More 
likely is that yields will trade in a narrow range for at least a few months, 
until it's clear that the economy is either slowing further, accelerating again 
or continuing to grow at the same moderate pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss Bank's Logan, for example, figures the 30-year Treasury bond yield, now 
7.26%, will bounce between 7.1% and 7.6% this summer as traders push the market 
to and fro, alternately starting rallies and then selling into them. 
</P>
<P>
 William Gross, a principal at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co. in 
Newport Beach, figures the T-bond yield range this summer will be 7% to 7.5%. 
"There's probably not going to be a lot of excitement in the bond market 
relative to what we've seen" in recent months, Gross says. 
</P>
<P>
 For many bond investors, a lack of excitement would be welcome, after the 
losses incurred in the market in winter and early spring. But experts also 
caution investors to use this period of relative calm to assess whether they 
should stay in bonds. If the economy booms again later this year or in 1995, 
interest rates could surge anew, causing more principal losses for bond owners. 
Investors who don't want to take that risk should view the current rally as a 
way out, investment advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunists and long-term investors, however, may want to take a different 
approach: Which bonds offer the best value today, if you figure the economy is 
sure to slow a bit more or remain on a moderate-growth track? 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond pros say the high-yield "junk" corporate bond market is a good bet, 
because junk yields haven't yet dropped in line with yields on Treasury bonds 
since mid-May -- even though junk bonds' fundamentals are solid. "I think the 
high-yield market is in great shape," says Frederick Cavanaugh, manager of the 
John Hancock Strategic Income fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 For a simpler bet, Pacific Investment Management's Gross says investors should 
look at intermediate-term Treasury securities. The yield on five-year T-notes, 
for example, is 6.52% now. At that level, Gross says, the market is already 
assuming that between now and the end of the year, the Fed will raise 
short-term interest rates another full percentage point. Gross doubts the 
economy will be strong enough to justify that kind of move. 
</P>
<P>
 What about stocks? David Shulman, strategist at Salomon Bros., thinks the 
market will see its traditional summer rally if interest rates stay tamed. He 
expects the Dow to near its all-time high of 3,978. But the leaders in a summer 
rally, like the leading stock groups so far this year, will be an eclectic mix, 
Shulman says; names like Microsoft, Georgia-Pacific and Unocal are on his list. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson of IDS says the most logical stock market bet now is a replay of the 
last two years, in condensed version: Bank and other financial stocks have 
already rallied over the past month, he notes, as bond yields have fallen. The 
next move, Anderson says, should be in some of the economy-sensitive stocks 
that have been beaten down since winter -- autos, retailers and airlines, for 
example. If the Fed has succeeded in stretching out the economic recovery at a 
moderate pace, investors should be drawn back to stocks of auto makers and 
other companies whose "peak" recovery earnings may be years away, he says. 
Better Times for Stocks and Bonds? 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's rally in recent weeks has raised hopes that long-term 
interest rates are about to pull back sharply from their recent highs, which 
also could give a further lift to stocks.

DEREGULATION PLAN ATTACKED FROM ALL SIDES; ENERGY: PUC PROPOSAL FOR ELECTRICITY 
COMPETITION DRAWS COMPLAINTS. OFFICIALS SAY THE ISSUE COULD REACH THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's bright vision for lower power bills through electric utility 
deregulation is likely to be tied up in years of legal and technical wrangling, 
federal and industry officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first round of written comments on the ambitious deregulation 
proposal sketched by the state Public Utilities Commission in April, virtually 
all interested parties are leveling major complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility companies want to postpone competition, while consumer groups want to 
speed the advent of lower rates. And the U.S. Department of Energy is warning 
that the PUC's legal strategy could keep any deregulation plan tied up in the 
courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure looks to us as though they're getting into murky water," Susan F. 
Tierney, assistant secretary for policy at the department, said on the eve of 
today's deadline for comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legal analysis is that at best it's a very high-risk legal position for 
California to take -- that it can . . . order retail (competition) and set 
rates that look and behave as though they're transmission rates," a component 
of utility rate making that falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, Tierney said. 
</P>
<P>
 She predicted that lawsuits will be filed over the PUC plan and that they will 
eventually be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of public hearings on the proposal begins next Tuesday and Wednesday 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has proposed allowing the largest industrial users of 
electricity to start shopping among competing power suppliers in 1996. Small 
industrial customers would follow in 1998, commercial users the next year and 
residential consumers by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is attempting to create a competitive marketplace in hopes of 
bringing down California's electricity rates, which run 50% above the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the significance of that statistic has come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Cavanagh, energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental group, faults the commission for "the false notion 
that somehow California has buried its economy under a mountain of electricity 
costs. That is just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 While rates are high, Cavanagh and others point out, Californians use much 
less electricity than consumers in other states. In large part, that is because 
of energy conservation efforts, which drop consumers' monthly bills to among 
the lowest in the country. Indeed, the council argues in its comments, 
electricity represents just 2.5% of California's gross state product, compared 
to 3.1% of the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 The council contends that the PUC plan could, in effect, dismantle the 
programs that are bringing energy savings and give California the world's most 
diverse mix of electricity-generating fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also calls for the commission to strengthen the existing wholesale 
market for electricity -- in which utilities can buy power from other utilities 
or independent producers -- before moving on to the more complex task of 
establishing retail competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. takes the same position, proposing a 
three-stage plan that would establish a wholesale power pool in the western 
states but indefinitely delay retail competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of it as the brains and the control" of the regional transmission 
system, said John E. Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison. The pool 
would be an independent company owned by investors with no interests in either 
independent power generators or utilities. It would channel the lowest-cost 
electricity to utilities, without favoring any producer or group. 
</P>
<P>
 "One analogy would be the air traffic control system," Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a structure could be modified to handle retail competition somewhere down 
the line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric Co. also wants to put off 
residential retail choice, in its case until 2008 -- six years later than the 
commission proposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a delay, PG&E will offer to forgo the "transition" fees 
envisioned in the PUC plan that would let it charge ratepayers for the costs of 
existing assets -- not least its Diablo Canyon nuclear plant -- that could 
become uneconomical in a competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that mirrors recent PUC approval of an Edison proposal, PG&E wants 
to accelerate by $200 million a year the depreciation on its nuclear investment 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to use time instead of larger transition costs to manage a period of 
transition into the future competitive market," said Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E 
senior vice president and general manager of customer energy services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, consumer groups -- from industrial to agricultural to residential 
users -- plan to file comments raising the drumbeat for lower power rates and 
faster implementation of the PUC plan. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization, for instance, will call 
for introducing retail choice to residential users first, or at least at the 
same time it is granted to big industrial consumers.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CABLE DEAL BESPEAKS FAITH IN NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that speaks volumes about the future of the newspaper business, 
Times Mirror Co. has forced itself to sink or swim in the unknown multimedia 
future in which computer networks will play a larger role than ink and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market initially reacted sourly as investors and analysts focused on 
the present -- in which Times Mirror will cut its dividend and transfer its 
profitable cable business to a venture with Atlanta's Cox Enterprises in return 
for cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But the future is more interesting: It will marry the centuries-old newspaper 
business to evolving computer technology. Yet the thought to keep in mind is 
that the heart of the multimedia business will always be edited information -- 
the essence of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all is flux. Times Mirror's deal will leave it a 
$3.2-billion-in-sales publisher of newspapers, books and information services 
with $1.3 billion in fresh cash to invest in new media. But Invest in what? is 
the big question. The information industry at this point is filled with small 
companies and big ideas. "Our forward horizons are the next three to five years 
rather than the next six months," says Times Mirror Chairman Robert F. Erburu. 
</P>
<P>
 In its plans, Times Mirror has to think ahead to a different America, in which 
perhaps half the population will be using computers much as they now use 
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 That's actually not so wild a bet. Fifty million personal computers were sold 
last year, six times the number of television sets, according to George Gilder, 
futurist and author of the forthcoming book "Telecosm." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Grove, president of Intel, says the personal computer will become "the 
interactive center of the home," combining functions of the telephone, 
television and computer. 
</P>
<P>
 What has that to do with the newspaper? Simply that the computer is likely to 
displace the TV but provide an outlet for the content of newspapers and 
magazines, says Gilder, because computers and newspapers are attuned to 
delivering specific information to individual readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such analysis reflects the thinking of newspaper companies today. Times 
Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, has acquired newspapers -- Newsday, 
the Baltimore Sun and others -- along with television stations and cable 
properties over the past 25 years. But it sold the TV stations last year and 
now has cut direct activities in cable, while looking for opportunities to 
invest in future extensions of its newspaper and information service 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not alone. Washington Post Co. recently acquired Mammoth Micro 
Productions, a developer of the software that has made possible a computerized 
edition of Newsweek. Other companies are pursuing similar visions. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fascinating because newspaper companies, although they have owned TV 
stations, have never really gone into other fields before. Essentially the 
business hasn't changed since the 1840s when James Gordon Bennett introduced a 
one-penny paper called the New York Herald and drew a mass readership followed 
by mass advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been much reason to change. Although newspaper readers as a 
percentage of the U.S. population have been diminishing for 50 years, the 
decline has been gradual and newspapers still carry more advertising than any 
other medium. It's a cyclical business that does very well in good times and 
not so bad in bad times -- because other businesses must advertise at all 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 But now advertisers are not content to reach thousands of people who may never 
buy their product or service; they want the newspaper to reach specific numbers 
of target customers. Also, readers are demanding more specific information, 
geared to their individual interests. The model for what is going on is the 
magazine business where general interest publications, such as Time, used to 
dominate but now the most profitable publications, such as Forbes, PC Magazine, 
or Outside, have special interest readerships. 
</P>
<P>
 And growing computer usage accentuates the trend toward tailored news. Times 
Mirror noticed it first in professional services, which supply information for 
legal firms and medical practices. As technology changes, such information can 
be delivered on-line or on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees for specific information are higher, because the information is more 
current, more valuable to the business receiving it. And the trend to more 
specific information will spread to newspapers, says J. Kendrick Noble, of 
Noble Consultants, a Bronxville, N.Y. media firm. That's already happening as 
newspapers offer mortgage services over phone lines or faxed reports on 
individual stock portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future will come specialized information on health care, and 
combinations of advertising and reviews for movies, concerts and plays for a 
fee. The idea is to reduce dependence on advertising and increase income from 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism as it has been known will change. Newspapers will supply more 
specific information locally, readers will choose and pay for specific items. 
And advertising in some cases will be sold separately, as in the shopping 
services the Los Angeles Times and Pacific Bell, and Newsday and Nynex, are 
introducing. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper as the community bulletin board "had better be the low-cost and 
most adept provider of all such information services," says one media expert, 
"because there's going to be a lot of competition for the business." 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of companies would Times Mirror think of backing or acquiring with 
its cash? Several kinds, say analysts: Small software, electronic and 
telecommunications firms, or information gatherers such as J.D. Power & 
Associates, the automobile customer service. But big acquisitions -- paying 
half a billion dollars for well-known firms such as Broderbund Software -- 
would be unwise and are not in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good question arises: Why would customers pay extra to newspapers for 
such information, when the Internet and many computer service organizations can 
supply it? The answer is that newspapers gather, edit and interpret the 
information, make it usable, and -- most important -- stand behind it. 
Credibility, in a word, the asset derived from the reputation of a newspaper's 
staff in gathering facts and providing interpretation of events -- the asset 
not listed on the balance sheet but on the masthead -- will be even more 
important in selling services. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: The newspaper business has a solid future, for those who have 
the wit to capitalize on emerging trends. And in that context Times Mirror's 
managers, and the shareholders behind them, have just made a profound long-term 
decision in dropping the currently profitable cable business to bet that they 
can invest $1.3 billion wisely enough to ensure the company's future in the 
21st Century.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; 
CYBERPRIVACY AND THE 'CLIPPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If the annual Digital World conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center 
has been oddly free of friction this year, that may change today, when Clinton 
Brooks of the National Security Agency meets civil libertarian and cyberspace 
legend Philip Zimmerman, author of a notorious data encryption program called 
Pretty Good Privacy, on a panel titled "Privacy in the Digital World." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is one of the leading forces behind the "Clipper Chip," the 
government-designed microchip that would encrypt data sent over phone lines -- 
if private industry ever agreed to use it. The catch is that the government 
would have the key to unlock the encrypted information, the idea being that 
criminal activity in a digitized form could thus be monitored, ostensibly with 
the necessary legal safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was supposed to be balancing the individual's right to privacy with 
society's need to combat crime at a time when more and more information is 
electronic. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who went back and read the Federalist Papers in the course of 
developing his ideas on Clipper, says he's been shocked by the overwhelmingly 
negative reaction. "This goes to the core of the Fourth Amendment of the 
Constitution," he says, "but society isn't having a chance to address it." 
</P>
<P>
 The NSA scientist said he looked first to the Internet in hopes of getting 
"reasoned deliberation" on the subject, but instead was hit with "flames" and 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As I began to understand it, I realized the Internet is made up of a lot of 
immature people, college students for whom it is more fun to make easy snide 
comments instead of addressing the real issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman has a stock comeback: "I think I ought to be able to go up and 
whisper in your ear even if your ear is 100,000 miles away. If we install 
Clipper, then we can't do that, because the government will have a back door 
into our encrypted communications." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks, deeply earnest, maintains: "This country is the most vulnerable 
nation to the disruption of our information systems because of our 
high-technology. We need to get out of this petty bickering mode. I'm hoping 
people here will sense from me that this wasn't some master conspiracy scheme 
by the government, so we can get on with the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Baulick, a multimedia developer from Minneapolis, was less concerned 
with the Clipper controversy than with Magenta, for whose reappearance he 
waited patiently. She was last seen dissolving into a glob of ones and zeros, 
or so it said on the computer screen where Baulick sat in a corner of the 
cavernous Convention Center on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Baulick waited in one of BayMoo's hundreds of virtual rooms, described this 
way: The walls and floors of the root lodge are of soft earth. There are three 
small tables here, made of old pine. The chairs are also pine, and covered in 
soft paisley cushions. There is a flicker of soft candlelight. Bill the 
bartender is behind the old, wood bar.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the roughly 1,200 others who thronged the fifth annual Digital World 
convention, Baulick had come in order to catch up on new technology and meet 
people from the converging industries of computing, entertainment, consumer 
electronics and telecommunications. But BayMoo, an all-text virtual reality 
that anyone can add to and play in over the Internet computer web, kind of drew 
him in. It's a kind of game known on-line as a Multi-User Dungeon, or MUD. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't ask me to follow her," he says to no one in particular as Magenta 
breezes in and out again. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry -- you can play in the MUD too. Just telnet to mud.crl.com.8888. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual worlds are, quel surprise, something of a theme at Digital World this 
year. Other than Catapult, a new interactive firm launching an on-line video 
game network service, the buzz of the conference was Knowledge Adventure 
Worlds, which has developed a prototype for AT&T of an interactive 3-D virtual 
environment that may become a standard for the next generation of on-line 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The "world" that company President Dave Gobel demonstrated for a packed 
audience bore some resemblance to the interactive television interfaces phone 
companies such as Bell Atlantic and cable companies such as Time Warner have 
been developing. You can move through rooms and down hallways and choose from a 
variety of theoretical services, such as home shopping or games. And you can 
call up a friend via modem and hang out there together, using the keyboard to 
chat. 
</P>
<P>
 But because KA Worlds uses mostly computer-generated graphics and character 
animation rather than video, plus a powerful compression technology, it doesn't 
require a fancy-schmancy broad-band network to make it run. It works over 
regular telephone lines and most personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also does away with text-based pull-down menus, which can be a major 
turnoff to consumers unfamiliar with computer software such as Microsoft 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 A spinoff of La Crescenta-based multimedia developer Knowledge Adventure, 
which maintains a minority stake in the firm, KA Worlds hopes companies across 
all industries will commission the firm to develop their own virtual worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who find the concept less than obvious, Gobel recommended "Snow 
Crash," the recently published Neal Stephenson cyberpunk novel about a virtual 
realm called Metaverse, which he swears he didn't see an advance copy of before 
developing the product: "Read it if you want to know our business plan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, if you want to be a member of the interactive digital age 
cyber-clique, you'd better read it anyway. It was the last-read book of at 
least half an informal sampling of Digital World attendees, including Michele 
DiLorenzo, who was named chief of the newly restructured Viacom New Media on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which was expected after Viacom's acquisition of Paramount 
Communications earlier this year, combines Paramount's Palo Alto-based 
multimedia publishing arm, Paramount Interactive, with Viacom New Media, based 
in New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom also announced the formation of a new group called Viacom Interactive 
Services, which includes the interactive TV groups of both companies, and 
creates a new position for former Paramount Technology Group chief Keith 
Schaefer, who will develop an on-line business strategy for the company from 
New York. Viacom executives said the reorganization would result in about five 
layoffs from the organization out of about 150 employees.

GOTECH ACCUSED IN $1-MILLION FRAUD COMPLAINT; BUILDING: ORANGE COUNTY FIRM 
ALLEGEDLY SIPHONED FUNDS FROM CLIENTS IN ONE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST CONTRACTOR 
FRAUD CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest contractor fraud cases in California, the state attorney 
general's office has accused an Orange County custom home builder of siphoning 
nearly $1 million from the accounts of dozens of clients and subcontractors 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint was filed against Gotech Builders; its owner, Jeffrey 
Charles Weiner, and several former Gotech executives on behalf of the 
Contractors State License Board. It seeks to permanently bar Weiner and the 
others from obtaining contractors' licenses in California or from working for 
any licensed contractor in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Mendoza, a deputy state attorney general, said in a brief telephone 
interview that she also intends to begin a criminal investigation in connection 
with the case, but she declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed with the California Department of Consumers Affairs 
last month, though no public announcement was made. A hearing will be held 
before an administrative law judge later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's probe of Gotech began late last year, following a Los Angeles 
Times investigation of the company and its activities. The state's accusation 
details $961,000 that Gotech and a predecessor company, called Systems 
Construction, allegedly diverted from customers' construction accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a bigger case," said Paula Watkins, head of the Southern 
California regional office of the contractor licensing board -- the state 
agency responsible for licensing and disciplining of building-trades 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants have been charged with illegally diverting funds from 
customers' construction accounts and engaging in fraudulent sales techniques to 
entice customers to sign construction contracts. The company operated largely 
in Orange, Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the state complaint was Larry Stephen Hampton, whose contractor 
license Gotech used to operate. Also named was Richard K. Green, a former vice 
president of the company, and Ilene Gayron, a sales agent. Hampton and Green 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gayron never held a contractor license, she was named in the 
complaint as the architect of most of the companies' fraudulent sales 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayron was married to Weiner for a year and a half, but the marriage was 
annulled in April 1991. Gayron continued to work with Weiner until early this 
year, and, according to Weiner during testimony in a recent bankruptcy hearing, 
she still lives with him in a luxury home in Fullerton built by Gotech. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayron, reached at her new employment referral business in Brea on Tuesday, 
said "nothing in (the complaint) is true. I was an employee, and I was just 
doing my job." She and Hampton have notified the state that they intend to 
defend themselves in the administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner and Green have not responded to the charges, according to Mendoza, the 
deputy attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case outlined in the state's complaint, a Montebello couple paid Gotech 
$119,628 -- including $37,000 that the company allegedly withdrew from a 
construction account without authorization -- for work on a new home that was 
to have cost $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gotech's license was suspended by the contractors' board in October, 
1993, the only work that had been completed was minor grading on the site. None 
of the couple's money has been refunded, and Weiner, the sole owner of Gotech, 
has since filed for bankruptcy liquidation.

 U.S., Japan Expand Scope of Trade Talks: The two nations agreed to include 
banking and other financial services in negotiations aimed at opening Japanese 
markets to more American goods. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
the trading partners, at a Paris meeting of the 25-nation Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, also decided to talk about how to ensure 
protection of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. The 
new discussion areas will be part of so-called framework talks aimed at 
improving U.S. access to Japan's tightly controlled markets. The original 
areas, still under negotiation, are autos and auto parts, medical equipment, 
telecommunications products and insurance.

 U.S., France to Tackle Movie Feud: The governments of the two nations have 
agreed to take a new stab at resolving their bitter dispute over film 
distribution and royalties in France, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
said at the annual meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development.The two countries also agreed to address common 
concerns about access to Japan, considered the main transgressor when it comes 
to trade. Discussion groups from Paris and Washington also planned to hash over 
the contentious new link between trade policy and workers' rights -- a high 
priority of both nations. Kantor said he struck the three-part agenda agreement 
Monday night with his French counterpart, Gerard Longuet.

 American Matches Some TWA Discounts: AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, 
said it is matching some European fare discounts initiated by Trans World 
Airlines. "We are going to do a limited match of the special on competitive 
routes," a spokesman said.TWA announced the discounts Monday; some carriers 
matched the fares, but others said they were still studying the move because 
European bookings were already strong. The latest discounts allow as much as 
$200 off round-trip tickets purchased by June 13. The lower rates apply to 
travel between July 3 and Aug. 31, with a maximum stay of 30 days. Northwest 
Airlines and United Airlines said they were matching the TWA fares on competing 
routes. Delta Air Lines did not immediately go along.

 Mid-Sized Manufacturers Expect Growth: About 63% of them plan to add full-time 
employees this year to handle an increasing volume of orders.According to the 
Grant Thornton Survey of American Manufacturers, 65% of the executives 
interviewed last month said they expect to see demand rising for the rest of 
the year. Interviewers surveyed 250 top executives at companies with annual 
sales of between $10 million and $500 million. Among the findings: 49% are 
increasing overtime, 42% are hiring extra part-timers and 42% are using workers 
from temporary agencies for production jobs. Nearly two-thirds of the 
executives said they expect their companies to make more money this year than 
last.

 SEC Approves Nasdaq Listing Proposal: The National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
said the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved rules intended to 
strengthen the exchange's authority to bar the listing of some firms.Nasdaq 
spokesman James Spellman said the exchange sought the rules "as a fraud 
protection device, but also to underscore the integrity of our market." 
Spellman said the rules might be used, for example, to prevent the listing of a 
company that met Nasdaq's numerical criteria but whose board included people 
with a history of securities or commodities law violations. The NASD runs the 
computer-screen-based Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock market, on 
which more than 4,700 issues are traded.

 Orange County Register Halts Ad Campaign: The newspaper agreed to call off the 
countywide campaign because of a trademark dispute with the Washington Post, an 
attorney for the Post said."We're clarifying a few final things, but they have 
agreed to stop using" the phrase, "If you don't get it, you don't get it," said 
Mary Ann Werner, assistant counsel to the Washington newspaper. She added that 
the resolution had been amicable. Register officials said that any agreement is 
still in progress. "I can't comment until I see the response to our 
correspondence" with the Post, said John Schueler, executive vice president and 
general manager of the Register. The Post filed for trademark rights to the 
phrase last fall.

 UAW Reaches Tentative Pact With GM: The United Auto Workers union and General 
Motors Corp. reached the agreement late Monday night, covering 3,500 striking 
workers in Michigan. UAW officials said GM has agreed to bring work back into 
the union's ranks and invest in new equipment as part of the agreement to end 
the 5-day-old strike at the car maker's Technical Center in Warren, Mich.A 
spokesman for the union said a ratification vote was set for today and that 
workers could be back on the job in the afternoon if the pact is approved. The 
UAW local struck GM because it said the auto maker has been assigning work to 
outside contractors. Union bargainers were satisfied with the tentative 
agreement, said Earl Hartman, an official of UAW Local 160.

 Silicon Graphics, NTT in Pact: Silicon Graphics Inc. and Japan's Nippon 
Telegraph & Telephone Corp. tentatively agreed to develop together an 
interactive multimedia system in Japan. Under a memo of understanding, Mountain 
View, Calif.-based SGI would supply network software and "servers" that would 
dish up to Japanese households, government offices and businesses digitized 
movies and other information via a fiber-optic network being installed by NTT. 
Tests of the system would begin late next year. Edward R. McCracken, SGI's 
chief executive, said the Japanese appear chiefly interested in using the 
digital network to boost business productivity. Nancy Battey, an analyst at 
International Data Corp., said the deal gets SGI's "foot in the door" in Japan 
but that she is dubious because of a lack of financial details.

JUSTICES HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN PROP. 103 INSURANCE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court on Tuesday heard oral arguments in a case 
considered crucial to the fate of Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rate 
rollback initiative. Both sides emerged from the one-hour hearing predicting 
victory, but the session itself did little to reveal the court's view of the 
high-stakes case. 
</P>
<P>
 The case represents 20th Century Insurance Co.'s challenge to state Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's order that the Woodland Hills-based insurer 
refund $78 million plus interest (a current total of about $120 million) in 
"excess" 1989 premiums to about 900,000 California policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi expressed confidence that the high court will reverse a Los Angeles 
Superior Court ruling last year that his order breached 20th Century's 
constitutional right to earn a fair profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's clear from their questions that the justices found our 
procedures are in line with the Constitution," Garamendi said after the 
session. He considered the case important enough that he attended the hearing 
in person, even though Tuesday was Election Day for the primary in which he was 
a Democratic candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 required a one-year, 20% rollback of property- casualty 
insurance rates, but the Supreme Court -- in a separate 1989 case -- ruled that 
an insurer could not be held to that 20% standard if the result would be 
"confiscatory" in its particular case. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the subsequent legal wrangling has revolved around how to define 
confiscatory. 20th Century argues that in its case, anything below a 20% return 
on equity would be confiscatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi maintains that the 10% rate of return he set for the whole industry 
is a fair standard and that the more than 400 insurers affected by Proposition 
103 should not be entitled to case-by-case exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said a favorable ruling would pave the way for an estimated $1.5 
billion in rebates to policyholders, beyond the nearly $800 million that 
insurers have already rebated. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 20th Century's case, it is doubtful whether even a complete victory for 
Garamendi would result in anything like $120 million in rebates. The company 
had more than half its capital wiped out by an estimated $600 million in losses 
from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, and it is doubtful whether it could 
afford any substantial rebate today. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 20th Century's attorney, Gary L. Fontana, said after the court 
hearing that if the company had paid the original rebate when ordered, it 
probably wouldn't have survived the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The small appeals court chamber in the Ronald Reagan State Office Building in 
Downtown Los Angeles was packed for the arguments, and the overflow of 
spectators watched on video monitors in a downstairs auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices have 90 days to issue a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The court typically prepares tentative decisions even before hearing oral 
arguments, but Fontana said the justices' questions made him conclude that they 
are still wrestling with the issues and may take the full 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's attorney, Michael Strumwasser, said he thought the questions 
indicated that the justices were comfortable with the issues and would rule 
soon, perhaps within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana said that if 20th Century were to lose on all counts, it would appeal 
the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

COURT RESURRECTS BIG DEFENSE FRAUD CASE; WHISTLE-BLOWING: APPELLATE DECISION 
REVERSES DISMISSAL OF A 1980S SUIT AGAINST NORTHROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When leading whistle-blower attorney Herbert Hafif accused the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles of lying in a defense fraud lawsuit, he was fined $24,000 
by federal Judge David V. Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But an appeals court in Pasadena has ruled that federal prosecutors knowingly 
filed a "factually inaccurate" declaration in the case, and it threw out the 
sanctions Kenyon imposed on Hafif two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court ruling, along with another recent decision that reversed a 
dismissal of the suit, has resurrected one of the biggest defense fraud cases 
of the 1980s, involving allegations that a guidance system for a nuclear-armed 
cruise missile was both defective and improperly tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp., which built the system, has already paid a $10-million 
civil fine on charges that it improperly tested the guidance devices, known as 
flight data transmitters. It also pleaded guilty to federal felony charges and 
paid a $17-million criminal fine. And it agreed to make $11 million in repairs 
to the transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prior court settlements involved only the issue that Northrop's tests 
were rigged, not the defect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Brajas, a former Northrop test technician at its western services 
department in Pomona, charges in his suit, filed in 1987, that Northrop used a 
hydraulic damping fluid in the gyroscopes that would freeze at temperatures 
typically experienced by the cruise missiles at high altitudes.  
</P>
<P>
 The damping fluid used by Northrop, known as DC-200, would freeze at 40 
degrees below zero, far warmer than the 65 degrees required under the contract, 
according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fahey, a former assistant U.S. attorney, asserted in a declaration that 
the government learned about the low-temperature problem through its own 
investigation, not from Brajas. That point was crucial to Kenyon's initial 
dismissal of the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Hafif lambasted Fahey in legal filings at the time as "putrid," "despicable," 
a "cheat" and a "fraud." The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles wanted to 
teach Hafif a lesson and successfully sought the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pasadena appeals court ruled late last week that since Fahey's 
statements were inaccurate, Hafif was merely engaging in "harmless hyperbole."  
</P>
<P>
 Fahey, however, still insists the declaration was correct. "This is crazy," 
said Fahey, now in private practice in Los Angeles. "Brajas was never the 
source of the cold-temperature allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio indicated that the company will continue to 
fight the case on the grounds that Brajas has no right to bring suit, because 
he was not the original source of the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Benson, an attorney who now represents Brajas, said the two appeals 
court rulings "clear the way for the issue to be finally litigated after seven 
years."

FOX LEAVES MADISON AVE. ON SIDELINES; ADVERTISING: THE NETWORK HIRES A FIRM 
THAT SPECIALIZES IN MOVIE CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE ITS NFL BROADCASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who can make movie teasers look better than the films themselves is 
about to try to do the same for the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Broadcasting Co., which will begin airing NFL games late this summer, this 
week hired Tony Seiniger, president of Beverly Hills-based Seiniger 
Advertising, to create commercials to promote Fox's first-ever NFL broadcast 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Seiniger has created ad campaigns almost exclusively for more than 
1,000 feature films -- including such hits as "The Fugitive," "Field of Dreams" 
and the upcoming "Wyatt Earp." The agency has also created popular movie 
posters for big-screen blockbusters such as "Jaws," "The Right Stuff" and "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Fox is a telling example of the unconventional steps marketers 
will take to keep remote-control-wielding consumers from zapping their ads. And 
it is a reminder to giant Madison Avenue agencies that the nature of their 
business is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Coca-Cola turned away from Madison Avenue by hiring the 
Beverly Hills talent firm Creative Artists Agency to develop its TV ads. Reebok 
raised eyebrows when it picked a Los Angeles design firm, Scott Mednick & 
Associates, to create some print ads. Now Fox is snubbing conventional ad 
agencies by handing its $3-million account to a firm best known for producing 
glitzy movie trailers and posters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In challenging times, people are looking for innovative ways to stand out," 
said William A. Cohen, a marketing professor at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiniger plans to vastly change the look of football advertising. Unlike past 
NFL campaigns that typically showed players in battle on the field, Fox's 
upcoming campaign will focus on the top players out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see them in uniform, these guys all look like Darth Vader," Seiniger 
said. "We want to show that players have individual personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 The multifaceted campaign will be aimed at boosting overall NFL television 
viewership as well as introducing fans to Fox broadcasts of the games. Besides 
producing TV spots, the agency will create ads for 3,000 billboards nationwide, 
Seiniger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising experts say Fox's selection of Seiniger is a wise one. "These guys 
have lots of experience getting people into movie theaters," said Rance Crain, 
editor in chief of Advertising Age. "What's so different about getting people 
to sit down and watch a TV show? It's all about building audience." 
</P>
<P>
 But the selection of Seiniger is also considered risky. The 21-year-old firm, 
which competed against a few conventional ad agencies for the account, has 
little experience beyond film promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone in the film business wants a creative advertising resource, they 
go anywhere they can to find it," Seiniger said. "This sort of thing is 
happening more and more in consumer product advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox executives said the decision was simple.  
</P>
<P>
 "The NFL is entertainment," said Tracy Dolgin, executive vice president of 
marketing at Fox Sports.  
</P>
<P>
 Fox shook the broadcast world in December when it outbid CBS by agreeing to 
pay $1.58 billion for the rights to broadcast the NFL's National Football 
Conference games for four years. Its first broadcast will be a preseason game 
Aug. 12, and its regular season broadcasts will begin Sept. 4.

TICKETMASTER DOCUMENTS SOUGHT IN PROBE; ENTERTAINMENT: ROCK GROUP PEARL JAM 
FILED A FEDERAL COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT AGENCY'S MONOPOLY KEPT IT FROM TOURING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of its investigation into anti-competitive practices in the ticket 
distribution industry, the Justice Department has demanded that Ticketmaster 
turn over documents related to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times learned Tuesday that the Los Angeles-based ticket agency was served 
late last week with a "civil investigative demand" -- the equivalent of a 
subpoena -- requiring it to turn over contracts and other pertinent records. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation stems from an antitrust complaint filed with the Justice 
Department last month by the Seattle rock group Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the action, but he 
acknowledged that the investigation is proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned S. Goldstein, Ticketmaster vice president, said it would be inappropriate 
to comment on whether the company had been served papers. But he said 
Ticketmaster would "deal with whatever arises in the appropriate manner and 
will prevail and be exonerated at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their investigation, Justice Department officials from Washington 
have been in Los Angeles recently, interviewing music business figures. Among 
those contacted this week by the government were representatives for recording 
artists Sting and R.E.M., sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Pearl Jam have accused Ticketmaster of exercising a monopoly over 
ticket distribution and using that influence to keep promoters from booking the 
band's summer tour, which was canceled. Pearl Jam sought to limit ticket prices 
to $18, plus a $1.80 handling fee -- low by pop standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's complaint, filed by Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent New York law 
firm, alleged that Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all important 
concert venues in the country and uses the relationships to "cement control 
over the distribution of tickets to concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster has dominated the ticket market since 1991. In May of that year, 
the Justice Department's antitrust division gave the go-ahead for Ticketmaster 
to buy certain assets from Ticketron, which at the time was its only major 
competitor.

RAYTHEON JOINS FLAT-PANEL SCREEN PROJECT; TECHNOLOGY: A U.S.-JAPANESE-FRENCH 
CONSORTIUM HOPES TO BRING ABOUT A REVOLUTION IN COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY 
ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raytheon Co. said Tuesday that it has joined a U.S.-Japanese-French consortium 
to build a new kind of flat-panel screen that it hopes will revolutionize 
electronic displays on everything from laptop computers to radar. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the group include Texas Instruments Inc.; Pixel 
International, a French electronics firm, and Futaba Corp. of Japan, also an 
electronics company, said Raytheon, which is based in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-performance screens can now be found in laptop computers and are used 
by the military. The group will build the screens for military and commercial 
use, said William Swanson, senior vice president and general manager of 
Raytheon's missile systems division. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultra-thin screens are called field emission displays. The quarter-inch 
glass plates are expected to replace bulkier television picture tubes in 
applications such as aircraft instruments, air traffic control monitors, 
computer screens and industrial displays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency has projected the 
global market for flat-panel display screens at $40 billion annually by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a month ago, the White House proposed spending up to $1 
billion to help U.S. flat-panel makers compete with Japanese manufacturers, who 
produce most of the displays. 
</P>
<P>
 A few U.S. companies have less than 3% of the global market for flat panels. 
</P>
<P>
 A Raytheon spokesman declined to say how much the company will spend on the 
project.

 The Federal Trade Commission voted May 31 to close an investigation of whether 
the company uses Joe Camel to encourage children to smoke, a statement released 
late Tuesday said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it may seem intuitive to some that the Joe Camel advertising 
campaign would lead more children to smoke or lead children to smoke more, the 
evidence to support that intuition is not there," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds called the decision "a complete vindication." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Mary L. Azcuenaga, Deborah Owen and Roscoe Starek III voted to 
drop the investigation. The remaining two commissioners -- Dennis Yao and 
Chairwoman Janet Steiger -- released statements saying they were disappointed 
with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reason to believe that the Camel campaign induced underage people to 
start smoking and that proceedings against such ads would be in the interest of 
the public," Steiger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is evidence that the carton character has appeal to minors and that 
Camel has increased its market share among minors," Yao said, adding that he 
wanted the matter aired in an administrative trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission sent letters Monday to R.J. Reynolds and the Coalition of 
Smoking or Health informing them of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite awareness of the Joe Camel character, it has not changed youth's 
overwhelmingly negative opinions about smoking," company spokeswoman Peggy 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition on Smoking or Health last week said it was unhappy with the 
vote. News of the decision leaked earlier this month, but commissioners refused 
to confirm or deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Trade Commission is there to protect consumer interests and this 
action would give the tobacco industry a green light to continue enticing 
America's children," said coalition member Scott D. Ballin, who also is vice 
president of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters to Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.), and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) 
were sent Tuesday. Synar is a member of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee's subcommittee on health and the environment, and Waxman is the 
subcommittee's chairman.

CONSUMER CREDIT JUMP IS BIGGEST IN 9 YEARS; ECONOMY: APRIL'S $8.9-BILLION 
INCREASE IS 11TH STRAIGHT MONTHLY GAIN. CREDIT CARD BORROWING RISES A RECORD $5 
BILLION.

<P>
 Consumer credit soared $8.9 billion in April, the biggest jump in more than 
nine years and the 11th straight monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card borrowing set a record by increasing nearly $5 billion to $293.8 
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Federal Reserve Board said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said all borrowing rose 13.2% at an annual rate, following a revised 
12.6% jump in March and 6% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists had projected that credit would be up about $6 billion in 
April. They expected the total to be held down by Easter's early arrival this 
year, meaning consumers did much of their holiday shopping in March rather than 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales declined 0.8% in April while overall consumer spending for the 
month slipped 0.1%, the Commerce Department previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed said revolving credit, meaning credit card borrowing, skyrocketed 
20.7% at an annual rate in April, accounting for about half the overall 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8.9-billion total increase for all borrowing was the largest since 
consumer credit soared $11.6 billion in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts conceded that it seems contradictory that Americans would be piling 
up debt at the same time they were curtailing spending. But they said the two 
sets of numbers do not always move in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like people are borrowing and not spending," said economist Kurt 
Karl of WEFA Group, a forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "It may be people 
borrowed this month and next they'll pay off the bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said the latest increase in borrowing brought outstanding debt to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $817.8 billion in April, up from $808.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto loans rose at an 11.9% annual rate to $287 billion after a 16.2% increase 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Other forms of credit, including loans for mobile homes, education, boats, 
trailers and vacations, were up 5.5% to $236.9 billion, after a 16.6% rise in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists expect spring consumer spending to increase, but only at a moderate 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity. Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real 
estate, namely home equity loans and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Commerce Department reported sales at the wholesale level 
dropped in April after three straight monthly increases and inventories of 
unsold goods rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales by wholesalers fell 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted $165.9 billion 
-- the first decline in sales this year following three straight monthly 
increases in the opening quarter of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in March rose a revised 1.7% instead of 1.3% as previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventories increased by 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted $217.9 billion 
following a revised 0.5% decrease in March, which was originally reported as a 
0.9% fall.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CASE STUDY: HOW 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A WORKPLACE; SEATTLE'S METRO SYSTEM ENTERS FAST LANE WITH 
ELECTRONIC OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Costa points to a corner of his cubicle. "I used to have two huge 
cabinets, four drawers each," he says. "Now I just have this one little white 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 The cabinets -- crammed with paperwork essential to managing bus building 
contracts for Costa's employer, the King County Department of Metropolitan 
Services in Seattle -- and four others that occupied his boss's office once 
formed an information traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the files' contents were needed by the departments that handle 
operations, maintenance, administration and safety and training, only Costa 
knew how to use the cryptic database that identified the files in which 
information was stored. The result was a work process that often crawled along 
at the pace of a Friday afternoon freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the old cabinets are gone, replaced by an electronic filing system readily 
accessible by several dozen people simultaneously -- including contractors, who 
dial in via modem from manufacturing and assembly sites in Toronto and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system, based on software designed to help people work together, 
should allow Seattle's transit system to manage several multimillion-dollar bus 
buying contracts at a time, thereby adding to the fleet more quickly and 
helping to keep commuters moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in a corner of the fifth floor of the downtown Exchange Building, 
Costa's fleet procurement team oversees the complex process of expanding 
Seattle's 1,200-bus Metro system. The three-person team is tiny, but it serves 
a pivotal role in the growth of the nation's eighth-largest transit system. 
With no rail or subway alternatives, Seattle has invested heavily in its bus 
system, considered to be among America's most innovative. 
</P>
<P>
 When gridlock along 3rd Avenue became a daily event in the 1980s, for example, 
the city dug a tunnel beneath the bustling retail and commercial district and 
bought 60-foot buses that run on diesel fuel at street level, then switch to 
electric power for the 1.3-mile subterranean route. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Metro's buses are considered state-of-the-art, the fleet procurement 
team's desktop PCs were, until recently, running 1986 technology. That year, 
Costa had implemented the department's first-ever electronic database, using 
the then-popular dBase program. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, the database resembled a jalopy. Its main role was as a directory of 
file numbers, indicating in which drawer the manila file folder with the actual 
documents could be found. Even worse, only Costa had access to the database. 
His role as librarian burdened his already hectic day and often caused the work 
of others to grind to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone needed information and I wasn't around, the request sat and waited 
until I was available," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, the Metro earmarked $20,000 to revamp the system. By choosing 
wisely among new personal computer technologies, the transit authority could 
bring to its business infrastructure the same level of innovation shown in its 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials saw the modernized system meeting several needs. First, it had to 
include a new database for taming the thousands of documents that were clogging 
departmental channels. It had to be easy to learn and open to anyone who needed 
it, including remote users such as contractors and Metro inspectors at 
manufacturing sites. And, to ensure that the transit authority got a reasonable 
return on its investment, the system had to be versatile enough to be adapted 
to other Metro needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, the Metro began using a custom application designed for the transit 
authority using Lotus Notes, the leading entrant in the software category known 
as "groupware." 
</P>
<P>
 Most software programs are designed with single users in mind. Notes' features 
are geared to the needs of people who work as a group. Co-workers swap messages 
and ideas via electronic mail, and they write and route pertinent memos, 
letters and reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Notes lets co-workers collect a body of information that acts 
as the electronic equivalent of the departmental file cabinet. Just as you 
might open a file cabinet drawer and add a letter to a file, Notes lets you add 
documents to files that can be read and used by everyone in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Information searches that used to take hours of paging through stacks of 
papers are now done in seconds. Group members help themselves to the letters or 
reports they need. Documents not created within Notes are scanned into the 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 The database automatically creates the audit trail required by state- and 
federally funded contracts, says Peter Weinrobe of Princeton, N.J.-based 
Trellis Network Services, which created the application. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also powerful enough that the Metro's information services staff can 
create other applications with it, freeing workers from reliance on expensive 
outside consultants.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; PICK AN INTERNET CRUISING VEHICLE

<P>
 The Internet is a bit like the weather. Lots of people like to talk about it, 
few people understand it and no one can control it. But the Internet is getting 
a little easier to use, thanks to America Online and some commercial Internet 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a worldwide network of networks designed during the 1970s for 
scientists, academics and defense contractors, is now available to everyone. 
However, as many new subscribers have found out, getting on and learning to use 
the Internet can be a lot more difficult than they imagined. There are several 
reasons for this. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, most Internet providers run under the Unix operating system and 
require users to understand at least a few Unix commands. This is quite 
different from commercial on-line services such as Prodigy, America Online and 
CompuServe, which Windows and Macintosh users navigate by pointing and clicking 
at menus and icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the most difficult type of account to set up is the type you need 
if you want to run Mosaic, an easy-to-use Macintosh and Windows Internet access 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news about Mosaic is that it is in the public domain, so you don't 
have to buy it. You have already paid for it with your federal tax dollars. The 
bad news is that you can't run Mosaic with just any type of Internet account. 
You have to set up either a SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) or PPP 
(Point-to-Point Protocol) account. And before you can log on, you must obtain 
and configure some pretty obtuse software. It's not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Several companies are working to change all this. America Online, a major 
commercial service for users of DOS, Windows and Mac, is now offering access to 
some, but not all, Internet resources. Like other such services, it offers its 
members the ability to exchange electronic mail via the Internet, but unlike 
most other commercial on-line services, it also offers access to Internet news 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 There are thousands of news groups (forums) that let you post questions, 
respond to others' comments and read articles posted by people around the 
world. America Online charges $9.95 a month, which includes five free hours. 
Additional hours are $3.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online recently expanded its Internet offerings to include Gopher and 
WAIS. Gopher is a menu system that lets you cruise from one Internet provider 
to another. Gophers are organized by subject and geographic area. WAIS (Wide 
Area Information Server) is a database that allows you to find your way around 
the network by entering the correct keywords. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online's Gopher is organized by subject matter, so it is very easy to 
find your way around.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While AOL expands to embrace the Internet, several commercial Internet 
providers are developing software to make their services much easier to use. 
Netcom ((800) 501-8649) will soon release its NetCruiser software, which will 
allow Windows users to navigate the Internet by clicking on icons. Unlike 
Mosaic, NetCruiser is a snap to install. The software automatically takes care 
of all the obscure commands and configuration routines and even helps you find 
the local access phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, once you're on, you never have to issue a single Unix command. 
NetCruiser provides access to most Internet resources, including World Wide 
Web, Gopher, FTP (files for downloading) and e-mail. The company plans to 
charge NetCruiser users $19.95 a month for up to 25 hours of access. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipeline ((212) 267-3636), a New York-based Internet provider, offers an 
elegant and easy-to-use Windows access program for its system. Pull-down menus 
and icons connect with most Internet services. A powerful electronic mail 
editor makes it easy to read and send mail. To save time and money, the 
software allows you to download mail and news group articles onto a hard disk, 
so you can read and respond before you log on to the service. The company 
offers a number of price plans, starting at $15 month plus $2 an hour for 
access from the New York area.  
</P>
<P>
 For an additional hourly fee, you'll soon be able to use the service from 
anywhere in the United States. Subscribers who already have access to the 
Internet can avoid extra access charges by using their current Internet service 
to access Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever system you choose for using the Internet, keep your expectations in 
check. There is a lot to explore, but it takes a while to get used to it all. 
For novices, the best strategy is to use the Gopher menu system to cruise 
around the net.

<P>
 Time was when getting information from the U.S. government involved letter 
writing, phone calls and sometimes even trips to Washington to search through 
records. Nowadays, you can get a good bit of government information on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best tactics is to use gopher, a simple menuing system that will 
take you almost anywhere on the Net.Investors will be glad to learn that 
corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, previously 
available on the Internet only by invoking various arcane commands, are now 
easy to get this way. Type gopher town.hall.org to get a menu of items, 
including the keyword-searchable SEC database (known as Edgar), as well as a 
new section containing U.S. patents and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
 For more general information, type gopher marvel.loc.gov. If you don't have 
gopher, type telnet marvel.loc.gov and use marvel as the log-in. The marvel 
gopher can help you access government data on topics ranging from aerospace to 
weather, including U.S. Census Bureau data, job openings and federal assistance 
programs. Marvel and other gophers also offer the Library of Congress 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good resource is the Commerce Department's Economic Bulletin Board, 
which can be reached by typing telnet ebb.stat-usa.gov and logging in as guest. 
If you lack Internet access, just use your modem to dial (202) 482-2584. You 
can browse through hundreds of economic indicators, some of them updated daily.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; STAR WARS 
TECHNOLOGY, IN DEFENSE OF HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Ronald Reagan once envisioned the day when powerful energy beams 
could protect the United States from enemy nuclear missiles, a concept that 
became known as the Star Wars defense system. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of energy beam weapons has faded into obscurity, but a portion of 
the technology has been harnessed for a different purpose: treating cancer with 
revolutionary proton beam radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Electus Technology in San Bernardino has developed an accelerator that creates 
a beam of protons that can be aimed far more accurately at cancer tissue than 
current electron or photon beam radiation or the older cobalt radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Electus, founded by former TRW engineer Jon W. Slater, built a proton beam 
accelerator at Loma Linda Medical Research Center and is building conventional 
accelerators at other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the company's 42 employees came out of the defense industry, said 
Slater, sole owner of the company. The former defense workers are crucial not 
for their knowledge of specific defense technology, but for their background in 
systems engineering for complex machines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people looking for work in Los Angeles with incredible skills," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater's proton machine consists of three accelerators that impart energy to a 
stream of hydrogen nuclei, each of which consists of a single proton. The 
intermediate accelerator, known as a radio frequency quadropol, uses what was 
once a candidate technology for Star Wars. Another of the three accelerators, 
one that plays a crucial role, is known as a synchrotron and was developed at 
the federal government's Fermi Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike conventional radiation, proton beams can penetrate a precise depth of 
body tissue and impart energy directly onto a tumor. Older radiation methods 
penetrate less deeply and radiate significantly more healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Side effects such as nausea, hair loss and diarrhea are less severe with 
proton therapy. The downside is that the machines cost $40 million to $80 
million each. So far, Slater said, he has sold only one but has several 
prospects. RALPH VARTABEDIAN

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; THE 
GENETICALLY ALTERED POTATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A gene found in tobacco is being used to develop a potato resistant to late 
blight disease, the same plant affliction that caused the devastating Irish 
potato famine of 1845, reports a team of Purdue University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the breakthrough is 150 years too late to help the Irish, many of whom 
came to this country as a result of the famine, blight disease is still the No. 
1 pest of potato plants worldwide. While chemicals have been used against it in 
the United States, new varieties of the fungus have become resistant to current 
fungicides. To develop a naturally resistant potato, the researchers first 
identified a gene in tobacco that codes for a protein called osmotin, which is 
produced by many plants under stress. Then the gene was combined with another 
gene sequence to increase the amount of protein produced and moved into potato 
plants. (Osmotin has no known human health effects and occurs naturally in all 
plants.) 
</P>
<P>
 The additional osmotin enables the genetically engineered potato plants to 
fight off late blight infestations for one or two days, a delay that may seem 
small but is sufficient to substantially reduce the toll taken by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Smarter Than a Speeding Bullet: In the old Westerns, the flash of sunlight off 
a rifle barrel was often enough to give away where shots were coming from. 
Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have come up with a more 
high-tech approach. The key components for the Livermore device, called 
Lifeguard, are a sensor that identifies a speeding bullet via its unique 
signals, and a sophisticated computer that processes the signals into an image. 
When a bullet is fired, Lifeguard's sensor picks up the location of the bullet 
and instantly re-creates its flight path, showing on a video screen the path 
all the way back to its source. A red rectangle outlines the area where the 
gunman is standing. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lifeguard has obvious military applications, the Lawrence Livermore team 
actually came up with the idea for the device after hearing reports of a 
schoolyard shooting. Potential law enforcement applications include attaching 
the device to a police helicopter, VIP protection, and security at large 
gatherings or in open spaces, such as schoolyards. Lifeguard could also be 
married to a still or movie camera with a telephoto lens, which could snap 
legally admissible pictures of the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashes to Alloys: Coal-burning electric utility companies produce approximately 
75 million tons of fly ash annually. While a quarter of that tonnage is used in 
construction or other applications, the remainder is disposed of in landfills, 
at a cost of nearly $1 billion per year.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last 10 years, the Electric Power Research Institute has been trying 
to come up with alternatives. One involves using the ash in new composite 
materials called ashalloys. Ashalloys, a class of metal matrix composites, 
which are engineered combinations of a metal and other materials, are 
composites of aluminum alloy and fly ash. Researchers at the University of 
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, working with ashalloys have found that these composites 
offer a number of advantages over plain aluminum: energy savings, lower 
disposal costs of the ash and improved material properties at a reduced cost.  
</P>
<P>
 Ashalloys could make their biggest impact on the auto industry by helping to 
reduce the weight of vehicles. Engine blocks, pistons, cylinder heads and drive 
shafts are all considered candidates for ashalloy technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyberspace Shopping: While interactivity promises many things, one thing 
everyone seems to agree on is that drivers on the information superhighway will 
surely head for the cybermalls to shop. On-line shopping services and CD-ROM 
catalogues are only the beginning. According to the cable industry gurus, 
shopping ranks right up there with video on demand as a "killer application" 
for interactive services. 
</P>
<P>
 Now along comes virtual reality technology to make these cybermalls even more 
realistic. UC San Diego and the San Diego Supercomputer Center have come up 
with a virtual reality system called In the Bag that is designed to make 
shopping from your living room a more familiar experience. Using a Silicon 
Graphics computer and the company's RealityEngine graphics, along with virtual 
reality gear (cyberglove, space ball and liquid crystal display glasses), 
shoppers can wander through various 3D mall stores, select merchandise and drop 
the selected merchandise into a depicted shopping bag. But the system makes no 
provision for many other aspects of the mall experience, including searching 
for parking, hanging out with friends or scarfing down fast food.

 Side by Side: The increasing use of interactive and multimedia production in 
corporations has created a problem familiar to writers of scripts, TV 
commercials, corporate videos and the like: the need to write in two columns, 
one for dialogue, the other for directing camera and actors. And these elements 
must stay next to each other no matter how many rewrites the script goes 
through. Current word-processing software offers this capability but requires a 
user to plow through hundreds of pages of documentation to learn the necessary 
skills.  
</P>
<P>
 To the rescue comes William Simon, himself a writer and producer of films, 
documentaries and corporate videos. Simon's Rancho Santa Fe company, Simon 
Skill Systems, is best known for teaching computer skills by audiocassette. Now 
he has developed software called SideBySide, designed to be used with Microsoft 
Word. Users simply choose one of the pre-designed two-column or multi-column 
formats and start writing. If a paragraph with new directions has to be 
inserted later, the software will make sure that camera directions still appear 
opposite the dialogue for which they were intended. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SPRINT IN TALKS WITH 2 
EUROPEAN FIRMS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: POSSIBILITY OF PACT WITH FRENCH AND GERMAN 
PHONE COMPANIES FOLLOWS COLLAPSE OF EDS MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One day after ending merger talks with Electronic Data Systems Corp., Sprint 
Corp. said Tuesday that it is exploring a deal to sell a large portion of 
itself to two European telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible partnership with Deutsche Telekom of Germany and France Telecom 
of France, both state-owned phone monopolies, would "concentrate mainly on 
providing seamless, global telecommunications services to business customers," 
Sprint said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were not disclosed. But executives at Sprint, which operates the 
United States' third-largest long-distance network and owns local telephone 
systems, said the Europeans might purchase a special type of Sprint stock at 
above-market prices and gain seats on Sprint's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint's merger talks with Electronic Data Systems, a Dallas-based computer 
services company, collapsed in part because of disagreement over the value of 
each company's stock. Sprint's stock rose in response to the latest news, 
climbing $1.375 to $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Any deal reached with the Europeans would face the scrutiny of U.S. and 
European regulators. "I'm sure there will be lots of inquiries," said an 
official at the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. law bars a foreign investor from directly owning 20% or more of any 
company licensed by the FCC. Indirect foreign ownership is limited to 25% and 
must be approved by the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department reportedly is negotiating changes to a similar foreign 
investment plan in which British Telecommunications proposes to buy a 20% stake 
in MCI Communications Corp. of Washington, the No. 2 long-distance carrier in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the European Community is pressing its member countries to open their 
telecommunications markets, neither France nor Germany allows competition in 
its local or long-distance telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint's move is part of a trend among phone companies worldwide to form 
alliances that can offer large companies one-stop shopping for international 
long-distance services. That market is estimated at $10 billion a year and is 
growing at a rate of 20% annually, according to some estimates.

SAUDI FLAGS ON BURGER BAGS: A BIG MACSTAKE; MARKETING: MUSLIMS COMPLAINED THAT 
MCDONALD'S WORLD CUP PACKAGING SENT KORAN VERSE TO THE TRASH BIN. 
</P>

<P>
 McDonald's inadvertently offended thousands of Muslims by printing a Koran 
scripture on its hamburger bags, then staged a retreat Tuesday after Islamic 
leaders complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The stir caused by the world's leading purveyor of fast food began with a 
World Cup promotion featuring the flags of the 24 nations competing in this 
summer's soccer championship. One of the flags was that of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 The green and white Saudi flag bears an Arabic passage that can be translated 
as "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his Prophet." Offended Muslims 
complained that such sacred words should not be crumpled up and thrown in the 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's printed 2 million of the bags, intended for take-out orders of 
children's Happy Meals at its 520 restaurants in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the declaration of faith which appears on the bag," said Iqbal Sacranie 
of the United Kingdom Action Committee on Islamic Affairs. "It is normal when 
people have used the bag they would throw it away. This would be desecration, 
and perhaps Muslims would find it offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident illustrates the pitfalls awaiting multinational corporations that 
don't do their homework before they offer products to people of starkly 
different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi ambassador to Britain, Ghazi Algosaibi, promptly expressed his 
concerns to the McDonald's vice president for marketing, John Hawkes. A Saudi 
diplomatic spokesman described the communication as "a very polite letter 
requesting the withdrawal of the bags," but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 A McDonald's spokesman, Mike Love, acknowledged Tuesday that the promotion was 
a mistake. He blamed bad advice from outside consultants. He could not 
immediately say how long it would be before the bags depicting the Saudi flag 
would stop appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen overnight," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacranie said he was satisfied with the response, even if McDonald's continues 
to distribute the bags for a while. He said he believes McDonald's made an 
honest error that was based on bad marketing recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important point is, it is a matter of recognition," Sacranie said. "They 
have understood and responded to the concerns of the Islamic community that 
this particular scripture is part of the holy Koran. I told them that when we 
are living in such a truly global age, understanding should be shown by such 
mega-companies." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's said it had been concerned ahead of time about using the Saudi flag 
and sought advice from Simon Marketing International, a consulting agency 
involved in the World Cup promotion and other McDonald's projects.

ROBIN ABACARIAN: WHEN A WOMAN JUST SAYS 'NO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Sundays

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1987, a 19-year-old female college student walked into the room of a 
20-year-old male student named Robert Berkowitz, looking for his roommate. The 
roommate wasn't home, but Berkowitz seized the opportunity of her presence to 
have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 He put her on his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "no." 
</P>
<P>
 He straddled her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "no." 
</P>
<P>
 He pulled down her sweat pants, then removed her underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "no." 
</P>
<P>
 He penetrated her. 
</P>
<P>
 She left his room in tears and immediately reported the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Was she raped? Not according to the all-male Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which 
proclaimed last week that "No" was not enough. I suppose the court, which 
upheld a lower court's decision to toss out Berkowitz's rape conviction, might 
have reinstated it if she had only screamed and fought or been badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad for her. She thought she was doing the right thing by not resisting. 
And look what she gets. "I did what we were supposed to do, what everyone 
taught us to do in college," she said. "If we were being raped, say 'No' and 
don't fight, because you could end up dead." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, she would have been the perfect rape victim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've been waiting for a case like this to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 All this spring, we were barraged by stories about various communities in a 
dither, protesting the paroles of rapists into their midsts. Concerned citizens 
decried rapists as the lowest of the low. They spoke of keeping neighborhoods 
safe from this form of human scum. 
</P>
<P>
 But something didn't feel right to me. The whiff of hypocrisy was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, support is sometimes the last thing a community gives to a woman 
who claims to have been raped, especially by someone she knows. People don't 
believe her: Maybe she was asking for it. What was she doing in his hotel room, 
anyhow? Why try to ruin a nice young man's life over one small mistake? 
</P>
<P>
 A tiresome amount of time and ink have been devoted to debunking the notion of 
"date rape." In print and on the air, date rape has been derided as an 
invention of campus feminists to excuse a woman who willingly has sex, then 
regrets it the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
 That view is attractive, I think, because it is easier to believe a woman is 
capable of lying to protect her reputation or to cover her shame than to accept 
that a young man with a bright future is capable of something we consider so 
heinous. (Never mind that women often do not physically resist because they 
believe the rapist -- that is, their friend, their acquaintance , their date -- 
will listen to them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the women of California, our state Supreme Court has a firmer 
grasp than the Pennsylvania court on what constitutes rape. Last month, the 
California court upheld the conviction of a man who raped a woman as she slept 
at a friend's house the night before her 1990 wedding. Although the rapist -- 
the fiance of a friend -- was unarmed, the woman said she was too afraid to 
struggle or cry out. Her fear, said the court, made it rape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Leanora Annette Wong of Huntington Beach was raped and murdered. 
Police have arrested three-time convicted rapist Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., a 
man she met in a bar. Morgan was accused of a fourth rape in 1993, but 
prosecutors did not file charges because, they said, the woman gave police 
inconsistent statements. 
</P>
<P>
 In its coverage of the Wong case, The Times interviewed sociologist Gary 
LaFree, author of "Rape and Criminal Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 LaFree was asked about the challenges of prosecuting rape cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases involving strangers were easiest, he said. Cases involving 
acquaintances, which turn on whether consent was given, are the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best predictors or verdicts in our data," LaFree said, "had to do with 
our victims' moral character. If the victim had been drinking or using drugs, 
or had been having sex outside marriage -- or was even assumed to have been 
doing those things -- they were less likely to get convictions. Even things 
like a gun were less important than the victim's moral character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everybody involved in the system is operating on stereotypes. They're 
looking for stranger cases, they're looking for squeaky-clean victims, they're 
looking for cases where an offender breaks into a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County deputy district attorney who declined to prosecute Morgan in 
that fourth rape case last year agreed with LaFree that it's much harder to 
prove rape when the assailant knows the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell juries that a woman always has a right to say no," he said, 
"but that doesn't always fly." 
</P>
<P>
 I like an idea advanced in 1992 by the New Jersey Supreme Court. The question, 
said the court, is not whether a woman said "no." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether a woman said "yes."

NEWPORT PAIR, 2 OTHERS KILLED IN FLORIDA AIR CRASH

<P>
 A Newport Beach man and woman were killed Tuesday, along with a South Pasadena 
couple, when their small plane flying through heavy thunderstorms crashed in an 
orange grove, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot and owner of the twin-engine Beechcraft was Jack A. George, 63, of 
Newport Beach, according to his son, Tobin George of South Pasadena. The names 
of the others, all in their 60s, had not been released. 
</P>
<P>
 George said his father, who was divorced, was traveling with a female friend 
from Newport Beach and friends from Pasadena, all of whom he declined to 
identify until relatives were notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack George, a retired defense contractor originally from South Pasadena, had 
filed a flight plan for a trip from the Tallahassee suburb of Havana to Key 
West, said Mary Ann Cassano, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation 
Administration in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane went down between Bowling Green and Wauchula. Air traffic 
controllers in Miami had lost both communications and radar contact with the 
aircraft, which was then southeast of Lakeland, about 3 p.m. EDT, Cassano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic controllers contacted local law enforcement to alert them to an 
airplane in distress after the pilot advised them he needed to make an 
emergency landing, said sheriff's Capt. Arnold Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 4 p.m., he said, "we started receiving calls from residents in 
the area where the plane went down of plane parts in their yard." 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries on the ground were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, assisted by a helicopter from a local television station, searched 
for the crash site, which was found an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that at the particular time he was lost from radar, there was 
an area of thunderstorms in the route of the flight," Cassano said. "That's not 
to say that that was the cause, but it's a weather condition that was prevalent 
at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft went down in a drainage ditch between orange groves, Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating, Cassano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack George had owned the plane for 20 years, according to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably the most immaculately maintained aircraft you would ever 
find," said Tobin George, 35. "It was his pride and joy. It was perfect."

SIGNS OF FIRE SEASON; ABOUT 165,000 ACRES OF TINDER-LIKE, OPEN LAND WILL BE 
CLOSED FRIDAY UNTIL RAINS RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the days growing hotter and wild brush growing drier, Orange County fire 
officials on Friday will declare more than 165,000 acres of open land 
off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the county's annual fire season means that hikers, campers, 
bikers and nature lovers must stay out of certain grassy areas until the rainy 
season returns. Fires can be triggered easily by an illegal campfire, fireworks 
or a simple spark from a starting car, County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a fire starts in the middle of nowhere, it could spread 100 acres before 
anyone is able to call 911," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, one of the longest and most disastrous fire seasons in Orange 
County history, proved how easily and quickly fire can destroy, Young said. 
Three arson fires, fueled by Santa Ana winds, ravaged parts of Laguna Beach and 
unincorporated areas near Anaheim Hills and off Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 27 Laguna Beach fire roared over more than 16,000 acres and damaged 
or destroyed more than 400 homes in Laguna Beach, Canyon Acres, Emerald Bay and 
the El Moro Beach Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ortega Highway fire, which was the largest and longest of the season, also 
started on Oct. 27 and lasted for four days. It burned an estimated 22,000 
acres and destroyed 36 homes along the rural eastern edge of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A North County fire started in Anaheim Hills late on Oct. 26 and spread to the 
unincorporated community of Crest de Ville, destroying two homes and damaging 
29 more. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been arrested in connection with the Laguna Beach and Ortega 
Highway fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is acting suspicious in the bushes near your home and there are 40 
m.p.h. winds," Young urged, "call the Fire Department or the police." 
</P>
<P>
 County crews already have been busy clearing dry brush in many danger areas, 
and the Fire Department has conducted a series of controlled burns over about 
20,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews also have checked thousands of homes for dry brush and sent warning 
notices to some homeowners who are in violation of the county's fire code. If 
they do not remove the brush, county crews will, and the homeowner will be 
billed between $350 and $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said firefighters are hoping for the best this fire season, but 
preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, firefighters throughout the county will begin a series of 
training exercises and drills to prepare for the possibility of battling 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 1, the county also will have its own firefighting helicopter.  
</P>
<P>
 "The helicopter isn't going to make a difference when you have a fire the size 
of Laguna, but it makes a difference when that fire is still one acre," Young 
said. "All three of the major fires we had last year were an eighth of an acre 
at one point. The helicopter can keep them at an acre." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the unusually strong winds like those that fueled the October 
fires, Young said, fire in brush land always poses a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because there's not 70-m.p.h. winds doesn't mean the world is roses," 
Young said. "We could easily have a fire that burns 1,000 acres and a dozen 
homes without any winds or unusual weather conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The following areas will be closed to the public beginning Friday:  
</P>
<P>
 Area 1 -- North of Brea to the county line; between the Brea city limits and 
the Yorba Linda wildlife-urban area, including Chino Hills State Park; and east 
of the Yorba Linda wildlife-urban area to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 Area 2 -- South from the Riverside Freeway to O'Neill Regional Park; west from 
the Cleveland National Forest boundary to the following limits: Anaheim Hills 
city limits, Tustin city limits, Irvine city limits, and Irvine Boulevard and 
Trabuco Road in Lake Forest; east of Rose Canyon to the Cleveland National 
Forest boundary; east of Dove Canyon to the Cleveland National Forest; east of 
Coto de Caza to the Cleveland National Forest; urban-wildlife areas between 
Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza and Dove Canyon and from the southern tip 
of Coto de Caza south to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, west from the Cleveland National Forest boundary to the following 
limits: Mission Viejo city limits, San Juan Capistrano city limits and San 
Clemente city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park is open except for the area between Ortega 
Highway and Lucas Canyon Road. Also included are the following areas inside 
Cleveland National Forest: Silverado Canyon, Williams Canyon, Modjeska Canyon 
and Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Area 3 -- South of Bonita Canyon Drive, San Canyon Avenue and the San Diego 
Freeway to Coast Highway; west of Laguna Canyon Road to the Newport Beach 
(Corona del Mar) city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Area 4 -- East of Laguna Canyon Road to Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park; 
south of Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the Laguna Beach city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 County employees also will begin posting warning signs in forbidden areas 
today. Although violators probably will escape with a verbal warning this 
weekend, authorities will be able to hand out misdemeanor citations to people 
who venture into areas off-limits as of Friday. Potential Fire Areas Orange 
County's fire season is here. To help prevent wildfires, more than 165,000 
acres of open land have been declared off-limits to the public. The Orange 
County Fire Department will prohibit trespassing in the following shaded areas: 
* Safety Suggestions Fire officials offer these fire-safety rules for visitors 
to wilderness areas ad parks: Use fire rings and barbecue pits for open fires. 
Do not smoke in hazardous areas. Keep matches and cigarette lighters away from 
children. Do not discharge fireworks in wilderness areas. Clear branches and 
tree debris a minimum of 10 feet from all chimneys. Provide spark arrester on 
all chimneys Clear roof of all combustible leaves and needles. Make sure 
address is posted and clearly visible from the street. Clear combustible 
vegetation such as dry weeds, brush and leaves 100 feet or more from house. 
Maintain clear access. Source: Orange County Fire Department

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; LOCAL ELECTIONS / SUPERVISORS; THREE RUNNING NECK AND 
NECK IN 2ND DISTRICT; SILVA, TILLOTSON AND MOULTON PATTERSON FIGHT FOR TWO 
SPOTS IN NOVEMBER RUNOFF VOTE WHOSE WINNER WILL SUCCEED RETIRING WIEDER.

 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson and Councilman Jim Silva were 
running in a virtual dead heat with businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson late 
Tuesday night as they battled for two places in a runoff for the northwest 
Orange County Board of Supervisors seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Supervisor William G. Steiner and state Sen. Marian Bergeson romped 
to easy victories in supervisorial races in their North and South County 
districts respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Huntington Beach, home of all three front-runners for the 2nd District 
post being vacated by retiring Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, early returns 
left the race too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday night, Silva was holding a slim lead over colleague Moulton 
Patterson, but Tillotson remained very much in contention, separated from the 
top by a narrow margin, according to results from a third of the precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rankings hold, Moulton Patterson would position herself as the first 
Democrat with a shot at securing a seat on the Board of Supervisors in 15 
years. But she would have to defeat Silva, a Republican, in a Nov. 8 runoff, 
which already is forecast to be a particularly bitter contest for the 
nonpartisan seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very negative campaign where (the Republicans) will 
attempt to tear down my record," Moulton Patterson said Tuesday night, already 
looking forward to the fall campaign. "We've already seen this. I don't know 
how many votes money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who can expect an infusion of Republican funding for a runoff after 
being outspent in the primary, said he was hopeful of retaining a spot for the 
November showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just hope you can hang on," Silva said from a party at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tillotson, a failure to make the runoff would prove to be an expensive 
early exit, as she has loaned her own campaign $342,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson paced nervously in her 16th-floor suite at the Westin South Coast 
Plaza hotel as early returns showed her in third place in the tight three-way 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel with the campaign we ran we should be victorious," she said, 
adding that it was too soon to predict the outcome since the votes from her 
strongholds -- Huntington Beach and Seal Beach -- had not yet been tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tillotson conceded that she had expected to beat Moulton Patterson in 
the absentee balloting and was surprised by the mayor's strong showing in the 
second spot behind Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 The three contenders emerged from a field of five candidates who also included 
Huntington Beach businessman John A. Thomas and former Garden Grove Councilman 
Raymond Thomas Littrell, both of whom trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different story in the other supervisor contests: Steiner declared an 
easy victory over Anaheim college Prof. Phillip L. Knypstra just minutes after 
the first absentee totals were reported. Bergeson, a three-term state senator 
from Newport Beach who ran unopposed, also wrapped up an early victory to 
succeed retiring Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in South County's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a vote of confidence for the job I've done, since I was 
appointed last year by Gov. Wilson," Steiner said from a campaign party at the 
Orange County Mining Co. Restaurant in Orange. "It's a lot better to be elected 
than appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bergeson: "My (race) looks pretty good. I've been in both kinds of 
campaigns and this is more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 With three open seats on the board, Tuesday's election marks the beginning of 
a substantial change in membership and political style on the staunchly 
conservative five-member panel that governs California's third-largest county. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley will retire in December after 20 years representing the sprawling South 
County district. And Wieder, the board's first female member, whose pending 
retirement has created the vacancy in the 2nd District, will leave after more 
than 15 years.

SIX GRADUATES HURT AS GUNFIRE ERUPTS AT PARTY; VIOLENCE: ATTACKERS FIRE AT THE 
VENICE HOME OF AN HONORS STUDENT. INCIDENT IS THE SECOND IN THREE DAYS IN WHICH 
A GRADUATION GATHERING ENDS IN SHOOTING. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time in three days, a high school graduation party ended in a 
rain of bullets as gunmen wearing bandannas shot up a Venice gathering early 
Tuesday, injuring six graduates outside the home of an honors student. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, who graduated Monday night from St. Monica's High School in Santa 
Monica, were shot in the legs and arms and one was hit in the side. By Tuesday 
afternoon, four had been treated and released from hospitals. Two others were 
reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had no motive, but said the students may have been randomly chosen 
victims in a yearlong war between local black and Latino gangs that has left at 
least 13 people dead and besieged a nearby section of Venice. Two or three 
masked attackers, who fired at least 30 rounds from semiautomatic weapons as 
they drove past in a pickup truck, were described as black men, while four of 
the victims are Latinos and two are white, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one at the party was affiliated with gangs, said police, who speculated 
that the victims may have been singled out only because of their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's shooting at the house across from the Penmar Recreation 
Center, the gang war had been confined mainly to neighboring Oakwood, about 
half a mile away, and a housing project more than two miles away, near Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's host, 18-year-old Eugene Travnikoff, said he had left to get food 
as the gathering was breaking up about 3:30 a.m. By the time he returned, he 
found ambulances arriving to take away his wounded classmates -- four young men 
and a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the worst," Travnikoff said. "I thought everybody was dead or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who gathered at the home later said witnesses told them shots were 
fired from a pickup truck and a car. At least two students were wounded as they 
ran to help friends who had been shot. Among the injured students were two 
honors graduates and a professional skateboarder whose leg was shattered in the 
incident, according to friends and school officials. Police would not release 
the names of the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the house bore several bullet holes and there was a chunk missing 
from a basketball backboard. Friends who just the night before had donned green 
graduation gowns now wore hospital passes that allowed them to visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go from graduating -- a big moment -- to not knowing what happened to 
your best friends," said Travnikoff, sleepless and shaken by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy follows an incident Sunday that left two dead and seven injured 
when youths with semiautomatic weapons opened fire on an end-of-school party in 
San Marino. Unlike the highly advertised San Marino party, police said, the 
informal Venice get-together was a quiet affair. About a dozen people were 
outside when the shooting occurred, and Travnikoff said his parents were at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hanging out -- kicking it," said Salvador Lomeli, a classmate. "We 
were fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident shocked officials at the 600-student Catholic school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a beautiful ceremony, " said Sister Cheryl Milner, the principal. 
"It's tragic to have something like this juxtaposed with such a wonderful 
evening."

ANTI-GANG AGENCY GIVEN $2.5 MILLION; BUDGET: CITY COUNCIL FAILS TO OVERRIDE 
RIORDAN VETO, GUARANTEEING FUNDING FOR FLEDGLING HOPE IN YOUTH ORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The upstart Hope in Youth anti-gang organization won a $2.5-million 
appropriation Tuesday from the Los Angeles City Council, which rejected demands 
that the fledgling organization be forced to compete for funds with more 
experienced social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The council failed by three votes to override a budget veto by Mayor Richard 
Riordan that guaranteed Hope in Youth funding, while leaving other groups that 
work with young people to fight for a portion of another $2.5-million 
appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over Hope in Youth created a rancorous final chapter in the city's 
budget debate, with opposing camps packing the council chamber and jeering one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote in favor of the church-based anti-gang program -- whose backers come 
from 10 religious denominations and include Cardinal Roger M. Mahony -- was the 
lone victory for Riordan during a four-hour budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
 On 11 other votes, the City Council mustered the two-thirds majority required 
to override mayoral vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
 In its veto overrides, the council: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expanded hours or services at parks and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Added an extra street-sweeping crew to clean an extra 100 "curb-miles" of 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expanded the number of animal control officers by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raised spending to recruit more women police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approved funds to speed preparation of environmental impact reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to arm City Hall security officers with pistols and 
added two artist-calligraphers to make commendations and plaques at the behest 
of council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had used his veto last week to pare back most of those programs and to 
eliminate a few. His aides on Tuesday reiterated his concern that the council 
overrides leave the city with an inadequate reserve of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to put things back in (the budget) if you don't find the revenue 
to pay for them," said Bill McCarley, the mayor's chief of staff. "The council 
has said, 'We will take the risk that the reserve fund will be adequate.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But council members argued that the added programs were significant enough to 
risk a relatively small reduction in the reserve fund. "These programs are in 
areas that people will actually notice in their lives," Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heated debate of the budget session revolved around Hope in Youth, an 
echo of the controversy that has surrounded the group since it leaped to 
prominence a year ago by winning a total of more than $5 million from the city 
and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had fulfilled a pledge from his campaign when he included an unusual 
$5-million line item in his budget for the program, doubling the funding the 
city had provided a year earlier. But the City Council amended the budget to 
force Hope in Youth to compete for the funds, along with other youth service 
agencies. Riordan, in turn, vetoed the council action and proposed a 
$2.5-million guarantee for Hope in Youth and a competition for the remaining 
$2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for Tuesday's contest, in which several other community 
activists complained about what they said is favoritism for Hope in Youth. The 
vote was eight in favor of funding the agency and seven against. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton Alphonse, who has been running an anti-gang program on Crenshaw 
Boulevard since 1985, said he is threatened with closure after the loss of 
$25,000 in funding from the county and $100,000 from the city during the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been struggling for years to keep my doors open," said Alphonse, who 
heads the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation. "Then one group with no 
history of effectiveness gets all this money, without letting other groups 
compete for it. . . . That just doesn't seem fair." 
</P>
<P>
 T.J. Bottoms, pastor of All Peoples Christian Church, said his church and 
youth center has been serving the community for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Hope in Youth is a good idea and has outstanding potential," Bottoms 
said. "But institutions that have been around as long as us, who have weathered 
all the storms, are being ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph (Rockhead) Johnson, a former Compton Crips gang member and now 
coordinator with the Amer-I-Can anti-gang program, added: "One group shouldn't 
automatically be given the biggest piece of the pie." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hope in Youth organizers argued that the $5 million designated for 
anti-gang programs never would have existed if they had not launched their 
campaign for public funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is $5 million that was not there before," said the Rev. William R. 
Johnson, pastor of Curry Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in 
Compton. "And the $2.5 million available to other organizations is $2.5 million 
that wasn't there before. This is new funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Negrete, a chairman of Hope in Youth and a Chicano studies professor at 
Cal State L.A. said the new organization is the only one with a plan large 
enough to deal with mushrooming gang membership. "For years the gang violence 
has been getting worse and worse," Negrete said. "Whatever was being done in 
the past obviously wasn't enough. Something new was needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The antipathy in the debate was heightened by events in the week leading up to 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers from one of the community organizations supporting Hope in Youth -- the 
Southern California Organizing Committee -- lashed out at Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas for his opposition to the program. One described Ridley-Thomas as 
supporting "anti-Catholic, anti-white and anti-Latino" views. A church bulletin 
at one parish said that Ridley-Thomas had insulted "the church and the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow lawmakers defended the South-Central Los Angeles councilman, who is 
black. Councilwoman Rita Walters called the flyers "character assassination." 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said they were blasphemous. And Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter accused Hope in Youth supporters of smear tactics and intimidation -- 
noting that hundreds of backers of the organization had threatened to picket 
Ridley-Thomas's home. 
</P>
<P>
 That demonstration, however, was called off when Ridley-Thomas staged a rally 
of his own on his front lawn an hour before the Hope in Youth demonstration was 
to begin. The councilman had gathered twice as many people as the Hope in Youth 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting for the special appropriation for Hope in Youth were council members 
Richard Alarcon, Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, John Ferraro, Hal Bernson, 
Rudy Svorinich Jr., Joel Wachs and Yaroslavsky. Voting against were council 
members Laura Chick, Nate Holden, Marvin Braude, Galanter, Ridley-Thomas, 
Walters and Goldberg.

A DOCTOR IN DANGER; PHYSICIAN SAYS HE HAS HEALED HIMSELF, BUT PAST DRUG USE 
IMPERILS HIS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The night his girlfriend died in his bed of a massive cocaine overdose, Dr. 
Stan Azen's long affair with drugs finally capsized his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran emergency-room physician later was arrested and convicted of 
possessing cocaine. His $400,000 home was seized under federal anti-drug laws. 
And he admitted in a public hearing that he was an addict who had abused drugs 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Azen managed to cling to his career. He swore off cocaine, enrolled at the 
Betty Ford Center and passed numerous random drug tests. Meanwhile, he worked 
at two San Fernando Valley hospitals that serve many low-income people, earning 
high praise from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely one of the best ER physicians I have ever known. . . . He is 
a kind, compassionate physician in the best sense," said Dr. Jonathan Serebrin, 
emergency room chief at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, where Azen 
worked for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last month, nearly four years after his girlfriend's death, the 
Medical Board of California opened trial-like hearings that could cost Azen, 
42, his license to practice. The board charges, among other things, that he 
gave his girlfriend cocaine the night she died, that he was under the influence 
of drugs and alcohol when he tried to resuscitate her and that he continued to 
buy, sell and use drugs after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen denies the allegations. And in an unusual twist, he is drawing vocal 
support from other doctors who believe he is clean and sober and should be 
allowed to keep caring for poor and minority patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems inappropriate to remove a . . . board-certified, American-trained 
physician from a population that rarely has access to such quality of care and 
competence," said Dr. Val Warhaft, who heads emergency care at Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley, a Sun Valley facility that treats many poor Latinos and 
where Azen worked until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azen's case poses a dilemma for the medical board, which must decide how 
severely to punish an admitted one-time drug abuser who also is seen as 
dedicated to helping a clientele often underserved by medical professionals. 
The board can revoke Azen's license, suspend it or place him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen says he has not touched drugs in three years and no longer desires to. He 
insists that his years of drug abuse never affected patients. And he is angry 
the board is trying to punish him, rather than place him in a diversion 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his girlfriend's 1990 death, Azen has been buried under an avalanche of 
legal and personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 His former Westside home and his Jeep Cherokee were seized under 
asset-forfeiture laws, although the Jeep was later returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration revoked his certificate of 
registration, a crucial permit for emergency room physicians to prescribe 
pain-killing narcotics such as codeine. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said in a written decision that it was "inconsistent with the 
public interest" to let Azen keep his certificate because of his history of 
drug abuse, including his admitted use of cocaine with his girlfriend on the 
night she died. 
</P>
<P>
 The revocation cost Azen his job at Pacifica Hospital, which he had held since 
September, 1991. Before that, his arrest and ensuing legal difficulties had 
cost him jobs at the Medical Center of North Hollywood and at Westside 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings last year that led to the loss of his DEA license, Azen, who now 
lives in Sherman Oaks, testified that he began experimenting with marijuana and 
cocaine in the 1970s and became a regular cocaine user in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Loma Linda University medical school, Azen was hired in 1982 at 
Medical Center of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, he was working up to 90 hours a week, earning $240,000 a year. And 
there was a romantic bonus: He had met a hospital auditor, Donna Lynn Miller, 
who soon moved in with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a fat paycheck and a high-stress job, Azen also had become a serious 
cocaine user, snorting up to two grams a day, according to his DEA testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen denied taking drugs on the job. But a friend told state investigators the 
physician had a "high tolerance" for cocaine and used it to stay awake during 
his long hours at work. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller moved in, Azen's house became a gathering spot for several of 
their friends who often barbecued, played volleyball and used drugs together 
"for days on end," Azen testified. He said he supplied some cocaine for the 
parties. "We were kind of like a little family together," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the night of Sept. 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 After he came home from work, Azen said, he and Miller snorted cocaine, smoked 
marijuana and had a couple of drinks apiece. Then they made love and went to 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen told police that Miller later got up and went to the bathroom. But when 
she returned to bed, she had two seizures and lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Miller, but she did 
not respond. He later dialed 911. By the time paramedics arrived, Miller, 28, 
was dead. A pathologist estimated that she had ingested 20 times a fatal dose 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Azen described Miller as an addict who had "a death wish" and 
once tried to kill herself. At the time of her death, he said, she was drinking 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said that although he and Miller had used cocaine together in the past, 
he did not supply her drugs on the night she died. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were filed against Azen in connection with Miller's death. 
But in April, 1991, he was arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to her 
sister. Police said they searched his home and turned up 61 grams of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen later was convicted of possessing cocaine. He was sentenced to six months 
in jail and three years probation, requiring him to submit to random drug 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by Miller's death and his legal problems, Azen said he decided to stop 
using drugs. He enrolled in a Los Angeles outpatient clinic of the Betty Ford 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A county probation officer testified at the DEA hearing that from December, 
1991, to December, 1992, Azen passed 22 random drug tests. Azen said he has 
since passed more. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials argue that the issue is not whether Azen is drug-free now, 
but whether he broke drug laws and made serious errors of medical judgment in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert McKim Bell, who is prosecuting Azen, said he 
was negligent in not seeking help for his addiction and for continuing to treat 
patients while addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Azen broke the law by providing drugs to Miller and others. And by 
giving cocaine to Miller, who had a history of seizures, Azen risked her health 
because the drug has seizure-inducing properties, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell also said Azen performed CPR on Miller while impaired by drugs and 
alcohol, and waited 30 minutes after she stopped breathing before dialing 911 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he had eaten dinner and slept before Miller's seizure and was sober. 
He said he did not call 911 because the phone was in the kitchen, several rooms 
away. Getting to it would have meant stopping CPR, which is not supposed to be 
interrupted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only days before the medical board hearings began, Azen lost his third job 
when he was terminated at Pacifica Hospital because he did not have a DEA 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the DEA revoked his permit March 3, he continued to practice at the 
hospital without it until May 15. Azen said patients were not endangered 
because he still could get narcotic medications from the hospital pharmacy, 
which has its own DEA certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica Executive Director Ermanno Mariani said Azen was dismissed because he 
could not do his job properly without the license. But he added that Azen was a 
good doctor whom he would take back if his legal problems are resolved -- a 
sentiment echoed by others at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a mostly Latino neighborhood, Pacifica is a small community 
hospital and may be best known as the place Rodney King was treated after he 
was beaten by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is a poor one, and Pacifica's busy emergency room could double as a 
set for "St. Elsewhere." More than 1,400 sick people are seen there each month. 
Among them are a hefty share of gang members with bullet or knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their colleagues who practice in more leisurely surroundings, ER 
doctors describe what they do as "gut medicine" -- making snap decisions in 
life-or-death situations. And among Pacifica's ER physicians, Azen is known as 
a gut-medicine star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard other doctors call him a doctor's doctor," said Warhaft, Azen's 
former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably one of the 10 or 20 best clinicians in the country," said Dr. 
Rick Key, another Pacifica ER physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Key recalled one Azen patient who had overdosed on digitalis, a heart 
stimulant. The man's heart was beating in a rapid, uncoordinated way, a 
potentially lethal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen tried the standard treatment, electroshock paddles, but the man's heart 
kept convulsing wildly. Switching strategy, Azen injected him with a big dose 
of potassium, stopping the heart. Then, using a pacemaker, Azen restarted it, 
and its beat returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as brilliant as you'll ever see in medicine, to do that on the spot," 
said Key. 
</P>
<P>
 Key and Warhaft said they never saw Azen impaired at work and would love to 
see him return. The medical board action against him, they said, does not make 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is spending bread in the six figures to, if they succeed, 
remove a very good doctor from doing good work in a charity area," said Key. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan liked working in a third-world hospital and doing things for people who 
otherwise would never have the chance . . . That's what makes this even worse."

GAME WARDEN REPORT BLAMES POLICE FOR BEAR'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES and LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State game wardens, previously blamed by Azusa police in the May 20 shooting 
death of a California black bear, contend that it was the police who were eager 
to shoot an obviously drugged and groggy animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa police failed to shout and honk their horns when asked to do so by game 
wardens, and repeated several times their intention to shoot the animal even 
when it was within the safety zone and growing groggy from tranquilizer darts, 
said a May 31 report on the incident by the California Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the report, obtained by animal activists, followed the creation 
Monday night of an Azusa city wildlife commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressured by those protesting what they called the unnecessary killing of the 
356-pound animal that wandered onto city streets, the Azusa City Council on 
Monday night voted to set up a Wildlife Response Policy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is to set guidelines on handling forays by wild animals into 
the city, which abuts the foothills of Angeles National Forest. It is to be 
made up of city officials, Police Department representatives, animal activists 
and representatives of various wildlife organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Henry Garcia said he is trying to schedule the first 
meeting this month and is hoping to have a model policy in place within a month 
of that meeting. Commission members also will discuss the possibility of 
establishing an 800 number or 24-hour hot line for these kinds of situations, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear was killed by 14 shots fired by four police officers after it left a 
containment area set up by police. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report, Azusa police said wildlife officials were slow to respond, 
lacked the proper equipment and made a mistake by using two tranquilizer darts 
with smaller doses instead of one larger dose. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fish and Game report appeared to contradict the police version of 
events, Azusa police said the state report is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there was conflict (between game wardens and police)," said Azusa 
Police Capt. John Broderick. "We had two different agencies looking at it from 
two different perspectives. Fish and Game were looking to save the bear. Police 
wanted to save the bear but also had to consider community safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Game report admitted that game wardens lacked a needle long 
enough to fill the tranquilizer darts, but said the equipment was later 
obtained and the darts were emptied into the bear. It defended the decision to 
use two darts and portrayed police officers as uncooperative and eager to shoot 
when they could have shooed the bear into a cul de sac for capture. 
</P>
<P>
 One game warden yelled at officers not to shoot the animal and another was 
told to get out of the line of fire when he stood between a rifle-toting 
officer and the bear, according to the report.

PREACHER'S FUNERAL MIRRORS HIS SPIRIT; MEMORIALS: THOUSANDS ATTEND SERVICE FOR 
EVANGELIST ROBERT W. MCMURRAY, RECALLING HIM WITH SINGING AND DANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, Pentecostal preacher Robert W. McMurray needed all that space that 
he spent three decades carefully assembling in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge church pulpit that he built was crowded with more than two dozen 
clergymen from across the United States. His sprawling sanctuary's 2,000 seats 
were filled by a gathering that spilled outside into a large tent and filled 
two other meeting halls down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hoover Street -- which bisects the four city blocks that he purchased to 
turn into an innovative housing project -- was closed down, lined with cars and 
filled with knots of people talking quietly about McMurray and his vision for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 church members, political officials and religious leaders 
gathered Tuesday at the Greater Bethany Community Church to mourn McMurray, 67, 
who died May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers were there to honor McMurray as a bishop of Pentecostal 
Assemblies of the World, as pastor of the church that grew from 119 members to 
more than 5,000, and as a spirited evangelist who helped create 16 other 
churches in Southern California along with more than 50 specialized ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians remembered him as an open-minded man who opened his church to 
them and opened his heart to those in need -- organizing a relief effort that 
fed 2,500 families for weeks after the 1992 riots, providing living quarters 
for men recovering from alcoholism and creating the Greater Bethany Economic 
Development Corp. to start construction of 115 units of affordable family 
housing near the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members remembered him as a unique spiritual counselor. And as a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took me in, almost as a son," said Kevin Williams, 31, a music producer 
who has attended the church for 15 years. "He provided the vision for me to 
keep a level head. I could have very easily taken the gang path." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray sought peace between warring gangs and often invited gang members to 
the church in hopes of teaching them "how to be gentlemen." Apostolic Church 
Bishop Arthur Brazier of Chicago said he once asked McMurray, who was visiting, 
to please not walk on the new pews that Brazier had installed in his remodeled 
church sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said all right. But in the middle of the service he jumped up on them and 
stopped and flashed a big smile at me." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray enlivened his Sunday services with his singing and dancing, said Lois 
Johnson, an associate minister at Bethany. He walked around as he preached, 
sometimes stopping to pick up a fussing baby from the congregation. Once, she 
said, he surprised teen-agers by showing up at one of their roller-skating 
parties -- on skates. 
</P>
<P>
 State Controller Gray Davis said McMurray had kidded him about Davis' lack of 
rhythm. "He'd say: 'You can't dance. But you can write checks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd in the sanctuary, the tent and the two meeting halls leaped to its 
feet when Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said she wanted to see some 
dancing at McMurray's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he was feisty. He was his own man," Waters said. "He dared to build this 
church. He dared to build this block, to build this community." 
</P>
<P>
 The service lasted five hours and was followed by burial at Forest Lawn in 
Glendale. McMurray is survived by his wife, Jeannette, three daughters and a 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bowers, presiding bishop for Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, said 
those who did not know McMurray might have been puzzled by the singing and 
dancing. "Pardon my language, but it ain't what's wrong with us. It's what 
right with us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers said the congregation and the clergy were painfully aware of the loss 
McMurray's death represents. "We know what's happened," he said, "but we're 
looking beyond this." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert McMurray would have understood.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
JUDGE VOIDS 1992 ELECTION CREATING SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a severe blow to the city of San Gabriel's attempts to move ahead with a 
unified school district, a Superior Court judge has ruled that a 1992 election 
that created the district was unconstitutional because it did not include 
voters from Alhambra whose children would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, released this week by Judge Diane Wayne, found that the state 
Board of Education's decision to limit voting to residents of the 3,218-student 
San Gabriel Elementary School District violated the constitutional rights of 
the residents of the Alhambra school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's order, which declares the election null and void, restores the 
authority of the Alhambra school district to enroll high school students from 
San Gabriel. Alhambra officials were elated with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court ruling vindicates us; it says, 'Yeah, you were right,' " said Heber 
Meeks, superintendent of the 21,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said parents with incoming ninth-graders should enroll their children at 
San Gabriel High School in the Alhambra district just as they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel has existed as a unified school district for two years. It has 
hired teachers, modernized buildings and prepared to enroll high school 
students this fall at temporary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent of the San Gabriel district was not available Tuesday for 
comment. Other officials declined to comment. School board officials could not 
be reached.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CULVER CITY; $30,000 
REWARD OFFERED IN OFFICER'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detectives on Tuesday asked for help locating a suspect in the February 
shooting of a Culver City police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Harold Eugene Taylor, 27, of Los Angeles is often in the 
South-Central neighborhood around Florence and Vermont avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've exhausted all our leads in trying to locate him," said Culver City 
Detective Jon West. "There's up to a $30,000 reward offered for the arrest or 
conviction of anyone involved in the shooting of the officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Travis Marschall was shot in the throat while pursuing suspects in a 
Culver City robbery Feb. 19. He is recovering from injuries that affected his 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who is wanted in Nevada for a parole violation, is described as 6 feet 
tall, 150 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He is considered armed and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other suspects remain in the Los Angeles County Jail awaiting preliminary 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph McAdams, 37, of Los Angeles is being held without bail. Alcoa Cooke, 
21, of Hawthorne is being held on $1 million bail. Both were charged with armed 
robbery and attempted murder of a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have recovered property linking the suspects to a series of robberies 
and carjackings in which victims were followed to their homes and attacked.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SCHOOL 
BOARD OPENS TALKS WITH KEY UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education opened contracts talks with its influential 
employee unions this week, setting the stage for arduous decisions this summer 
over whether the district can pay for school reform programs as well employee 
salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles has demanded that the district restore a 10% 
salary reduction that was imposed last year amid massive budget cuts.Other 
employee unions, including those representing clerical workers and school 
police, are also seeking various levels of salary restoration packages. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members and Supt. Sid Thompson said salary increases are a top 
priority, but are not optimistic that they will be fully restored soon. In a 
budget report Monday, Thompson recommended that the district spend $8.1 million 
to fund reform efforts such as LEARN and the district's new financial 
accounting system.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY SAYS COUPLE'S HOME VIOLATES CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city this week filed a complaint against the owners of a Tudor 
castle-style home in the Ranch village, charging that the 12-year-old 
remodeling project violates a variety of building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes about a month after city building inspectors armed with search 
warrants spent an hour taking photos inside the unfinished home, which has been 
the subject of numerous neighborhood protests and heated public meetings.The 
city says its goal is to get the owners, Fern and Victor Ganish, to complete 
work on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes live in the house even though the interior is not completed. The 
Ganishes have said that flooring, drywall and plumbing still need to be 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed Monday in Harbor Municipal Court, claims that the 
Ganishes have violated seven municipal codes, including building, height and 
safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes have denied the allegations. They claim city officials harassed 
them and held their project to an unfairly high standard. Fern Ganish has 
blamed the slow pace of construction on city interference and her husband's 
poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment in the case is scheduled for next week. If found to be in 
violation of the codes, the Ganishes could face thousands of dollars in fines 
and up to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said the city's main goal is to have the 
Ganishes complete work on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we want to get them to bring the structure up to living condition," 
Brady said. "We don't want to chase them out of their house or have them tear 
it down. We are just asking that it not be in violation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes began converting the one-story ranch-style house into a two-story 
Tudor castle in the early 1980s.SHELBY GRAD

 With the opening of the city's newest park last week, basketball and sand 
volleyball enthusiasts each have access to a fifth playing court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Breeze Park, at 32311 1/2 Charles Road, is the first area park to be 
dedicated since the city was incorporated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the sand volleyball court and basketball court, the 1.7-acre park 
also has two playgrounds -- one for tots and one for older children -- and four 
picnic tables.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VOLUNTEERS RISE AGAIN IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtually nonexistent during Soviet rule, volunteerism is once again emerging 
in Russia, thanks in part to the growth of democracy in that country, according 
to the executive director of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County, who 
visited Moscow last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a less suspicious government, nonprofit groups and charitable 
organizations have blossomed over the past few years, Carol Stone said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said that the need for Russians to volunteer is even greater now because 
the market reforms that accompanied the birth of democracy have wreaked havoc 
on the lives of the Russian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common to see pensioners selling eyeglasses, a pencil, or any item -- 
just to eat," said Stone, who spent May in Moscow as a member of a team that 
trained volunteers and managers of volunteer organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Agency for International Development paid for the Moscow trip, which 
was coordinated by the Points of Light Foundation and the Moscow Charity House, 
a volunteer center in Russia, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Claire Martin, director of special groups development for the Points 
of Light Foundation, conducted workshops and developed a volunteer management 
workbook that will later be translated into Russian and published there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest need is to develop a system that will provide a structured way 
for strategic and financial planning," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts on volunteerism will arrive in Moscow later this year and next 
to help the Russians learn how to plan, raise money and use volunteers more 
effectively, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteerism was part of the Russian tradition," Stone said. "But during the 
Communist regime, it was coercion. You (didn't) volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian immigrant who now owns a consulting business in Irvine said that 
nonprofit groups are emerging in Russia because people feel a new sense of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there is the beginning of democracy, nonprofit and charitable 
organizations are showing up," said Boris I. Gurevich, a director of the 
Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. But he said most Russians are still 
cynical about any organized social service effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, every organized effort was done by the government," said 
Gurevich, who came to the United States in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Russian people will need the help of charitable organizations 
because of continuing economic dislocation in his former homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time of guaranteed income for everybody is gone," Gurevich said. "Now, 
people have to work two to three jobs just to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The typical Russian volunteer is about age 60 and is a former doctor, lawyer 
or engineer who is "extremely frustrated by the chaos and wants things to get 
better," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some volunteer because they can receive additional food or clothing from the 
groups they work for, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer Stone met in Moscow, Nina Milakova, 72, is a former doctor who now 
lives alone in a tiny apartment. She helps distribute clothing, food and 
medical equipment to people in her apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, a former teacher who taught for a year in Libya, said she was impressed 
with the resilience of the Russian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have suffered so, and yet they to to keep on going," Stone said. BERT

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EAST LOS ANGELES; 
CURFEW ENFORCEMENT LINKED TO DROP IN CRIME, LOITERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot program of ticketing youthful curfew violators in East Los Angeles has 
led to a drop in crime and loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 p.m.-to-dawn curfew for juveniles, on the books for years, has rarely 
been enforced because of the costly and time-consuming arrest process. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials said this week that a pilot program started in January 
has produced good results by ticketing youthful offenders. Sheriff's deputies 
have written 246 tickets during the program in a seven-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew tickets carry a $675 fine, but the youths and their parents can 
instead choose to attend a month of parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a slight decrease (in crime)," sheriff's Lt. Robert Hoffman said. 
"The numbers of citations have dropped down, and officers say it's hard to find 
kids hanging out on street corners anymore. The kids know better now."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LIBRARY PLANS OFFERINGS 
FROM RAP TO CHAMBER MUSIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recently reopened Los Angeles Public Library Downtown has launched a 
series of concerts, readings and lectures, ranging from a Sunday afternoon rap 
performance to an evening with political cartoonist Jules Feiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural events series, scheduled to run through the summer and fall, 
started last weekend with a presentation on jazz and poetry. The next event is 
set for 3 p.m. Sunday, with a performance by the Long Beach Symphony chamber 
ensemble and a lecture by conductor JoAnn Faletta on women composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Commission President Gary Ross said the series is designed to offer "a 
wide range of programming that will appeal to a large cross-section of the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets have been priced at $5.50 in advance and $7.50 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking -- a persistent vexation in the area around the library, which is at 
5th and Flower streets -- is available under the Maguire Gardens on Flower 
Street between 5th and 6th streets for $5.50 all day Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several restaurants in the area have also announced that they will offer 
special dinners on days of library events, Ross said. Weeknight performances 
have been mostly scheduled for Wednesdays, to coincide with a plan by Downtown 
merchants to boost the Central City by using Wednesday night events as the core 
of a marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library is the custodian for this part of the city's cultural life, and 
there is nothing else like it," Ross said. "New York and other major cities 
have long had such events, but Los Angeles hasn't, and it's time we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the planned summer events will be Sunday afternoon music presentations 
by country singers Rosie Flores and Katy Moffatt; Latino singer Lalo Guerrero 
and the Loza Sextet; blues performers Hadda Brooks and Linda Hopkins, and 
rappers Sin -- Strength of Egypt and the Watts Prophets. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeknight events will focus on political cartoonists and comic book artists, 
featuring lectures by Feiffer and Los Angeles Times syndicate political 
cartoonist Paul Conrad, author Art Spiegelman and cartoonist Trina Robbins, and 
a panel discussion on comics of the '90s. SHAWN HUBLER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD TO 
OUTFIT OFFICERS WITH STRONGER HELMETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department hopes to outfit all its officers with better 
protective helmets within the year, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for better helmets was emphasized after the 1992 riots.Since then, 
the LAPD has been searching for helmets with which to outfit its officers in 
the event of another riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial attempts to find a bulletproof helmet ran aground after officials 
determined that it is all but impossible to make an entirely bulletproof helmet 
that can be worn comfortably. Instead, the LAPD has fallen back on a lower 
standard, one employed by the U.S. military, that helmets be able to restrict 
shrapnel and flying debris but not be fully bulletproof. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with that standard and money to purchase the $270 helmets, officials 
told members of the Los Angeles Police Commission that they hope to have the 
helmets within the year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS OK WASTEFULNESS STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved spending $10,000 
for a college think tank to identify wasteful duplications of services by 
county and city governments and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted 4-0 to pay one-third of the cost for a three-month study 
of all county and local government services to find areas that could be 
streamlined or contracted out to private business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study is the opening salvo in rethinking how government is structured in 
California," said Jim Hodge, executive director of the Orange County chapter of 
the California League of Cities. The league is providing $10,000 of the study's 
$30,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers from the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont 
McKenna College will gather budget information to determine where local 
governments are using money wisely and where they are wasting taxpayer dollars 
through inefficiency and overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that information, a summit of government and business leaders will 
recommend ways to increase efficiency. For example, cities might be encouraged 
to contract with county fire and police departments to cut down on bureaucracy, 
or government agencies might be advised to contract out some services to 
private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she believes the study could show that many 
local governments already are being run efficiently. If that is so, she said, 
the study still will be useful because it could highlight cities' money-saving 
practices for others to imitate. 
</P>
<P>
 Five corporations -- Pacific Bell, Southern California Edison, Southern 
California Gas, Fluor Corp. and the Irvine Co. -- are splitting the remaining 
$10,000 cost.

African American students, said Laura Rycraw, who heads Links' scholarship 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to help out with their educations. The need is there," said Rycraw. 
"Sometimes, the (scholarship money) starts an education. Sometimes, it helps 
people continue their education."

 Scholarship recipients from Cal State Fullerton are: Daniele Fagins of La 
Palma; Ebony Hill of Anaheim and Jennifer Ryan of Brea. Winners from UC Irvine 
are: Taliva Martin of Irvine, Allyce Edwards of Irvine, Denise Hart of Santa

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAYOR'S 
RESIDENCE TO BE REMODELED FOR OFFICIAL USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The official residence of the mayor is getting a make-over starting in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-room G.F. Getty House in the city's stately Hancock Park area will be 
renovated over a seven-month period so that it can be used for city-related 
entertaining, receptions and formal functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of our efforts to present our city as the renowned and respected 
place that we know it to be, it is imperative for us to have a place to meet, 
greet and entertain leaders from around our city, state and nation," Mayor 
Richard Riordan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The English Tudor home, which sits on a one-acre lot, was built in 1921 and 
donated to the city in 1976. The next year it was dedicated as the official 
mayoral residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Tom Bradley lived in the home, but Riordan chose to remain at his 
Brentwood house. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the renovations will be to sandblast the creamy white facade to expose 
its original brick color, remodel the kitchen and build a bathroom on the first 
floor, said Susi McConaghy, executive director of the nonprofit Getty House 
Restoration Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Work will begin Sept. 12 and be done through private funds, donations and free 
services from designers, architects and landscape artists, McConaghy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation is scheduled to be completed by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 McConaghy is overseeing the renovation along with Nancy Daly, the project 
chairwoman and Riordan's girlfriend.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCILMAN PLANS TO SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Burnie Dunlap has announced his intention to seek another four-year 
term on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, 51, said this week that encouragement from a cross-section of Brea 
residents and from his family prompted him to run for office again.If 
reelected, Dunlap said he will focus on redesigning Brea's monetary policies in 
light of dwindling financial support from state government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be smarter, we need to be more creative so we can provide city 
services in a way that doesn't place a burden on the taxpayers," said Dunlap, 
director of insurance services at Brea Community Hospital. He was initially 
elected to the council in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make Brea economically vital and strong," he said. He said a 
downtown revitalization project is one example of how city revenue can be 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said he would also strive to "continually reflect the values of the 
people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the council's accomplishments during his term, Dunlap noted that the 
city has balanced its budget and reduced expenses over the past three years, 
implemented a police bicycle patrol, increased affordable housing and moved 
ahead with the Brea Community Center, which is scheduled for completion by May 
of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving as mayor in 1993, Dunlap held a series of town hall meetings 
designed to increase the public's dialogue with elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap is married and has two grown children.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; WORKERS HELP PAY FOR MAN'S HOMELAND TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of generosity of his friends and co-workers, Vinh Nguyen will soon see 
his family in Vietnam for the first time in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 25, a custodian at Walton Intermediate School, recently received a 
$1,100 check from colleagues to help pay for his trip. The employees collected 
the money after he mentioned to a co-worker that he was saving up for a trip to 
visit his family, which includes five younger brothers he has never met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really numb. I just can't believe that they did this," Nguyen said 
during an interview on Tuesday at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just mentioned this to a co-worker and then all this was happening," Nguyen 
added with a smile and a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's two-week visit home will begin on June 23, and he plans for it to be 
a surprise for his family, who lives near Dong Nai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just go into the house and say, 'It's me!' and see what happens then," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 6, Nguyen fled the county with his grandmother and grew up here, 
eventually graduating from Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, his fellow custodian Ron Smith decided to try and help Nguyen pay 
for the trip by passing along word to other workers on the campus. Smith, a 
Vietnam veteran, said he felt a kinship with Nguyen because of his own 
experience in the country and with its people. 
</P>
<P>
 Little happened until this May when Smith asked librarian Kathy Lasseter to 
make an announcement during a staff meeting announcing a drive to help Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envisioned us getting him a piece of luggage or something, but Ron said, 'I 
think he needs money,' " Lasseter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the announcement, they were astonished to have collected $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe it. People came in with checks between $10 and $100. 
People just kind of did it anonymously. I had no idea people would be so 
generous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of students also chipped in $1 bills on their own to support Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is expected to cost about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he pitched in, Raul Velazquez, 13, said, "He hasn't seen his 
parents (in years) and I can't imagine that. It makes me feel better to help 
someone in need." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's visit home is still a few weeks away, but he's already eagerly 
anticipating seeing his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to see what kind of people they are, and what kind of lifestyle 
they're living. I want to see what they're like," he said."  
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I'm losing sleep over this. I can't wait for the day." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; LONG-DISTANCE REPLY TO MESSAGE IN BOTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Sibert runs a chartered boat service out of Seal Beach and has sailed 
around the world. But this sea-loving salt was nevertheless surprised by the 
message about a voyage that he received in the mail last month. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a letter from a minister in the Marshall Islands, writing in response 
to a message found inside a wine bottle that had washed up on a remote Pacific 
atoll earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottle was tossed into the sea more than a year ago by a tourist from 
Idaho who was on one of Sibert's chartered voyages to the southern tip of Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of bottles are thrown overboard but few are found," said Sibert, who, 
with his wife, Jan, runs Fantasy Sailing. "We've thrown bottles over the side 
before but never got anything back." 
</P>
<P>
 The chain of events began in February, 1993, during a voyage from Long Beach 
to La Paz, Baja California, aboard Sibert's boat, Enchanted Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 During the cruise, Estelle Aschliman wrote a note that said: "We are sailing 
off the shores of Baja California. I would like to know where this bottle ends 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, including the Seal Beach address of Fantasy Sailing and a dollar 
bill for postage, was put in a bottle and thrown overboard, Sibert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean currents sent the bottle more than 3,000 miles west to the Marshall 
Islands, where it washed up on Likiep atoll. 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered by an island resident on March 23, according to a letter 
sent to Sibert by American-born Rev. Richard McHolsiff, who works on the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 McHolsiff's single-page letter described the island and said the bottle was 
discovered by a man named Jepaner. Several photographs of island residents were 
included with the letter. The Marshall Islands are some 1,500 miles southwest 
of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Marshall Islands were once administered by the United States, and 
have strong diplomatic and military ties to the U. S., postage to Seal Beach 
cost just 29 cents, and the rest of Aschliman's dollar was donated to the 
island's Sudan hunger relief fund. It was "money well spent," McHolsiff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibert is trying to contact Aschliman to tell her what became of the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise," Sibert said. "You just don't expect these things to come 
back."SHELBY GRAD

JUDGE TO RULE ON BAN OF PLAYBOY AT FIREHOUSES; LAW: FIREFIGHTER CLAIMS THAT 
L.A. COUNTY'S PROHIBITION AGAINST SEXUALLY ORIENTED MATERIAL AT STATIONS 
VIOLATES HIS 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THE JURIST HEARING THE CASE APPEARS TO FAVOR 
HIS VIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge said he will rule Thursday on whether the U.S. 
Constitution protects a Los Angeles County fireman's right to read Playboy in 
the firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-day trial -- which included testimony that Playboy has female and 
blind readers who find the magazine worthwhile for its articles alone -- U.S. 
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson suggested Tuesday that he was leaning toward 
ruling in favor of county Fire Department Capt. Steven W. Johnson, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson challenged the county's ban against having Playboy on the job after 
county officials said that such magazines could create an unpleasant atmosphere 
for outnumbered women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was unable to show any requirement in federal anti-discrimination 
law "that supports this . . . policy of yours," Wilson told Les Tolnai, a 
senior deputy county counsel who defended the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to be the type of case that requires this type of 1st 
Amendment limitation," the judge said. He added that "evidence is persuasive 
that there are places in a firehouse that can provide a quiet place to read" 
Playboy or other such magazines without infringing on the workplace rights of 
women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a 27-year-veteran who lives in Corona del Mar, is represented by the 
American Civil Liberties Union and Playboy attorneys in his fight to regain his 
right to read Playboy at his Lake Los Angeles station, in the far northeast 
corner of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexually oriented magazines were banned from all work locations -- including 
dormitories, restrooms and lockers -- under a sexual harassment policy enacted 
in July, 1992. Fire Department officials said the policy was needed to prevent 
a sexually charged environment for the department's 11 women firefighters, who 
must work with about 2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about thought control," ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman said. "The 
government can't regulate what men think about women . . . based on their 
desire not to have men think in a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 The county may have had good intentions, but the policy is vague and over 
broad, Hoffman argued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking to foist Playboy magazine on women who don't want to have it 
foisted on them," Hoffman said. "All Capt. Johnson is asking for is that when 
he has his private time he wants to be able to read Playboy as he has been for 
the last 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolnai countered that the county had no choice but to enforce the ban in order 
to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not about thought control," he said. "This case is about conduct 
control. The 1st Amendment does not provide the same type of protection in the 
workplace as it does everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Vaughan, a civilian county employee who helped draft the policy, 
testified that nude pictures of women at a county firehouse could create an 
undesirable atmosphere in which women would be viewed as sexual objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a small number of women in the Fire Department it's almost as if 
they are solo out there," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 County firefighter Janet Babcock, appearing for the county, testified that 
before the ban, nude magazines did create such an atmosphere. "You had to put 
on a thick skin a lot of the time, go with the flow," Babcock said. "Sometimes 
I needed to be more on guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock and another female firefighter submitted declarations to the court 
stating their opposition to lifting the ban. However, two other women 
firefighters filed declarations with the court contending they had no 
objections to the presence of such magazines in fire stations.

MORE BOOKIE NAMES SOUGHT IN RECORDS; GAMBLING: DEPUTIES WHO BROKE UP ALLEGED 
BETTING RING SAY FURTHER ARRESTS ARE POSSIBLE. SEIZED COMPUTER INFORMATION IS 
BEING EXAMINED. 
</P>

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies who broke up what they called the largest sports betting 
ring in Southern California in recent years began searching seized computer 
records Tuesday for the hidden identities of the ring's bettors, looking for 
help in finding more bookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrests we made (Monday) are not the end of the arrests we will make," 
said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Kading, who is on the vice detail 
of the Special Investigations Bureau. "As we obtain more information, we will 
attempt to arrest more people in the Kalustian ring, or what is left of it, and 
who comes in to take their place." 
</P>
<P>
 The sports bookmaking operation was crippled Monday, authorities said, when 
sheriff's deputies swept through five counties and arrested 17 people, 
including Kale Kalustian, who deputies allege was the leader of a criminal 
enterprise that netted $5 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Kalustian, 65, of Granada Hills, earned the lion's share of 
the illicit profits. Two men identified as Kalustian's top aides, both from the 
San Fernando Valley, were among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they seized $82,408 in cash from five locations, including 
$34,099 from Kalustian and $29,791 from an alleged lieutenant, Walter Miller. 
They also seized computers, financial ledgers, cellular and regular phones and 
tape recorders they said were used to record bets and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the bettors, often in code, are believed to be listed in those 
records, Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said illegal bookmaking is so widespread that they hold out little 
hope that the operation will remain dormant for long. But the information in 
the seized records "may take us to other organizations," Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NBA (National Basketball Assn.) finals start (tonight) and the bettors 
will be looking for a place to make their bets," he said. "They have an 
addiction, an inner compulsion to drive them to bet, and they will be looking. 
Because of human frailty, people want to bet. So they will find a bookmaker or 
a bookmaker will find them. It just goes on and on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Tuesday that they suspect Kalustian has been involved in sports 
betting operations for at least 10 years, taking over at least partial control 
of a bookmaking operation allegedly run previously by Ron Sacco, a San 
Francisco-based bookie who authorities say ran the largest sports betting 
operation in the world until his indictment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco is in federal custody awaiting trial on charges of operating a 
$1-billion-a-year international bookmaking operation. He was indicted last year 
along with 25 alleged associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian and at least one of his alleged associates, Ron LaForgia, 42, were 
charged along with 11 others in 1986 with running a smaller ring. 
</P>
<P>
 All 17 people arrested Monday were booked for investigation of conspiracy to 
commit bookmaking and were being held in lieu of $200,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the current ring began nine months ago and there had 
been more than a dozen arrests before Monday. Kading said the ring specialized 
in taking bets on horse races and professional and college basketball and 
football.

A STUDY IN SPIRIT; HIGH SCHOOL VALEDICTORIAN PURSUES SCHOOLWORK DESPITE BRAIN 
SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Nothing will stop Birmingham High School valedictorian William Ress from 
basking in accolades at his high school's upcoming graduation ceremony -- not 
the recovery from four-hour brain surgery, not the daily radiation treatments, 
not the fear of death. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old San Fernando Valley senior has lost most of his hair and much 
of his energy since January, when doctors found a malignant brain tumor behind 
his right eye. But Ress keeps on with the determination that has helped him 
earn straight A's through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite advice from teachers, counselors and friends to study at home after 
the surgery five months ago, Ress is finishing his last three Advanced 
Placement courses on campus with his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a lot of people telling me to quit, I've really had to assert myself," 
said Ress, who lives in Encino. "But I would have felt like a quitter, like I 
didn't take on what I knew I could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early morning hours of Jan. 29, without warning, a seizure shook Ress; 
his rocking bed woke his parents in the next room. He was taken to a local 
hospital where, after a myriad of tests, doctors found the tumor. One week 
later, he flew to San Francisco for surgery to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a month later, Ress was back at Birmingham, taking Advanced 
Placement courses in government, English and calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day after school, Ress had radiation treatments at St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank that robbed him of his energy and his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mingled with the baseball pennants, caps, posters and Little League trophies 
that clutter his bedroom are vivid reminders of his ordeal. The plastic mask he 
wore during radiation sits on a bookshelf by the door. Three hospital 
identification wristbands are taped to the wall above his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They remind me that even though I am looking toward the future, looking 
toward college, I have to stop and smell the roses. I have to remember the 
people around me now," said Ress, who plans to attend Brown University in Rhode 
Island after a year at UC Berkeley. He will began a year of chemotherapy this 
week. His parents, who say doctors have not given them a definitive prognosis 
for their son's future, are optimistic. "We're just going with the flow," said 
his mother, Mira. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting cross-legged on his bed, a Brown University baseball cap covering his 
nearly bald head, Ress said that through his experience, "I found out that I'm 
a lot stronger than I thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the importance of earning straight A's faded after the surgery, Ress 
said, he stayed in school to regain a sense of normalcy in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still want to do well, but it's not the top priority anymore," he said. 
"What's more important to me is I'm finishing, that I stuck this out to 
completion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ress grew up in a comfortable house on a quiet street in the Encino hills with 
his parents and older sister, who just graduated from Berkeley. He attended a 
private school for gifted students through the eighth grade, but went on to 
Birmingham High, as his sister had, because he wanted to meet students with 
different backgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 At first it was a shock, he said, going from an eighth-grade class of six 
students at the Mirman School to a campus where he knew only a handful of the 
3,000 teen-agers crowding the halls. But Ress quickly immersed himself in 
honors classes. Soft-spoken and with an unassuming manner, he made close 
friends and impressed his teachers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a brilliant, charming young man," said Anita Gershten, his academic 
counselor. "He has a genuineness, a sincerity, that makes him a rare human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden illness forced Ress to face his mortality in a way few teen-agers 
ever do.  
</P>
<P>
 The tumor became the topic of conversation at home, Ress said. His father, who 
is an arthritis specialist, spoke to colleagues all over the country and read 
everything he could about tumors.  
</P>
<P>
 Ress said that instead of despair, the illness and the support of his family 
and friends helped him look to the future with more enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our class song is 'These Are Days,' " said Ress, who will graduate June 16. 
"But I don't think these are the days. A lot of high school students are living 
for now instead of looking toward the future. My life is in front of me."

BILL BOYARSKY: IS THERE HOPE FOR VALLEY'S OLD MAIN STREETS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm always looking for signs that Los Angeles is surviving, and perhaps 
recovering from all the calamities that have hit us in the last couple of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a resident, and a homeowner, I want to know that the place isn't going to 
hell. And as a columnist, my job would be intolerably gloomy if all I wrote was 
bad news. I'd go back to my original career goal, sportswriting, where I'd be 
assured of covering winners as well as losers. 
</P>
<P>
 So when I heard that Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick was having a 
seminar on reviving the San Fernando Valley's decaying Canoga Park and Reseda 
business districts, I headed out there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chick is a lively woman who has represented the West Valley since she defeated 
her former boss, Joy Picus, in last year's election. The fact that she 
challenged, and beat, Picus showed there's a hard edge to her. She needed it 
during the calamity she had to face after six months on the job -- the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving her own wrecked home, Chick roamed the district from dawn until late 
at night for days, goading city, state and federal officials into helping the 
3rd District's many victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park and Reseda were hit hard, especially the older business buildings 
that, in the days before shopping plazas and malls, were the retailing heart of 
the Valley. Topanga Plaza, Warner Center and the other shopping centers had 
just about killed the old Valley main streets. The earthquake was the final 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus resurrection, not resuscitation, was the task facing Chick and the 
neighborhood activists, business people, architects, planners and government 
officials who met Friday and Saturday on the Winnetka campus of an Armenian 
community school. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't realize the difficulty of the job these people were undertaking until 
I walked along Sherman Way in Reseda with Art Pearlman, a retail marketing 
specialist and a partner in the shopping center development firm of 
Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell. We were part of a group taking a walking tour of 
Reseda's business district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s, Sherman Way must have been like East 14th Street or Bancroft 
Avenue in San Leandro, the little city next to Oakland where I went to school. 
I bet they had their version of a George's Drugstore in Reseda, and their 
Fergie's drive-in. The boarded up Reseda movie theater was probably once as 
busy as our Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 But shopping habits changed, Pearlman pointed out as we looked across the 
street at a big drugstore. There aren't enough parking places by this store's 
entrance and most of the parking is in the back. That's too far for car-bound 
Angelenos to walk. Some of the merchants had devised a solution, converting 
their back doors into main entrances opening onto the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefronts, however, are boarded up and locked. This practice, along with 
vacant stores and trash-littered stores and parking lots, gives Sherman Way a 
desolate look. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics and ethnic change are also big challenges to Reseda's revival. 
When the Sherman Way business district was young, the shoppers were the white 
middle-class residents of small, newly built tract houses nearby. Today, most 
of the residents near Sherman Way are poorer Latinos, shopping at stores 
operated by a multitude of ethnic groups. And, as Pearlman noted, the biggest 
age group in the area is 15 to 29 -- younger than the age group that shops the 
most, the 30- to 50-year-olds. Merchants will have to sell goods the current 
neighbors will buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Chick there was another factor. From the standpoint of her career, the 
political history of her district made it a dangerous task. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's predecessor, Picus, had failed to reconcile conflicts over how to 
restore fading parts of the Valley. In some places, she favored development. In 
other areas, she fought it. Business turned on her. So did homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 In staging her two-day seminar, Chick bravely put these conflicting forces in 
the same room, inviting the same political attacks that destroyed Picus. "The 
anger about change is always there," Chick told me. "It's best to meet it head 
on. So I might as well get everyone together." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, her guests seemed pleased to have been invited. They tossed 
around a number of ideas. Lively discussions continued in the sunny patio 
during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Chick will move the process further along with a bigger community 
meeting in Reseda. Out of this, hopefully, she will come up with concrete 
ideas, developed by merchants and residents, to bring old Reseda back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 These are all small steps, not headline material. But they are important to 
ensure the survival -- and prosperity -- of the Valley and the rest of L.A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY INCHES TOWARD TERM LIMIT MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a sometimes testy debate, the City Council this week moved closer to 
placing a term limit measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters, the ordinance would prohibit council members from 
serving more than two consecutive full terms. This ordinance would not be 
enforceable, however, unless the California Legislature votes to allow general 
law cities, such as Tustin, to enact term limits. Legislation on this issue is 
pending in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting in favor of term limits Monday were Councilman Jim Potts and new 
council members Michael J. Doyle and Tracy Worley. Doyle and Worley were 
elected in April after pledging to reform city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to the people to decide," said Potts in voting for the 
council-sponsored ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley emphasized that "politics as usual is just not acceptable any more," 
and predicted that term limitations will become increasingly popular among 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli and Councilman Jeffrey Thomas spoke out against 
term limits, warning that the city's power would be weakened on county and 
regional boards that operate on a seniority basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is the absolute worst thing we could do for the city," 
Saltarelli said. He added that Tustin, with its population of 59,000, would be 
overshadowed on regional boards by bigger cities such as Anaheim, Irvine and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two terms is simply too little," said Saltarelli, who suggested that a 
three-term limit would be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas warned that "we're making a mistake" by calling for term limits when 
many cities in the state are not operating under such restrictions. A better 
approach, he said, would be for the voters to decide when a council member 
needs to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pretty smart right now," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime local resident Berklee Maughan of Tustin Community Participants, a 
citizens action group formed after last April's election, said he was "very 
pleased about the healthy debate" on term limits that has occurred during the 
past three council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Maughan, a 56-year-old investor, said he was shocked that Saltarelli 
and Thomas were opposed to the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just asking them to let the people vote on the issue," said Maughan, 
adding that he believes council members tend to become less responsive to the 
electorate the longer they are in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the politicians get elected, they always walk the precincts and they 
ask you what you want," Maughan said. "It seems that after they get elected, 
they start telling you what you need. And there's a big difference." ALAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TENTATIVE CITY BUDGET ELIMINATES 26 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have unveiled a preliminary 1994-95 budget that calls for the 
elimination of 26 employee positions, the sale of a $5-million reservoir and 
small increases in a wide range of fees. 
</P>
<P>
 During a study session on Monday, City Manager David N. Ream said the steps 
are necessary to offset a potential $15-million deficit brought on by the 
continuing poor economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no fun raising fees and taxes, but what we're trying to do is strike a 
balance" between maintaining services and reducing costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $279.6-million spending plan includes a 2.5% increase in the sanitation 
fee and a 2.9% increase in the water rate. It also calls for new fees of $50 to 
$90 an hour to offset the cost of providing construction- and design-related 
review services. 
</P>
<P>
 Positions that would be eliminated include a fire safety specialist, a police 
arson investigator, two fire battalion chiefs, five police service officers, 
two building inspectors, four custodians and three library staffers. However, 
the employees would be shifted to other, vacant positions whenever possible, 
Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two controversial fees, for registering home and business alarms and for 
parking permits, are included in the budget, but the staff provided an 
alternative to charging them. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the alternative, parking permit fees would be eliminated. Also, only 
businesses would pay the alarm registration fee, which would be reduced from a 
proposed $30 to $25. Money generated by the alarm fees would enable the city to 
retain 17 police cadet positions that would otherwise be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for selling a $5-million reservoir in the south end of the city 
near Bear Street and Alton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ream pointed out that the proposed budget would involve some risk because it 
includes about $7 million in one-time revenue to meet the deficit, instead of 
raising more fees or cutting more positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that the economy will improve and make those steps unnecessary, 
but Ream added that "the danger is next year we could be sitting here with an 
even bigger mountain to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the proposed budget offers "a responsible course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council listened to the staff presentation on the budget and appeared 
to accept most of the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several council members questioned proposals to increase fees at city 
swimming pools by 50 cents and close each pool two days a week. They suggested 
that the staff prepare alternatives to those proposals, as well as a plan to 
charge patrons up to 50 cents for temporary library cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to consider and adopt a final budget following a 
public hearing on June 20. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; WAIVER SOUGHT FOR CLASS SIZE PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District is hoping the State Board of Education 
will excuse its failure to keep class sizes down. 
</P>
<P>
 Because several first-, second- and third-grade classrooms at Mariposa, 
William E. Fanning and Brea Country Hills elementary schools were overcrowded 
during this school year, the district faces a penalty of $90,698. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the penalty, the district this week unanimously voted to ask the 
state to waive the charges though district officials acknowledge having 
exceeded class size limits set by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty is calculated by adding up the revenue, which the state pays the 
district annually, for each student exceeding the maximum 30 pupils per class. 
In the Brea Olinda district, classes exceeded the maximum capacity by a total 
of 27 students. The largest class had 33 students in it, school officials said. 
Each student accounts for $3,359 in revenue, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials expect a decision from the state in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Edgar Z. Seal said he expects the state to grant the district's request 
to waive the penalty because Brea Olinda is taking action to reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
 Come the 1994-95 school year, the district plans to lower the maximum limit of 
pupils in first-, second- and third-grade classrooms to 28 per class. Board 
members unanimously approved the move Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude shouldn't be how to get a waiver but how to reduce class size," 
Trustee Todd A. Spitzer said. MIMI KO

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; MORRISSEY, HAMMOND LEAD RACES; LEGISLATURE: MORENO 
HOLDS EDGE OVER METZLER IN DEMOCRATIC FIGHT FOR PARTY'S ONLY SEAT IN THE 
COUNTY.

 Backed by the financial might of conservative state Sen. Rob Hurtt, Republican 
Jim Morrissey jumped to an early lead in the 69th Assembly District primary and 
Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond clung to a narrow margin over two 
opponents in the 70th District GOP race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary in the 69th Assembly District, Santa Ana City 
Councilman Ted R. Moreno staked a surprising early lead in the race to retain 
the seat held by Orange County's only Democratic legislator, Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who ran for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Mike Metzler, the favorite in the 
race, was trailing Moreno by a small margin with about a third of the votes 
tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morrissey campaign immediately began planning strategy for the general 
election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the No. 1 target of the state Assembly Republicans, to regain this 
seat," said Mark Q. Thompson, Morrissey's campaign consultant. "The fight for 
the general election starts now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th District, the trio of newcomer GOP candidates resorted to 
everything but four-letter words in a burst of negative campaigning days before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
 With incumbent Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) making an exit to run for the 
state Senate, the GOP primary victor can almost be anointed the winner come 
November because the district is overwhelmingly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Political Week newsletter proclaimed the battle the "hottest 
and perhaps most negative GOP primary in this election cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem: With few differences on issues, the campaign focused on 
personal histories. Businesswoman Marilyn C. Brewer had to defend herself 
against the dreaded L-word as "liberal" stickers began appearing on her 
campaign signs. The 56-year-old former aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides questioning Brewer's conservative credentials, attorney Thomas G. 
Reinecke also called attention to Hammond's past financial problems. Hammond 
went through a bankruptcy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Reinecke had to shout down a whisper campaign that he had been sued 
for non-payment of a bill for a former girlfriend's abortion, an allegation he 
strongly denied. Reinecke said the bill related to a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond had a distinct fund-raising advantage, as Hurtt's conservative Allied 
Business Political Action Committee contributed nearly $160,000 in cash and aid 
to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th District Democratic primary, Jim Toledano, who faces a difficult 
task in the general election, had no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 70th District hardly had all the mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District race, Umberg's departure set off a free-for-all 
in both the Republican and Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The local GOP viewed the seat as a good opportunity to seize from county 
Democrats the only state legislative or congressional seat they hold. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side of the 70th District, Virgel L. Nickell, who works for 
a nonprofit organization, was forced to dispatch a hastily prepared mailer over 
the weekend, denying anonymously-made allegations that he had left his former 
wife in the lurch without child support. Worse yet, the charge went, he had 
forced her onto the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nickell's current wife sent out a mailer that called her husband a good 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim manufacturer Morrissey built a huge advantage over his Republican 
opponents by securing the backing of party conservatives, including the 
financial support of Hurtt and his Christian/business organization, ABPAC. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Democrats in the 69th, most of the barbs were traded by Latino 
activist Zeke Hernandez and Santa Ana Councilman Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dispute that has attracted the attention of the Orange County district 
attorney's office, Hernandez alleged that Moreno offered him money to stay out 
of the race. Moreno, in turn, claimed Hernandez illegally taped their telephone 
conversation to set up the bribery charge. Both issued strong denials. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler helped his chances by winning Umberg's endorsement and the support of 
labor and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic primary in the 68th Assembly District stood in stark contrast 
to the races in the 69th and 70th districts. With Anaheim Councilman Irv 
Pickler confined to a wheelchair after a car accident and educational assistant 
Linda Kay Rigney suffering from pneumonia, the candidates were more concerned 
about taking their medicine than taking potshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney, who was running neck and neck with Pickler, had to overcome Pickler's 
greater name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) attracted only token opposition in the 34th state Senate District 
and 67th Assembly District GOP primaries, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt will face Democrat Donna L. Chessen, a Buena Park city councilwoman who 
took an early lead in her race, or insurance broker Wayman L. Nelson in 
November. Democrat Jonathan Woolf-Willis was unopposed in the 67th Assembly 
District race.  
</P>
<P>
 Republican Assemblymen Curt Pringle of Garden Grove (68th district), Mickey 
Conroy of Orange (71st), Ross Johnson of Placentia (72nd), Bill Morrow of 
Oceanside (73rd) and Republican state Sen. William A. Craven of Oceanside 
(38th) all ran unopposed in their GOP primaries. In early results consultant 
Thomas Berry was leading attorney Genaro Lara for the Democratic nomination and 
the right to meet Craven in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats Jeanne Costales, Allan L. Dollison and Lee Walker in the 71st, 72nd 
and 73rd Assembly districts, faced no opposition this time around, but will 
have uphill battles against Republican incumbents in November.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; LOCAL ELECTIONS / TREASURER; CITRON LEADS NEARLY 2 TO 1 
AGAINST 1ST OPPONENT IN 20 YEARS; FINANCE: MOORLACH SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER 
HIMSELF VICTORIOUS JUST FOR MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE OF THE WAY THE INCUMBENT 
INVESTED PUBLIC MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
 Facing his first opponent in 20 years in a race that focused on his handling 
of Orange County's vast investment portfolio, Robert L. Citron appeared headed 
back to his job Tuesday as treasurer-tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron held a nearly 2-1 edge over his challenger, John M.W. Moorlach, a Costa 
Mesa accountant heavily supported by the Orange County Republican Party, who 
waged a fierce attack on Citron's investment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried their darndest and they did damage, but it all backfired," Citron 
said. "By questioning my investment practices, (Moorlach) temporarily upset the 
national market in which we deal (but) with a lot of hard work, we're gradually 
restoring the confidence" of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said that even if he lost the election, he would consider himself 
victorious just by making the public aware of the way Citron invested public 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I win either way because (Citron's portfolio) is so bad," he said. "I feel we 
dealt with the issues. We ran a clean campaign. I have no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
 The race for treasurer-tax collector turned vicious this year when Moorlach, 
38, attacked Citron by suggesting he was playing fast and loose with the 
county's $7.5-billion securities portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach had gone so far as to suggest last week that Citron's investment 
strategies have caused the portfolio to decline some $1.2 billion in the past 
five months alone. Citron dismissed the accusation as nonsense from a desperate 
candidate trailing badly in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate centered on Citron's use of the county pool's U.S. Treasury bills 
and bonds as collateral to borrow on a short-term basis at low interest rates. 
The treasurer invests the borrowed funds in bonds and securities that pay a 
higher rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 While interest rates remain low, the investment plan can yield a bonanza. But 
because rates have been rising since since the beginning of this year, Citron 
has been forced to post additional collateral -- some $300 million this year -- 
because the value of his securities has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Though risky, the strategy has served Citron well over the past 24 years, and 
has consistently earned him higher-than-average returns as he has tried to 
out-guess the market. Citron's investment returns have been so lucrative that 
185 cities and government agencies have turned over their funds for him to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's election made Citron the subject of national news, as the Wall 
Street Journal and business trade publications analyzed his portfolio and gave 
Moorlach and his supporters a sounding board from which to chastise the 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaccustomed to criticism, the 69-year-old treasurer-tax collector 
acknowledged that the attacks deeply hurt him and his wife of 39 years, Terry. 
He said this bid for another four-year term would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 As Citron saw it, the race pitted county government's only elected Democrat 
against the full weight of the Republican Party in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach's campaign committee contained Reps. Christopher Cox, Dana 
Rohrabacher, Robert K. Dornan and Ed Royce, as well as state legislators Mickey 
Conroy, Gil Ferguson, Doris Allen, John Lewis, Rob Hurtt, Bill Morrow and Curt 
Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson was also on the committee, but dropped off when she 
became concerned that Moorlach's criticism of Citron was damaging the value of 
the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Citron found himself in the rare position of having to 
raise money for his reelection effort. Through late May, he had received 
$32,198, about one-fifth of which came from brokerage firms and banks that do 
business with the county. Citron said he saw no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also said he didn't believe he was in any danger of losing his job. 
Nearly three months before the election, Citron predicted that he would get at 
least 60% of the vote.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; LOCAL ELECTIONS COUNTY; RUNOFF APPEARS LIKELY IN 
CLERK-RECORDER RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a contest between two veteran county officials whose duties are being 
merged into one office, beleaguered Recorder Lee A. Branch and County Clerk 
Gary L. Granville appeared headed for a runoff election late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being battered by allegations of sexual harassment and mismanagement, 
Branch trailed Granville by only a small margin. Closely behind them was Ella 
M. Murphy, who is Branch's top assistant, followed by attorney Christopher J. 
Leanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Granville and Branch said they expected the election would result in a 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have that many candidates, there's a good chance for a runoff," 
said Branch, who added that the allegations against him were unfounded and 
exploited by his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping it would end one way or the other tonight," said Granville, who 
spent much of the day taking down his campaign signs. "Now we have to do it all 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch is considered the incumbent for the newly formed clerk-recorder, while 
Granville's position is being eliminated as a cost-cutting measure. A runoff 
election will be held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the county assessor's office, incumbent Bradley L. Jacobs had 
a sizable lead against two employees from his office -- Larry Lee Bales, an 
auditor-appraiser, and David J. Holbert, the deputy assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the races for county recorder and assessor have traditionally 
remained low-key, this election was closely followed by many county government 
observers, largely because the incumbents have been mired in controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch was ultimately censured by the Board of Supervisors following two 
investigations into accusations that he mismanaged his department and sexually 
harassed two female employees. Branch has denied any wrongdoing and said the 
accusations against him were exaggerated. His opponents, however, attacked him 
for lowering morale and productivity in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville said he thought many voters had trouble distinguishing between him 
and Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Branch, Granville, it sounds the same to them," Granville said. "They'll ask 
me, 'Are you the sexual harassment guy?' or, 'Are you the one that's not 
competent?' The voters know that something is wrong. They just don't read 
carefully enough to know who is who." 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk-recorder will be in charge of issuing marriage licenses and 
fictitious business names, as well as filing property records. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' office was criticized last year for the slow pace in processing tens 
of thousands of appeals for property tax reassessments. Homeowners have 
complained about the red tape involved in the reassessment process and delays 
in receiving refunds. Jacobs has defended his office's operations and 
performance given its limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, incumbents in five other county offices were on pace of being 
reelected, according to early voter returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In three uncontested countywide offices, incumbents retained their positions. 
There were: Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and 
County Auditor Steve E. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 In two other contested races, County School Supt. John. F. Dean appeared to be 
staving off a challenge from Darrell Opp, chief education officer in the county 
Department of Education, while Public Administrator William A. Baker was 
fighting off bids from businessman Michael K. Stark and vocational guidance 
counselor Mitchell T. Tracy.

JUDGE REFUSES TO LOWER RAPE SUSPECT'S $2-MILLION BAIL; CRIME: POLICE OFFICER'S 
SON IS ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING FOUR WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Van Nuys judge has refused to lower a $2-million bail for a Woodland Hills 
man accused of abducting and sexually assaulting four women and girls in the 
west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leland B. Harris came Tuesday during a 
hearing at which the arraignment for Howard August Davis was delayed until June 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Monday, prosecutors charged Davis with 37 felony 
counts stemming from four attacks in which the victims were abducted off the 
street and taken to isolated locations. Davis is accused of raping two 
18-year-olds and a 17-year-old. He is also charged with kidnaping and sexually 
molesting a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're extremely serious offenses; therefore the person who commits such 
offenses is an extremely dangerous person," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Martin L. 
Herscovitz. "That's why bail was set so high." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said the $2 million is a "conservative" bail amount. 
Herscovitz said he could have asked for as much as $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is charged with kidnaping for sexual purposes, rape, forcible oral 
copulation, sodomy, digital penetration and child molestation. If convicted on 
all charges, he would face well over 300 years in prison, Herscovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Davis did not formally deny the charges in court, defense attorney 
Peter L. Knecht of Los Angeles said his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a devastating charge -- 37 counts," Knecht said. "But he indicates to me 
he's not guilty (and) he wants to go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a 29-year-old self-employed painter and son of a Beverly Hills police 
officer, kept his head lowered during the short proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things look bleak, but McMartin looked bleak," Knecht said, referring to the 
ill-fated preschool case in which none of the seven people indicted on charges 
of molesting children were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said solid police work and some luck led to Davis' arrest Friday, 
five days after he allegedly molested the 10-year-old girl. The arrest followed 
the distribution of composite drawings of the suspect and a description of a 
light-colored, small pickup truck used in all four attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a quick look at the composite. It doesn't look at all like him," 
Knecht said, showing reporters a photocopy of a drawing depicting a man whose 
facial features are similar to Davis' but who appears to be Latino. Davis is 
white and has strawberry blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Davis without incident near Ventura Boulevard and Sale Avenue 
on Friday night, two days after investigators realized a serial rapist was 
attacking young females in the West Valley.

PLAN WOULD AVERT $40-MILLION PROBATION AGENCY CUT; FINANCES: COUNTY WILL TAP 
SALES TAX, STATE SOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE. FUNDING IS CONTINGENT ON LABOR 
AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Completing a series of budget moves designed to bolster law enforcement, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors crafted a plan Tuesday to save the 
Probation Department from a proposed $40-million budget cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said they would tap two sources to provide $20 million for the 
department: $13.7 million from a projected increase in sales tax revenue slated 
for public safety use and $6.3 million from state disaster reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is contingent on probation officials reaching agreement with labor 
representatives to save $12 million, possibly through deferral of overtime pay 
or other benefits. The county is pursuing additional funding sources that could 
further reduce the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 If all of the funding comes through, the department will be able to maintain 
current levels of service, said Chief Probation Officer Barry J. Nidorf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be able to maintain crucial adult and juvenile services . . . and it 
puts us even with other justice agencies in the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed presented the supervisors with a 
proposed $14.7-billion budget last month that included substantial cuts for law 
enforcement, parks, museums and libraries. But the board, which is scheduled to 
formally deliberate the budget next month, immediately signaled that law 
enforcement would be a funding priority, and substantially reduced cuts 
proposed for the Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed initially proposed a $39.8-million cut for the Probation Department, 
which would result in 588 layoffs, elimination of the Municipal Court 
investigations program, reductions in investigations provided for Superior 
Courts, and elimination of the work furlough program and the Long Beach and San 
Pedro crime suppression programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the restoration, the department remains seriously understaffed, 
Nidorf said. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of civil rights groups, churches and probation officers last month 
filed a federal lawsuit charging that the Probation Department provides 
inadequate services in low-income neighborhoods and discriminates against black 
probation workers in job assignments and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also contends that procedures designed to relieve overworked 
probation officers result in "releasing disproportionately large numbers of 
essentially unsupervised people convicted of serious felonies into urban core 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Nidorf said the bias allegations are untrue and contended that past budget 
cutbacks have hampered the provision of services throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not providing what anybody -- by any stretch of the imagination -- 
would call probation supervision," he said. "I'm not satisfied with the level 
of service in (low-income) communities; I'm not satisfied with the level of 
service in any community." 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day that the board decided to give more money to the Probation 
Department, it wound up five days of public hearings on the proposed budget 
with yet more pleas from county department heads and citizens to restore 
programs slated for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn told supervisors that the proposed $20-million 
cut to his department could cost the county $177 million in uncollected 
property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said the cut would result in laying off 419 people, coming on top of a 
$10-million cut last year and the loss of 109 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Several supervisors expressed concern. But the board put off any action to 
restore funds until it begins its budget deliberations, scheduled for July 11.

LEAD DESPITE STATE'S MISCONDUCT CHARGES; COURTS: PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ALLEGED 
MISDEEDS HELPED INCUMBENT, JUDGE'S ATTORNEY SAYS. OPPONENT ATTRIBUTES STRONG 
SHOWING TO 'VOTER IGNORANCE.'

<P>
 Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney, who is facing official misconduct charges, 
appeared to be waging a successful battle for his judicial life Tuesday against 
a defense attorney who says Orange County deserves a judge who follows the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In early returns, Whitney was leading his opponent, defense attorney Dennis 
Patrick O'Connell of Yorba Linda, by a significant margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for Whitney's seat was the most closely watched of four local 
judicial races. The state Commission on Judicial Performance filed misconduct 
charges last month alleging that Whitney, 63, denied defendants their right to 
an attorney and violated other constitutional rights in his Santa Ana 
courtroom. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is also reviewing similar 
allegations against Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, who has denied any wrongdoing and predicts he will be vindicated, 
huddled with his wife next to a piano in the lobby at Westin South Coast Plaza 
hotel in Costa Mesa. "I'm very upbeat and positive," he said, reading from a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran on my record as a fair and firm judge who is a strong supporter of law 
and order, and I believe that message reached the voters of Orange County. The 
people have spoken." 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Ron Brower, said the publicity involving Whitney's alleged 
misdeeds was apparently helping the incumbent judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County, our voters are extremely conservative," Brower said. "If 
you run publicity on a judge that he's too severe and that he's not spending 
enough time with defendants, he's likely to win on a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, 44, attributed Whitney's strong showing at the polls to "voter 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked precincts, went to 2,000 homes and found eight people who knew the 
issue," he said. "They're not saying Whitney's good or bad. They're saying he's 
(an) incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two other Municipal Court races, incumbents Pamela L. Iles in South 
County and Daniel C. Dutcher in Westminster were leading by wide margins over 
their challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the only contested race for Superior Court, Santa Ana Municipal Judge 
Gary Patrick Ryan was holding a large lead over colleague Municipal Judge 
Barbara (Tam) Nomoto. 
</P>
<P>
 In South County, Iles, 49, who has been on the bench there for 12 years, was 
being challenged by Mission Viejo attorney John C. Connolly, 51, who runs a 
general law practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about experience," Iles said after early election results showed her 
leading the race. "I've worked for victims' rights in this state for 18 years. 
I think that's what voters recognized. They saw through the rhetoric and voted 
for the best record."  
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, incumbent Dutcher was fighting off criticisms from a 
prosecutor and a civil attorney that he is too lenient in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher, who has been on the bench since his 1982 election, attributed the 
complaints to smear tactics. He had the support of more than 90 fellow judges 
and commissioners countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging him were Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryl Lee, 37, who handles family 
support cases, and Seal Beach attorney Barry S. Brown, 39, who serves as a pro 
tem judge in civil and small claims cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The animosity present in these judicial contests was absent in the only race 
for a seat on the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Nomoto and Ryan refused to criticize each other, instead focusing their 
campaigns on their own strengths.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; HEADLANDS SLATE LEADS IN DANA POINT; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
$500-MILLION HOTEL RESORT AND 370-HOMES PROJECT HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN THE 
CITY ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three candidates who support a controversial $500-million resort development 
for the Headlands jumped to the lead Tuesday night in early results for the 
Dana Point City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
 After absentee ballots were totaled, Harold R. Kaufman, Bill Shepherd and 
incumbent Councilwoman Karen Lloreda were ahead of Ernest A. Nelson and Toni 
Gallagher, two anti-Headlands plan candidates who trailed in fourth and fifth 
place, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 However, nobody was claiming victory yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love those numbers, but I'm not going to get excited yet," said Lloreda, a 
Capistrano Beach resident seeking her second term on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wilberg, an anti-Headlands candidate, said the absentee ballots were 
distributed by a pro-development Chamber of Commerce. "I still feel good about 
my chances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks before the election, in which the Headlands was the key issue, 
most local political observers had predicted a close race. But with 12 
candidates -- the most since 26 people ran in 1988 -- vying for three open 
seats on the five-member council, there was no confident forecast about who 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argued that gender would play a role and that a woman definitely would be 
chosen, although only two of the candidates are women. Others suggested that 
anti-incumbent fervor among the voters in this coastal city of 34,000 would 
hurt Councilwoman Lloreda and possibly the candidates who joined her on a 
pro-Headlands slate, Kaufman and Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others suggested that voters would elect independent candidates and 
reject the six candidates supported by the two main political action committees 
in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers also agreed that the development plan for the Dana Point 
Headlands was a key campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the City Council-approved Headlands plan, which calls for a 
400-room hotel and 370 homes on the privately owned 121-acre peninsula, 
launched a heated petition drive in April to force a special referendum on the 
development. The council last month scheduled the Headlands election for 
November, but the debate over the plan spilled into the council race. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan say the project will generate important revenue for the 
city, while its foes say it is too massive for the prominent peninsula. "I 
don't think there is any doubt that the Headlands is the No. 1 issue," said 
Joanna Paoli, a local activist.  
</P>
<P>
 Three local political action committees clashed over the Headlands issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the groups -- Dana Point United and Concerned Taxpayers of Dana Point 
-- backed the slate of candidates who support the Headlands plan: Lloreda, 
Kaufman and Shepherd. The other group, Hometown Dana Point, is opposed to the 
plan and backed a slate composed of Nelson, Gallagher and Wilberg.

LAST 2 DEFENDANTS IN TAY MURDER CASE CALLED PAWNS; TRIAL: DEFENSE LAWYERS 
PORTRAY ABRAHAM ACOSTA AND KIRN KIM AS LONERS SEEKING APPROVAL. THEY NEVER 
INTENDED TO KILL BUT WERE MANIPULATED, JURORS ARE TOLD.

 The remaining two teen-agers on trial for the 1992 New Year's Eve murder of 
honor student Stuart A. Tay of Orange were unwitting pawns manipulated by the 
teen who masterminded the brutal slaying, defense attorneys told a jury 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Kim, 18, of Fullerton, never 
intended to kill Tay and were tricked into participating in the slaying by 
Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton, who has already been convicted of orchestrating 
the murder, defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that Acosta was the first to strike the 17-year-old 
Tay with a baseball bat, while Kim sat in a car nearby, acting as a lookout. 
But defense attorneys told an Orange County Superior Court jury that the teens 
were unaware that murder was planned until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 During its opening statements Tuesday, the defense sought to portray Acosta 
and Kim as loners who were looking for acceptance and eager to pal around with 
Chan, a one-time candidate for class valedictorian at Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution made its opening statements Monday, the first day of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg said Acosta is a mentally retarded youth 
who played the role of class clown to get attention. Acosta relished the 
attention Chan gave him and believed he was participating in a prank to scare 
-- not kill -- the victim by striking him with a bat, Gragg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta "was a prime subject for Mr. Chan," Gragg told jurors, adding that the 
first blow only angered Tay and was not hard enough to do serious injury. "All 
(Acosta) knew about was a plan, an attempt to frighten somebody, rough somebody 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 After Acosta struck Tay, Chan began beating the victim unconscious as Acosta 
looked on in shock, according to Acosta's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no idea what to do and was scared to death," Gragg told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim had waited outside and did not know a murder was taking place in Acosta's 
garage, said defense attorney Allan H. Stokke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kirn Kim was out of the garage when the incident took place," Stokke said. 
"Kirn Kim, I think you will see, had not a clue about what was really 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was beaten with baseball bats and forced to swallow rubbing alcohol. His 
nose and mouth were taped shut and he was buried in a shallow grave in Acosta's 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg told jurors that Acosta did not realize what the hole in the back yard 
was for until Chan ordered Tay's body placed in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan could be sent to prison for life without parole when he is sentenced this 
summer. Mun Bong Kang, 19, of Fullerton, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder 
and could face the same sentence for his role in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The four teens have been prosecuted as adults. A fifth defendant, Charles 
Choe, 18, of Fullerton, was prosecuted as a juvenile after he agreed to testify 
against the other teen-agers. He is expected to be released from the California 
Youth Authority when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe was the first witness to testify Tuesday and told jurors that Acosta and 
Kim were well aware that a murder was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants all attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. Tay attended 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan and Tay became acquainted while planning to rob an Anaheim computer-parts 
dealer, Choe told jurors. When Chan learned that Tay was lying about his name 
and age, Chan feared Tay was a police informant and decided to kill him, Choe 
said.

GRANDPARENTS TESTIFY IN DEATH OF INFANT BITTEN BY RAT; COURT: THE VEHICLE WHERE 
THE COUPLE'S 4-MONTH-OLD GRANDSON AND HIS PARENTS LIVED WAS INFESTED WITH 
ROACHES AND STREWN WITH TRASH AND SPOILED FOOD, THEY SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The grandparents of a 4-month-old boy who prosecutors contend died after being 
bitten more than 100 times by a pet rat told a jury Tuesday that the car the 
family was living in when the baby was fatally injured was cluttered with 
spoiled food, trash and cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandfather, Dennis Giguere, testified that he cleaned out the contents of 
the station wagon two or three days after the child's death and found rat 
feces, a rat nest fashioned from clothing and pieces of stuffed toys, gnawed 
baby formula caps, a chewed seat belt and cockroaches "just about everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by the defense how many cockroaches there were, Giguere responded, 
"I couldn't estimate. Hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of the baby, Steven Sr. and Kathyleen Giguere, are being tried on 
charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment for allegedly 
leaving Steven Jr. alone in the car with a rat who bit him more than 100 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant's grandmother, Dianne Giguere, testified that she and her husband 
also found half-filled baby jars, a half-eaten hamburger and two pillows, one 
lying next to the car in the Anaheim lot where the family had camped. She said 
the pillows were spotted with what she believed were bloodstains. She said the 
car did not contain a cage, food or water for the pet rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness for the prosecution, Dr. Richard Evans, the veterinarian who 
examined the rat after it had been captured and killed, said it was "moderately 
to severely" starved. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who is chief of veterinary services for the Orange County Health Care 
Agency, said the necropsy he performed showed that the rat had suffered erosion 
of its muscle and fat reserves. It also had an atrophied liver, an empty 
intestine and a stomach that was "completely packed" with clotted blood and 
skin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the parents asked Evans why he had not preserved the animal's 
tissues that other pathologists could examine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt firm in my diagnosis," said Evans, who concluded that the rat had 
eaten little or nothing for 72 hours before attacking the infant and had been 
malnourished for at least a week, possibly several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning, Evans acknowledged that he had made some mistakes in his 
original written report on the necropsy, which he later corrected. He said that 
he had written that the rat was starved on a scale of 1 to 2, meaning mild to 
moderate, when the evidence clearly showed that the animal's condition was more 
serious and should have been ranked 2 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 William Watson, a lawyer representing Kathyleen Giguere, said in an interview 
that the defense will seek to prove that the rat was not starving but living on 
all the food found inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also contends that the rat did not kill the infant because the 
child was already dead before it was bitten, possibly due to sudden infant 
death syndrome or a congenital breathing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Giguere said her stepson and his wife lived in slovenly conditions even 
before they, the baby and their 3-year-old daughter were evicted from an 
apartment in Anaheim. She said whenever she visited the apartment she found 
dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and on the counter, baby bottles filled with 
curdled milk, scattered beer and whiskey bottles, and dirty clothes piled in 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 48 hours before the baby's death, Dianne Giguere said, she alerted the 
county social services department of her concerns about the welfare of the 
Giguere children. But officials were unable to find the transient family to 
investigate the complaint.

FEES TO RISE FOR HEALTH INSPECTIONS; BUDGET: THE MONEY FROM THE INCREASES IS TO 
COVER COSTS, NOT TO BOOST COUNTY'S COFFERS, OFFICIAL SAYS. SUPERVISORS POSTPONE 
A VOTE ON THE PRICE OF ANIMAL BUSINESS LICENSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Fees for a host of county health inspections will increase between 6% and 31% 
on July 1, under a new fee schedule approved by the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Huston, the county's assistant director of environmental health, said 
the county would prefer not to raise the health inspection fees for 
restaurants, hospitals and hotels, but the costs of the inspections have gone 
up since the last fee increase two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's concern by us about the economy and the impact on businesses," Huston 
said. The money from the fee hikes is meant to cover the increasing costs of 
performing the inspections, not to be a boost to the general county budget, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee for most restaurant inspections will increase between 6% and 7%. The 
restaurant fee increase will comprise the bulk of the new revenue, contributing 
$402,322 of the $426,330 expected to be generated annually.  
</P>
<P>
 Other establishments such as tattoo and massage parlors will see their 
inspection fee increase 6.92%, from $130 to $139. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest increases are for surveys to determine if sewage is being disposed 
of properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspections for the cleaning of septic tanks and chemical toilets will go up 
to $112, which is 31.76% more than the previous fee of $85. A check on the 
sewage systems plan for a new parcel of land will rise 6.91% to $318. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also approved a 20% increase in the fee for quarantining a dog 
or cat after it has bitten or scratched someone. As of July 1, pet owners will 
have to pay $30, up from $25. 
</P>
<P>
 The only increases not approved by the board were those for animal businesses 
such as grooming parlors and rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner asked Judy Maitlen, the head of the county's 
animal control department, why the proposed license fee for grooming parlors 
was $85, up from $52. Maitlen responded that the $85 was comparable to the fee 
in other jurisdictions.  
</P>
<P>
 Steiner and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said they could not support the 
increase if it was being done for any other reason than to recover the actual 
cost of the licensing.  
</P>
<P>
 A date for the vote on the animal business license fees has not been set. 
Rising County Fees

health inspections. The new fees are effective July 1. 03,30,13,09 Current fee

CONSULTANTS TO STUDY AAA PLAN CONCERNS; DEVELOPMENT: COSTA MESA'S MAYOR SAYS 
TRAFFIC PROBLEMS WOULD RESULT FROM AUTO CLUB EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consultants will spend the next two weeks responding to concerns by Mayor 
Sandra L. Genis that traffic problems would result from a 500,000-square-foot 
expansion of the Automobile Club of Southern California, the deputy city 
manager said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday postponed approval of the project, after Genis, a 
professional planner, spent more than two hours criticizing the project's 
environmental impact report, the study of how a project will affect a 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said she doubts whether the EIR, performed by consultants for the city, 
accurately predicts the amount of traffic the development will draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the experts testified, I got the impression that they weren't sure 
themselves," she said during the meeting. The council majority voted for a 
two-week delay on the project, and asked Deputy City Manager Donald D. Lamm and 
traffic consultants to defend the traffic study in the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Club wants to double its office space at 3333 Fairview Road, to 
almost 1 million square feet. With an anticipated 2,509 employees, the Auto 
Club would become the city's largest employer. An independent study performed 
for the city has said the expansion could generate an additional $2.2 million 
yearly for local retailers and service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the certification of the EIR, the council could not consider the other 
approvals needed for the development, and decided to postpone consideration of 
the entire proposal until its June 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club vice president Peter R. McDonald said afterward that he was 
frustrated by the delay and that the traffic study had been completed for 
months. Genis said she had questioned the traffic consultants for months 
without getting answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamm said many of Genis' questions we asked for the first time Monday, leaving 
consultants at a loss for quick answers. He said consultants will return with 
the answers in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fairly confident that we can provide her the information that will 
satisfy her," Lamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, residents have challenged the proposed expansion of the Auto Club 
offices, arguing that it will open the way for excessive commercia growth in 
the north part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, local business leaders have hailed the project, saying it 
could attract more jobs, commerce and development. 
</P>
<P>
 And while residents and business people packed the council chambers to praise 
or critize the project Monday, they never got the chance to speak. Some said 
afterward the unexpected postponement makes the city look anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly the type of project this community and most communities truly 
desire,"said Charles C. Wilson, a manager for Southern California Edison and 
the chairman of the Economic Development Task Force, a joint project of the 
city and the Chamber of Commerce.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; SURFERS HAVE BALL WITHOUT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Party-goers celebrated surfing's colorful past and showed concern for its 
future at the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn.'s fifth annual Waterman's Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 guests, including celebrities, surfers and executives from 
Quiksilver, FreeStyle USA, O'Neill and other companies in the the beach 
lifestyle industry, came together Saturday in a rally for ocean health at the 
California Scenario Sculpture Garden in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-per-person gala netted $175,000 for three organizations dedicated to 
ocean preservation: the American Oceans Campaign, Orange County Marine 
Institute and the Surfrider Foundation. Surf's Up 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Bruce Brown, whose classic 1964 surf flick "The Endless Summer" made 
kids in Iowa long to ride the waves, was on hand to receive the Waterman 
Achievement Award for his contributions to the beach lifestyle industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun honoring Bruce. He really loves water sports, and he's brought that 
to the whole country," said Tom Knapp, event chairman and SIMA president. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said "Endless Summer" appealed to people everywhere because it was "fun 
and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I made the film was to give surfing the respect I thought it 
deserved," Brown said. "Surfers are good guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown recently released "The Endless Summer II." Proving he's still an 
independent spirit, he ignored the call for "creative black-tie" attire and 
showed up in a casual ensemble that included a navy sport coat with a frayed 
Hawaiian shirt, slacks and a pair of flip-flops.  
</P>
<P>
 He refused to refer to Robert (Wingnut) Weaver and Pat O'Connell, the two who 
embark on a surfing safari in the new movie, as co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not stars; they're surfers," he said. Both surfers/actors attended 
the bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in the movie "went beyond the dream-come-true status," Weaver said. 
Weaver, 28, grew up in Newport Beach and surfs every day near his home in Santa 
Cruz. He's handling his newfound fame with good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing 'Wingnut is a kook' written on a sidewalk is the biggest compliment to 
me, because it means a surfer took the time to do it," he said. Party On 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were women in dresses that fit them like a mermaid's skin and 
men wearing shorts with their tuxedo jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surf industry is a menagerie of different personalities," said Jimmy 
Olmes, vice president of SIMA. "Everyone makes their statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers wandered about the sculpture garden listening to jazz music, 
bidding on beach paraphernalia at a silent auction and sampling the 
well-stocked buffets. 
</P>
<P>
 The exotic menu featured red corn crab taquitos with pineapple dip, chilies 
stuffed with cream cheese and fried in beer batter, lobster ravioli with 
champagne butter sauce, pizza with sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts and 
chocolate bread pudding with tequila orange sauce -- all the work of Specialty 
Catering. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Danson, longtime star of the "Cheers" TV show and president of the 
American Oceans Campaign, made more than a perfunctory appearance; he arrived 
on time and stayed late. Danson said the SIMA bash is his favorite party of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the surfers are out with their babes," he said, "and they give us a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Danson has been a longtime supporter of ocean preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that happens on land -- whether farming with pesticides, lumber 
cutting, ozone depletion -- everything ends up reflected in the coastal waters. 
The ocean is the biggest game in town," he said. "(Ocean pollution) is not 
going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Danson said he occasionally gets together with his former "Cheers" co-stars, 
but each has gone in his own direction to follow careers and families.

 Although "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau refers to the Catholic church as 
blessing same-sex unions, most, but not all, of the claims of such unions point 
to rituals and practices of Catholics who later came to be identified with the 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Church spokesmen dispute the claims  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Roman Catholic teaching holds that homosexual orientation is not in 
itself sinful, but sexual activity outside a heterosexual marriage is 
considered a sin.

LAUGH LINES; MEN AND FOOD: IT'S A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I took my kids to the pool the other day and caught a glimpse of myself in the 
lifeguard's sunglasses. (A babe, I might add, so I was actually trying to suck 
in my stomach.) It was appalling. I was so bald, so fat, so white, I looked 
like the underside of Free Willy. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do middle-aged men get so sloppy? I think it stems from the way men eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Men eat foods that come in slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Slabs and mounds. A slab between two mounds, often yellowy mounds -- either by 
design or age. 
</P>
<P>
 This eliminates everything green, everything that swims and everything that 
might keep you alive past midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to buy food for a man: Just buy something with a large bone in it he 
can wrestle with, gnaw on, then walk away from the table with barbecue sauce 
and flecks of char stuck on his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are not like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Women dread it when a man says, "You wanna go for ribs?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's the last thing women want -- to be on display sucking sauce off their 
fingers and picking corn from their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are like cats: Eat a little bit, then leave the rest for later. 
</P>
<P>
 Men are like dogs. They eat everything in front of them. Men don't even taste 
the food. They simply want to finish as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Eddie, what was that thing you just ate, that thing that looked like a 
piece of fried stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. It was brown, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is a waste of time for a waiter to recite any of the day's specials to a 
table full of men. Whenever the waiter gets to the last special, say, "fresh 
sea bass, lightly battered and sauteed in a balsamic vinaigrette, with cilantro 
and basil, and a bouquet of garden vegetables almondine," a man, realizing he 
has run out of choices, will say, "Good. Gimme that, and put some nacho cheese 
on top, OK? And fries." 
</P>
<P>
 When men are finished with their food, they pause for a second -- so you'll 
understand that they are trying to act polite -- then they go around the table 
and eat the food from the women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You done with that?" a man will ask, grabbing your plate and eating your food 
with your silverware! 
</P>
<P>
 Women get their revenge by mixing their foods together. 
</P>
<P>
 Men hate this. God, how they hate mixed foods! 
</P>
<P>
 Men eat one thing at a time. Every man has a different order, but all men eat 
sequentially. Women eat randomly. They order premixed things, like risotto, 
then mix in more things. They comingle; they create. A woman's plate looks like 
an artist has painted it. A man's plate looks like Rin Tin Tin has licked it. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cocktail party, a woman will take something from this tray, something 
from that tray, put all these things on a small plate and nibble for the rest 
of the party. A man will go straight to the swinging doors and camp there, 
toothpick in hand, picking off whatever comes out on a tray. He will put 
nothing on a plate -- he isn't even holding a plate. Get him a shovel! 
</P>
<P>
 Women know this. And still, women care about how they look eating in front of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women don't eat at all on the first date," my friend Annie told me. "We don't 
want a guy to think we're pigs. We order something we can pick at; 
psychologically we're trying to show him that we're picky with food and we're 
picky with men -- also we don't want to give him the impression that if he 
stays with us, he'll wake up one day 20 years down the road and see he's 
married to Bossy the Cow. A woman never orders spinach on a first date, because 
it sticks to your teeth, and it's always there when you smile; never garlic or 
onion. Never order dessert either, or take a bite when he orders two." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you hungry?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starving!" Annie said. "The moment he drops you off, you head straight for 
the Haagen-Dazs and sit there in a housecoat, stuffing yourself just like . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 A man.

 Teen-Agers Staying Virgins Longer Than We Thought 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls are staying virgins longer than most adults think, according to 
a new report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alan Guttmacher Institute said Monday that 62% of adults assume the 
average teen-ager has sex before turning 16. But 70% of all boys and girls are 
still virgins when they reach 16, and 18% abstain until at least their 20th 
birthday, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among girls who do have sex before 15, 60% said they were raped or coerced in 
some unspecified manner, the institute said, quoting a 1987 study. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen sex "is not as widespread, and does not begin as early, as most adults 
believe," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, which studies reproductive issues and is affiliated with 
Planned Parenthood, based its report on research it primarily conducted in the 
1990s and the research of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-thirds of today's sexually active teens used some type of contraception 
the first time they had sex, and at least 70% use contraception regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adolescents account for 30% of out-of-wedlock births today, compared to 50% 
in 1970. Nail Polish Ranks No. 1 With Young Cosmetics Users 
</P>
<P>
 Fingernails are important to teen-age girls, judging by how much nail polish 
they use. Simmons Market Research Bureau surveyed 3,000 teen-agers and found 
that nail polish was their favorite cosmetic, with 71.6% of the young women 
saying they used it. Lipstick was a close second, used by 66.9 %, followed by 
mascara at 59.9%, eye shadow at 54.5% and blush at 49.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found working teen-agers are more likely to use mascara, blush 
and foundation makeup than those who don't work -- an indication that at an 
early age, women understand the importance of making a good impression on the 
job. Popular 'Power Rangers' Make Their Way to Kids Books 
</P>
<P>
 Grosset & Dunlap has published four chapter books for kids 6 to 11 years of 
age based on the popular TV program, "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." The 
titles are "It's Morphin Time!" by William McCay, "Megazord to the Rescue!" by 
Cathy East Dubowski, "The Terror Toad" by Jean Waricha and "Rita's Revenge" by 
Rusty Hallock. Each book costs $3.95.

RSVP; KEATON VANISHES AT 'AMELIA' SCREENING, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Enigma" was a word much heard in the lobby of the Directors Guild Theatre on 
Monday night as the audience for "Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight" pondered 
the mystery and appeal of the famous aviator who vanished on an adventurous, 
around-the-world flight in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 At the post-screening party, sky blue buttons with the slogan "I Saw Amelia 
Earhart" were handed out to promote the Turner Television Network movie, which 
will air Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guests didn't get to see the movie's star, Diane Keaton, an actress 
with her own brand of enigma. Keaton appeared in the lobby, empty of all but 
the press, for only a few moments some 20 minutes after the screening had 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by director James Foley, she had come directly from the set of 
"Unstrung Heroes," the movie she is directing, but was dressed to perfection in 
white with ropes of pearls. She walked the gantlet of flash cameras and replied 
to a question from a television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did it feel" to make the Earhart film? 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Keaton exited into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rumors she might return for the reception, but there was no 
sighting. Instead her co-stars Rutger Hauer and Bruce Dern were there to pick 
up the praise from the crowd, which also included the movie's writer, Anna 
Sandor, director Yves Simoneau, TNT execs Dennis Miller and Alan Sabinson, Dana 
Delany, Geoff Lewis, Donna Mills and a whole raft of agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the evening's most compelling character, Earhart, William Morris agent 
Steven Weiss said, "I think she's an icon, and luckily, a mystery, so people's 
perception of her can be molded." 
</P>
<P>
 Photos of Earhart, taken by the late Albert Bresnik, were on display in the 
lobby attracting much more attention than the '30s-style band playing in front 
of an empty dance floor. The crowd also concentrated on sampling the wide 
variety of food from a menu that followed Earhart's final flight from America 
through the Caribbean, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better eaten backward" was overheard as the notion of eating New York 
cheesecake before West Indian jerk beef, Nigerian moi moi and Malayan spring 
roll clearly wasn't one person's idea of a real adventure.

TV RATINGS; FOR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE WEEK, ABC IS NO. 1 
</P>

 Specials featuring top musical performers, soldiers and a runaway 14-year-old 
girl scored high ratings last week, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. data released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual edition of "The World Music Awards" last Tuesday, which 
featured performances by "the artist formerly known as Prince," Whitney Houston 
and Ray Charles, was the No. 6 program of the week among households, helping 
ABC to its eighth-consecutive weekly victory in the four-network race.CBS was 
second, NBC third and Fox fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also drawing a large audience in a head-to-head battle with the awards show 
was "Before Your Eyes: Kristin Is Missing," a CBS News special about a teen-age 
Michigan girl who ran away from home. The program tied with ABC's "Roseanne" 
and a special 90-minute edition of ABC's "Turning Point" focusing on D-day at 
No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis failed to provoke much interest 
in ABC's rerun Sunday of the first part of "The Kennedys of Massachusetts," 
which was trounced by CBS' rerun film "The Man With Three Wives" and NBC's 
"Love on the Run." Southland Ratings

RUNOFFS FORCED; O.C. INCUMBENTS END STRONG; ELECTION: BITTER NOVEMBER SHOWDOWN 
IS EXPECTED FOR WEIDER'S SEAT. FULLERTON RECALL APPEARS TO BE SUCCEEDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in Orange County on Tuesday set the stage for a bitter November runoff 
election to succeed retiring county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, while in 
primary election contests most incumbents surged to victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The major exception was in the city of Fullerton, where early returns showed 
voters favoring the recall of three City Council members who pushed through a 
2% utility tax last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high-profile race to replace Wieder in District 2, Huntington Beach 
Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson was locked in a close race with her council 
colleague Jim Silva and businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson. Silva was leading. 
</P>
<P>
 And in perhaps the state's nastiest battle for an Assembly seat, Irvine City 
Councilman Barry J. Hammond was neck-and-neck with Thomas G. Reinecke in the 
70th Assembly District Republican primary with about 15% of the vote counted. 
The third candidate, businesswoman Marilyn C. Brewer, trailed in the contest to 
replace Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who is stepping down to run 
for the state senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Jim Toledano 
in the November general election, the district's large Republican voter 
registration makes it likely that the seat will remain in Republican hands. 
</P>
<P>
 One of several potential election upsets seemed to be occurring in central 
Orange County in the Democratic race for the 69th Assembly District to succeed 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). There, Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. 
Moreno was leading Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, who won his party's nomination for state attorney general, had joined 
the Democratic Party leadership in endorsing Metzler as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side in that district, Anaheim businessman Jim Morrissey was 
leading Santa Ana businessman Virgel L. Nickell by a comfortable margin. The 
Republicans hope to win the seat in November and remove the Democrats from 
their only local legislative seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 46th Congressional District primary, Democratic Party leadership also 
saw its choice trailing in early returns. Santa Ana community activist Robert 
Banuelos led businessman Mike Farber for the right to challenge Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove). Banuelos, the Democratic nominee in 1992, lost to 
Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election season filled with strange twists and turns, voter apathy ruled 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6 p.m. check by the registrar of voters office showed that just over 19% of 
the electorate had shown up at the polls up to that point, indicating the 
turnout could be lower than in 1986 when 38% of the voters cast ballots -- the 
lowest turnout during the last 40 years before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a disappointing trend, to say the least," said Donald Tanney, the 
registrar of voters. "Especially when you read about people who stand in line 
for nine hours to cast a vote in some areas on this planet." 
</P>
<P>
 But local GOP Chairman Thomas Fuentes found encouragement in who he believed 
went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it holds that it is a low turnout, that should be good news for Republican 
candidates. Usually, the most loyal of voters is a conservative voter. We think 
the liberal voter is the one to stay home. In Orange County, mainstream voters 
are conservative voters," Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who did vote showed streaks of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republicans -- usually counted on in the November general 
election to deliver the winning margins for their statewide nominees for 
governor and U.S. senator -- cast a large protest vote against Republican 
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of the local GOP voters supported the come-from-nowhere 
candidacy of computer entrepreneur Ron Unz -- a larger margin than Unz was 
receiving statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In another local election surprise, three City Council members targeted for 
recall in Fullerton appeared to be losing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Westminster, where the firefighters union -- backed by fellow union 
members from around the state -- staged the recall to protest cuts in the Fire 
Department's budget, the council members apparently were surviving the recall 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 In other elections, Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), under investigation for 
alleged mishandling of campaign funds during his first campaign for Congress in 
1992, was holding back four challengers in a race that reached a boiling point 
in the final days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim was the only Orange County congressman facing a serious election threat 
during Tuesday's primary, with the other five Republican representatives easily 
defeating their primary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Other incumbents also appeared to be holding back strong challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race that would normally receive little attention, Municipal Court Judge 
Claude E. Whitney appeared to be defeating Yorba Linda attorney Dennis Patrick 
O'Connell. Whitney faces a misconduct allegation filed against him by the state 
Commission on Judicial Performance, stemming from allegations that he violated 
the constitutional rights of defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party, long the dominant party in local politics, seemed to be 
losing its strong bid to take over the nonpartisan county treasurer-tax 
collector's office. Democrat and incumbent Robert L. Citron, who has not faced 
an opponent since his first election 24 years ago, appeared to be beating back 
the challenge by John M. W. Moorlach, a certified public accountant and local 
GOP leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In contests for other seats on the Board of Supervisors, state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), easily won election Tuesday to replace retiring 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 The third supervisorial seat on Tuesday's ballot was that of incumbent William 
G. Steiner, who easily defeated community college professor Phillip L. 
Knypstra. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonpartisan races for county offices, if no candidate receives more than 
50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters compete in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent consolidation of the offices headed by County Clerk Gary L. 
Granville and County Recorder Lee A. Branch guaranteed that at least one of the 
two incumbents eventually will lose. Late returns showed Granville beating 
Branch, but without enough votes to avoid a runoff. Branch was censured by 
county officials for misconduct earlier this year.

VOTER TURNOUT AT POLLS COULD BE RECORD LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 California voters stayed home from the polls in numbers headed straight for 
the record books Tuesday, but don't blame Joe Davison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes before the polls closed Tuesday night, in the tiny mountain 
enclave of Follows Camp, Davison got in his Jeep, got on his citizens band 
radio, and badgered his neighbors -- all 140 or so who are registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to reach them . . . at around a quarter to 8 to remind everybody who 
hadn't made it to the polls," says Davison, owner of the Follows Camp mobile 
home park, which is in the San Gabriel Mountains above Azusa. "I think we got 
three more voters." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tiny precinct couldn't crack a 40% voter turnout no matter how hard 
Davison tried. And, as goes Follows Camp goes, so goes California. Ninety 
minutes before Davison took to the airwaves, acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller lowered his already dismal Election Day prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had predicted a pathetic, historic low of 39.8%," Miller said. "Based upon 
what we know right now, it could be closer to 37%. That would be the lowest 
turnout in a major election since we started keeping records in 1916." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County too appeared to be flirting with the record low turnout of 38% 
set here in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Warner, a supervisor at the Orange County registrar of voters office, 
said final figures would not be available until today, but "I would figure it 
would be about 40% of registered voters, which is what people predicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Whitehall wouldn't be surprised if the turnout was even lower than 
that. She has been a precinct worker for 35 years, all near Wilshire Boulevard 
and Western Avenue, and this election will be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since 6:30 this morning," Whitehall said as she sat in the 
polling place at James Barber Shop and waited grumpily for the voters to 
arrive. "It's been terrible. Out of 500 registered voters, we only have 100 
regular ballots. This is too much, to sit here all day." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for Frank Genardi, barbershop owner and violinist 
extraordinaire, "We'd all be bored to death," she said. "He plays classical and 
he plays modern and he plays the themes of the '40s when I could dance." 
</P>
<P>
 But can he explain a 20% turnout? He certainly cannot. "We gave 'em all that 
we usually give: happy faces, pretty music," Genardi insisted as the clocked 
ticked down to closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the lifeguard headquarters garage in Venice, another makeshift polling 
place, a disgusted Delilah Bolden waited for crowds that never arrived. "The 
weather's beautiful, but the voting's lousy. We don't have more than about 100 
who have voted already and it's 5 o'clock. We have about 600 voters. That's 
very low. It's nothing. I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some obvious reasons turnout was low in this election. This wasn't a 
presidential election year, and neither primary in either of the top two races 
-- for governor and for U.S. Senate -- ended up being very close. Also, none of 
the ballot propositions were of the sensational, high-spending kind that can 
draw voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 As Miller points out, it's not like this turnout is an aberration, a stunning 
drop in a stellar record. The last several elections have seen fewer and fewer 
people come out to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an historic pattern here," he said. "And there's not any single 
factor that's causing it. There are not a lot of hot-button measures on the 
ballot. The candidates for even the top offices haven't excited voters. More 
basic than that, people don't think it makes any difference who's elected. . . 
. People are giving up on the ability of the process to respond to the issues 
people face." 
</P>
<P>
 If Miller's prediction holds, less than one-sixth of California's population 
will have made decisions on the primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 p.m. Tuesday, only 15.72% of the registered voters in Los Angeles County 
had turned out at the polls, nearly 2 percentage points less than those who had 
voted by the same time in June, 1990, the most apathetic Election Day in county 
history, said Marcia Ventura, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County 
registrar-recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be even lower than the 37.7% in 1990," Ventura said. "It may be voter 
apathy. There may be nothing of interest to the voters on the ballot. It might 
be that the politicians have not campaigned enough. It's a difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
 In person-on-the-street interviews, no one said the dog ate the sample ballot, 
but excuses for not voting on Tuesday were right up there. "I'm underage," 
insisted one young woman as she headed toward her Civic Center bus stop. "I'm 
20." 
</P>
<P>
 Gently informed that the voting age was 18, she stopped and stared and found 
another reason: "I didn't even know you were supposed to vote today." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so how would he vote if he got to the polls on time? "I haven't really 
paid much attention," he said. "I'm too busy. I'll just vote what my conscience 
tells me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Culley was an even harder case. The overworked mother of a toddler was 
roused via CB by Joe Davison, her boss: "He was saying: 'OK, you guys, it's 
down to the wire. We gotta get going.' " Her response: "I have a 3-year-old 
daughter. I went from one eight-hour job to a part-time job. Cindy didn't have 
a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 In D&S Plaza, a Winnetka mini-mall, four election officials waited for the 
voters at a card table wedged between carpet rolls and vinyl tile samples at 
Valley Discount Carpet. By noon, they had processed 69 of 550 registered 
voters. And with hours to go before after-work voters would show, they did 
their best to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to look at all the pretty colors and pick out carpets for our 
earthquake-damaged houses," said Gloria Weber of Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about food, decorating, anything," added Ruther Chappell, also of 
Winnetka. "What do ladies talk about?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least one voter, however, apparently was willing to go to any extreme to 
vote -- anywhere, that is, except his neighborhood polling place in central 
Orange County. He told county officials he was afraid to cast his vote because 
of a high-voltage line located at his polling place. Could he go somewhere 
else? Sure, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I've heard everything," a clerk at the county office said.

SYBERT LEADING GOP FIGHT TO FACE BEILENSON IN 24TH; RACE: IN 41ST ASSEMBLY 
DISTRICT, SHEILA KUEHL, LOYOLA LAW PROFESSOR SEEKING TO BE FIRST OPENLY GAY 
STATE LEGISLATOR, WAS IN FRONT OF FIVE OTHER DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS. 
</P>

<P>
 A former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who bankrolled his campaign with $400,000 of 
his own money, and a feminist lawyer who highlighted her teen-age TV acting 
career in her campaign were leading in two of Tuesday's most closely watched 
and competitive primaries in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-fought GOP primary for the 24th Congressional District seat, early 
election night returns showed Richard Sybert, 42, who was director of Wilson's 
Office of Planning and Research, the front-runner in a field of five candidates 
seeking the right to run against U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
in the Nov. 8 general election. Banking consultant Robert K. Hammer was running 
a close second. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, seeking his 10th term, easily won Tuesday's Democratic primary 
running against Scott Gaulke, a candidate affiliated with extremist Lyndon 
LaRouche. The 24th Congressional District includes the western San Fernando 
Valley and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In another spirited race, preliminary returns showed Sheila Kuehl, 53, who 
played Zelda in the TV sitcom "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," leading six 
candidates running in the Democratic primary for the 41st Assembly District 
seat. The 41st District includes the western San Fernando Valley, Conejo 
Valley, Malibu and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Republicans in the 24th District primary covered the waterfront in 
ideology. But it was personal issues, not policy, that finally dominated the 
GOP contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, several of his primary election foes sniped that Sybert, a Calabasas 
resident, was a carpetbagger unfamiliar with the San Fernando and Conejo 
valleys. Voter registration records showed that Sybert established his 
residency in the 24th District in late 1993, only months before he entered the 
race for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also were raised about whether Sybert was the businessman he claimed 
to be. After years of practicing law and working in government, Sybert became 
president of a Santa Barbara-based toy design firm in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sybert entered the race with a bang. First, he decisively established 
himself as the fund-raising champ by loaning his own campaign $430,000, and 
next he secured a formidable string of Republican Party endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrayed against Sybert were Hammer, a resident of Newbury Park, who vowed to 
use his two decades of business experience to clean up waste in Washington; 
Emery Shane, 36, of Agoura Hills, a commercial real estate broker, who 
contended to be the candidate with the deepest roots in the district; Mark Boos 
Benhard, 28, a media consultant and former congressional aide from Agoura 
Hills, who was backed by his former boss, William Dannemeyer, an 
ultraconservative Orange County politician, and Sang Korman, 56, a businessman 
and perennial congressional candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the finish line came into sight, Sybert overcame his foes with slick 
campaign mailers touting his credentials and endorsements. Finally, he topped 
off this barrage with two pieces of literature -- one signed by retired L.A. 
Police Chief Ed Davis -- that contended Hammer had failed to vote in several 
previous elections and that Shane had fibbed about how long he lived in the 
district. Shane closed out the campaign threatening to sue Sybert for libel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic primary race for the 41st Assembly District seat was one of the 
area's most competitive electoral contests. Triggering this race was the 
decision by the incumbent, state Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) to 
seek a judgeship rather than reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six candidates for this seat had war chests large enough to 
finance extensive campaigns. In fact, Democratic voters in the 41st District 
were hit by a blizzard of candidate mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidates in the race ranged from Kuehl, a lesbian feminist 
from Santa Monica, to John Shallman, a business consultant from Encino who 
touted his ties to the Valley and to Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Shallman kicked up some dust at the end with a last-minute hit piece that 
blasted four of his opponents as Westside lawyers and singled out the more 
colorful portions of the quartet's views and personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Waging the most expensive campaigns were the 53-year-old Kuehl, a professor at 
Loyola Law School; William Rothbard, 43, a Pacific Palisades attorney, and 
Edward Tabash, 43, a Malibu attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, who told Democratic Party activists that she hoped to become 
California's first openly gay state legislator, spent more than $250,000 on her 
campaign while Rothbard and Tabash each spent more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, the only woman in the race, pitched herself to voters as a feminist 
activist who was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard, who sits on the board of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and 
was endorsed by several law enforcement groups, touted himself as a 
tough-on-crime environmentalist. Tabash, a leader in the abortion rights 
movement and a civil libertarian who has espoused legalized prostitution, 
staked out an identity as the candidate with the toughest platform on illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running was 53-year-old Pacific Palisades attorney Roger Jon Diamond, 53, 
a longtime anti-smoking activist and leader of several crusades to block 
coastal oil drilling, who pledged to bring an environmental sensitivity to the 
Assembly if elected, and Pat McGuire, 43, a teacher and businessman from 
Tarzana, who said he would not take campaign contributions from special 
interests and would seek to reduce taxes on residential property. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in the GOP primary in the 41st Assembly District were Peter Eason, 39, 
a banker, and Michael Meehan, 28, a reserve deputy sheriff and law school 
student. 
</P>

FUGITIVE SUSPECT IN AMY BIEHL DEATH IS CAUGHT, ORDERED HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fugitive 16-year-old boy who is one of four people charged with murdering 
American student Amy Biehl was caught Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, whose name has not been released, had been missing since skipping a 
court hearing in November.He was arrested Tuesday, and a judge ordered him held 
until an Aug. 15 hearing. He had not originally been jailed because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three suspects were released on $70 bail each last month. Their next 
court hearing also is Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd chanting racial slurs surrounded Biehl, a 26-year-old white Fulbright 
scholar from Newport Beach, after she drove friends to their homes in the black 
township of Guguletu last August. The four black defendants are accused of 
beating and stabbing her to death.

DECISION '94: THE PRIMARIES; VALLEY VOTERS TURN OUT TO POLLS IN DISMAL NUMBERS;

 California voters turned out in record low numbers Tuesday, but don't blame 
Joe Davison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes before the polls closed Tuesday night, in the tiny mountain 
enclave of Follows Camp, Davison got in his Jeep, got on his CB and badgered 
his neighbors -- all 140 or so who are registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to reach them . . . at around a quarter to 8 to remind everybody who 
hadn't made it to the polls," said Davison, owner of the Follows Camp 
mobile-home park, which is in the San Gabriel Mountains above Azusa. "I think 
we got three more voters." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tiny precinct couldn't crack a 40% voter turnout no matter how hard 
Davison tried and, as goes Follows Camp, so goes California. Ninety minutes 
before Davison took to the airwaves, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller 
lowered his already dismal Election Day prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had predicted a pathetic, historic low of 39.8%," Miller said. "Based upon 
what we know right now, it could be closer to 37%. That would be the lowest 
turnout in a major election since we started keeping records in 1916." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the way it looked at D & S Plaza, a Winnetka strip mall, where 
election official J. Belcher shook her head at the blase local acceptance of 
what is a treasured privilege in many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not been any great rush," she said sadly. "Those poor people in (South) 
Africa stood in line for days to vote." She was one of four officials who 
waited for the voters at a card table wedged between carpet rolls and vinyl 
tile samples at Valley Discount Carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, the group had processed only 69 of 550 registered voters. And with 
hours to go before after-work voters would show, the group did their best to 
pass the time pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to look at all the pretty colors and pick out carpets for our 
earthquake-damaged houses," said Gloria Weber of Winnetka.

Winnetka. "What do ladies talk about?"

<P>
 At the Studio City garage of Lois Toolan, David Wajsbord, 71, and his 
69-year-old wife, Estelle, broke up the afternoon monotony. They brought their 
total to 120 out of 841 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wajsbord, a Holocaust survivor liberated in 1945 by U. S. troops, voting 
is more than a choice between candidates and more than a civic duty. It is an 
affirmation of his belief in his adopted country and a confirmation of freedom, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote like someone (who) is called to the Army; it's something I 
must do," Wajsbord said as he walked into the booth. "When I go home, I feel 
much better. I feel like I accomplish something." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 73 of 919 registered voters had made it to the poll at Winnetka Street 
School in Winnetka by midday. Poll watchers with no one to watch eyed the door 
longingly, promising that the rush would come in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a nice Akita (dog) that came in by the name of Sumo," said election 
judge Gloria Harris of Winnetka. "That was a high point." 
</P>
<P>
 And the scene was not much different at the Studio City garage of election 
inspector April Howard, who has been an inspector since 1988 and an election 
official for six years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she is paid $45 for her time and the use of her home. She also got 
an extra $5 for attending a one-hour class in how to be an inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting up the booths, with all these bits and pieces, probably takes a 
couple of hours," she said. "Sweeping out the garage probably takes about four. 
. . . I started doing it because it was a nice way to feel good about doing 
your civic duty." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her neighbors didn't feel as strongly about their duties. Howard 
counted 74 voters out of a possible 614 at midday. "This is usually a very good 
precinct, but the whole thing's running very slow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Whitehall, a worker for 35 years at a precinct near Wilshire Boulevard 
and Western Avenue, said this election would be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since 6:30 this morning," Whitehall said as she sat in the 
polling place at James Barber Shop and waited grumpily for voters to arrive. 
"It's been terrible. Out of 500 registered voters, we only have 100 regular 
ballots. This is too much, to sit here all day." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for Frank Genardi, barbershop owner and violinist 
extraordinaire, "we'd all be bored to death," she said. "He plays classical and 
he plays modern and he plays the themes of the '40s, when I could dance." 
</P>
<P>
 But does he explain a 20% turnout? He certainly does not. "We gave 'em all

ticked down to closing time.

who have voted already and it's 5 o'clock. We have about 600 voters. That's 
very low. It's nothing. I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There are some obvious reasons that turnout was low in this election. This 
wasn't a presidential election year, which attracts higher voter turnout, and 
neither primary in either of the top two races -- for governor anS. Senate -- 
appeared to be ending up being very close. Also, none of the ballot 
propositions were of the sensational, high-spending kind that can draw voters 
to the polls.

 As Miller points out, it's not like this turnout is an aberration, a stunning 
drop in a stellar record. The last several elections have seen fewer and fewer 
people come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an historic pattern here," he said. "And there's not any single 
factor that's causing it. There are not a lot of hot-button measures on the 
ballot. The candidates for even the top offices haven't excited voters. More 
basic than that, people don't think it makes any difference who's elected. . . 
. People are giving up on the ability of the process to respond to the issues 
people face."

MOURNERS REMEMBER CANYON COUNTRY GIRL; FUNERAL: FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD JOKEMA DU BOIS 
IS EULOGIZED AT BURIAL. SHE DIED DRIVING CAR HOME FROM CHURCH WITHOUT 
PERMISSION.

 In her photo album, JoKema Du Bois, 15, kept a poem given to her by her 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins, "As long as we remain open with each other, we'll grow together." 
</P>
<P>
 The poem was read at Du Bois' memorial service Tuesday. The teen-ager died 
June 1 after losing control of her grandmother's car and crashing into two 
oncoming cars. Du Bois was not old enough to drive -- she had snuck out of the 
house with the keys to the car to drive to a church group meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others, including a 3-year-old girl, also died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard being a teen-ager," her grandmother, Mary McWilliams, said after 
the service. McWilliams was also Du Bois' guardian. She said she had given her 
granddaughter the poem to try to get across the message that the teen-ager 
should listen more closely to parental figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever tell you anything to hurt you," she said as if talking to Du 
Bois, "and no mother ever does. They're for your own good." 
</P>
<P>
 Her uncle, Ed Luster, who read the poem, said he hoped that the many youths 
attending the service would take the message to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "If JoKema had been listening, maybe none of this would have happened," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was eulogized at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall with 
more than 250 mourners, most of them students, filling the pews and standing 
along the walls inside the chapel. Those who knew her said that when their 
tears dried, Du Bois' constant laughter and smiles would be what they'd 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be upset with her, she could have done something stupid, and she'd 
say something totally off the wall and you'd just laugh at her," Luster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends from Canyon High School and the Canyon Country Assembly of God youth 
group echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one spirited girl," said Tom Hemrajani, a friend who had known Du 
Bois for the past two years and was one of her pallbearers. "She was always on 
the move, always happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois was driving home from the meeting with several other girls -- 
including her 14-year-old sister, Barbara -- when the car crossed the center 
divider of Seco Canyon Road and collided with two oncoming vehicles. She died 
at the scene and her sister remains in critical condition at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Also killed in the crash were Gena Watkinson, 15, and Jesica Noell, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth passenger, Alicia Acevedo, 14, remains hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the other vehicles were not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 A graveside service for Watkinson is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Eternal 
Valley. The 3-year-old will be buried in a private ceremony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said she will remember her granddaughter as a popular, open-minded 
person who bore none of the prejudices common in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't know anybody tall, short, skinny or fat," she said. "She didn't 
know the difference between black, brown or white. They were all the same to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnetta Jones, a youth minister at the church, performed a solo version of a 
slow, mournful song, "Don't Cry," during the service at the request of Du Bois' 
family. The tempo became more modern, but tears continued to flow as the song 
"It's Hard to Say Good-bye" by the soul group Boyz II Men came from a portable 
stereo at the outdoor burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Milliken, associate and youth pastor of the church, presided over the 
service. He told the mourners to be thankful for their memories of Du Bois and 
to think of her as still playing a role in the larger scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven has much laughter now," he said. "Much more." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial fund for the three girls killed in the accident has been 
established. Donations may be made to the Memorial and Medical Fund, in care of 
the Santa Clarita Elks Lodge, P. O. Box 1326, Canyon Country, CA 91351.

THURSDAY RULING IS EXPECTED ON PLAYBOY BAN; WORKPLACE: JUDGE QUESTIONS L. A. 
COUNTY'S POSITION THAT ITS POLICY IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ANTI-DISCRIMINATION 
LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge will declare Thursday whether the U. S. Constitution 
protects a Los Angeles County firefighter's right to read Playboy in the 
firehouse, even if county managers fear that such magazines create an 
unpleasant atmosphere for outnumbered women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a one-day trial in his courtroom on the subject -- including 
testimony that Playboy has female and blind readers who find the magazine 
worthwhile for its articles alone -- U. S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson 
indicated that he was leaning toward a ruling in favor of county Fire 
Department Capt. Steven W. Johnson, 49, who challenged the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was unable to show any requirement in federal anti-discrimination 
law "that supports this . . . policy of yours," Wilson told Les Tolnai, a 
senior deputy county counsel who defended the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to be the type of case that requires this type of First 
Amendment limitation," the judge said. He added that "evidence is persuasive 
that there are places in a firehouse that can provide a quiet place to read" 
Playboy or other such magazines without infringing on the workplace rights of 
women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a 27-year-veteran who lives in Corona del Mar, is represented by ACLU 
and Playboy attorneys in his fight to regain his right to read Playboy at his 
Lake Los Angeles station, in the far northeastern corner of the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexually oriented magazines were banned from all work locations -- including 
dormitories, restrooms and lockers -- under a sexual harassment policy in July, 
1992. Fire Department officials said the policy was needed to prevent a 
sexually charged environment for the department's 11 women firefighters, who 
must work with about 2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and his attorneys contended that the ban violated his constitutional 
right to read what he wants, and that while the department banned Playboy, it 
permits other controversial material, such as religious advertisements, to be 
posted at fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about thought control," ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman said. "The 
government can't regulate what men think about women . . . based on their 
desire not to have men think in a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 The county may have had good intentions, but the policy is vague and overly 
broad, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking to foist Playboy magazine on women who don't want to have it 
foisted on them," Hoffman said. "All Capt. Johnson is asking for is that when 
he has his private time, he wants to be able to read Playboy as he has been for 
the last 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tolnai countered, however, that the county had no choice but to enforce the 
ban to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. "This case is not about 
thought control," he said. "This case is about conduct control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The First Amendment does not provide the same type of protection in the 
workplace as it does everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Vaughan, a civilian county employee who helped draft the policy, 
testified that nude pictures of women at a county firehouse could create an 
undesirable atmosphere in which women would be viewed as sexual objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a small number of women in the Fire Department it's almost as if 
they are solo out there," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Vaughan was asked whether the ban would also apply to 
other magazines in which pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women had 
appeared, and copies of Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated were 
shown to her as examples. She responded that it would. 
</P>
<P>
 County Firefighter Janet Babcock, appearing for the county, testified that 
before the ban, nude magazines did indeed create such an atmosphere. "You had 
to put on a thick skin a lot of the time, go with the flow," Babcock said. 
"Sometimes I needed to be more on guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock testified that after the ban went into effect, her co-workers blamed 
her for depriving them of such magazines. She also said she did not tell any of 
her co-workers that she was testifying Tuesday because she did not want to have 
to defend her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock and another female firefighter submitted declarations to the court 
stating their opposition to lifting the ban. However, two other women 
firefighters filed declarations with the court contending that they had no 
objections to the presence of such magazines in fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides also presented social psychologists as expert witnesses on the 
effect of magazines containing pictures of nude women on men and women in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Daniel G. Linz testified on behalf of the county that he was particularly 
concerned by this month's issue of Playboy, which featured pictures of nude 
women firefighters in other departments titled "Some Like It Hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa J. Natale, a marketing director for Playboy, testified that a Braille 
edition is available for the blind and submitted a declaration that about 
325,000 women subscribe to Playboy, forming about 12% of the magazine's 2.7 
million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's wife Cathy, who attended her husband's trial, said in an interview 
that she's with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to read it too," she said. "I know a lot of women who read it."

'BRIDGE TO NOWHERE' IS FINALLY OPENED 
</P>

 Canyon Country's "Bridge to Nowhere" finally goes somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, dozens of city and county officials gathered at a spot overlooking 
the Santa Clara River to officially open Whites Canyon Bridge -- a project that 
had become a highly visible embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the last four years, the bridge over the river led from Whites 
Canyon Road on one side to nothing but an expanse of dirt on the other. The 
construction project, which started in 1988, came up short of completion funds 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so many calls asking, 'When is that damn thing going to be done?,' " 
said Jo Anne Darcy, a field deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich and a Santa 
Clarita city councilwoman. "It just became a county joke for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 The project soon took on its popular nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were numerous newspaper articles over the years about the 'Bridge to 
Nowhere' and the frustration of local residents," said Donna Guyovich, 
spokeswoman for the county public works department. "That's why we were just as 
happy as the residents (to see it open), if not more so -- to stop taking that 
teasing." 
</P>
<P>
 The project had been on Los Angeles County's highway plan since the 1960s and 
was considered critical as Santa Clarita's population ballooned in the 1980s. 
Its chief purpose was to provide direct access to Sierra Highway and the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, allowing traffic to avoid Canyon Country's busiest 
intersection: Soledad Canyon Road and Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerous delays -- led by a drop in new construction that dried up tax 
revenues -- stalled construction, making the project an easy target for 
criticism by people who've seen it as nothing more than a multimillion-dollar 
dead-end for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction finally resumed in September, 1990, and was completed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of the $27.4-million project, politicians wanted to look on 
the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning, the bridge that was called the 'Bridge to Nowhere' will be 
called the 'Bridge to Everywhere,' " Antonovich said during the grand opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, the joke still had some life left. 
</P>
<P>
 As Antonovich was chauffeured over the route as its first passenger in a 
bright red 1958 Corvette provided by the Santa Clarita Valley Corvette Club, 
one watcher quipped that the car was new when construction began. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this rate, we're all going to be retired by the time they open another 
road," said Jack Curenton, leader of a Santa Clarita citizens group that has 
clamored for city road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Witticisms aside, many residents are simply happy to be able to use the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind it all and over it all, I hoped they would finish what they started 
planning 25 years ago," said Jack Ancona, a local transportation activist. 
"We've been waiting for this for so long; everybody on this side of the valley 
is going to want to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction delay had some benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 When Metrolink suddenly found itself needing to expand its Santa Clarita route 
after the Northridge earthquake, improvements to the Whites Canyon Road 
crossing could be made without having to work around a busy road. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor George Pederson, although reluctant to criticize the project, 
expressed the hope that the city had learned an important lesson for future 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have the money, when we start them, to be able to finish them."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; COUNCIL PANEL VOTES AGAINST PRESCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel voted against a proposed Northridge preschool 
and day-care center Tuesday and supported an appeal by neighbors who fear the 
school will create traffic problems in the residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Planning and Land Use Committee voted 2 to 1 to support the 
appeal of neighbors who want to halt a proposal by Fernando and Sherri Segre to 
convert a home on Devonshire Street to a preschool for 36 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the North Valley Homeowners Assn. said the preschool would 
create traffic headaches and set a precedent that would allow other commercial 
projects into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the place for a preschool," said Dennis Smith, a neighbor who 
called the project a "commercial intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Patrick McDonaugh said there is an abundance of preschools 
in the area. He said a survey by the homeowners group found that there are 35 
other preschool or day-care centers within three miles of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sherri Segre tearfully asked for an opportunity to show that her preschool 
would not cause a problem. Her proposal called for a review of the project 
after one year, at which time the city could impose more restrictions or close 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are our future and I ask you to look into the future," she said, 
choking back tears. "I'm pleading for you to give me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick said she would support the school if the number of 
children were limited to 24 instead of 36. By law, Segre can have day-care for 
12 children without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilmen Hal Bernson and Richard Alatore voted to support the appeal. 
Bernson said he feared the preschool would set a bad precedent for the 
neighborhood. The entire council will have the final say on the project June 
22. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; SHOPPING CENTER WINS APPROVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council gave final approval Tuesday to a $50-million, 
250,000-square-foot shopping center in Northridge, despite an appeal by 
neighbors who want limits on the operating hours of a proposed supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimous vote gives the go-ahead for construction of a 
51,000-square-foot Vons supermarket, 24,000-square-foot Spectrum Club health 
club and 40,000-square-foot Linens N Things bed and bath store at Shirley 
Avenue and Plummer Street near Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 9.6-acre shopping center will also have a three-story parking lot 
with more than 1,200 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Kapor, on behalf of neighbors, had appealed the project to the City 
Council, hoping that the proposed 24-hour supermarket would be required to 
close at 11 p.m. daily. But no neighbors testified at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area, said that Kapor's appeal had 
no legal grounds and that the council was not permitted to vote to change the 
store hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the developers, Northridge Pavilion Associates, said they are 
hoping to get permits within 30 days and complete construction by the fall of 
next year. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE RETURNS WITH 100 SUMMER COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a disastrous plunge in enrollment linked to last summer's scaled-back 
curriculum, Pierce College is again offering a wide range of summer classes 
beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 100 courses, summer offerings at Pierce this year will be 
almost four times that of last summer, when Pierce administrators nearly 
canceled summer school because of a funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move may have hurt the school even more because enrollment -- which 
helps determine how much state funds community colleges receive -- dropped 
15.5% between the fall of 1992 and the fall of 1993, the college's largest loss 
on record, said William Norlund, vice president of academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't offer summer school, it sounds like you have problems in the 
minds of the public," Norlund said. "People would rather go to a school that 
doesn't have problems. We feel that one of the reasons our enrollment dropped 
in the fall was our lack of many summer classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will begin two weeks earlier than usual, giving crews four weeks to 
repair earthquake damage to the campus library between the end of summer school 
July 22 and the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Norlund said the school still has openings in some English and math classes, 
as well as in accounting, art, business and other subjects. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; SENIORS' PRANK SEEN AS BRUSH WITH THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Graduating seniors of Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino scrawled a goodby 
message curb-to-curb on a street next to their school, earning a tolerant 
reaction from their former principal, but drawing a reproach from Los Angeles 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Before graduating Sunday, an unidentified group of seniors painted "Celts '94 
Seniors" across Santa Rita Street next to the Catholic school -- a section of 
road scheduled to be resurfaced next week, said Father Fred Tillotson, 
principal of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "As graffiti goes, it's rather in good taste," Tillotson said. "I know that 
the students were aware that the street was going to be repaved, so there would 
be no permanent damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The markings included the painted words Bye, Mrs. Brown , a farewell to a 
popular English teacher who leaves for a Peace Corps assignment in Slovakia 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The would-be artists ran out of paint, however, before they could finish their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite its mildness, the painted message was condemned by police as 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still marking city property," Los Angeles Police Capt. Val Paniccia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the road, we don't want people following this example. It would be 
preferable for them to show their sentiments with something like a banner."

 A Pasadena man gave emotional testimony Tuesday about an April shooting that 
occurred after a traffic altercation on Angeles Crest Highway and led to the 
loss of his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Milovic, 51, said he passed out after pieces of shrapnel hit him in the 
left cheek and a bullet went through his right eye, causing his red Corvette to 
go over a berm and travel about 70 feet down a hillside. 
</P>

 Michael Shinkman, 50, of Palmdale is charged with attempted murder, mayhem and 
shooting at an occupied vehicle in the April 25 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinkman, an auto mechanic for the Los Angeles Police Department, is being 
held in County Jail in lieu of $555,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Municipal Judge Barbara Lee Burke, after hearing testimony during a 
preliminary hearing, ordered Shinkman to appear June 22 for arraignment in 
Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Milovic testified that he was traveling south on a section of Angeles Crest 
Highway about 10 miles north of Foothill Boulevard that is known for its tight, 
winding curves, when he came upon Shinkman, who was driving about 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinkman pulled over to let Milovic pass, Milovic said, but then suddenly 
veered around the Corvette and pulled in front of him, blocking the southbound 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Milovic testified that he started to pass Shinkman's green Plymouth on the 
right shoulder when he noticed that Shinkman was holding a gun and wearing a 
blue jacket with a Los Angeles Police Department logo on the sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put my hands up against the window so he could see them because I thought 
he was a policeman," Milovic said. "Then he started shooting. I know that the 
window shattered and two shots hit me for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Charles Araujo, who was off duty at the 
time, witnessed the shooting after he pulled to the side of Angeles Crest 
Highway to help motorists involved in what he thought was a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Araujo said he happened on the scene just as Shinkman was standing outside his 
car pointing a gun at the Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Daniel Huswitt asked Araujo if Shinkman's hands were shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I observed a controlled shooter who was taking aim at a target, and then 
correcting his stance and absorbing the recoil before continuing to shoot at 
his target," Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke denied a motion by Huswitt to dismiss the attempted murder and mayhem 
charges after he alleged that Milovic had tailgated Shinkman in "a 
cat-and-mouse situation that had created reasonable fear in Shinkman's mind."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; DISTRICT APPLIES FOR PRESCHOOL GRANT 
</P>

<P>
 School officials are applying for a $1.3-million federal grant to provide 
preschool programs for about 300 low-income children that would include 
"twilight sessions" scheduled four days a week from 4 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The later sessions, which would be held in addition to 3 1/2-hour morning 
sessions four days a week, are designed to help working parents become more 
involved in their child's education, said Georgia McAninch, director of child 
development programs for the Glendale Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district is awarded the grant, classes would be held in the existing 
Head Start facility at Pacific Avenue and Riverdale Drive, and also at the 
district's Cerritos and Franklin child development centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant would help the district provide activities, meals, and medical and 
social services to low-income children from the age of 3 until they enter 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Administering a Head Start program would be a natural extension of the 
district's child development programs, McAninch said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a waiting list for children to enter one of the district's four 
preschools, which serve about 400 students. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DEBRIS REMOVAL SERVICE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles will extend its free service of removing earthquake 
debris for residents, a public works official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 How long the service will be offered depends on how long the state Office of 
Emergency Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency are willing to fund 
the program, said Andres Santamaria, a manager in the Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to offer the program through Sept. 30, but the state and 
federal agencies are evaluating whether the program should be extended that 
long. The city is spending about $450,000 a day to provide the service and 
anticipates it will have spent $28.9 million by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has committed to reimbursing the city for that amount. Los Angeles now 
wants a commitment for an additional $79 million extend the program through the 
end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indications are that we will get funding through Sept. 30," Santamaria 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Spellman, a deputy to Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said there continues to 
be a demand for debris removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had calls from people saying, 'I haven't started (reconstruction) 
yet; my insurance or FEMA money hasn't come yet; I haven't been able to get a 
contractor,' " Spellman said. "Residents were welcoming this extension." 
</P>
<P>
 The city began the debris pickup program to relieve the burden on earthquake 
victims and to help speed the recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 To have rubble removed, residents can call (800) 498-CITY. Haulers usually 
arrive within seven days of the request and will pick up bricks, drywall, wood, 
asphalt, concrete and other building materials. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOTEL OWNERS SPLIT ON PROSTITUTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue of how to weed out customers who may be prostitutes divided 
Sepulveda Boulevard motel owners who attended a meeting Tuesday at the Carriage 
Inn in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can operate a motel if we have to get a driver's license for 
everybody who rents a room," said Lloyd Levine, owner of the Cabana Motel, 
"because, unfortunately, people who aren't married to each other want to use a 
motel now and then. That's been part of the innkeeper business for years." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that we have been checking IDs forever," said Harold Peskin, 
manager of the Carriage Inn. "We've been in business 30 years. They can't say 
it's going to put the motel out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the motels present at the meeting have been ordered to check 
identification and hire security as part of 27 conditions imposed by the Los 
Angees city Zoning Department to alleviate prostitution and other illegal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The motels include the El Cortez, the Cinema, the Town House and the Bali Hi. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners also were concerned about stopping men who sneak in with a prostitute 
and then leave, allowing the prostitute to use the room to turn more tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a problem, you can call us and we can come out there and take 
care of it," said Los Angeles Police Officer Joe Losorelli. "If they are not 
registered, they can be evicted from the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Losorelli said, police are working on a list of known convicted 
prostitutes that could soon be circulated among local motels, allowing them to 
tell if their customers are prostitutes simply by checking their 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of a new mapping program initiated by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office in April, motel management could call police to arrest these 
prostitutes simply for being on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some motels bemoaned having to take more responsibility for the 
problem, most of the 10 motel owners attending Tuesday's meeting realized it 
will take more than complaining to ease the problem of crime near their 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we can do is just be a little more careful of who we rent to," said 
Levine. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS NOT JUST A BEAT FOR THIS OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's far from being Granada Hills' typical Citizen of the Year. For one thing, 
Rick Gibby doesn't live in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, he didn't receive the Chamber of Commerce's highest award for 
being a philanthropic businessman or saving a beloved park from condominium 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 He got it for being a good cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I was recognized as a part of the community even though I don't 
live in the community meant a lot to me," said the Santa Clarita resident, who 
has worked in Granada Hills for five years. "People don't call me Officer Gibby 
anymore, they call me Rick." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year Los Angeles Police Department veteran is a senior lead officer at 
the Devonshire Division and, in the words of one local activist, "is like the 
father of community policing in the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Becky Lohnes Leveque, chairwoman of Operation PROTECT (Porter 
Ranch Organized to Eliminate Crime Together), the Devonshire district has 
become a model for community policing -- due in large part to the efforts of 
Gibby, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 "He truly cares about the people he serves," Leveque said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibby is the creator of a number of innovative, community-based policing 
programs, said attorney John Weitkamp, who serves as the chamber's legal 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 He began an early version of Operation Sparkle, which brings residents 
together to clean up their streets and stores, removing graffiti and clearing 
brush. He spearheaded a volunteer surveillance team, which has helped make more 
than 100 arrests in a couple of years, and developed a popular business watch 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of his community-based programs helped reduce crime by 60% in one 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of those programs are now employed throughout the Valley, city and 
even throughout the country, Weitkamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gibby, if "community policing" is the latest in a confusing line of 
official catch-phrases, its meaning is simple: "Narrowing the gap between the 
Police Department and the community. "We're taking on problems together," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to residents, however, Gibby spends more personal time taking on 
those problems than most people who call the area home. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Leveque and Weitkamp told of one instance when Gibby, on his way home 
from work, spotted a broken window at a business. Instead of calling his 
station to report the damage, he climbed through the broken glass, picked up 
the telephone and called the owner, waiting there until the owner arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he calls the Devonshire Division his "second home," Gibby admitted 
that "my wife would probably tell you it's my first home." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the fact that he is the first non-resident to receive the honor and 
the first police officer, being Citizen of the Year for 1994 was especially 
poignant for Gibby, he said. The award was named for longtime community 
supporter Gil Benjamin, who died last year, and to whom Gibby has dedicated the 
remainder of his law enforcement career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's served at several stations throughout the city, Gibby said that 
whether he lives there or not, he plans to spend his last three years before 
retirement at the Devonshire Division. In fact, he insists on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will spend it there, or I won't be sticking around." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; MOVER SENTENCED FOR OVERCHARGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Pacoima-based moving business has been ordered to do 25 days of 
community service and pay a $2,700 fine after pleading no contest to 
overcharging earthquake victims for moving belongings out of their damaged 
homes, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was imposed Monday on Jeronimo Maldonado, 32, of Pacoima by Los 
Angeles Municipal Judge Barry Taylor, who also placed Maldonado on three years 
summary probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence requires Maldonado to do the community service either on a state 
Department of Transportation work crew or in the PACE program, a graffiti 
removal operation run by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado, who does business as Maldonado Trucking, was working as a 
subcontractor for L. A. Moving Storage & Distribution Inc. of Arleta, at the 
time of the offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of L. A. Moving Storage & Distribution, Thomas J. Smith, 42, of 
Van Nuys, was sentenced to 20 days community service last month after pleading 
no contest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Maldonado were accused of overcharging earthquake victims in the 
Sherman Oaks area for transportation, parking and labor in the days following 
the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado pleaded no contest to one count of making false and illegal 
statements and three other counts that violated the Public Utilities Code, 
according to Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham, who handled the case. JEFF

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY ELIGIBLE FOR ADDED QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News of an additional $908,000 in federal earthquake recovery aid for the city 
of San Fernando has sent officials scrambling to meet a deadline only two weeks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the type of thing that can put San Fernando back on its 
feet," City Administrator Mary Strenn said. "The most important thing is we get 
it out into the community as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials learned late last week that the city was eligible for 
supplemental Community Development Block grant funds available through the Los 
Angeles County Community Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city was given a June 16 deadline by which officials must draw up and 
submit a list of projects for which the money would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "These funds are very targeted," Strenn said, explaining that the money can 
only be used for earthquake relief not covered by aid from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency or Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, city officials might want to use the money to make repairs on 
Truman Street, which suffered damage while being used as a detour during the 
earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would like to see if it is possible and, by possible, I mean 
something that is not too complex or cumbersome, to see if there (is) bridge or 
gap financing available for businesses in the community," Strenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that some of the money might be used to help businesses that 
were turned down for SBA loans. However, city officials do not yet know what 
the rules are for applying for the federal money or what projects are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will attend a county-run training session on how to apply for 
the funds Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the City Council approved the hiring of a consultant -- at no 
more than $10,000 -- who would help with the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has received about $600,000 in federal earthquake aid of the 
$9 million promised. This is in addition to the $908,000 city officials learned 
of last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount came as something of a surprise to the city. "We are quite pleased 
with the allocation," Strenn said. ED BOND

COUNCIL GIVES PRELIMINARY OK TO LANDMARK ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to an ordinance that would 
for the first time enable Burbank to designate its own historical landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, places such as the downtown Burbank post office and the Bob's Big 
Boy restaurant on Riverside Drive are recognized as historically significant by 
state and federal agencies, City Planner Rick Pruetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process, right now, is out of the city's control" because the city has 
never had an agency authorized to make such designations, Pruetz said. "The 
designation process is something the city plays no role in." 
</P>
<P>
 If given final approval next week, the proposed law would go into effect as 
early as July. The ordinance would allow the city to form a five-member 
commission to deal with preservation issues, and to establish procedures and 
criteria for the process of selecting landmarks. Prospectives sites include 
Burbank City Hall and Bellarmine-Jefferson High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners would need approval from the commission before demolishing or 
altering the appearance of a landmark, but no site could be designated a 
landmark without the property owner's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the ordinance 4 to 0, with some hesitation from 
Councilwoman Susan Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanos objected to two elements of the proposed law, one of which is a 
requirement that the commission be made up of two nominees selected by the 
Burbank Historical Society, two by the Burbank Chamber of Commerce and one by 
the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the ordinance," she said. "I just don't support what I consider to 
be overburdensome clauses in the ordinance."

DEPUTIES HUNT THROUGH COMPUTER RECORDS TO IDENTIFY BETTORS; GAMBLING: THEY HOPE 
THAT NAMES WILL BUILD STRONGER CASE AGAINST KALE KALUSTIAN, THE ALLEGED 
RINGLEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies who broke up what they called the largest sports betting 
ring in Southern California in recent years began searching seized computer 
records Tuesday for the hidden identities of the ring's bettors, looking for 
help in finding more bookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrests we made (Monday) are not the end of the arrests we will make," 
said Lt. David Kading of the vice detail at the sheriff's Special 
Investigations Bureau. "As we obtain more information, we will attempt to 
arrest more people in the Kalustian ring, or what is left of it, and who comes 
in to take their place." 
</P>
<P>
 The sports bookmaking operation was crippled Monday, authorities said, when 
sheriff's deputies swept through five counties and arrested 17 people, 
including Kale Kalustian, who deputies allege was the leader of a criminal 
enterprise that netted $5 million a month. Authorities said Kalustian, 65, of 
Granada Hills earned "the lion's share" of the illicit profits. Two men 
identified as Kalustian's top aides, both from the San Fernando Valley, were 
among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they seized $82,408 in cash from five locations, including 
$34,099 from Kalustian and $29,791 from an alleged lieutenant, Walter Miller. 
They also seized computers, financial ledgers, cellular and regular phones, and 
tape recorders they said were used to record the bets and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the bettors, often encoded, are believed to be listed in those 
records, Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'll be doing now is following up with as many of those bettors as we 
can identify to see if they will cooperate with us" in locating other 
bookmakers who may rush in to fill the void left by Kalustian's arrest, Kading 
said. "We will also use this to build a tighter case against Kalustian." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said illegal bookmaking is so widespread that they hold out little 
hope that the operation will remain dormant for long. But the information in 
the seized records "may take us to other organizations," Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NBA finals start (tonight) and the bettors will be looking for a place to 
make their bets. They have an addiction, an inner compulsion to drive them to 
bet, and they will be looking. Because of human frailty, people want to bet. So 
they will find a bookmaker or a bookmaker will find them. It just goes on and 
on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Tuesday that they suspect that Kalustian has been involved in 
sports betting operations for at least 10 years, taking over at least partial 
control of a bookmaking operation previously run by Ron Sacco, a San 
Francisco-based bookie who authorities allege ran the largest sports betting 
scheme in the world until his indictment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco is in federal custody awaiting trial on charges of operating a 
$1-billion-a-year international bookmaking operation. He was indicted along 
with 25 alleged associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian and at least one of his alleged associates, Ron LaForgia, 42, were 
charged along with 11 others in 1986 with running a similar, but smaller ring. 
</P>
<P>
 All 17 people arrested Monday were booked for investigation of conspiracy to 
commit bookmaking and were being held in lieu of $200,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the current ring began nine months ago, and there had 
been more than a dozen arrests prior to Monday. Kading said the ring 
specialized in taking bets on horse races, and professional and college 
basketball and football. The clerks allegedly took bets from a variety of 
locales and phone numbers to make it more difficult for investigators to locate 
their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the operation was believed to be run by Kalustian out of his 
home in the 12000 block of Bambi Place, Kading said.

DEATH PENALTY SOUGHT IN 1989 KIDNAP, MURDER; COURTS: JURY WEIGHS LIFE IN PRISON 
OR EXECUTION FOR TENNESSEE MAN CONVICTED LAST MONTH OF SLAYING IN NORTH HILLS.

<P>
 Citing the convicted killer's lengthy and violent criminal history, a 
prosecutor asked a jury Tuesday to sentence a Tennessee man to death for the 
execution-style slaying of a man who was abducted as he left a Studio City bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ronald Boscaino has not been deterred by society's intervention and attempted 
rehabilitation," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan D. Chasworth, reciting a list of 
his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 After convicting Boscaino, 32, of murder last month, a Van Nuys Superior Court 
jury is now trying to determine whether he should be executed or spend the rest 
of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 To sway the panel toward the death penalty, the prosecutor promised that the 
jury would hear details of Boscaino's 20-year string of crimes, beginning when, 
at the age of 12, he forced an 8-year-old boy to perform oral sex on him at 
gunpoint. The victim in that 1974 incident in Tennessee was the first witness 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony also came from a 32-year-old woman who said she was with Boscaino 
and several other teen-agers in 1978 when an elderly man was brutally beaten in 
Tennessee. Margaret McIntoch testified that Boscaino used a boat paddle to hit 
78-year-old Virgil McGill in the back of the head, striking McGill so hard that 
the paddle broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasworth also said Boscaino committed a 1985 robbery and assault in Georgia, 
then fled to New York state, where he and his brother brutalized two men in a 
hotel room. The prosecutor said one victim was forced to perform oral sex and 
the second was sodomized during an incident that lasted at least six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Boscaino was convicted of first-degree murder last month in the death of 
Sheldon Oppenheim, who was gunned down in his North Hills residence Sept. 24, 
1989, after he was kidnaped from a parking lot, taken to his apartment and 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying occurred during a two-week crime spree by Boscaino and his 
27-year-old brother, Vincent, who was also convicted of Oppenheim's murder and 
is scheduled to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 During the brother's trial, two witnesses testified that Ronald Boscaino 
bragged about the killing to two friends in Tennessee, then threatened to kill 
anyone who went to authorities, saying "I'm going to hell anyhow," according to 
Chasworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chasworth said her office decided to seek the death penalty only in Ronald 
Boscaino's case because he was the one who actually shot Oppenheim and because 
he had tried to kill another kidnap victim shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Boscaino abducted Tory Christopher on Oct. 4, 1989, from the same Studio City 
parking lot where Oppenheim was kidnaped. Christopher testified that he was 
forced into his car, where Boscaino found Christopher's gun under the seat. 
Boscaino shoved the barrel into Christopher's mouth and pulled the trigger, 
Christopher testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun did not fire, apparently because Boscaino could not figure out how to 
disengage the safety, and Christopher escaped. Boscaino was convicted of 
attempted murder in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Fefferman did not make an opening statement Tuesday. 
He declined to comment on the case outside court.

COUNTY DEPARTMENT SEEKS TAX TO KEEP PARKS OPEN; REVENUE: THE ANNUAL FEE IN 
UNINCORPORATED AREAS WOULD RAISE $9 MILLION. MOST SUPERVISORS HAVE INDICATED 
OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Short of funds to operate nearly a third of Los Angeles County's parks, 
officials have decided to propose that all homeowners who live in 
unincorporated areas of the county pay a new annual tax of $24 apiece to 
prevent the parks from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approves it, the tax would 
raise about $9 million annually, more than enough to keep open 37 of the 121 
county parks now slated to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the county Department of Recreation and Parks have said they 
would have to close the parks and eight public swimming pools unless 
supervisors restore a proposed budget cut of $8.1 million, or 23% of their 
department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to reject the tax 
proposal or hold public hearings on it in July. Most of the supervisors have 
indicated that they oppose the tax, but it is unclear how the board would make 
up the budget shortfall without it. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities on the chopping block in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys include El Cariso and Veterans Memorial parks in Sylmar, 
Apollo Park in Lancaster, Del Valle Park in Castaic, Dexter Park in San 
Fernando, Hasley Canyon Park in Saugus, Pearblossom Park in Pearblossom and 
Northbridge Park in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 About 375,000 property owners in the unincorporated areas of the county would 
pay the tax, according to two studies previously commissioned by the parks 
department. All homeowners would pay the same $24 fee, regardless of the size 
of their dwellings. Vacant property would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the county cannot tax homeowners in one area to pay the full 
cost of facilities used by a larger group of people. The two studies estimate 
that residents in surrounding incorporated cities use the threatened pools and 
parks about two-thirds of the time. Thus, the proposed tax on unincorporated 
county residents would only pay their share, about a third of the operating 
costs of the threatened parks and pools. The rest would have to be paid by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax is adopted, it would be the second fee increase in two years for 
parks. In November, voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition A, which created 
a $540-million countywide assessment district -- including both county and city 
residents -- aimed at improving parks and beaches, acquiring open space, 
constructing recreation facilities and preventing graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of homeowners, particularly in the Antelope Valley, were incorrectly 
charged tax increases under Proposition A that ranged from several hundred 
dollars to $54,000. Parks officials said they do not anticipate similar 
glitches if supervisors adopt the current proposal because it would be levied 
uniformly on all homeowners, instead of being based on the number of improved 
acres.

$2-MILLION BAIL STAYS FOR SUSPECT IN RAPES; HEARING: ARRAIGNMENT IS SCHEDULED 
JUNE 20 FOR A WOODLAND HILLS MAN CHARGED WITH 37 COUNTS THAT ALSO INVOLVE 
KIDNAPING AND CHILD MOLESTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge refused to lower bail of $2 million for a Woodland Hills man accused 
of abducting and sexually assaulting four women and girls in the west San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leland B. Harris came during a hearing 
in which the arraignment for Howard August Davis was delayed until June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Monday, prosecutors charged Davis with 37 felony 
counts stemming from four separate attacks in which the victims were abducted 
off the street and taken to isolated locations. Davis is accused of raping two 
18-year-olds and a 17-year-old. He is also charged with kidnaping and sexually 
molesting a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're extremely serious offenses, therefore the person who commits such 
offenses is an extremely dangerous person," Deputy Dist. Atty. Martin L. 
Herscovitz said. "That's why bail was set so high." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said $2 million was a "conservative" bail, adding that he 
could have asked for bail to be set at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is charged with kidnaping for sexual purposes, rape, forcible oral 
copulation, sodomy, digital penetration and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is convicted on all charges, Davis would face more than 300 years in 
prison, Herscovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Davis did not formally deny the charges in court, defense attorney 
Peter L. Knecht of Los Angeles said his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a devastating charge -- 37 counts," Knecht said. "But he indicates to me 
he's not guilty (and) he wants to go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 29, a self-employed painter and the son of a Beverly Hills police 
officer, kept his head lowered during the short proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things look bleak, but McMartin looked bleak," Knecht said, referring to the 
ill-fated McMartin preschool case where none of the seven people indicted on 
charges of molesting children was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said Davis and his family are "devastated" by the 
charges. Davis is a longtime Valley resident, Knecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said solid police work and some luck led to Davis' arrest Friday, 
five days after he allegedly molested the 10-year-old. The arrest followed the 
distribution of composite drawings of the suspect and a description of a small, 
light-colored pickup truck used in all four attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a quick look at the composite; it doesn't look at all like him," 
Knecht said, showing reporters a photocopy of a drawing depicting a man with 
facial features similar to Davis', but portraying a suspect who appears to be 
Latino. Davis is white and has strawberry blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Davis without incident near Ventura Boulevard and Sale Avenue 
on Friday night, two days after investigators began to suspect that a serial 
rapist was attacking young females in the West Valley.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CLAS CASE COULD RETURN TO COURT; EDUCATION: 
STATE OFFICIALS MAY SEEK ANOTHER ORDER REQUIRING DISTRICT TO GIVE TEST EVEN IF 
JUDGE'S DECISION IS APPEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Concerned that the Antelope Valley Union High School District could try to 
sidestep a court order mandating that it administer the disputed CLAS test, the 
state Department of Education might take the matter back to court. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued a tentative 
ruling ordering the district to give the test, Department of Education 
officials said Tuesday that they may seek another order requiring the district 
to give the test even if it appeals the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping we could have less hassle than this but apparently that's not 
the case," said Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The department filed a lawsuit last month against the high school district in 
the wake of an April 20 decision by the conservative majority of its board to 
not administer the statewide assessment exam, which has been praised as a 
revolutionary method of testing students' critical thinking skills, and blasted 
as intrusive and secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was given this year to about 1 million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 
10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne ruled Monday in favor of the department, saying the Education Code 
clearly requires the district to give the California Learning Assessment System 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board decides to appeal Wayne's ruling, the appeal would stay her 
decision and could allow the district to avoid giving the test this school 
year, which ends next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley school board is scheduled to meet with its attorneys in 
closed session tonight to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Billy Pricer and member Sue Stokka said Tuesday that they 
support appealing the ruling. Pricer, calling the department's latest move 
"childish" and a "power play," said: "Get it in the appellate court and let's 
get a clear-cut decision on what the Education Code says." 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of the board agree to abide by the ruling and give the test 
without an appeal, Symkowick said the department may not return to court 
Thursday. But the department is also concerned that the district would try to 
stall by seeking parental consent before administering the test, something 
Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien ruled unnecessary in an unrelated case last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the board wishes to let us know these aren't going to be issues to put off 
the test (we won't go back to court)," Symkowick said. "If they won't, we're 
going to appear Thursday morning and see if we can get an order ordering them 
to give the test immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as the legal wrangling continues, time is running out for the 
school district to administer CLAS to its 10th-grade students. The school year 
ends June 15, with final exams scheduled for the last three days of class. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-grade CLAS exam is recommended to be given over several days, 
although Department of Education officials said it could be administered in as 
little as six hours if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of subjecting students to a full day of testing so late in the 
school year has caused even the two members of the school board who support 
giving CLAS to question the validity of any results. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Wilda Andrejcik, who with trustee Bill Olenick has consistently 
voted in support of administering CLAS, said all the publicity about the test 
may have an impact as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the students) won't take it seriously and that concerns me because we 
would like to have it as a valid test," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 1,006 school districts in the state, including a second Los Angeles 
County district, have decided against administering the 1994 CLAS test. 
Antelope Valley is the only school district that the state has taken to court 
over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Symkowick said that in light of Monday's court ruling, a letter was sent to 
the five other districts asking them to follow the "spirit of the ruling" and 
give the test. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials declined to say what action they would take if the 
other districts continue to refuse to administer the test.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CAMPUS SECURITY INCREASED FOLLOWING FIGHT

 Additional sheriff's deputies patrolled Saugus High School during the 
mid-morning break and lunch Tuesday following a fight between students the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight Monday broke out around 10 a.m. at the end of the mid-morning break, 
said Sheriff's Deputy John Hudson of the Santa Clarita Valley station.No 
students were seriously injured, but deputies used pepper spray to control one 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20 students participated in the fight, but only those responsible 
for starting it were taken into custody. The fight followed a confrontation at 
a weekend party, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four additional deputies were on campus Tuesday to make sure that there were 
no further disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have beefed up our security," said Richard Obar, assistant principal. "Our 
kids are tense, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten students were taken into custody on suspicion of battery or disturbing the 
peace, sheriff's officials said. Eight were released to their parents, but two 
were sent to Juvenile Hall because they were on probation for previous criminal 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the students have been suspended for at least five days, Obar said. He 
said the school may seek to expel some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight was not gang or racially motivated, according to school and 
sheriff's officials.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER BUDGET HOLDS LINE WHILE HIKING 
POLICE SPENDING 7%; SERVICES: CUTS IN COMMUNITY GRANTS AND FOUR LAYOFFS WILL 
MAINTAIN LAST YEAR'S LEVEL OF $28.7 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council approved an operating budget for the coming fiscal year of 
$28.7-million -- almost identical to the current budget. But because law 
enforcement spending has been boosted by 7% in the new budget, some departments 
-- including public works, which will have to lay off four employees -- will be 
taking cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The total share going to law enforcement and community safety programs is 
$10.6 million, primarily for police services provided by the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. That total includes $50,000 originally earmarked for the 
city's community grant program, which funds local nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds will be transferred to the law enforcement account for programs to 
crack down on auto theft, juvenile crimes, graffiti, residential burglaries and 
traffic offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will leave the community grant program with only half the funds it has had 
in the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in law enforcement funding was made by the council, which 
unanimously approved the budget Monday night, even though a report issued in 
February showed that the number of major crimes actually decreased in Lancaster 
in 1993 compared with 1992. But at candidate forums prior to the April 12 
election, residents made it clear that crime was probably their upmost concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being cut in the new budget are funds for the city clerk's office, but 
city officials said that was because it does not have the expense of an 
election in the upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be cutbacks in community development planning because, city 
officials said, of the slowdown in development. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the layoffs will be from the public works department, Assistant City 
Manager Dennis Davenport said there would not be a noticeable cutback in 
services to the public. He said the jobs being eliminated were those of 
engineers and inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget actually calls for the elimination of 10 full-time jobs and one 
part-time position, but most of them had already been left vacant over the past 
year after workers retired, transferred or quit. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, the council also rejected a last-minute plea from the 
local American Red Cross chapter, which sought $100,000 to help finish its new 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members applauded the project but said the city could not afford to 
give the agency the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have made me bleed inside because we can't do what you want us to do," 
Mayor Frank Roberts said. "It's almost like I'm voting against God, country and 
motherhood when I vote against the Red Cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they would consider giving the Red Cross a portion of the 
funds left in the community grant program. They also offered to help the 
organization raise funds from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Skvarca, chairman of the Antelope Valley Red Cross chapter, said the 
organization has already raised $500,000 to put up the roof and exterior walls 
of a 6,000-square-foot building at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale. The building 
will be able to withstand an 8.0 earthquake and will be the focal point for 
aiding victims of a quake, flood or other disasters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization needs another $250,000 to finish the interior, Skvarca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have been happier if they had given us the line item in the budget," 
Skvarca said. "But I respect where they're coming from."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN PLEADS NO CONTEST IN BOMBING

 A 70-year-old Monrovia man pleaded no contest Tuesday to charges that he 
exploded a pipe bomb underneath his ex-wife's unoccupied pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Edwin Smith, who made his plea in Superior Court, is expected under 
terms of a plea bargain to be sentenced to four years in state prison for 
felony use of a destructive device and stalking in violation of a restraining 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plea agreement is accepted when he is sentenced June 28, three other 
felony charges filed against him will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea bargain upset Smith's ex-wife, Rini Duzanne, who said the April 18 
explosion in front of the Lancaster home of Duzanne's daughter was one of many 
such acts of harassment that she has had to endure since leaving Smith six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed they're only going to lock him up for four years," said 
Duzanne, 51. "He'll get out in two. He's been hunting me for six years. I'll 
have two years of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Smith been convicted of all five counts -- including explosion of a pipe 
bomb beneath Duzanne's motor home, making terrorist threats and possessing the 
materials to make a destructive device -- he could have faced as much as 20 
years in prison, according to his attorney, Michael C. Eberhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of evidence against him," Eberhardt said. "At his age, he 
didn't want to risk (a sentence of) 15 to 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Duzanne was concerned, even two decades would not be enough. "I 
think they should lock him up forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duzanne said that she was with Smith for 10 years, including six years of 
marriage, and that he was abusive to her throughout. When Duzanne finally 
decided to leave him, she said he promised to harass her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I would never get away with leaving him," she said. "The man's a 
maniac. Normal people don't go around trying to kill people."

 With at least 73 species wiped out statewide, California is called the 
country's "epicenter of extinction" by one environmental group. The grizzly 
bear may grace our state's flag, but it hasn't roamed our hills for more than 
70 years. The California condor used to cruise the skies above the foothills 
around the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, but the population has 
become limited to a sanctuary in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though more than 30% of the vertebrate species in the United States are 
located in California, the Golden State has twice the number of federally 
listed endangered species of any Western state. Development and the spread of 
urbanization into wildlife areas have led to the destruction of habitat and 
reduced the numbers of birds, other animals and plants, leaving some species 
with uncertain futures. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there's no hope of bringing back the extinct, there is a chance for 
the dwindling numbers of threatened species. From Tujunga Wash to the Santa 
Clara River to the desert fringes beyond the Antelope Valley, species in short 
supply are protected by the state's Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. Along with candidates for listing, the state agency 
tracks dozens of species of "special concern" -- those whose numbers are 
dropping but aren't yet considered candidates for listing.  
</P>
<P>
 * Receiving Protection 
</P>
<P>
 Number of species in California on state and federal threatened and endangered 
lists, as of April, 1994. Some species are on both federal and state lists. 
Currently 17 are proposed for state or federal listing: State-listed 
endangered: 44 
</P>
<P>
 State-listed threatened: 30 
</P>
<P>
 Federally listed endangered: 58 
</P>
<P>
 Federally listed threatened: 27 
</P>
<P>
 * Listing Species 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone can file a petition with the state Department of Fish and Game 
suggesting that a species be listed as threatened or endangered. The procedure 
is similar for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A species is considered 
endangered if it's in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant part 
of its range. A species is listed as threatened if it's likely to become 
endangered within the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the petition is filed, agency has 90 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 If agency biologists agree listing should be considered, the species becomes a 
"candidate species" and a proposed rule is drafted within the first year after 
the petition is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the draft proposal is published, there is a 60-day period for public 
comment and collection of additional information. 
</P>
<P>
 Once species is listed as threatened or endangered, agency issues regulations 
to protect it. Agency then issues regulations to protect listed species. The 
killing, capture, export, import, harm, harassment and sale of protected animal 
species are prohibited. Violation is a federal offense, punishable by both 
civil and criminal penalties of fines and/or one year in jail. For a species on 
the state list, the maximum fine is $5,000. For a species on the federal list, 
the fine can rise to $50,000.  
</P>
<P>
 * Identifying Species of Concern A sampling of species in the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys considered endangered, threatened or of 
special concern; most exist only in small numbers in these areas: 
</P>
<P>
 Least Bell's Vireo 
</P>
<P>
 Vireo Bellii Pusillus  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: On federal endangered list since 1986; endangered in California 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Once abundant in wetlands and riparian scrub statewide, now found 
locally in small numbers only near Santa Clara River. Few sighted at Hansen Dam 
and Tujunga Wash. Threatened by habitat destruction and cowbirds, which take 
over vireos' nests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distinction: Distinctive song questions "cheedle cheedle chee?" and answers 
"cheedle cheedle chew!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Unarmored Threespine Stickleback 
</P>
<P>
 Gasterosteus Aculeatus  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: On state and federal endangered lists since 1971 and 1970, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Creeks in riparian woodland. Water connecting two schools of fish 
in Santa Clara River in San Francisquito Canyon has been threatened by roads 
and grading for development, which silts up river.  
</P>
<P>
 * Distinction: During breeding season, a male stickleback changes from its 
normal drab greenish brown to blue and brilliant red. A males courts a female 
by performing a "zigzag dance" and is responsible for building the nest and 
watching over the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mohave Ground Squirrel 
</P>
<P>
 Spermophilus mohavensis  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: After nearly 23 years on the state threatened list, it was approved 
for removal from the list. But on May 20, a judge ordered a 30-day stay on the 
delisting, meaning it stays on the list for the time being. If the delisting is 
approved, it will be the first time a species is removed from a threatened 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Creosote bush scrub and Joshua tree communities in western Mojave 
desert, including Antelope Valley. Main threats are urbanization and off-road 
vehicle use, which damage and destroy its habitat. The growth of Palmdale and 
Lancaster accounts for dramatic declines in its population. 
</P>
<P>
 * Factoid: Spends about seven months a year underground in hibernation, due to 
lack of its primary food of seeds and desert vegetation. The remaining five 
months are spent eating and procreating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Swainson's Hawk 
</P>
<P>
 Buteo swainsoni  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: On state threatened list since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Riparian forest, dry land areas. No longer nests in Southern 
California but small flocks migrate through on the way back to the Central 
Valley from their winter home in South America. Used to nest in the San 
Fernando Valley about 70 years ago, and a small number still do in the Antelope 
Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 * Distinction: One of the only "polymorphic" birds of prey, in which 
individuals vary in color and appearance. Eats many large insects, munching 
mostly on the wing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Western Yellow-Billed Cuckoo 
</P>
<P>
 Coccyzus americanus occidentalis  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: This rarely sighted species has been on state endangered list since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Prefers willow woodlands in river valleys. Although there are no 
confirmed nestings or population locally, migrants have been sighted in Santa 
Clarita in the last few years. South fork of the Kern River is its largest 
remaining stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distinction: Feeds on insects and occasionally on fruit and frogs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southwestern Pond Turtle 
</P>
<P>
 Clemmys marmorata pallida  
</P>
<P>
 * Status: Species of special concern with few habitats left in state due to 
silted-up or polluted rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Ponds in riparian areas. Population exists in Santa Clara River, 
small numbers in Mojave River, although it is normally absent from desert 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distinction: May become aggressive when challenging another turtle for 
basking spots such as logs, rocks or floating vegetation.

THE GOOD COP; AS PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE UNION, DANNY STAGGS SAYS HE TRIES TO 
TAKE THE HIGH GROUND DURING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a fine mess Danny Staggs has got himself into. Seated in the audience at 
the Wilshire Theater's Ebell Club, he is surrounded by hundreds of protesters 
who hammer the floor with picket signs and shout taunts at Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Up onstage and clearly flustered, Riordan yells into a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the folding chairs around Staggs, gray-haired women with proper hats 
glare at the demonstrators and squawk: "Hooligans! You're acting like 
hooligans!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be an opportunity for the mayor to present his budget to 
supportive neighborhood associations in the mid-Wilshire area. Now, as the 
meeting wobbles toward riot, a ruddy-faced man takes the stage and issues a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 If the protesters don't settle down, he says, he's going to ask the uniformed 
police officers hovering on the sidelines to clear them out -- an interesting 
proposition, since the protesters are off-duty cops themselves, many still 
strapped with their 9-millimeter handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't good," observes Staggs, who, as president of the Los Angeles 
Police Protective League, is at once a city employee, a police officer, and the 
boisterous throng's elected leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cops, in fact, would probably find a domestic dispute at Tom and 
Roseanne's place more appealing than Staggs' current assignment: guiding a 
police union through contract negotiations in the problematic realm of 
post-riot Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride over to the demonstration last Wednesday, union spokesman Geoffrey 
Garfield sums things up: "This is not a job. This is punishment for something 
he did in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 So it would seem. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs stepped straight into a fusillade of controversy last December when the 
7,557-member Los Angeles Police Protective League threw out its previous 
president and elected him. 
</P>
<P>
 Morale was already dismal. Ticket writing and drunken driving arrests dragged. 
Veterans were bailing out in substantial numbers. On top of that, the ACLU 
challenged the Police Department because so many officers live outside the city 
limits; female officers leveled sexual harassment charges at the department; 
and critics challenged certain physical fitness tests at the academy as 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the matter of two officers allegedly opening fire on a Highway 
Patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, underlying that turmoil, is the fact that for two years the force 
has gone without a contract or cost-of-living pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the city and the union finally negotiated a deal -- a 3% hike this 
year and next. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great contract, but it's a fair contract," Staggs said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the union rejected the agreement 3 to 1, and dissidents attacked the 
president for his audacity at even bringing it to them, beginning a recall 
process that still hangs over Staggs' head. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-day blue flu followed, along with threats of similar wildcat 
activities during the impending World Cup games. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which fit into the picture of police life a little boy envisioned 40 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs was born and spent his early years in the Carolinas but moved to South 
Gate at age 8, with his recently divorced mother and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 With their father out of the picture, Danny and his older brothers Barry and 
Kenneth turned to a neighbor for male guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a father figure to me. I admired him," Staggs says. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the neighbor was a cop, and one by one, the Staggs brothers 
became cops, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after joining the LAPD, Kenneth and Barry began working with the 
Protective League (motto: "Protecting Those Who Protect Others"). Both 
eventually were elected to the board, as they rose through the department 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 As Danny worked his way from division to division, though, he found that his 
familial connections didn't always serve him well with management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed that every time I went somewhere for an interview . . . it was 
like, you're wasting your time, you're one of those Staggs brothers. 
Consequently I felt, well, I guess if I can't (be) promoted, I'd better get 
more involved in the League. It seems to be the only place I can be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs -- who is married and has two adolescent sons and a 12-year-old 
daughter -- began working with the League as a delegate, representing officers 
in job disputes. He worked full time as a board member for five years, before 
stepping up to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 His office, in the Protective League's distinctly unstylish digs on the 
fringes of Skid Row, displays a photograph of Staggs when he walked a Downtown 
beat through what cynics referred to as "wine country." Standing in a stiffly 
starched uniform, he writes a ticket to a man passed out cold on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the usual oak-framed, cop memorabilia -- badges, handcuffs, 
commendations -- Staggs' office is a gallery of awards and trophies he won in 
amateur track and running competitions. That physical prowess served him well 
during five years as a fitness and martial arts trainer at the police academy. 
And that experience worked to his benefit come league election time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-five percent of the force went through the academy when I was there," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that recognition hasn't been enough to save the white-haired president 
from the brutal criticism that came in May, when he handed his constituents the 
contract the league leadership and city had worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the way negotiations have gone," says Officer Gary Morgan, who quit 
the union negotiating team and launched the recall campaign against Staggs, 
just before members voted down the deal. "Most of the problems have occurred 
because of the lack of leadership Staggs has shown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs dismisses the recall effort as par for league presidents. He calls 
Morgan an aspirant to the union board who's looking to make a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I'm not aggressive enough to the public," says Staggs as he steers a 
rented Ford down 8th Street toward the demonstration at the Ebell. "Well that's 
my personality. That's my style. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to emphasis that point, Garfield edges in behind Staggs' words. 
</P>
<P>
 The League's former president was very aggressive, he says. "He had the look 
of the stereotypical cop. Big. Gruff. But when you have leadership like that, 
who do you then turn to? For every bad cop you've got to have the good cop. 
It's always best to have the leader be the good cop." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, spokesman Garfield says, has now positioned Bill (Get In Your Face) 
Harkness -- an outspoken, old-school type listed as one of the Christopher 
Commission's problem officers -- as the bad cop in the contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the city can always go to the responsible president, who is diplomatic . 
. . urbane," Garfield says. "That's Danny." 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs seems comfortable in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 "My projection on television and my projection to the public has to be 
different than the projection of an angry police officer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the neat gray suit and cellular phone, Staggs can't quite shake 
the personna that tends to come with so many years piloting black-and-whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haight Ashbury's a little north of here buddy," he quips when a disheveled, 
longhaired man appears on a side street, strolling barefoot down the double 
yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
 As he passes a vast sidewalk display of wrenches, pliers and screw-drivers, he 
can't help but comment: "Some mechanic's missing a lot of tools right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs' war stories -- "put your hands up or I'll blow your brains against the 
windshield," he tells one rapist-armed robbery suspect -- are as dramatic as 
any Joseph Wambaugh spins. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is fully aware that he serves the League at a pivotal moment in the 
city's history, when the force is at a watershed between vastly different 
Chiefs, different styles of policing, and quickly changing attitudes and 
expectations within the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, as well as the inherent difficulty of representing cops in 
contract disputes, become apparent as he pulls up to the demonstration outside 
the Ebel Club on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators, reflecting a multicultural melange of pent-up anger, aren't 
budging as they wave signs: "No Contract, No Police," shout slogans -- "We want 
bucks, Riordan Sucks!" -- and bluster militant. 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful the mayor's private-sector employees ever confronted him so 
rudely. 
</P>
<P>
 And judging from their outraged expressions, some of the guests from the 
area's mansion-infested neighborhoods had assumed that a labor union is what 
happens when the maid and butler have a fling -- certainly not something in 
which their nice neighborhood policeman would engage. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs pumps hands and accepts back slaps as he works his way into the 
building: "Good job, Mr. President . . . " "Hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Staggs opposed a department sickout, and a judge later issued an 
injunction, banning the League from such activities. So last week's blue flu 
was a wildcat action. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staggs refuses to see it as a mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have supported last week's action if he could have, he says, adding 
that he opposed last year's blue flu only because he thought it was premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I reach back into my holster and the holster is empty, we had our guns 
taken away back in November, when (the court) laid its order on us." 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits in the back of the Ebell Club, Staggs is concerned that his members 
maintain a delicate balance -- that they show the swarms of television cameras 
their outrage, without becoming outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, guys," he mutters sotto voce, like a coach watching from the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows that the membership's patience for his moderate tact has worn 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the demonstration goes pretty much as planned. After Harkness and 
other designated speakers have their say, the protesters file out peacefully, 
joking with their uniformed counterparts, chuckling when a police helicopter 
swoops in and lets out a siren chirp. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive back, Staggs is upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important for the mayor to see that anger. He's never seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the anger remains contained, he says, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe there are officers who will resort to any action. It can get out 
of control. But they have to remember that first of all they're police 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, as the union and city agree to bring a mediator into their 
negotiations, Staggs' confidence in a settlement has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the rank and file's frustration undiminished, and the city's budget 
unchanged, the League's designated good cop remains balanced on a very thin 
blue line.

A FRANK DISCUSSION; YES, HOT DOGS ARE A HIGH-FAT, GUILTY PLEASURE. BUT A 
CONNECTION BETWEEN FRANKFURTERS AND CANCER IN KIDS? SAY IT AIN'T SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First it was Alar on the apples in Mom's apple pie. Then it was pesticide 
residue in the milk from mother's breast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're supposed to worry about the last remaining all-American food: the 
humble hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in time for the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 As icons go, the hot dog's halo has been slipping for some time. Decades ago, 
frankfurters were identified as a leading cause of choking death among young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 They became even more of a guilty pleasure when federally mandated food labels 
confirmed hot dogs' high-fat, high-sodium constitution. In 1992, the federal 
government included hot dogs on a list of foods that can be hazardous if not 
fully cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 So it comes as no surprise that these slippery pink logs of unspecified animal 
innards are not health food.  
</P>
<P>
 But -- hot dogs and leukemia?  
</P>
<P>
 That's the relationship being investigated in the wake of recent findings by 
USC researchers, who compared the hot dog intake of 232 Los Angeles children 
who developed leukemia to a matched group of children who did not. 
</P>
<P>
 According to USC epidemiologist John Peters' report in a cancer research 
journal, children who eat more than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the 
normal risk of developing childhood leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other reports in the same issue of Cancer Causes and Control suggest that 
children born to mothers who ate at least one hot dog per week while pregnant 
have twice the risk of developing brain tumors, as do children whose fathers 
ate too many hot dogs before conception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, wasn't it just last week we had that popcorn scare?" says Lon 
Rosenberg, who proudly oversees hot dog concessions at Dodger Stadium. "Now 
they're after Dodger Dogs! Enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, I ate at least a dozen dogs a month at the ballpark. 
And I'm sure my kids eat that many now," Rosenberg says. "If there was anything 
wrong with that, my friends at Farmer John would've warned us, wouldn't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sure would, say the folks at Farmer John, who make Dodger Dogs. They, like the 
dozens of other hot dog manufacturers, are steamed about all the media 
attention over what they call an "obviously flawed" study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't have released the study," Farmer John spokesman Ron Smith 
says. "It doesn't do any good. Why cause such a ruckus?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust me, we never meant to cause a ruckus," says Peters, still reeling from 
the reaction to research quietly published last March. "We never set out to 
indict hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dietary exposure to processed or cured meats was part of a little side 
questionnaire to our study on (electro)magnetic fields. We were as surprised as 
anyone by the hot dogs findings. . . . It was the biggest risk for anything we 
saw in the study -- about four times the risk for EMFs." 
</P>
<P>
 Any cancer in children is considered very rare. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
strikes only about three in every 10,000 children, so even a ninefold increase 
still presents a relatively small risk.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some health experts, including Peters' group, suggest that children 
reduce their consumption of hot dogs and other processed foods -- such as 
bacon, ham and bologna -- until more is known about the danger.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, no one knows what the connection is between hot dog-heavy diets and 
childhood cancer, or even if it is a cause-and-effect link. "Is it the mustard 
or the ketchup or the relish or the . . . bun? We operate in a state of 
ignorance on such questions," Peters says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the ingredients in a typical hot dog sandwich is a known 
carcinogen -- and that is nitrite. The preservative, which has been found to 
cause cancer in animals, is added to hot dogs to protect consumers from 
botulism and other nasty, even life-threatening bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Proper cooking would kill most of those germs, but the dogs are often eaten 
raw -- especially by kids. Because the government considers processed meats 
"fully cooked and ready to eat," some packages do not warn consumers to cook 
them further. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk from bacteria appears to be far greater than that from nitrites, so 
substituting one of the various nitrite-free brands on the market may pose 
different hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pediatricians, including Dr. Nick Roulakis of Arcadia, say studies such 
as Peters' validate his family's decision to avoid cured meats altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not a crucial part of our diets," Roulakis says. "In fact, we know 
that complex carbohydrates like pasta and cereals are much better for children, 
as well as for adults." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For ease of preparation, cost-per-serving and fun-per-bite, hot dogs may well 
be the perfect food. "For two-career '90s families with picky eaters like 
mine," says Eileen Marsh of Los Angeles, "I'm not sure I can even imagine life 
without hot dogs. . . . I haven't told the kids yet. I'm going to wait till we 
finish off this last pack in the fridge." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the Fourth of July?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just as patriotic to eat healthy hot dogs," says Eric Hawkins, a buyer 
for Wild Oats Community Market in Pasadena. "We've got a nice supply here of 
tofu-based Smart Dogs and Soy Boys. Very nice on the barbecue. . . ."

 Did the Roman Catholic church ever bless homosexual unions in ritual 
ceremonies resembling the sacrament of marriage? The question, explosive by 
nature and certain to excite ideological reflexes among gay rights advocates 
and their opponents, has acquired new urgency this week with the publication of 
Yale University history professor John Boswell's latest book on human sexuality 
and the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe" (Villard Books) asserts that from the 
8th to the 18th Centuries, the Catholic church sanctioned same-sex unions and 
offered ceremonies complete with prayers for the couple's union, Holy Communion 
and rubrics directing the couple to kiss a book of the Gospel, the priest and 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Publication of the book -- and installments of the "Doonesbury" cartoon strip 
that touch on Boswell's findings -- are already causing a stir within the Roman 
Catholic Church in the United States and in Eastern Orthodoxy. The "Doonesbury" 
strips will be published today through Saturday in The Times and other 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau refers to the Catholic church in 
the strip as blessing same-sex unions, most of the Boswell claims point to 
rituals and practices associated with Eastern Orthodoxy, which arose among 
early Christians in Greece and Eastern Europe, rather than the Western 
Christians in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon also says that "homosexuality is, of course, a particularly 
egregious sin before God." Actually, Roman Catholic teaching holds that a 
homosexual orientation is not in itself sinful. But any sexual activity outside 
a heterosexual marriage is considered sinful. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell bases his controversial conclusion on a 12-year study of 55 ancient 
manuscripts, mainly in Greek, that he says point unmistakably to an attitude of 
tolerance and charity toward homosexuality among some earlier Christians, far 
different than the theological polemics that tear at the church today. 
</P>
<P>
 His book is also likely to fuel an ongoing debate within some old-line 
Protestant denominations, among them the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 
and the Episcopal Church, over whether to allow same-sex marriages of committed 
monogamous partners -- and to direct that authorized ceremonies be written to 
sanctify such unions. A related issue in both the Roman Catholic Church and 
old-line Protestant denominations is whether to ordain homosexuals as clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell's findings are not only taken seriously by those likely to be pleased 
with his conclusions, but by detractors who say they do not underestimate his 
role in helping to shape the continuing debate within the churches over sexual 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell won acclaim in 1980 with the publication of his first book, 
"Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality." A review in the New York 
Times called it revolutionary and said it set "a standard of excellence" in 
scholarship. It won the American Book Award for history. 
</P>
<P>
 That book provided a major intellectual framework for the drive by gay men and 
lesbians for spiritual equity in Christian churches. They cite the book when 
arguing for the blessing of same-sex unions and the admission of gay men to the 
Roman Catholic priesthood and gays to the ranks of Protestant clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Catholic theologian Richard John Neuhaus, writing in the March 
issue of the Catholic journal First Things, complained: "The influence of that 
book is truly remarkable; it has become a kind of sacred text for those who 
want to morally legitimize the homosexual movement. In certain circles, any 
allusion to what the Bible or Christian tradition say about homosexuality is 
likely to be met with, 'Yes, but Boswell says. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now with Boswell's claim that the church at one time performed gay marriages, 
his detractors are even more aghast and do not believe his evidence convincing. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Church in New York hotly disputes Boswell's 
claims. "Boswell would not be acknowledged by any theologian or historian of 
Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Protestant persuasion," says Father Milton 
Efthimiou, a church historian at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and 
South America in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably pulling at straws. He's trying to make a case about something 
that just doesn't exist," Efthimiou says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Wilkin, professor of the history of Christianity at the University 
of Virginia, says: "The basic principle in historical studies is that 
everything has to be contextualized. An isolated manuscript or an isolated 
reference means nothing unless it has corroboration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me improbable in the extreme that he can provide such evidence," 
he says. Wilkin and others say they suspect Boswell of engaging in "advocacy 
scholarship." They note that Boswell is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell was not available for an interview because of a serious illness, his 
publisher says. But a longtime friend and associate who read the book for 
Boswell before it was published came to his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the suggestion is that the position came first and the scholarship 
followed, that is not the way he works," says Ralph Hexter, a professor of the 
classics and comparative literature at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
"The arguments should rise and fall on their merits. If the only thing they can 
say against this work is that Boswell wants it to be so, from my point of view 
they must have no better argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Hexter says Boswell did not set out to find same-sex rituals. After his first 
book was published, someone contacted Boswell with a tip about where he might 
find the telltale manuscripts. Some had been known within scholarly circles, 
but their source was lost, Hexter says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Boswell stumbled onto a collection of Eastern liturgies that had these 
(rituals) in them. And then he found many of them. He found them all over the 
place," from the Vatican to Mount Athos in northern Greece, Hexter says. Other 
manuscripts were located in London, Paris and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a publicity release, Boswell's publisher says: "The text focuses on 
Boswell's discovery of Catholic liturgies for a same-sex ceremony that bear 
striking resemblance to heterosexual nuptial services that were performed in 
churches by priests from at least as early as the 8th Century to the 20th." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Darling Young of the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., 
is an authority on the early church fathers. She says it is entirely likely 
that Boswell came across manuscripts containing prayers and ceremonies for 
uniting couples of the same gender. There may have even been instances in which 
such ceremonies took place, she says, but they would not have been official. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether somebody wrote down a ritual at some time for the joining of two men 
in a relationship, of course that's possible," Young says. "'But as a public 
ritual uniting two people of the same sex? No. I don't think it's plausible 
historically," she says. She also says a distinction must be made between what 
is officially taught and what is sometimes practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 All this ignores what many see as a biblical injunction against homosexual 
practice found in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian New Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 But the meaning of those scriptural references have been the subject of 
debate, with traditionalists holding that they mean homosexual activity is 
sinful, while others seek to reinterpret them in light of new insights into the 
human condition and cultural conditions during biblical times.

90'S FAMILY; REAL LIFE; KIDS MUST GRIEVE IN OWN WAY, AT OWN PACE 
</P>

 One child wanted to crawl into his father's casket. Another asked her recently 
widowed father when the new mommy was coming. A preteen who had experienced 
four recent deaths in the family acted as if nothing had happened and wanted to 
go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought, my God, what's wrong? My children seem like zombies," 
said Andrea Powell, 39, who was devastated last year when her husband, Mike, 
died in a freak accident at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is wrong. In a society that has tended to hide the death experience, 
it is hard for adults to know what is normal -- or to know that children grieve 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they might be blaming themselves for the death. They might be ashamed 
that they are now different from their peers, or afraid no one will take care 
of them. They might just be wishing desperately that life would go on as it was 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, children simply need more time to assimilate what has happened, said 
Margaret Stuber, assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA. Sometimes, symptoms 
of anger, sadness or guilt may not surface for a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several years, many parents have learned not to force children to 
attend a death, a funeral or to touch a body, or conversely not to prevent them 
from doing so if they want to, with explanations of what to expect ahead of 
time. Many also understand now that it is best to be honest with children and 
that a good method of encouraging small children to talk about their feelings 
is to go first. ("I feel like this. If I were you, I might feel like that. . . 
.") 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many do not appreciate how children grieve at their own developmental 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-verbal children are aware something is wrong and need consistent warm care 
and reassurance, Stuber said. Preschoolers do not understand that death is 
permanent and will need repeated answers to the question, "Why?" (A simple 
answer, such as "because he was very sick," works well.) 
</P>
<P>
 School-age children are vulnerable to gross misunderstandings. One child was 
distressed to find her aunt in the funeral home when her parents had said she 
had "gone to be with Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 They are also likely to be taunted cruelly by schoolmates. "A couple of kids 
asked bluntly, 'Didn't your dad get drunk and kill himself?' " Powell said. She 
said she had to tell the particulars of his death repeatedly to them so they 
could say the same to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers, hyper-conscious of peer norms, are reluctant to be different in 
any way. But hiding their responses can increase the isolation they feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said her children like to sleep in their father's T-shirts. Parents 
said sometimes it was helpful to take pictures of the dead person to school and 
share good memories. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother from West Los Angeles said her 5-year-old daughter didn't talk 
about her father's death for three months afterward. "If she said a sentence 
about Daddy and I responded, she'd run away or change the subject," she said. 
"I felt I couldn't help her on my own. It was way out of my league." 
</P>
<P>
 She found professional help with Stuber and joined a new bereavement center, 
Our House, which runs support groups for parents and children in West Los 
Angeles. The groups are run on a nonprofit basis for a sliding fee. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they can discuss common issues, such as children who constantly urge 
their parents to remarry or whether or not it is important to appear strong for 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Goldhammer, 37, whose wife died of lung cancer four years ago, said he 
normally believes in being strong in front of his children. But once when he 
could not help crying, he said he found unexpected comfort from his daughter, 
then 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad about Mommy," she told him. "But I'm not real sad because I have 
you."

 With just a snapshot taken in 1947 and a misspelled last name, Meyer Denn did 
what seemed impossible -- he united an American woman with her two cousins in 
Czechoslovakia, both of whom had survived the Holocaust by hiding in cellars 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stunning experience," said Marsha Friedman of Madison, Wis., who in 
1992 took her 25-year-old nephew to Bratislava to visit her cousins. "Being 
there gave me a sense of what life was like then -- you see who you come from, 
what your own relatives had to endure, the conditions they lived under. And I 
felt it was important for my nephew to see who he is and where his roots are." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn, a 32-year-old genealogical consultant who grew up as one of 16 Jews in a 
Texas town of 20,000, knows the importance of rediscovering the past. He has 
spent much of his life uncovering his own history, and helping others -- 
especially Jews -- find theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask someone my age where their grandparents come from, and many of them 
don't know," said Denn, who lives in Santa Monica. "It's very sad. When you 
don't know where you come from, you're losing a part of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn, who earned a degree in history from the University of Texas and studied 
Jewish immigration, the destruction of Slovak Jewry and the Holocaust at Hebrew 
University in Jerusalem, said many Jewish people falsely believe that all 
records of their families were destroyed in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But many family documents remain intact throughout Europe, he said -- good 
news for people like Robinn Magid, 34, who had always assumed that the 
Holocaust had obliterated all evidence of her family. After hooking up with 
Denn three years ago, Magid learned to recognize and read birth and death 
certificates and other records using a Polish dictionary. She has since traced 
11 generations of her family back to Lublin, Poland in the 1730s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitler may have deprived us of our family, but I will not allow Hitler to 
keep them off our family tree," said Magid, who lives with her 3-year-old 
daughter, infant son and husband in Northern California. "We can't bring them 
back, but I can make sure they won't disappear from our family tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Magid said her search has helped her answer questions she has always had about 
her family -- who they are, where they came from, how they got here. It has 
also helped her answer questions about herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always remember when I was in third grade, and my teacher asked for a 
show of hands of who could trace their ancestors to the crossing of the 
Mayflower," she said. "Now I see we each have our own Mayflower, we just have 
to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn said he is seeing a growing interest in finding the family "Mayflower" -- 
of uncovering and discovering family history. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a grass-roots movement to connect with the past, to come back home," 
said Denn, who also works with non-Jewish immigrants. "There was the turbulence 
of the '60s and '70s, and now people want to connect with their essence. People 
are realizing that your past is part of what makes you what you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn's preoccupation with genealogy began at age 9, when he became fascinated 
with a photo of his great-great-grandparents -- dressed in the shtetle garb of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked so different from me, I wanted to know how we were connected," he 
said. "My dad used to tell me bedtime stories about our relatives. I always 
wanted to know more." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending years pursuing genealogy as a hobby, Denn opened a consulting 
firm, Meyer Denn & Associates, last year. He charges $50 an hour but encourages 
the do-it-yourself approach to get the full impact of locating relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In his searches, Denn uses citizenship and naturalization papers, passports, 
ships' passenger lists, census records and Yizkor Books (published by Holocaust 
survivors in memory of those killed). The Mormon Temple's Family History 
Center-Los Angeles is also an invaluable source of genealogical information. 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to aerial photos taken by the Nazis of nearly every town and 
village in Eastern Europe, Denn has been able to locate family villages and 
sometimes even specific houses of ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I provide documentation, rather than just a family tree," said Denn, who 
speaks Yiddish, Hebrew and German. "It's important for people to know more than 
just names, and to be able to visit, if they choose, the places they come 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn's apartment is a testimony to his travels through history. Faded photos 
of family members from another age stare from the walls and shelves, and 
mementos of his trips throughout Eastern Europe -- including antique 
candlesticks, Jewish art objects and even stones from his great-grandparents' 
back yard -- litter his tables and countertops. 
</P>
<P>
 On one trip to Czechoslovakia, Denn met a man who was a guest at Denn's 
grandparents' wedding in 1918, and a villager who witnessed Denn's 
great-grandfather being taken away by Slovak soldiers to Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather always said there was nothing there -- he said his town was 
destroyed," said Denn, who has traced his family roots to the mid-1600s. "What 
was destroyed was the Jewish community of the town, but the town is still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Denn's bookcases are crammed with history books, stacks of documents and 
tattered volumes of archives. He excitedly breaks out a slide projector to 
showcase not the usual pictures of monuments and landscapes, but pages of 
records with the signatures and vital statistics of distant relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a charge you get from seeing the actual signature of a great-, 
or even great-great-grandparent," he said. "There's nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Denn's work involves finding not-so-distant relatives for recent 
immigrants like Boris Nesterovsky. Nesterovsky immigrated to this country from 
Russia four years ago with his wife and daughter. He knew he knew he had 
relatives in the United States but had no idea where they lived, or even the 
correct spelling of their last names. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my mom's dream to find them," said Nesterovsky, 66, whose great aunt 
and uncle immigrated to America prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917. "She 
always said, 'Maybe some day you will be able to emigrate, and you will find 
our relatives.' Now that I have found them, it is not only for my benefit, but 
for my mother's. And now my daughter has relatives in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Medved, a convert to Judaism who found that her relatives actually did 
come over on the Mayflower, said her exploration of her family's history gives 
her more than just a connection to the past and a link to the present. For her, 
getting in touch with where she came from builds upon her religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jewish perspective is that people are elevating technologically, but not 
spiritually," she said. "We have a lot to learn from those who have come 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, we will all be the ones who have "gone before." Which is why it is 
important, Denn said, to begin documenting your life, and the life of your 
family, now -- through audio- or videotape -- before your history dies with 
those who know it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing more valuable than, 50 or 60 years from now, your kids 
watching you tell your story," Denn said. "By giving them that, you're keeping 
people alive, and bringing your story to life."

HOW TO START YOUR OWN SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Start by interviewing relatives, asking them questions about your family 
history. Record names, dates and places. Use an audio or videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Research materials found in your home. Look for genealogical information in 
family Bibles, diaries, wills, baby books and letters, and on the backs of 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact other family members about your search. There is a chance that another 
family member may be working on a history too. Advertise your genealogical 
interests in national, regional and local genealogical publications, and in the 
personal ads of local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursue county records, such as birth and death certificates, probate records 
(adoption papers, name changes) or tax records. Birth, death and marriage 
certificates often contain parents' names, places of birth and other 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit the Los Angeles Family History Center at the Mormon Library in West Los 
Angeles, which is open to anyone who wants to trace their family roots. The

RENO AIR'S ENTRY AT JOHN WAYNE IN HOLDING PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors postponed until next week a decision on 
whether to allow a new low-fare airline into John Wayne Airport to give other 
airlines additional time to voice their concerns about the added competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is being closely watched because Reno Air's entry into the costly 
Orange County air market could be another welcome break for travelers. The 
Nevada-based carrier would become the second low-fare airline to start service 
following the lead of Southwest Airlines, which started flying 15 daily round 
trips to Oakland and San Jose last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other carriers, however, Reno Air proposes to begin service at John 
Wayne by picking up six daily flights to San Jose that would be vacated by 
American Airlines. American, which has allied itself with Reno Air, says it 
wants to drop the flights because it can't compete with Southwest's low-cost 
structure. American would be left with about 15 daily flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Reno Air would have to wait in line behind other carriers that want 
to start service at the noise-restricted airport. The process can take years 
because the slots are parceled out to new carriers annually. By picking up 
American's slots, Reno Air could skip ahead of other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of some of the other airlines operating at John Wayne said 
they are concerned about this arrangement and want to meet with airport 
officials Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the carriers are concerned that the proposal is inconsistent with the 
present policy," said airport spokeswoman Courtney C. Wiercioch. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, for instance, sent a letter to Board of Supervisors President 
Thomas F. Riley, urging rejection of what it termed an "unsound proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfair to United and other airlines in Orange County who have played by 
the rules," said the letter from Burt Pines, a lawyer who represents the 
airline. If Reno Air prevails, "the county would be denying to United an 
opportunity to grow at the airport" by vying for some of American's unused 
landing slots. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that United was not notified ahead of time that the Reno-American 
issue would be coming before the Airport Commission last week, which approved 
it. The matter was, however, included on the commission's meeting agenda, which 
was posted publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pines argues that any decision on Reno Air should be delayed until a full 
review can be made of the airport's policy on linkage of air carriers with 
regard to landing slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Another airline representative didn't go as far as to criticize the Reno Air 
proposal, but expressed concern nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's being proposed is a departure from the access plan," said Bryan 
Enarson, director of airport affairs for USAir, which has two daily flights 
from John Wayne, "and what we've asked the airport to do is meet with us and 
discuss more in depth why they are changing the practice." 
</P>
<P>
 A Reno Air spokeswoman said the airline had no comment about the delay. And an 
aide to Riley, whose district includes the airport, said he has not yet made up 
his mind on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Director Jan Mittermeier, who will host the meeting with the airlines, 
supports the American-Reno Air arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 She said earlier that the temporary arrangement would provide an additional 
alternative to air carriers and would come with heavy restrictions against Reno 
Air expanding its operations to other routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Wiercioch said that Mittermeier plans to stick by her position in 
the meeting with the airline representatives, but that she wants to make sure 
they fully understand the airport's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to make sure all the information is out, and that all of the 
players understand an issue, whether or not they agree," Wiercioch said.

O.C.'S GOTECH FOCUS OF MAJOR FRAUD PROBE; CONSTRUCTION: STATE ACCUSES CUSTOM 
HOME BUILDER OF SIPHONING NEARLY $1 MILLION FROM CLIENTS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest contractor fraud cases ever filed in California, the 
state attorney general's office has accused an Orange County custom home 
builder of siphoning nearly $1 million from the accounts of dozens of clients 
and subcontractors since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Mendoza, a deputy state attorney general, said in a brief telephone 
interview that she also intends to begin a criminal investigation in connection 
with the case. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint was filed against Gotech Builders; its owner, Jeffrey 
Charles Weiner, and several former Gotech officials on behalf of the 
Contractors State License Board. It seeks to permanently bar Weiner and the 
others from obtaining contractors' licenses in California or from working for 
any licensed contractor in the state. Weiner could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed with the California Department of Consumers Affairs 
last month, though no public announcement was made. A hearing will be held 
before an administrative law judge later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's probe of Gotech began late last year after a Times Orange County 
Edition investigation of the company and its activities. The state's accusation 
details $961,000 that Gotech and a predecessor company, called Systems 
Construction, allegedly diverted from customers' construction accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a bigger case," said Paula Watkins, head of the Southern 
California regional office of the contractor license board -- the state agency 
responsible for licensing and disciplining building trades contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants have been charged with illegally diverting funds from 
customers' construction accounts and engaging in fraudulent sales techniques to 
entice customers to sign construction contracts. The company operated largely 
in Orange, Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the state accusation was Larry Stephen Hampton, whose 
contractor's license was used to operate Gotech. Also named was Richard K. 
Green, a former vice president of the company, and Ilene Gayron, a sales agent. 
Hampton and Green could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gayron never held a contractor's license, she was named in the 
complaint as the architect of most of the companies' fraudulent sales 
techniques. She also was married to Weiner for a year and a half.  
</P>
<P>
 The marriage was annulled in April, 1991, but Gayron continued to work with 
Weiner until early this year. Weiner testified in a recent bankruptcy hearing 
that he and Gayron still live in a luxury home in Fullerton built by Gotech. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayron, reached Tuesday at her new employment referral business in Brea, said 
that "nothing in (the complaint) is true. I was an employee and I was just 
doing my job." She and Hampton have notified the state that they intend to 
defend themselves in the administrative hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Weiner and Green have not responded to the charges, according to Mendoza, the 
deputy attorney general.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case outlined in the state's complaint, a Montebello couple paid Gotech 
$119,628 -- including $37,000 that the company allegedly withdrew from a 
construction account without authorization -- for work on a new home that was 
to have cost $250,000.  
</P>
<P>
 When Gotech's license was suspended by the contractors board last October, the 
only work that had been completed was minor grading on the site. None of the 
couple's money has been refunded, and Weiner, the sole owner of Gotech, has 
since filed for bankruptcy liquidation -- a process that could free him of 
liability from claims by customers of his two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times articles showed how Weiner was able to use the license board's own 
policies to stifle customer complaints and for years avoid being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 The license board, which said it was greatly understaffed, generally refused 
to accept complaints about contractors who used mandatory private arbitration 
to resolve contract disputes with their customers. After a series of angry 
public hearings in Sacramento late last year, the license board changed its 
policy and now accepts complaints in all cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins acknowledged Tuesday that the board's former policy of ignoring 
complaints helped Systems and Gotech to operate for years without coming to 
regulators' attention.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: AMERIQUEST TECHNOLOGIES AND KENFIL INC. MAKE STOCK SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AmeriQuest Technologies Inc., a distributor of computer hardware, has traded 
1.1 million newly issued common shares for 3.3 million shares, or 51%, of 
Kenfil Inc. common stock held by its principal shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock swap, first announced in April, is part of AmeriQuest's proposed 
acquisition of Kenfil, a Van Nuys-based software distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Subject to the approvals of both companies' shareholders, the remaining Kenfil 
shares would be exchanged in a merger at the same conversion ratio of 0.34 
AmeriQuest shares for each Kenfil common share. The all-stock deal is expected 
to be completed in August. The value of the merger fluctuates with stock prices 
but is estimated to be in the neighborhood of $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously with the merger, holders of about $7.3 million of Kenfil 
subordinated debt will exchange the debt for additional AmeriQuest common 
shares.

2 SHAREHOLDERS SUE KOLL, ALLEGING UNFAIR STOCK OFFER

 Two shareholders filed lawsuits against Koll Management Services Inc., a 
property management firm controlled by Donald Koll, for allegedly offering too 
low a price to buy out the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Koll, chairman of Koll Management Services, controls 64% of the 
company's stock.The company and its investment firm, Freeman Spogli & Co. Inc. 
in Los Angeles, said last week that they plan to buy the other 36% of the 
company for $15 a share, or about $15.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lawsuits accuse Koll of using his control of the Newport Beach-based 
company to exact an unfair price from minority shareholders, therefore 
violating his fiduciary duty by not seeking other bidders first. Koll officials 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Freeman, a principal of Freeman Spogli, said the suits are "meaningless." 
He said it is standard procedure for lawyers to file suits asking for more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits were filed Thursday and Tuesday in Delaware Chancery Court. The 
plaintiffs are identified as 7457 Partners, a Florida partnership, and 
Phronesis Partners LP. Their ownership stake was not disclosed. The 
shareholders want to block the offer and force Koll to consider other offers. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading Tuesday, shares of Koll Management were unchanged at $14 a share. 
The company said a committee of independent directors is studying the 
management-led buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Management, which manages about $1 billion worth of real estate, is the 
third-largest property and asset management company in the United States. The 
company went public in July, 1991.

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS; NEW SPA TO OPEN WHERE PREDECESSOR NEVER

 The Spa at South Coast Plaza plans to open Aug. 1 in a building previously 
occupied by the short-lived and ill-fated Spa at the Center on Town Center 
Drive in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The new club incorporates the upscale building that housed the defunct spa, 
including its marble statues, luxurious carpeting and the tony address near 
Orange County's leading shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spa at South Coast executives say that's about all the two clubs will 
share. "It's a totally new management and a new ownership," spa director Kim 
Matheson said. "The old club only was open for less than six months and this is 
a totally new operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The former spa opened early in 1992 but immediately ran into financial 
trouble. Jeffrey Jones, a co-founder of the club, linked its August, 1992, 
demise to financial commitments that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 The new club is owned by Kaiser Developers Inc., a Chicago-based company that 
owns several health clubs in the East. The new club will be managed by 
Denver-based Club Sports International, which manages 36 health clubs and spas 
east of the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The old club left more than 200 members in the lurch when it failed. Matheson 
said the new club is "working with those individuals to be sensitive to their 
needs." That includes "preferential memberships." Matheson declined to state 
specifics of the memberships.  
</P>
<P>
 The new club is adding a restaurant that the old club lacked the funds to 
complete. Among the club's amenities: an outdoor, 25-yard lap pool and a sun 
deck; steam, sauna and whirlpool facilities; exercise machines; massages, and 
body wraps and mineral baths.

WASHINGTON POST LAWYER SAYS REGISTER WILL DROP ADS WITH DISPUTED PHRASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a trademark dispute with the Washington Post, the Orange County 
Register has agreed to call a halt to its current countywide advertising 
campaign, an attorney for the Post said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're clarifying a few final things, but they have agreed to stop using" a 
disputed phrase, said Mary Ann Werner, assistant counsel for the Washington 
newspaper, adding that the resolution had been "amicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Register officials said any agreement is still in progress. "I can't comment 
until I see the response to our correspondence" with the Post, said John 
Schueler, executive vice president and general manager of the Register. 
</P>
<P>
 The Post filed last fall for trademark rights to the phrase, "If you don't get 
it, you don't get it." This spring, the Register began using the phrase, word 
for word, in its own advertising campaign, which was developed by Los Angeles 
ad agency Stein Robaire Helm. 
</P>
<P>
 The local ad campaign's cost is estimated at $1 million, and the ads were 
scheduled to run for 33 weeks. Whether the disputed phrase was to have been 
part of the entire campaign is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday afternoon, the ads were still displayed in bus shelters and on 
billboards. They feature puzzled-looking people who presumably would "get it" 
if they bought the Register. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Register has canceled a long-held contract to purchase 
space on the tails of Orange County Transportation Authority buses, according 
to Frank Sandusky, regional manager of Transportation Displays Inc., who sells 
the space on behalf of OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandusky said he doesn't think the cancellation is related to the dispute with 
the Washington Post. "We've had long-term contracts with the Register, and this 
isn't the only creative (campaign) they've ever run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler said there has been no "cancellation" or deviation from the 
Register's original plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandusky declined to place a value on the Register's bus advertising contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fair & Expo Center, which was to have received advertising 
space on 100 buses from the Register in exchange for choosing the newspaper as 
a fair sponsor, said the cancellation leaves the fair in a bad position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caught us by surprise," said Jill Lloyd, whose advertising and public 
relations firm represents the fair. "We're receiving bus shelters and mall 
displays instead, but we certainly don't feel (that these are) as effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's joint advertisements with the Register are scheduled to begin June 
24 and run for 30 days. The Fair opens July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said the fair will buy space on the sides of about 40 buses beginning 
Monday, independent of its agreement with the Register.

 Something New Under the Sun: Summer is here and the time is right for pitching 
that beach umbrella in the sand . . . if only the darn thing would stay put 
when the wind starts to blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers can take heart.Costa Mesa resident William H. Ward Jr. is rushing 
to the rescue with the "Groundhog Sandscrew," a device that attaches to the 
bottom of beach umbrellas and makes it easier to keep them anchored. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 55, is a computer and electronics specialist who always "wanted a 
product of my own. This is just something I wanted to do. You might say I've 
been screwing things up and now I'm screwing them down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Groundhog Sandscrew is being sold through the Long's Drugstore and Fedco 
chains. Stores are selling the items for $5.97 and up, said Ward, who hopes to 
eventually license the product to umbrella manufacturers. Ward's research 
suggests that there are 10 million beach umbrellas in the nation, which 
translates into lots of potential sales.

PEARL JAM VS. TICKETMASTER: CHOOSING SIDES; LEGAL FILE: THE POP MUSIC WORLD IS 
DIVIDED OVER THE SEATTLE BAND'S ALLEGATIONS, WHICH LED TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IN THE TICKET 
DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is perhaps the biggest pop concert summer ever: Streisand, the Eagles, Pink 
Floyd, the 25th anniversary of Woodstock, "Lollapalooza." But missing from the 
roster is America's biggest-selling band, Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason behind the Seattle quintet's MIA status is the talk of the pop 
music business from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just over a week ago when the news broke that Pearl Jam had filed a 
complaint on May 6 with the U.S. Justice Department and inflamed what one 
insider has described as a "holy war" between that band and the biggest ticket 
agency in the country, Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam claims that the Los Angeles-based company used its influence to keep 
promoters from booking the band's low-cost summer tour. In the memorandum filed 
with the Justice Department's anti-trust division, the band alleges that 
Ticketmaster has a national monopoly over ticket distribution and that service 
fees charged by the agency drastically inflate ticket prices. Daniel Hamilton, 
a spokesman for the Justice Department, confirmed Tuesday that the agency is 
investigating possible anti-competitive practices in the ticket distribution 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to Ticketmaster executives and the company's attorneys were not returned 
Tuesday. In a May 29 letter to The Times, Ticketmaster vice president Ned S. 
Goldstein said his company "operates fully and squarely within the parameters 
of all applicable laws." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle band's action has raised the heat under the longtime simmering 
debate over ticket prices, and talk among artists, managers, promoters and 
venue operators has taken on a new edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Pearl Jam is doing is precedent setting," said Pam Lewis, who manages 
country star Garth Brooks, also a proponent of low-cost concerts. "Garth and I 
support the band, and we'll help in any way we can. We think greed is ruining 
the business and encourage others in the industry to rally to Pearl Jam's 
defense. It's time for artists to start standing up for their fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other managers who represent some of the nation's biggest concert acts 
also privately applauded Pearl Jam's efforts, but -- reflecting the sensitivity 
of the issue -- refused to speak publicly, saying they feared such action could 
jeopardize their clients' careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters and concert arena operators are lining up on Ticketmaster's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire any young band who tries to reduce ticket prices, but the service 
fee just can't be brought down to the price Pearl Jam is asking," said Claire 
L. Rothman, general manager of the Forum. "It's an unrealistic demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the national concert trade journal Pollstar, 
concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venue owners and promoters aren't going to just turn their backs on the 
revenue stream that Ticketmaster provides simply because Pearl Jam wants them 
to," said Bongiovanni, reflecting a view expressed privately by several 
promoters. "And, besides, these surcharges stem from legal contracts."

 Indeed it is those contracts that are at the core of Pearl Jam's complaint. 
The band's memo, filed by a prominent New York law firm, asserts that 
Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all important concert venues in 
the country and uses those relationships to "cement control over the 
distribution of tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster pays a portion of the service fees it collects to maintain 
exclusive long-term contracts with the owners of the largest concert venues. In 
addition, some promoters and artist managers also receive part of the 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the Justice Department is looking into allegations that 
Ticketmaster persuaded promoters to boycott Pearl Jam's plans to perform this 
summer at venues that charged $18 per ticket and no more than $1.80 per service 
fee. Ticketmaster typically collects $5 to $8 per ticket in phone-service fees 
for rock and pop concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters and building owners, who support Ticketmaster, blame escalating 
prices on increased artist fees. They credit Ticketmaster with devising new 
revenue streams to bolster shrinking profits for venues and concert-promotion 
firms, and for creating an efficient method of "instantaneous" ticket 
distribution via telephone and store outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Ticketmaster came onto the market, every promoter in the industry was 
unhappy," said Avalon Attractions president Brian Murphy, whose Los 
Angeles-based company puts on more than 300 Ticketmaster-affiliated concerts 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ticketmaster completely rewrote the rules and improved everything. They 
revolutionized the way tickets are distributed. I think the problem is that 
when anyone gets as big as Ticketmaster is, they just become a target for 
critics." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pearl Jam doesn't have any battle with any other concert act who wants to 
charge higher prices," Curtis said, commenting for the first time on the band's 
position. "We're just trying to look out for our fans. The fact is that a large 
percentage of the people who love Pearl Jam just don't have very much money, 
and we want them to be able to attend our concerts. It's all just as simple as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 California Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), who introduced state 
legislation in 1990 to cap ticket service fees, believes Pearl Jam has a 
legitimate complaint and supports the Justice Department probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty Pearl Jam is experiencing in bringing down fees is not the 
unique problem of just this rock band," said Areias, who maintains that his 
proposal was crushed by lobbyists for the ticket distribution industry. "We 
experienced an identical battle against the same powerful forces on the floor 
of the State Assembly in recent years." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The federal investigation is the latest in a series of legal problems for 
Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, consumers in six states filed class-action antitrust lawsuits 
against the corporation -- just days after Ticketmaster resolved a similar 
claim in California by agreeing to give away $1.5 million worth of tickets to 
charity groups and paying $750,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, in which Ticketmaster denied any wrongdoing, put to rest a 
1992 lawsuit alleging that the ticket agency and its Northern California-based 
affiliate, BASS, conspired with promoters and venue operators to bilk consumers 
by arbitrarily fixing the price of ticket "convenience" fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster has dominated the U.S. concert ticket distribution market since 
1991 when the Justice Department gave the go-ahead for the company to buy 
certain assets from Ticketron, its only major competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone in the business would prefer an atmosphere of competition," 
said U2 manager Paul McGuinness in a phone interview from Ireland. "But it was 
the Justice Department that did away with that when they allowed Ticketron to 
be acquired a few years ago."

RAPPING UP THE WORLD; RHYMIN' PROVIDES A NEW VOICE FOR RUSSIAN YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KNOBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These Russians wear hip American baseball caps on their heads, not frumpy fur 
hats. The guiding force in their lives is no longer Marxism -- it's MTV. And 
they favor the frenetic beat of rap music over the delicate strains of 
Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the hip-hop generation, Russian-style. 
</P>
<P>
 In much the same way as it captured the voice of a generation of young 
Americans, rap music has caught on among trendy Russians. Although the number 
of fans may be relatively small when compared to lovers of pop or rock, they 
are die-hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since rap music came to Russia in 1990 -- when Western-style radio stations 
and music television came to the then-Soviet Union -- dozens of rap acts have 
appeared around the nation. Rap is a natural in Russia, the homeland of such 
great poets as Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov, where society values 
expression through verse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rap music means something," college student and rap lover Anatoly Makarov 
said as he swayed to the beat of a rapper performing in a Moscow nightclub. 
"It's the only kind of music that talks about the problems we're having here: 
the crime, the government, the economy. The last thing I want to hear is some 
Russian pop star crooning about love." 
</P>
<P>
 While pop music singers warble about dating and the weather, some Russian 
rappers are launching a new effort to address Russia's social problems head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hip-hop is a movement for all young people," Vladislav Valov, lead singer of 
the rap group Bad Balance, explained. "We can give each other ideas to help 
deal with society's wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
 Valov, 23, is one of the founders of an organization called Hip-Hop Against 
Violence (in Russian: Heep-Hop Protiv Haciliya), which was founded in February 
by some of Russia's top rappers as a way to politicize musicians, artist, 
dancers and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had enough of this mayhem where we live. We're ready to do something," 
explained Peter Martiyanov, a 28-year-old businessman who is the enterprise's 
president. "We decided to unite all people who like hip-hop, all people who are 
interested in this culture." There are no accurate figures for the number of 
rap fans in Russia, nor on sales of rap albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-Hop Against Violence has already begun a series of fund-raising concerts 
aimed at helping children in such war-torn areas as the former Yugoslavia and 
the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Tajikistan. The group also hopes to 
get in touch with other rappers in Europe and America, and to perform abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers want to pass on a message of nonviolence through their music. 
"Gangsta rap isn't the kind of music that moves the hip-hop generation here," 
said Valov, who uses the stage name Chill Will. "We want our music to propagate 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group's emphasis on fighting violence is warranted. Crime rates have 
exploded in post-communist Russia. More than 2 million Russians were victims of 
crime in 1993 -- more than twice as many as 1985, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
first came to power -- according to the Russian Interior Ministry. Organized 
crime is also on the rise, with more than 5,700 criminal gangs operating in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's youth is in crisis because the country's economic decline has given 
young people little reason to work honestly, according to Valov. By joining 
forces with one of Russia's organized crime groups or by engaging in illegal 
business, a young person can earn in one day as much as a Russian doctor or 
lawyer earns in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there's so much violence here," said Valov, dressed in an oversized 
Mexican vest with a bandanna tied around his head. "It's not just economic 
crimes or violence against people -- it's violence against nature, against the 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
 While the organizers of Hip-Hop Against Violence are optimistic about their 
center's potential effect, Artemy Troitsky, a Moscow music critic, doubts that 
Russian musicians can reach out to youth the way their American counterparts 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, "Young people don't take rock stars to be their heroes anymore," 
Troitsky said. "Bandits or businessmen, yes, but not people in the world of 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the rap groups that have joined Hip-Hop Against Violence have begun to 
pen songs with nonviolent themes. Bad Balance has led the way with its hit 
"Children of Satan." The song is read -- rappers don't sing, says Valov, they 
read -- in Russian, though Bad Balance also raps in English: 
</P>
<P>
 I don't like gangs,  
</P>
<P>
 Undignified sportsmen from violent gangs,  
</P>
<P>
 I hate all they're doing,  
</P>
<P>
 Damn devils.  
</P>
<P>
 They're children of Satan.  
</P>
<P>
 Just Da Enemy, a female trio that alternates verses in English, French and 
Russian, is taking on racism. On a cassette produced by Hip-Hop Against 
Violence, their song "Color of Skin" explains: 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what color of skin do you have,  
</P>
<P>
 Expression of soul that makes sense.  
</P>
<P>
 Money makes the world go around.  
</P>
<P>
 Racism gathers fools around.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Not all the groups that have joined the center have incorporated the 
anti-violence message into their music. The group Bust A.S., which raps in 
English, sounds like gangsta rap in their song "Bucka Jackal":  
</P>
<P>
 I would kill myself if I were a cop!  
</P>
<P>
 (Expletive), this ain't no comedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Every time I see a cop, I spit automatically.  
</P>
<P>
 They're always checking in on us cause we're hanging out late.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Russian rap has often had violent or overtly sexual themes. The group 
Malchishnik scored a big hit with its 1992 rap "Sex Without a Pause," even 
though it was banned on both television and radio because of its explicitness. 
The group's song "Mike Tyson Is Innocent" was criticized for encouraging 
violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Malchishnik has not joined Hip-Hop Against Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Valov says that he has been heavily influenced by U.S. rap acts such as Public 
Enemy, a group that uses its music to address social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of American rap can be seen in other ways as well. Consider the 
Russian group KTL-DLL's song "It Will Be Easier for You When I Leave," in which 
the rapper considers killing himself over an unrequited love. As if to avoid an 
American-style lawsuit, an announcer intones at the end, "This song isn't to 
encourage suicide, but to show another side of life."

PREMIUM CABLE CHANNELS ADOPT CONTENT LABELS; TELEVISION: HBO, SHOWTIME, THE 
MOVIE CHANNEL AND CINEMAX WILL PROVIDE ADVISORIES ON VIOLENCE, SEX AND 
OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE BEGINNING THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when television is under pressure to reduce violence, four major 
pay-TV channels are instituting a labeling system to warn viewers about the 
content of every program they offer -- but not only with regard to mayhem. The 
advisories also will cover nudity, sex and language. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable executives deny that the move is in response to congressional pressure 
and say it will not affect what gets programmed on HBO, Showtime, the Movie 
Channel and Cinemax. Nor will movies or programs be edited, bleeped or altered 
in any way to change the rating. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe it as a voluntary effort to provide more information to their 
subscribers, especially to parents trying to limit their children's exposure to 
violence, sex and offensive language. 
</P>
<P>
 The standardized, 10-category advisory system will go into effect Friday on 
HBO and Cinemax (which are jointly owned) and later this month on Showtime and 
the Movie Channel (which also are jointly owned). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that because the concern over violence on television is occurring 
simultaneously, this could be perceived as a reaction to it," said McAdory 
Lipscomb, executive vice president of Showtime. "If we had not been providing 
advisories for years, it could be construed that way. But the thought is simply 
that, with so many images coming across our television screens today, better 
information about those images is needed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who has led the crusade to pressure television 
executives to reduce violence on TV without direct government involvement, 
believes "it is helpful to provide viewers with more information about what is 
on television, especially for parents trying to guide their children's viewing 
habits," a spokesman said. "But labeling is no substitute for a general 
reduction in glamorized violence." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Simon will continue to focus on monitoring what actually gets 
shown on TV in an effort to limit the amount of violence. Simon has no 
intention of lobbying other broadcasters or cable channels to adopt a similar 
advisory system, nor would he frown on its implementation elsewhere, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pay networks' new ratings system, there are four categories of 
violence: mild (MV), violent (V) and graphic (GV), with a separate category for 
rape (RP), because the companies have heard from their subscribers over the 
years that sexual violence is particularly offensive to some viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex is divided into three categories: brief nudity (BN), nudity (N) and strong 
sexual content (SC). 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially offensive language gets two labels: adult (AL) or graphic (GL). 
And there is a more general and all-encompassing category of "adult content" 
(AC). 
</P>
<P>
 As many as five labels could be applied to a movie or program; each will be 
appear on the air and in program guides. For example, the NC-17 movie "The Bad 
Lieutenant," starring Harvey Keitel, will get the grand slam of parental 
warnings: GL, GV, RP, N, SC. "Free Willy," a PG-rated family movie, will be 
labeled MV because of a couple of scenes of mild violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each company will label its own programs separately, so it is conceivable that 
the same movie might get a GV on Showtime and the Movie Channel and a V on HBO 
and Cinemax.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible that we would rank something different than HBO, but we both 
recognize our dual responsibility to provide information to our subscribers 
about what is graphic or perhaps unsuitable for children, and we think the 
common language we've developed will provide an acceptable parameter," 
Showtime's Lipscomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the two companies decided to join forces because it made sense 
to provide a common and consistent language for viewers of pay television. 
</P>
<P>
 For Showtime and the Movie Channel, the implementation of this advisory system 
represents a fairly large step in warning viewers about what they are about to 
see. In the past, they have simply provided the Motion Picture Assn. of America 
ratings on movies and a "parental discretion" tag on their own adult-oriented 
programs. HBO and Cinemax have been providing viewers with a more detailed 
description of their programs' violent or sexual content for many years, but 
nothing as specific as the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Baldwin, vice president of program planning at HBO, explained that a team 
of screeners and programmers has been in place for years to evaluate movies and 
programs in this manner. If there's an argument over whether something ought to 
get the "brief nudity" or the stronger "nudity" label, Baldwin said, "we err on 
the side of caution and just go with N. This isn't rocket science. It's just 
informational." 
</P>
<P>
 The "graphic violence" label will be reserved "for the really tough stuff, the 
high-impact kind of thing -- dismemberment, gunshots, blood and gore," Baldwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said that the "graphic language" category is for presentations with 
constant salty language, such as HBO's "Def Comedy Jam." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong sexual content is reserved for movies with graphic sexual depictions, 
such as Zalman King's "Red Shoe Diaries" on Showtime. "Indecent Proposal," for 
all its sexual innuendo, gets only a BN for brief nudity, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that many PG-13 movies also will be labeled BN because they include a 
brief glimpse of a topless woman. Many parents have complained that they have 
let their children watch such films in the afternoon, unaware of what they 
consider objectionable nudity. This system will help them avoid that, Baldwin 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples of what viewers can expect, "Rising Sun," the Sean Connery 
thriller from last year, received: adult content, adult language, violence, 
nudity and strong sexual content. The political comedy "Dave" will get labels 
for adult content and language.  
</P>
<P>
 Lipscomb said that neither Showtime nor HBO has been talking to the basic 
cable channels (such as MTV, A&E and USA) about adopting the ratings system, 
but he said the cable industry in general is committed to coming up with some 
kind of advisory system. One problem is that basic cable has been focusing 
solely on the question of violence, not of sexual or language content. Another 
is that basic cable, like its broadcast counterparts, has been more resistant 
to getting specific in its parental advisories for fear of losing advertisers 
who might be skittish about sponsoring programs clearly labeled as having 
violent or sexual content.

6 MUSICALS DUE AT ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For its 1994-95 Broadway Series, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has 
slated six touring musicals, one more than in the current season. Included 
among the upcoming shows are a classic American opera and two revivals -- 
"Hello, Dolly!" and "The Sound of Music" -- on their way to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Announced Tuesday, the subscription series will begin in November with 
"Jelly's Last Jam" (starring Maurice Hines), followed in December with "The 
Sound of Music" (starring Marie Osmond) and in February with "Blood Brothers" 
(starring Petula Clark). 
</P>
<P>
 The series then will take a four-month break before picking up again in June 
1995 with "Hello, Dolly!" (starring Carol Channing, who originated the title 
role in 1964) and a Houston Grand Opera production of "Porgy and Bess" partly 
financed by the center. "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" will 
close the season in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Center spokesman Gregory Patterson said the top price for single tickets, 
which has been $45, will rise to $47, except for "Porgy and Bess," whose top 
ticket will cost $60. The least expensive tickets to all shows will stay at 
$19. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will offer two kinds of subscriptions: a six-show package ($112 to 
$282) and a five-show package ($94 to $224). Because "Porgy and Bess" will run 
from a Wednesday to a Saturday, Patterson said, those with season tickets for 
Tuesdays or Sundays will be offered the five-show package and a chance to buy 
single tickets for "Porgy and Bess" before they go on sale to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Broadway Series has 16,932 subscribers who fill 71% of the seats, 
leaving the rest for single-ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three shows remain in the '93-94 series: "The Great Radio City Music Hall 
Spectacular" (which opens Tuesday and continues through June 19), "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" (June 21-26) and "The Phantom of the Opera" (July 22-Sept. 4).
