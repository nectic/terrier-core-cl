AN INVITATION TO RETURN TO SOIL OF EDEN; BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; WHY WE 
GARDEN, CULTIVATING A SENSE OF PLACE BY JIM NOLLMAN HENRY HOLT $25, 312 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 On our deck in Venice, we have 170 trees in pots. The leaves of sycamores, 
maples, cherimoya, California peppers, Brazilian peppers, mulberry, cottonwood, 
bamboo, birch, liquidambars, eucalyptus, white oaks and jacarandas cover the 
thin layer of wood between their roots and the sand. There are even some 
conifers -- torrey island pines, canary island pines, thunbergiana -- and 
several fruit trees: peaches, plums, loquat, apricot, tangerines and lemons. In 
the back, also in pots, are about 12 different herbs and a few tomato plants.  
</P>
<P>
 No one is completely happy with this arrangement. The trees can't really 
settle in and take root, the fruit harvest does not exactly conjure images of 
Breughel, the eastern white oaks are, frankly, a little homesick. Eventually, 
the cottonwood will want to leave home. Everybody's longing for more earth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pleasure they give is enormous; they sweeten the air, they fill the 
views from windows with green, they filter the light and rustle in the evening 
breezes. In return, we try to make it palatable with promises for a better 
future and more space.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Nollman's garden is on an island in Puget Sound. He gardens about an acre 
of vegetables, flowers and herbs, with several outlying orchards or special 
beds for asparagus, blackberries and the odd sequoia. He gardens, he writes, he 
ruminates, and he writes about gardening. His family eats very very well, and 
some of his harvests leave the reader with a keen craving for, say, freshly 
picked artichokes (something I've never tasted but I think the atavistic memory 
must be stored genetically in my body) and no place to go, short of driving to 
Santa Cruz (the artichoke epicenter). 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us around to the problem of Modern Life. Nollman is against our 
self-defeating efforts to control and master nature. He draws his inspiration 
from Japanese gardeners, from the Findhorn gardeners in Scotland (who believe 
in the individual spirits of plants), from the Gaia Hypothesis (that the 
biosphere is a self-regulating organism), and in the Chinese concept of feng 
shui (literally wind-water), which "teaches that people possess two souls. The 
shen soul is associated with the heavens; the kewi soul relates to the Earth. 
We exist precisely at the intersection . . . heaven and earth are equally 
sacred." We must, he insists, cultivate a sacred sense of place. "What the 
environmental community may lack most," he writes, "is an ability to engage 
people in their daily lives in a positive creative and joyful manner." 
Gardening accomplishes this by restoring our missing sense of place.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Nollman's many gifts to the reader is an admirable bibliography 
scattered throughout the book of this kind of literature, spanning centuries 
and continents and disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is his effort to combine the reasons we garden -- for beauty, for 
nourishment, to get outside, to play around in the dirt -- into something 
larger than the sum of its parts: more like a life's work than a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 One symptom of having a sense of place seems to be the desire to plant things 
only our children's children may be around to enjoy, like the sequoia Nollman 
plants when he first begins to write the book, or, on a shorter timeline, 
things like asparagus and orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four tree gardener," writes Nollman, "thinks in terms of a generation. 
The zero tree gardener thinks in terms of a few years. And in 1,200 years, that 
sequoia tree may be growing on a hill of its own making." 
</P>
<P>
 There are roughly 70 million gardening households in the United States. And 
gardeners, Nollman warns, can be a snobby bunch. Born-again Utopians, they've 
glimpsed paradise and feel quite "highly evolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to win converts, not alienate the unfortunate slobs and 
supermarket shoppers. Nollman, with his weakness for cabbages ("the heart is as 
perfect as one might expect from a vigorous, healthy, organically grown 
cabbage," he says proudly at one point of a young six-pounder) and his 
reverence for sequoias will do just that, even as he prepares exuberantly and 
diligently for "the utter breakdown of society."

HEALTH WATCH: BODY WATCH; A CONNECTION BETWEEN DIZZINESS AND DEPRESSION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors diagnosing dizzy spells shouldn't discount the patient's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of patients suffering from dizziness shows that almost half also 
experienced depression or anxiety, says Dr. Michael R. Clark, a Johns Hopkins 
psychiatrist. When treated with anti-depressants, therapy or both, the patients 
said their dizziness cleared up or became less severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dizziness is the ninth most common reason people of all ages go to a doctor. 
It ranks third among people over age 65 and first among those over 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, dizziness is sorted into four types: 
</P>
<P>
 * Vertigo -- the world seems to be spinning out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meniere's syndrome -- pressure in the inner ear causes severe pain and 
imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Labyrinthitis -- a viral infection of the ear affecting hearing and balance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-specific dizziness. Many patients whose symptoms were non-specific had a 
history of depression or panic attacks. Pelvic Exercise Can Help Incontinent 
Children 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institute of Mental Health says about 4% of children age 4-12 
suffer from urinary incontinence. A pelvic exercise can help bed-wetters and 
children who wet themselves during the day, say researchers at Duke University 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Children were taught Kegel exercises, tightening for five to 20 seconds the 
muscles that control urinary flow. The technique was developed by Los Angeles 
physician Arnold H. Kegel. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of 79 children, average age 7 1/2, 47 were cured of daytime incontinence 
within two months, 11 improved, and 21 did not benefit. For some children, the 
technique could eliminate the need for medications, urine alarms and surgery. 
Aquatic Creatures Can Cause Health Problems 
</P>
<P>
 Go for a swim in an ocean or lake and you will bump into aquatic organisms. 
Among the problems caused by waterborne creatures are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Swimmer's ear, an infection of the ear canal. Moisture and temperature allow 
microorganisms to multiply, resulting in inflammation and pain. Alcohol drops 
evaporate the moisture. Less irritating medication is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skin punctures from sea urchins with protruding spines. Waders are apt to 
touch or sit on the small animals, which respond with a stinging splinter. Pull 
it straight out and see a doctor for an oral antibiotic and a tetanus shot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jellyfish stings. Tentacles release a toxin into the skin. Do not touch the 
area. Rinse it with saltwater (not fresh water). Apply an antibiotic cream. 
Jellyfish can get you on the beach too. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Acetaminophen doesn't reduce pain during or immediately following 
circumcision, and circumcised newborn boys do experience great and persistent 
pain, researchers conclude. . . . The majority of malpractice claims against 
physicians result from neurological and other birth-related injuries, cancer, 
fracture and spinal problems, cardiac arrest and heart disease. . . . 
Precocious puberty disorder (before age 8 for girls, 9 for boys) is treatable 
with a hormone that inhibits the pituitary gland, delaying puberty until a more 
appropriate age.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; TUNING IN TO THE TURTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On warm, sunny Sunday afternoons when the sun isn't too hot, I like to drag my 
huge papasan chair out in my back yard and read the paper or a good book.My 
neighbors have a turtle about the size of a puppy. While I'm reading, the 
turtle will do laps around my chair. When I want to take a break from reading, 
I'll count how many seconds it takes the turtle to complete a full circle. It's 
very relaxing watching the turtle haul its heavy shell.

STREISAND TOUR ENDS: CAN ANYONE FOLLOW THIS ACT?; POP MUSIC REVIEW: THE 
SEVEN-CITY EVENT WAS A FINELY ORCHESTRATED TRIUMPH OF VISION AND BOX-OFFICE 
SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Barbra Streisand has ended her celebrated seven-city tour with a 
warm, relaxed performance on Sunday at the Pond of Anaheim, are there lessons 
to be learned for the pop music world? 
</P>
<P>
 You bet -- though most concert executives may focus on the wrong ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that promoters will be dazzled by the box-office grosses for the 
26 shows -- a staggering $65 million to $70 million. That means they may spend 
all their time trying to figure out who else can command close to her top price 
of $350 (excepting the Las Vegas shows). 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar question this morning: What price Michael Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
 Even better: What price Michael Jackson . . . with an opening act of Lisa 
Marie Presley, who wants a singing career? 
</P>
<P>
 It will be fascinating to see what prices will be attached to what stars in 
coming years, but the real lesson of the Streisand tour is the show itself. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a triumph of finances, these Streisand shows -- which she says 
represented her last-ever tour -- were a triumph of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop executives should make sure their mainstream acts -- from Whitney Houston 
to Mariah Carey -- make a tape of Streisand's two-hour HBO TV special (airing 
Aug. 21) and study it daily. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason there is so little acclaim for mainstream figures in the modern pop 
era is that few of their songs offer the character or revelation of the best 
rock, country or soul songs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why shows by such artists as Houston and Carey seem like random, 
arbitrary exercises. Instead of giving the songs added weight by putting them 
into some sort of intelligent context, the only thinking behind the selection 
and order of material revolves around issues of pacing and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula is painfully simple: You put a slow song here, a fast one there; a 
song to plug the new album here, an old favorite there. And, you save your 
biggest hit until the end. It's what everybody does, so it must work, right? 
</P>
<P>
 On this tour, Streisand -- who now plans to return to filmmaking -- challenged 
that game plan. Ignoring such Top 10 hits as "Stoney End" and "No More Tears," 
she picked songs that meant something to her, and she arranged them in 
revealing thematic sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I'm frightened" were the first words she sang in the show, 
and that song -- "As If We Never Said Goodbye" -- immediately personalized the 
evening, because stage fright was a major reason Streisand hadn't toured in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Still Here," a witty expression of self-affirmation with special lyrics 
to reflect on Streisand's career and image, reinforced the idea that this was a 
show about Streisand, not just a concert by her. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, songs about relationships were woven into a sequence that took you 
from the sexual awakening of "He Touched Me" through the heartbreak of "The Man 
That Got Away" to the eventual optimism of "On a Clear Day (You Can See 
Forever)." While the songs are of uneven quality, they blend together to make a 
convincing whole. Other songs were also linked meaningfully. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Streisand -- who earlier in the tour stuck close to the show's 
script -- seemed especially comfortable in the spotlight. As a bonus, she 
invited the fans to stick around for an extra half hour while she taped some 
additional numbers for the TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, she was freewheeling and relaxed, frequently throwing in 
ad-libs and kidding with the crowd. As fans shouted song requests at one point, 
she smiled and said something that other mainstream pop stars ought to put on 
their walls: "I have this planned, you know."

 All-Star Tribute: The first Elvis Presley tribute authorized by the late 
entertainer's estate will take place Oct. 8 in Presley's hometown of Memphis. 
The lineup for "Elvis Aaron Presley -- the Tribute" has not been confirmed, but 
those expressing interest so far include Elton John, U2, Lyle Lovett, the Judds 
and Bon Jovi. The tribute, featuring all-star performances of Elvis classics, 
will be broadcast live on pay-per-view, and will later be turned into a live 
album and home video. The event is co-produced by Avalon Attractions, PolyGram 
Diversified Entertainment and Elvis Presley Enterprises, and proceeds will go 
to the Memphis-based St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the music 
industry's T.J. Martell Foundation. And although organizers are remaining mum 
about the reported wedding between Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, and pop star 
Michael Jackson, they say the Gloved One is rumored to be among the event's 
performers.

 Helms Amendment Killed: A controversial amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
was effectively killed Monday when the Senate voted 49-42 to table a Helms' 
amendment that would have forbidden National Endowment for the Arts funds for 
any project or artwork depicting human body mutilation, invasive body 
procedures or bloodletting. The vote, which Helms proposed in response to a 
controversial performance by artist Ron Athey at the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis, took place after Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) argued that 
the amendment would effectively forbid portrayals of Christ on the Cross. The 
Senate is still considering a 5% budget cut that would target theater, visual 
art and presenting programs, trimming the endowment's 1995 budget to $161.6 
million. The House version of the same budget stipulated a 2% cut.

 NEA Grants: In other NEA news, the endowment on Monday announced $31.5 million 
in grants to 1,127 arts groups and individual artists, including close to $5 
million in grants designed to "help make the arts a basic part of K-12 
education." Also included in the grants was $4 million for public television, 
$4.6 million for museum exhibitions and $7.1 million for theaters. Among the 
largest local grants are $215,000 for the Mark Taper Forum's 1994-95 theater 
season; $115,000 for South Coast Repertory's 1994-95 theater season; $90,000 to 
UCLA's Wight Art Gallery for the exhibition "Pacific Dreams: Responses to 
Surrealism in California Art, 1954-1957"; $60,000 for "Exiles and Emigres: 
1933-1948," an upcoming exhibition at the L.A. County Museum of Art; and 
$45,000 to the Craft & Folk Art Museum to support a touring exhibition by

 'X-Files' Goes Online: Fans of Fox's TV series "The X-Files" will be able to 
share close encounters with the series' creators in an online service from 
Delphi Internet. Creator/executive producer Chris Carter, along with the 
writers and producers of the series, will participate in online forums and live 
conferences designed to "not only discuss specific episodes of the show, but 
also share ideas and information about paranormal activities and unexplained 
phenomena." The service will also offer database information about the series, 
a programming schedule and episode guide, as well as polls focusing on specific 
episodes and paranormal activities. "The X-Files" stars David Duchovny and 
Gillian Anderson as a pair of FBI agents who investigate cases that seemingly 
involve paranormal phenomena.

 More Otherworldly Views: "Nick at Nite's" Will Miller, a licensed 
psychotherapist, ordained minister and stand-up comic, will host "The Other 
Side," a weekday morning series on NBC that will tackle subjects ranging from 
alternative medicine, dreams and near-death experiences to romantic ghost 
stories. The program, which premieres in October and is being billed as an 
alternative to talk shows, will feature experts, guests and a studio audience.

THEATER REVIEW; THE ROAD AT PADUA FESTIVAL CAN BE LONG AND WINDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a late-breaking update on part two of the Padua Hills Playwrights 
Festival at Woodbury University: Whoever makes it through the nearly five hours 
of B Series will find at the end a delightful piece of ensemble acting in Susan 
Champagne's fizzy comedy "Away From Me." Up until that point, however, the 
evening feels longer than "Nicholas Nickleby."  
</P>
<P>
 In the noble Padua tradition, the audience tromps from one outdoor site to 
another, learning how gracefully a cement courtyard or a ramp for the disabled 
can serve as an impromptu stage. The playwrights all direct their own work. 
</P>
<P>
 The B Series starts on a hyperbolic pitch with festival founder Murray 
Mednick's "Switchback," which takes place in an apocalyptic "Mad Max" 
landscape. A woman with a baby carriage is dodging gunfire. So is a young woman 
dressed as a young man. Enter a soldier (his entrance, achieved with the help 
of remote-control toys, is one of the high points of the entire festival) and 
you have the family of man represented on stage: Mother, Man, Young Woman/Young 
Man, Baby. "Switchback" is happiest when things are symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick's language has a pseudo-Beckett rhythm, particularly when the women 
can't decide what to do. Sometimes the cross-dresser, convulsing from fear and 
a drug dependency, sounds like a Jet in "West Side Story": "Kids are stickin' 
it to each other all over -- Sarajevo and Rio and Brooklyn." True, but do we 
need this screamed at us by a twitching methadone addict? Bring back the 
remote-control toys. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the next site -- Susan Mosakowski sets "Locofoco" on a little bit of 
lawn where four sisters lounge in four large boxes. One of them, Novena Jet 
(Shawna Casey), hosts a late-night radio show for Jesus. Another (Tina Preston) 
used to host the news, and she's still getting satellite feeds from the 
transmitter embedded in her ear. "No, I don't want the top stories!" she 
screams to no one. A third sister, Kore (Molly Cleator), is regularly abducted 
by aliens, and the fourth (Pamela Gordon), sells fire insurance in order to go 
to Casablanca and get that sex change operation.  
</P>
<P>
 Piled one on the other, the sisters' insistent eccentricities are cloying. 
Cleator alone breaks through, with her passionate demand of one of her sisters, 
"Parts of me are missing! Find them!"  
</P>
<P>
 Shem Bitterman's "Justice" is the only play that uses an institutional space 
(the courtyard of a college building) to explore the cold, urban places where 
certain crimes are committed and where condemned men are sent.  
</P>
<P>
 "Justice" follows a black prisoner named Anderson (Jerome Butler) on a 
Job-like odyssey through the prison system, where a white guard taunts him by 
gently explaining that God is a black man and Satan white before administering 
a brutal beating. Questions of innocence and guilt swirl about, and the moral 
issues remain purposefully cloudy. If Anderson is not a murderer, as he claims, 
it is only because of a lame technicality (he scared a guy into shooting 
himself). After the guard's beating, he turns his wheelchair in circles 
demanding, "What the (expletive) is justice?"  
</P>
<P>
 Finally a sadist named Jim (the excellent Peter Berg) delivers a spiritual 
afterward that smells of overwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it's a relief to get to the clipped phrases and shapely scenes of 
Champagne's "Away From Me." A nerdy shrink (Steven Keyes) is losing control of 
a group therapy session as the play starts. "How does everyone feel about how 
she feels?" is a favorite question. Champagne is a wonderful director with a 
light touch, and this is the only play of the evening that has one. The cast is 
excellent. 
</P>

the first series, known as the A Series, should be the first stop.

DANCE REVIEW; 'KALEIDOSCOPE' TAKES VARIED PATHS WITH VARIED SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning with a fake antique from Fresno and ending with anarchic energies 
from Riverside, "Dance Kaleidoscope '94" offered a second program of really 
drastic diversity at Cal State L.A. on Sunday. (It repeats Friday.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pride of place on the seven-part bill belonged to two dark, forceful and 
complex contemporary works previously reviewed in these pages: Winifred R. 
Harris' trio "Like a Deer in Headlights" for Between Lines and Naomi Goldberg's 
quartet from "American Studies" for Los Angeles Modern Dance and Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern dance was also strongly represented by Katja Beisanz's "Legacy," a solo 
recalling in speech and gesture-based motion the loss of her family's homestead 
in a forest fire. Personal and homespun, the piece would be even more affecting 
if the text were spoken by the dancer, instead of on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Also responding to loss, Charles Maple's "Angel of the Abyss" for Pasadena 
Dance Theatre piled up grandiose pictorial effects in a Eurotrash ritual set to 
the Mozart Requiem. However, only the passages dominated by the superbly 
expressive Gilma Bustillo matched the power of the music and thus fulfilled the 
quintet's mission: honoring the memory of the late Gregory Osborne (a colleague 
of Maple's at American Ballet Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rose's cryptic, downbeat trio "A Prior Arrangement" also seemed a kind 
of lament -- perhaps for a world that grinds down women as relentlessly as the 
propulsive, nonstop athleticism of the work oppressed the stoic Kelli King. By 
the final pileup, King's endurance had become heroic, as if she'd survived 
Bosnia, Rwanda and more. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Faith Jensen-Ismay made women into brain-dead victims of 
cellulite obsession in her witless parody of fitness mania, "Image-A-Nation" 
for Mojalet Dance Collective. Some of her mime ideas looked promising, but her 
inability to expand them into purposeful group choreography undercut her 
hard-working seven-woman cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Ballet Pacifica, the Fresno Ballet offered Anton Dolin's familiar 
"Le Pas de Quatre," a 1941 showpiece evoking (without much accuracy) a ballet 
equivalent of "The Three Tenors" event circa 1845. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires contemporary dancers to impersonate four celebrated ballerinas of 
the Romantic age and, in recent years, has served as a vehicle for our own 
classical icons. (A new videotape, for example, features Nina Ananiashvili of 
the Bolshoi, Darci Kistler of New York City Ballet, Rose Gad of the Royal 
Danish Ballet and Tatiana Terekhova of the Kirov.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Fresno Ballet could muster neither stars nor stylists and, for all 
the good taste in Don Bradburn's staging, it provided a decidedly lackluster 
opening to the program. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; A 'PHANTOM' FIT FOR ORANGE COUNTY STAGE 
</P>

 Question No. 1: Is it possible, after a 4 1/2-year run at the Ahmanson 
Theatre, that anyone in the greater Los Angeles area who wanted to see Andrew 
Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera" has not already seen it? 
</P>
<P>
 Question No. 2: If you answered no to No. 1, then who were all those people 
Sunday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center for the opening night 
of the Orange County stop of the show's third -- yes, third -- national 
company? 
</P>
<P>
 Question No. 3: Would all of the Phantomaniacs ruthlessly compare the touring 
show's Grant Norman's Phantom to Davis Gaines', or before his, Robert 
Guillaume's, or before his, Michael Crawford's? Or would there be a line of new 
Grantmaniacs forming near the dressing rooms after the show? 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Grantmania may be too early to call, but try as the show's 
coterie of fans might to find production or musical cut-backs for this very 
expensive bus-and-truck edition, they will be hard-pressed to do so. Segerstrom 
Hall is no small house, and this "Phantom" fits it handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman's tragic monster may lack a little of Crawford's pure show-stopping 
energy, but this Phantom contains a desperation that we haven't seen before, 
and Norman's voice goes for the upper reaches with no strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne McEwan's Christine, craved by both the Phantom and young Raoul (John 
Schroeder), is more of a puzzle. Christine is weak and tremulous as she tries 
out for the prima donna role, then becomes confidently strong. So with McEwan, 
particularly on "Angel of Music" and the showcaser, "Wishing You Were Somehow 
Here Again," when she can barely be heard above musical director Glenn 
Langdon's fervent orchestra. Otherwise, Christine's opera moments allow McEwan 
to prove her ample opera gifts, making her a worthy obsession of the Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast feels right at home, firmly led by Schroeder, who 
explosively bursts through Raoul's nice-guy shell when pushed too far. 
</P>

SURGING GIANTS HOPE STRAWBERRY HAUNTS DODGERS; BASEBALL: SAN FRANCISCO PULLS 
WITHIN 1 1/2 GAMES OF L.A. ATOP THE NL WEST GOING INTO THREE-GAME SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers released Darryl Strawberry to end a problem-plagued association. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a sobered Strawberry is back and he's still a problem for the Dodgers, 
who got their first look at the renewed slugger and the team he helped revive 
in Monday night's game against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, batting .310 with two home runs and 11 runs batted in since 
joining the Giants, has helped San Francisco surge back into contention in the 
NL West. 
</P>
<P>
 His July 7 arrival coincided with a 12-2 burst that carried the Giants within 
1 1/2 games of the front-running Dodgers, losers of eight of their last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 What was a struggling Giant offense has come back to life. Barry Bonds and 
Matt Williams, the two players batting in front of Strawberry in the order, are 
batting a combined .343 with seven doubles, 13 home runs and 31 RBIs in the 12 
games Strawberry has started heading into Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This the first time in a long time that I'm playing with a team that's 
together," Strawberry said as the Giants wound up a series with his first team, 
the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no team chemistry with the Dodgers. We have it here now, just as 
the Mets used to have it when I played for them. What happened in L.A. happened 
and I don't really want to get into it. Let's just say things did not work 
out," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from a grudge match, Strawberry said his first game against the Dodgers as 
a member of the Giants was important because of its meaning in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm now playing for the Giants and I do my job for the Giants," Strawberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has declined to engage Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda in a war of words despite 
fresh criticism from his former manager, who earlier decried Strawberry's drug 
relapse as a character weakness, not an illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He let a lot of people down. He let himself down, he let his family down, he 
let his teammates down, he let the fans down," Lasorda told New York Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you something: The guy he let down the most is the guy who paid 
him all that money," Lasorda said, referring to Dodger owner Walter O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry left New York for his hometown team in 1991, signing a five-year, 
$20.25-million deal. He had one productive season for the Dodgers before 
chronic back problems limited him to 75 games in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 During spring training, he failed to show up for an April 3 Dodger exhibition 
and five days later checked into the Betty Ford Center near Palm Springs to 
undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was released by the Dodgers on May 25 after accepting a 
$4.8-million contract settlement.

MITCHELL MAKES POINT IN BAD WILL 100; GOODWILL GAMES: SPRINTER, SAYING HE WAS 
FINANCIALLY UNDER-APPRECIATED, BEATS BURRELL AND LEWIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing confusing about the selection process for the marquee events 
in the Goodwill Games' track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a proven reputation, like Carl Lewis, Linford Christie or Leroy 
Burrell, you receive an invitation wrapped in the currency of your choice. If 
all you've done is win a bronze medal in the Olympics and a couple of more in 
the World Championships, like Dennis Mitchell, you must earn your plane fare, 
room and board and perhaps a few rubles for spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell did, winning the 100 meters in last month's U.S. championships. Then 
he revealed his bad will for the Goodwill Games, renouncing his right to his 
lane as well as all of those rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was insulted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Great Britain's Christie, the reigning Olympic and world champion, 
injured a hamstring last week and withdrew, the Goodwill Games' talent 
procurers, desperate for another world-class sprinter for one of their main 
events, called Mitchell and offered him a sweet deal to reconsider. Suddenly, 
he was no longer insulted that he had been forced to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, believe that he had a larger point to prove. It was evident 
in his eyes, which he used to stare down the finish line in a pre-race warm-up 
that entertained the Petrovsky Stadium crowd of about 15,000 almost as much as 
the race itself, that he intended to do it here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. His time of 10.07 seconds, respectable considering the 
stiff wind of 1.9 meters per second in his face, did not approach the world 
100-meter record of 9.85 set two weeks ago by Burrell. But all that mattered 
was that it was better than the second-place Burrell's 10.07 and the 
third-place Jon Drummond's 10.12, and it allowed Mitchell, in all modesty, to 
respond positively to a question at the post-race news conference about whether 
he is the world's best sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to live up to the tradition of a cocky sprinter and say I am," said 
Mitchell, who trains in Westwood with Coach John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the man who can claim to be the best of all time? 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, running his second 100 of the summer, was never a factor, finishing 
fourth in 10.23. He then announced that he probably will not fulfill his 
commitment to compete in today's long jump against world record-holder Mike 
Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how I would respond going back to back like that against 
world-record holders," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a stirring afternoon for living legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Pole vaulter Sergei Bubka of the Ukraine, who holds the world record for 
setting track and field world records, was irritated by a swirling wind and 
cleared only one height, 18 feet 8 1/4 inches, as he finished third. Russians 
Igor Trandenkov and Maxim Tarasov were one-two at 19-4 1/4 and 19-0 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has not lost a heptathlon that she has completed 
since 1984, fell behind after three events before rallying in the fourth, the 
200 meters, to take a 109-point lead over Russia's Larisa Turchinskaya into 
today's final three events. 
</P>
<P>
 In another close race, Russia's 42-year-old Ekaterina Podkopyeva ran the 1,500 
meters in 4:04.92 to edge Ireland's 25-year-old Sonia O'Sullivan, who finished 
in 4:04.97. 
</P>
<P>
 But the award for perseverance belongs to Gwen Torrence. After beating 
Russia's Irina Privalova in the 100 Sunday, Torrence was confident of 
completing the double in Monday's 200. But, for some unexplained reason, she 
did not hear the starter's instructions, never got into her set position and 
allowed Privalova a sizable head start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to roll out of the blocks," Torrence said. "I was a few meters behind 
Privalova and thought about giving up. But I thought about all the people who 
had come to see me run. I made up my mind to run like hell." 
</P>
<P>
 That she did, winning in a fast 22.09. Privalova was second in 22.33. 
</P>
<P>
 While Torrence was on the victory stand to receive her gold medal, Mitchell 
interrupted his pre-race act long enough to salute her. That was the only time 
his attention was diverted from the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 After two false starts in the men's 100, none of the male sprinters got out of 
the blocks well except Mitchell. And 45 yards into the race, the only one with 
even a chance to challenge him was Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came hard with about 60 meters to go and almost pulled it out," Burrell 
said. "But that's neither here nor there. Dennis beat me to 100 meters." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's coach, Smith, was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leroy came over to Europe and ran one race that every other sprinter in the 
world would like to have run," Smith said. "But it was just one race. Dennis 
has been more consistent. He's the hot sprinter right now, and when he's in a 
streak like this, who knows what he might do?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fun day for Smith and Mitchell. But before they left to celebrate, 
the sprinter wanted everyone to know he had another reason for winning besides 
proving he could. He said he had dedicated his race to refugees from Rwanda.

DODGERS SPURN THE STRAWBERRY JINX TO WIN, 10-5; BASEBALL: MARTINEZ PITCHES 
WELL, KARROS HITS TWO HOME RUNS AS L.A. TAKES BIG LEAD AND HOLDS OFF GIANTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Some of the Dodgers, trying to explain their five-game losing streak, thought 
maybe it would take a series of this importance to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at Candlestick Park Monday knowing they would once again be subject 
to the hoopla surrounding former teammate Darryl Strawberry and having seen 
their lead over the San Francisco Giants in the NL West shrink to 1 1/2 games, 
the Dodgers played well.  
</P>
<P>
 Before 50,144, they didn't falter, rolling to a 10-5 victory behind strong 
starting pitching by Ramon Martinez and two home runs by first baseman Eric 
Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember a game having this kind of media coverage with this many 
people on the field before the game except for camera day last week," Karros 
said. "We needed this as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers needed a strong performance from a starter, and Martinez provided 
it, shutting out the Giants until the seventh inning, when Matt Williams 
crushed the first pitch he saw into the left field seats for his 37th home run. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to go all out tonight," Martinez said. "I was really concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers needed a big inning, and they got that in the sixth, sending 11 
batters to the plate in a five-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros' home runs in the second, a solo shot, and ninth, a three-run blast, 
were his second and third in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 With a strike threat looming, the atmosphere at Candlestick Park before the 
game was more like a playoff game than a mid-season series. Darryl Strawberry 
in a Giants' uniform was an added feature, and, before the game, the entire 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one several Dodger players stopped and said hello to Strawberry at the 
batting cage. But nothing seemed to get more attention than an earlier 
encounter, when Strawberry, spotting Manager Tom Lasorda on the field, went 
over and briefly said hello. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry says he harbors no animosity toward Lasorda for having said that 
drug abuse is a weakness, not a disease. And Lasorda says he and Strawberry are 
good friends. But when it comes to the game, it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say that I do not want Darryl to be successful for the Giants because 
that is the team we are competing against," Lasorda said. "But after that's all 
over, I want him to be successful and have a happy life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giant fans, who love to hate Lasorda, did so in vociferous tradition 
before the game, booing Lasorda as he made the long walk across the field to 
the Dodger dugout. Lasorda, also in traditional fashion, waved and blew kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant fans, though, showed their appreciation for Strawberry, giving him a 
standing ovation before his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Strawberry joined the team July 7, the Giants are 12-3. With the help of 
the Dodgers' 4-10 skid, the Giants made up eight games in the standings to pull 
to within 1 1/2 games of the division-leading Dodgers, setting up the 
three-game showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are right where we want to be, we're still in the pennant race," 
Strawberry said. "It's nothing to panic about. Tonight was just not our night." 
</P>
<P>
 The game reminded the Dodgers of the spring, or even a month ago, when they 
would not only hit the ball, but score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers knocked out starter Mark Portugal (9-7) in a five-run sixth 
inning, but left-handed reliever Bryan Hickerson didn't fare much better.  
</P>
<P>
 With the Dodgers leading by 2-0, Tim Wallach led off the inning with a single 
and moved to third on a double by Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rafael Bournigal at bat and one out, Raul Mondesi was intentionally 
walked. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strategy backfired. Bournigal's opposite-field single to right scored 
Wallach and Karros. Brett Butler singled up the middle for one run and Mike 
Piazza added two more runs with an opposite-field single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants scored three runs in the ninth against closer Todd Worrell, one on 
a home run by former Dodger Todd Benzinger.

 The Rams' ongoing auditions for a receiver to play opposite starter Flipper

 Rookie Chris Brantley, who had caught the attention of the coaching staff, has 
been sidelined because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brantley has been very impressive," Coach Chuck Knox said. "I just hope this 
is a temporary setback." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, on the final play of practice, wide receiver Sean LaChapelle was 
tackled by Dexter Davis in a non-tackling drill and injured his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams began training camp with 11 wide receivers competing for three or 
four spots. Jeff Jones was released earlier this week, and Todd Kinchen was 
placed on the injured list because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young had seven sacks in the first four games last 
season, then injured a knee and was lost for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's back, and according to Knox, is in prime form. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has looked great and has dominated in the one-on-one pass rushes," Knox 
said. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; PLAYER SUES: RACISM HURT PERFORMANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolphins' linebacker Bryan Cox, who said he was taunted by racist slurs by 
fans in Buffalo last season, is suing the NFL, charging racial discrimination 
made him a lesser player and prompted him to drink heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first nine games, you saw a Bryan Cox playing with emotion and 
kicking butt," he said. "For the last five games I didn't lose control of 
myself, you saw a person that was just out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox was fined $10,000 by the NFL for responding to Buffalo fans with obscene 
gestures. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue later reduced the fine to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox was also fined $3,000 for unnecessary roughness against the Philadelphia 
Eagles and $5,000 for outbursts against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Cox filed the suit Monday in U.S. District Court in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox charges that the NFL forced him to play in a "racially hostile 
environment" during the Bills-Dolphins game in Orchard Park, N.Y., and did 
little to defuse the situation, according to the Palm Beach Post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for money, but for a change in policy for what the league put 
me through last year," Cox said. "It was handled very poorly and it has made me 
bitter toward them, enough for me to want to expose them for what they are." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk vaulted to the top of the NFL's rookie salary list Monday, 
agreeing to a contract that could be worth $17.2 million over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a different type of back than they are used to seeing," Faulk said. "I 
have enough speed to break a long one. I can catch the ball and run inside or 
outside with it. I think I can do just about anything that is asked of me." 
</P>
<P>
 He joins a team that averaged a league-low 294.1 yards on offense last season. 
The Colts (4-12) also had the league's least productive rushing game (80.5 
yards) for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts announced late Monday they had signed linebacker Trev Alberts of 
Nebraska, the team's second pick in the first round and the fifth choice 
overall. The Indianapolis Star reported Alberts received a six-year, $8 million 
deal that included a $3.2 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk will receive a $5.1 million signing bonus and his total package eclipses 
the $14.4 million top pick Dan Wilkinson of the Cincinnati Bengals could 
receive over six years. Almost no NFL contracts are guaranteed for more than 
one season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Taylor, the Green Bay Packers' top draft pick who is expected to be 
sidelined until December with a knee injury, agreed to a four-year contract. 
The deal with Taylor, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound offensive guard from Notre Dame and 
the 16th overall pick in the NFL draft, is believed to be worth about $4 
million. . . . The New England Patriots said running back Marion Butts will be 
sidelined for at least two weeks after arthroscopic surgery to repair torn knee 
cartilage.

MORNING BRIEFING: SPORTS HEROES AND VICTORIES REIGN IN SPAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has Spain become the world's latest sporting power? A look at Sunday's results 
might lead to that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Indurain won the Tour de France for the fourth year in a row. Conchita 
Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario led Spain to a clean sweep of the United 
States in the Federation Cup tennis final at Frankfurt. Alberto Berasategui won 
the Mercedes Cup tennis championship. And Miguel Angel Jimenez won the Dutch 
Open golf tournament by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is the Spanish day, with two Miguels winning at the same time," Jiminez 
said. "I don't know him, but we are brother sportsmen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Spain: Education Minister Gustavo Suarez Pertierra, in charge of national 
sports programs, said: "This exemplary effort, which produces such results, is 
a prime example for Spanish youth, not just so they learn more about sports, 
but so they learn to exert themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who won the American Professional Soccer League championship last 
year? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason: Steve August, traveling secretary of the Boston Red Sox, 
claims the Seattle Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. caused tiles to fall from the 
Kingdome's ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they'd stop blowing off those fireworks up there in that Kingdome every 
time Ken Griffey hits a home run, maybe the ceiling tiles would stay up there," 
August said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had to happen: As far as the Philadelphia Phillies' Danny Jackson is 
concerned, he was completely justified in hitting the San Diego Padres' Craig 
Shipley in the leg with a pitch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stole last night with a 7-1 lead," Jackson said. "He knew it was wrong. He 
knew it was coming, and so did everyone else. The ball was down, it wasn't at 
his head or his neck. I just wanted to get a point across. When you do 
something to embarrass another team, you have to expect something to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No DH for Spahn: On this day in 1962, Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves set 
a National League record for home runs by a pitcher when he hit the 31st of his 
career against the New York Mets' Craig Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you: Losses are not taken lightly in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 After 17-year-old Razvan Sabau of Romania upset Jeremy Bates, Britain's No. 1 
player, and then Mark Petchey to give Romania a 3-2 victory that eliminated 
Britain in the Davis Cup, the London Daily Express editorialized: "Britain has 
been shamefully shoved into the basement of world tennis by a boy barely 17 
years old." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A violent game: The Calgary Stampeders have put Albi the horse on the injured 
reserve list after the two-year veteran tangled with a barbed wire fence and 
hurt her left fetlock earlier this week. Albi races around McMahon Stadium 
every time the Canadian Football League team scores a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Rocky, a gray gelding, has been activated from the practice roster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No bargain bill: A rainout caused a rare day-night doubleheader between the 
Cleveland Indians and the Baltimore Orioles today at Camden Yards. The park 
will be cleared between games, and separate admission will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A little late: An American in England, after purchasing prints of Arnold 
Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Morris, said he knew where to get Palmer's and 
Nicklaus' autographs, but asked where he could contact Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris won the British Open four times in the 1860s.

GOODWILL GAMES ROUNDUP; U.S. BASKETBALL TEAM CRUISES, BRACES FOR ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Raveling has a dozen concerns about his young American basketball 
team's Goodwill Games semifinal against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 12 players that wear the uniform that says Italy on it, they all worry 
me," Raveling said, after the United States defeated winless China, 99-80, on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's other semifinal pits Puerto Rico against undefeated Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's victory partly atoned for Sunday's 77-75 loss to Russia, a match in 
which the young Americans had the jitters most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of collegiate players was more or less in command against China. Lou 
Roe of Massachusetts led the scoring with 19 points and Michael Finley of 
Wisconsin came off the bench to score 16, including 13 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 China's top scorer was Sun Jun with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us, this is like an Olympics," Finley said. "Any time, as a collegian, you 
have a chance to represent your country when the pros are now in the Olympics 
-- we look at it as the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like we were out of synch coming into the Russia game. Our game is to 
run, we didn't get into that tempo last night and not all the time today. I 
think our best game is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans scored mostly on transition baskets and had a wide edge in 
rebounding. But even those advantages came only in spurts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably the most impatient offensive team in this tournament," 
Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a whole team of guys who are used to having the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 When the game was tied early at 12-12, Shawn Respert of Michigan State scored 
eight consecutive points in about two minutes to push the Americans ahead, 
20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the 6-foot-6 Finley who provided an even more decisive lift. He 
scored nine points in less than three minutes to make it 33-20 with 7:41 left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been our most consistent player in the three games here at both ends of 
the floor," Raveling said of Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said his No. 1 concern with the undefeated Italians is 6-11 Gregor 
Fucka, his team's leading scorer in three games with an average of 13.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He moves well for a big man, shoots with both hands and passes the ball 
extremely well," Raveling said. "He's probably the best rebounder in the 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians also have the edge in experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been together three years, we have three weeks," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three other games Monday, Brazil defeated Croatia, 98-94; Italy beat 
Puerto Rico, 83-69, and Russia defeated Argentina, 89-80. BEACH VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 In an all-American battle in the semifinal round, Carlos Briceno of Fountain 
Valley and Jeff Williams of Santa Monica upset beach volleyball star Sinjin 
Smith of Pacific Palisades and Bruk Vandeweghe of Beverly Hills, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Briceno and Williams will face Norway's Jan Kvalhein and Bjoern Naaseide, who 
defeated Australia 15-10, for the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 American women split a pair with Brazilian teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan of San Diego won, 15-10, while 
Barbara Fontana of Laguna Beach and Lori Forsythe of Encinitas lost, 15-9. 
Kirby and Masakayan are in the final. BOXING 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. champion Carlos Navarro stopped Germany's Rene Schultz in the second 
round to advance to the semifinals in the 112-pound class.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; ALOU'S TRIPLE RALLIES EXPOS PAST BRAVES, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Moises Alou hit a two-run triple and the Montreal Expos came back to beat the 
Braves, 6-4, at Atlanta on Monday night for their seventh consecutive victory 
and a 2 1/2-game lead in the National League Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez (8-5), celebrating his 23rd birthday, allowed four hits and 
four runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think was more important was the fashion in which we won," said John 
Wetteland, who got his 19th save. "It looked like we were down, but we hung 
tough and made things happen in the late innings. That was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to consecutive home runs by Ryan Klesko and Terry Pendleton, who was 
making his first appearance since going on the 15-day disabled list, Atlanta 
led, 4-3, before Alou's game-winning triple against reliever Mark Wohlers (7-2) 
in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 11th blown save for the Braves in 34 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 4, San Diego 3 -- Andres Galarraga hit his 31st home run to help the 
Rockies overcome an 11-strikeout performance by Andy Benes at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Sheaffer broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning by leading off with his 
first homer of the year against Benes (6-12). Mike Kingery added a run-scoring 
single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Ritz (4-4) won his third consecutive decision, allowing two runs and 
five hits in six innings. He walked two and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ruffin, the fifth Colorado pitcher, worked 1 1/3 innings for his 16th 
save. Brian Johnson had a pinch-hit homer in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn went one-for-five, dropping his major league-leading average to 
.389. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Houston 4 -- Kevin Mitchell homered twice against Greg Swindell 
(7-7), and Bret Boone doubled home the go-ahead runs at Cincinnati, as the Reds 
moved two games ahead of Houston in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smiley (11-9) gave up four runs in the first two innings before settling 
down to get his seventh win in his last eight starts. Jeff Bagwell drove in his 
major league-leading 99th run for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, Florida 1 -- Curt Schilling, sidelined the past two months by 
injuries, allowed one unearned run in five innings at Miami for his first 
victory since last year's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Thompson's two-out RBI single in the sixth inning broke a 1-1 tie before 
Kevin Stocker's bases-loaded triple ignited the Phillies' six-run eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, St. Louis 1 -- Rico Brogna went five-for-five with two RBIs and 
Bret Saberhagen picked up his fifth consecutive victory with a seven-hitter at 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogna had three singles and two doubles, and Jeff Kent added two RBIs. 
Saberhagen (12-4) allowed a run on seven hits with five strikeouts and one 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 2 -- Denny Neagle ended a string of poor starts and hit 
his first major league home run to lead the Pirates at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Neagle (9-8), who had allowed nearly a run an inning in his previous four 
starts, pitched five-hit ball and struck out nine in seven innings. AMERICAN 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Minnesota 4 -- Jose Canseco hit his 27th home run of the season and 
Brian Bohanon won for the first time since July 15, 1993, for the Rangers at 
Arlington, Tex.  
</P>
<P>
 In his second start of the season, Bohanon (1-0) allowed three runs and six 
hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco ended a five game hitting slump with a solo homer in the fifth inning 
and Rusty Greer batted in two runs with singles as the Rangers ended their 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Chicago 4 -- Bob Hamelin hit a three-run home run in the bottom 
of the 12th inning to give the Royals a victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin homered against Roberto Hernandez (3-4). Hipolito Pichardo (4-3) got 
the win despite giving up a run in the top of the 12th on Tim Raines' two-out 
single.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY SAYS BACK INJURY WAS KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has said the same things before -- during spring training, after he got out 
of the Smithers Clinic for treatment of alcohol abuse; when he came to the 
Dodgers before the 1991 season. But Darryl Strawberry believes he can stay drug 
free and sober this time, though he acknowledges he is "scared daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who completed a drug-abuse program May 4 at the Betty Ford Center, 
says that staying in the after-care program will make the difference this time, 
although he knows the criticism and doubts of others continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Giant Manager) Dusty Baker told me to walk proud and hold my head up high 
and deal with things," Strawberry said. "The important thing is that I didn't 
hurt anybody but myself. Everybody said I let them down, but I didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I wasn't hurting the Dodgers, the Los Angeles fans or the San 
Francisco fans, I was hurting myself, I was dying inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who is tested for drugs three times a week, says there were 
periods over the last nine years when he was clean, such as this spring, when 
his work ethic and performance were praised by his peers, "but the addiction 
was always there."  
</P>
<P>
 His level of addiction increased, he said, when he suffered a back injury and 
couldn't play, a situation he said overwhelmed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking anything away from the Dodgers or (executive) Fred Claire or 
Mr. (owner Walter) O'Malley, but this (his addiction) was something a little 
bit more powerful than they could handle," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry believes one of the reasons for the criticism is because of the 
money he was earning from the Dodgers when he was injured. Ironically, the 
Dodgers, who paid Strawberry $642,857 this season before the settlement, paid 
him another $4,857,143 to buy him out. In essence, the Dodgers are paying 
Strawberry more than $5 million to play for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that if a man settles with a player and pays him a substantial 
amount of money, that player should not have a right to come back and defeat 
that owner," outfielder Brett Butler said. "Somehow, it just doesn't seem 
right." MARYANN HUDSON

 Former Manager Buck Rodgers, fired by the Angels on May 17, has been hired by 
the Philadelphia Phillies as their major league scout on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia General Manager Lee Thomas and Manager Jim Fregosi were Rodgers' 
teammates on the Angels in the 1960s.

 A decision on the site of the Angel-Seattle Mariner series Aug. 2-4 is 
expected to be made today or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 King County officials will determine whether 40,000 damaged ceiling tiles can 
be removed in time to play the three-game series at Seattle's Kingdome, as 
scheduled. If the 59,166-seat stadium is unavailable, the series probably will 
be shifted to Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, home of the Oakland Athletics' triple-A 
affiliate; B.C. Place in Vancouver, Canada, or Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who have been forced to postpone two games with the Baltimore 
Orioles and shift three home games with the Red Sox to Boston's Fenway Park, 
had no further comment Monday.

 Angel third base coach Ken Macha became manager of the Tempe Rafters of the 
Arizona Fall League on Monday. The Rafters, whose roster will include top 
prospects from the Angels, Dodgers, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals and 
Detroit Tigers, won the league's championship last season. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

 Despite several weeks of front office turmoil and offers from three other 
teams, Detlef Schrempf will stay with the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrempf signed a five-year contract for $20 million, the club said Monday. 
The 31-year-old forward said he received three other serious offers and heard 
from "a few other teams."

<P>
 All five years of Schrempf's new contract are guaranteed, agent Jeff Neal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrempf, who exercised a clause making himself an unrestricted free agent, 
stayed with Seattle despite the controversial departure of longtime president 
and general manager Bob Whitsitt, who became general manager of the Portland 
Trail Blazers.

PHILLIPS STOPS LLANES, RETAINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Nearly nine months after his last bout, was Verno Phillips rusty Monday night? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite, if Jaime Llanes' wobbling frame was any indicator. 
</P>
<P>
 Unleashing a series of combinations, Phillips retained his World Boxing 
Organization junior-middleweight title before 3,475 at the Forum by stopping 
Llanes at 2:46 of the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering his flurries with a sharp left hook that often found Llanes' body 
and chin, the 5-foot-8 1/2 Phillips buckled Llanes early in the third round 
after a shot to the body. But the 5-10 Llanes recovered and had Phillips 
struggling later in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was much tougher than I thought he would be, he kept coming back, I 
give him credit for that," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The layoff affected me. I haven't fought since October and I couldn't really 
do in there what I wanted to do because he was so tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my hooks were the difference -- he couldn't stand my hooks." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips controlled the pace in the fourth, fifth and sixth, scoring a 
knockdown in the fifth on another combination that culminated with a left to 
the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Llanes, who was coming forward in the early rounds, rose quickly from the 
knockdown, but never seemed to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 By the seventh, Phillips was in total control. He ended the fight with a left 
hook-right uppercut-left hook combination that sent Llanes lurching face 
forward to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Lou Moret stepped in before even starting a count. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who last fought when he took the title away from Lupe Aquino, 
improved to 24-4-1, and scored his 13th knockout, the eighth in his last nine 
fights. Llanes is 27-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, lightweight Fabian Tejeda (38-3-2) won a unanimous decision over 
Mauricio Aceves (27-3).

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ARTHUR LEE TAKES CHARGE OF LOVE FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1967, Love's "Seven and Seven Is" was almost more than a transistor radio 
could contain. It still stands as one of the greatest two minutes, 15 seconds 
of relentless, rampaging rock ever recorded, and back then it was all a 
three-inch speaker could do just to keep from melting when it came on. 
</P>
<P>
 And those lyrics that Love leader Arthur Lee was singing! Even in those 
psychedelic-glazed times, they were a bit beyond the pale: 
</P>
<P>
 If I don't start crying it's because that I have got no eyes .  
</P>
<P>
 My Bible's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Colorful though that was, any reading up on the man could lead one to believe 
that such conditions simply were business as usual around the Lee household. 
</P>
<P>
 Underrated then and scarcely accorded its due since, Lee's music was some of 
the most adventurous of that adventurous era, bursting with ideas, energy and 
feeling. But those were trippy times, and by most accounts, Lee's was one of 
those minds that went tripping and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last year, during a Coach House appearance, Lee appeared to be 
still on the casualty list, delivering a woozy, incoherent set that could 
scarcely even be regarded as a performance, being more the sort of monologue 
bartenders have to listen to all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the club Sunday on a bill where he again was paired (as he had 
been last year) with fellow '60s Sunset Strip kings Spirit, Lee was remarkably 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say that he wasn't ambling though the audience early in the 
evening, tumbler in hand, his breath a genuine fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, between songs in his set, his rambling discourses still made him 
seem like Soupy Sales on acid -- clowning, nearly stumbling, alternately joking 
with the audience and petulantly complaining that they didn't understand him. 
When one person in the audience grew impatient during a Lee digression on what 
toys he'd had as a child, the singer remonstrated: "This is your history, 
fool!" 
</P>
<P>
 But when he sang, backed by a spunky young band, Lee was downright majestic. 
One might almost suspect him of being the Frank Fontaine of his generation: On 
Jackie Gleason's '60s TV variety show Fontaine played Crazy Guggenheim, a dufus 
tongue-tied drunkard who would turn around and sing like an angel. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the hourlong show Lee gave the impression that at any instant he 
could as easily land on his keister as on the right note. But that only added 
an edgy immediacy to the performance, and he indeed did land on the right notes 
with a voice that alternately roared like a rock wildcat and soared heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
 In a black cowboy shirt and blue jeans, he opened the show with high stakes, 
kicking off with the flamenco-tinged, nakedly emotional 1967 hit "Alone Again 
Or."  
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the set's 13 songs -- the catchy punk-velocity new "Girl on Fire" 
-- was less than 20 years old, but there was no hint of nostalgia. A young 
quartet from Los Angeles called Baby Lemonade backed Lee and played with a 
raucous passion, though it was sufficiently reined-in to navigate the varied 
byways of Lee's muse. 
</P>
<P>
 We got the lysergic haze of "Orange Skies," the romanticism of "Andmoreagain," 
an especially rampaging "Seven and Seven Is" and Lee's moody song from 1966 
about heroin addiction, "Signed D.C." For good measure, Love's pummeling 
rendition of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's "My Little Red Book" also was 
thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the group clearly was devoted to Lee's music, they seemed to have less 
patience for the man himself, looking bored and loudly tuning during his 
digressions. When Lee began exchanging expletives with yet another member of 
the audience, the band cut him short by plunging into a blistering version of 
"Your Mind and We Belong Together." Lee joined in, channeling his anger into a 
raging vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 The edge that Lee's set had was nearly missing from Spirit's -- a shame, 
because at some points in its performance Spirit recaptured some aspects of its 
own '60s glory. That glory had been something to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Randy California's questing, soulful guitar work (by the time he was 
18, California had melded such disparate influences as Jimi Hendrix and Wes 
Montgomery into a remarkably original and potent guitar style), the quintet had 
freely mixed rock, jazz and other sources in vivid and vital musical 
excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early '70s, Spirit has been pretty much California's show, with only 
drummer Ed Cassidy (California's bald-pated stepfather) remaining on the drums. 
Now 71, Cassidy is most likely the oldest musician in rock, and he's still a 
kick, keeping a powerful beat while spicing the band's jams with unexpected 
accents. 
</P>
<P>
 Often over the past two decades, California (not unlike Lee) seemed to be 
performing in a murk of his own. But Sunday's set was one of his most focused 
in years as he, Cassidy and keyboard player Scott Monahan (who also held down 
the bass line and harmony vocals) hit a tight groove, from which California 
sometimes took some moderately questing solos. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcomings were that the material was mostly songs that Spirit has been 
running into the ground for years -- including "Fresh Garbage," "Mr. Skin," 
"Nature's Way" and Hendrix's "Red House" -- and the jams lacked much element of 
the unexpected.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; THE INDUSTRY; 
BATTLING FOR A PIECE OF THE GLOBAL PIE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS NOW THE WORLD'S 
LARGEST ECONOMIC SECTOR, WITH IMPORTANCE THAT SURPASSES THAT OF OIL, STEEL -- 
EVEN COMPUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy years ago, AT&T was a trademark recognized around the world as 
synonymous with the telephone. Then regulators forced the communications giant 
to spin off its international operations and focus on building a telephone 
infrastructure for America. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as AT&T and other U.S. companies move out to take on the world market, 
they face a bittersweet reality. The once-sleepy telecommunications business 
has grown to be the world's largest economic sector, with a strategic 
importance that surpasses that of oil, steel or even computers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while U.S. companies were looking inward these past decades, fragments of 
the old AT&T empire have emerged as leading world players. Alcatel of France is 
the world's largest supplier of telecommunications equipment -- it has a 50% 
share of the rapidly growing Chinese market -- in large part because of the 
assets it acquired from ITT, the international operation that was broken off 
from AT&T. NEC Corp., Japan's leading communications and computer company, was 
once a subsidiary of AT&T's Western Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 These companies have strong footholds in world markets that are growing at an 
astounding rate in size and importance. Anderson Consulting, which counts most 
of the world's leading companies as its clients, figures the telecommunications 
sector will represent a $1.1-trillion industry by the year 2000, about double 
its current level. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you buy a shirt at the store, a computer automatically registers its 
color, style and size," says Ali Sabeti, chief of telecommunications for the 
World Bank. But that information is useless, Sabeti says, unless it can be sent 
over phone lines to the factory in Hong Kong so new shipments will arrive to 
replenish shelves while the item is still in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheap labor isn't enough to be competitive," Sabeti says. "Countries that 
don't have access to (telecommunications) networks can't participate in the 
global economy. They are just left out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From China to the Czech Republic, from Mexico to the Middle East, nations are 
responding to this new reality. Advanced land-line, mobile and satellite 
telephone systems are being installed in record numbers. This year, as many as 
100 million more phones lines will be connected to the expanding web that is 
the world telecommunications system. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major drivers for growth today is the realization of the 
importance of telecommunications to the economy," says Roger Dorf, president of 
AT&T's Caribbean and Latin American network systems operations. "People have 
discovered that there is more of a willingness and ability to pay (for 
telecommunications) than anybody ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
 In China, which has only one telephone for every 100 people, people are 
shelling out $1,800 just to get on a two-year waiting list for phone service. 
That's many times the average annual salary. China wants to quadruple the 
number of phones it has in service by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 India has committed itself to spending $15 billion to modernize its 
telecommunications sector, although it is more reluctant than China to permit 
foreign competition. It has plans for a network of hundreds of satellite dishes 
to bring telecommunications to remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrialized nations such as Britain, Japan and the United States are taking 
the next giant step forward, making plans for massive investments in new 
interactive systems that can offer education, video on demand and home shopping 
as well as wireless telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to judge just how much of a market this telecommunications boom 
represents to U.S. companies. Only six countries outside the United States have 
anything approaching open markets: Australia, Britain Chile, Japan, New Zealand 
and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, only France Telecom can offer phone services. And it buys most of 
its phone equipment from national supplier Alcatel. The same is true of 
Deutsche Telecom, which has a virtual lock on the German market and buys most 
of its equipment from German supplier Siemens. Although Japan is nominally 
open, industry analysts don't expect much of its planned $200-billion-plus 
investment in a new information superhighway over the next two decades to go to 
foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But freer world markets may be just a matter of time. Anderson Consulting 
figures that countries representing more than half of the world market have 
either begun the process of dismantling their old telephone monopolies or have 
concrete plans to do so in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those that delay too long may find major multinationals choosing to locate 
their operations in nearby countries where phone services are cheaper and 
better. Already, Britain has become a major communications hub for Europe, and 
Australia is emerging as a hub for Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even China, once the epitome of the centrally controlled economy, is beginning 
to introduce competition of sorts lest it be outflanked by upstarts like 
Vietnam. The government recently created a new telecommunications company made 
up of a handful of government ministries to compete with the Ministry of Post 
and Telecommunications-run phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America and Europe, countries have begun to privatize their telephone 
systems to tap private capital and finance ambitious expansion plans. The 
schemes are working. As monopolies have gone private in Britain, Chile and 
Mexico, they have sucked money into this rapidly growing sector like air into a 
vacuum. International financier Alan Bond made a killing recently when he sold 
his 44% ownership in Chile's national carrier to Telefonica de Espana. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P. Morgan and Citibank are each major investors in two new private telephone 
systems established in Argentina. Mutual funds are pouring billions of dollars 
of investor money into newly privatized phone companies in places like Mexico 
and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with every gold rush, it is the hardware suppliers who make money 
first. Research firm Dataquest, a technology research firm, estimates that the 
world market for telecommunications equipment will grow to $184 billion by 
1997, up nearly 50% from $125 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany are the world leaders in the business 
of supplying big switches and other sophisticated gear required to make phones 
work. AT&T comes in a weak third as a world supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 With extensive operations around the world and long experience dealing with 
overseas customers, the large European companies have a distinct advantage. 
When Alcatel tackles markets in Latin America, it can send employees from its 
operations in Spain or Portugal who are familiar with the former colonies and 
speak their languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been around a while. They know which buttons to push to influence 
decision-makers," says John Dinsdale, associate director for telecommunications 
at Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. Justice Department broke up AT&T a decade ago, it took away 
AT&T's last stranglehold on selling telephone equipment, the domestic market. 
The seven new regional phone-operating companies, once exclusively supplied by 
Western Electric, sought cheaper suppliers overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly emerging companies have also looked overseas for suppliers. McCaw 
Cellular, the cellular phone giant in the process of being acquired by AT&T, 
buys almost all of its equipment from the Swedish company Eriksson. AT&T, 
meanwhile, has faced largely closed markets overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, AT&T and other U.S. companies like Motorola and Northern Telecom 
are making an aggressive foray into the international market. As recently as 
seven years ago, AT&T had only 100 employees overseas. Today it has 56,000 
overseas employees. And it is learning to move fast. When Argentina wanted a 
cellular company that could quickly establish phone services, it turned to a 
consortium that included AT&T, GTE and two local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium signed a contract March 28. By the end of May, by pulling in 
250 engineers from its operations worldwide, AT&T had installed a $250-million 
cellular system accessible to 22 million potential customers. The system is 
expected to go into commercial service soon and will offer many Argentines 
their first access to telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're catching up pretty quickly," says Dorf, the AT&T official for the 
Caribbean and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies don't have the advantage of captive markets that European 
companies like Siemens and Alcatel do. But as markets gradually open, the U.S. 
companies' experience operating in a competitive rather than a regulated market 
may give them an important advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Telecom and AT&T are the product of a deregulated market," says 
James Long, head of Northern Telecom's international operations. To be 
competitive, North American companies have been forced to keep adding new 
features such as 1-800 services, call forwarding and conferencing that are not 
available in Europe or Japan. Much of this involves writing sophisticated 
software, an American strength. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies will also have an edge in building next-generation broad-band 
networks for video on demand and other applications because of their early 
investment in this technology. AT&T has won major multibillion-dollar contracts 
from Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic to build such systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And after years of watching in frustration as competitors won international 
contracts with the backing of their governments, U.S. companies are now 
receiving similar help. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, AT&T won a a $4-billion deal to build a modern network in Saudi 
Arabia. Strong support from the Clinton Administration helped to clinch the 
deal. When Motorola faced obstacles getting fair access to the Japanese market, 
U.S. trade negotiators intervened, assuring the company a major stake in a 
market expected to quintuple in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies are beginning to reap the harvest of such efforts. Northern 
Telecom's international sales last year accounted for a quarter of its sales, 
up from just 8% four years ago. Motorola has built or is in the process of 
installing 150 mobile systems in 18 Chinese provinces, establishing itself as a 
leader in the mobile area, says Tom Hinton, general manager of Motorola's 
cellular operations in China. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. exports of telecommunications equipment climbed 24% last year to $9.7 
billion, giving the nation a telecommunications trade surplus for the first 
time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But while equipment sales are where the opportunities are today, in the long 
term it is the service area that will have the greatest growth. Dataquest sees 
the services market growing to $680 billion in 1997 from about $500 billion 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that growth will come in markets filled with acronyms such as VANs 
(value added networks), VPNs (virtual private networks) and ISDN (Integrated 
Synchronous Digital Networks). While the market for POTS (plain old telephone 
service) is likely to remain flat, the Yankee Group, a Boston-based research 
firm, expects that new areas involving sophisticated packages of data, voice 
and video communications to multinationals will more than double in three 
years, making it a $17-billion market. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in this package market that America's strength is most apparent. The 
world's major players have broken up into three teams, each centered around a 
market-savvy U.S. player. The MCI-British Telecom team has an early start, but 
AT&T is quickly building up a formidable alliance that could include dozens of 
large telecommunications players. Sprint's deal with the French and German 
telephone companies may not go through unless the phone markets are opened up 
wider in France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newer and more aggressive faces in the international arena are 
America's regional telephone-operating companies. Pacific Telesis has stakes in 
cellular systems in Japan and Korea, two of the world's fastest-growing 
markets. Southwestern Bell and France Telecom have major stakes in Telmex, 
Mexico's successful phone company. Bell Atlantic spent $1 billion for a 42% 
share of Iusacell, a cellular operator in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 US West has been among the most aggressive, investing $2.5 billion in 
cellular, cable and phone systems in Russia, Britain, Hungary, France, Norway 
and Sweden. The company says its goal is to put together the building blocks 
for systems that can offer multimedia capabilities including wireless, 
telephone and entertainment, a goal that it is close to approaching in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a model the company thinks may be appropriate for developing countries 
as well. The company has proposed to the Indian government a plan that would 
begin by offering basic telephone service using easily installed cellular base 
stations. As wire lines are installed, the cellular phone system would be moved 
farther out to offer services to another population while wire line would take 
over in its existing area. The idea is to ultimately have a full multimedia 
system with video service, telephones and wireless. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that unlike other industries where it is often reasonable to use 
cheaper intermediate technology, in telecommunications it makes sense to put in 
the latest technology available. New digital switches are often the cheapest 
per subscriber and the easiest to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going from the 19th Century to the 21st Century," says John Clarke, 
analyst for the London office of Daiwa Research Institute. "They need top 
communications services." What Is It? 
</P>
<P>

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; SOCIAL IMPACT; 
DIVIDED FAMILIES REACH OUT AND WATCH SOMEONE; TV HOOKUP LETS SALVADORANS IN THE 
UNITED STATES 'GO LIVE' WITH CHILDREN AND OTHER RELATIVES THEY LEFT BEHIND AND 
OFTEN CAN'T TRAVEL TO VISIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan Chavez has never touched his little boy, Roberto. But from Los Angeles, 
where he lives and works, Chavez can speak to his son -- and see him -- here in 
the Salvadoran capital. The connection is a two-way television hookup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robertillo?" the father begins, waving. "How are you? You look so chubby!" 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez's wife, Marisol, who has not seen Roberto since he was an infant, looks 
at the screen and asks the boy, "Who am I, my love? I am your mommy." 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Roberto, sitting in a San Salvador studio, squirms and waves 
back at the screen where his parents' images appear. In a few minutes, Juan and 
Marisol Chavez begin to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chavez family is like so many in El Salvador that were torn apart by a 
decade and a half of war, poverty and lost opportunities. More than 1 million 
Salvadorans abandoned their country to escape violence or to look for work, and 
most ended up in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Houston and other U.S. cities. 
Parents left children behind with grandmothers or aunts; siblings parted 
company, marriages broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding this tidal wave of migration, services that establish and maintain 
contacts between separated family members have become big business. Courier 
agencies ferry money and packages back and forth, and airlines are crowded with 
international travelers whose lives seem forever divided between their exile 
homes and the homes of their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And now the video service takes advantage of technology and offers family 
reunions -- via satellite -- an application that provides an immediate social 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadorans here in El Salvador and any of nine U.S. cities can reserve time 
on a live, closed-circuit television connection for an audiovisual conversation 
with their loved ones. In the States, the communication originates in the 
offices of the Salvadoran-owned Gigante Express courier service and is beamed 
to the studio here of Channel One studio, a private cable television firm that 
is a division of Gigante. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the reservations are made stateside, and workers for Channel One are 
deployed to distant villages, urban barrios and nearby suburbs to notify people 
of their appointments for a television meeting with their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs roughly $40 for 10 minutes, though the price goes up if Channel One 
provides transportation to the studio. The company also offers various 
promotional discounts that can reduce the price or add bonus time.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite communication is especially useful for those who are too poor to 
afford plane tickets home, or illegal residents whose status makes 
international travel a high legal risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cut down the distance," said Channel One manager Francisco Navarrete. 
"We've had family encounters where they hadn't seen each other for 10, 15 
years, men who had left behind their pregnant wives and only knew their child 
through photos, who had never seen their child say, 'Papa.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once the televised connection is made, he said, "Sometimes they barely talk. 
There is so much emotion, it's 10 minutes of sobbing." 
</P>
<P>
 And it can also be 10 minutes of airing filial grievances, asking for money, 
deciding whether to sell the house and the cows, finding out how the kids are 
doing in school. Technology makes it all immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Ortega, 56, is Juan Chavez's mother. On the morning of their satellite 
appointment, she left her home in the provincial seat of Zacatecoluca, about 30 
miles southeast of the capital, before dawn, with Roberto and four other 
grandchildren in tow, to reach the Channel One studio on time. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Chavezes were late at the Los Angeles end, Ortega began complaining, 
and she didn't stop complaining throughout most of their conversation. Like 
many older Salvadorans who have found themselves saddled with their children's 
children, Ortega appeared to resent her double duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to leave if I had to wait five more minutes," she scolded Juan 
and Marisol Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, I worked all night and just got off," Chavez, a truck driver, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to send me? When are you coming home? I will be dead 
before you ever return," Ortega continued. "Here I am with these kids, and you 
are progressing. Well, that's the cross I have to bear." 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, the children sat quietly in their chairs, staring at the images 
of Juan and Marisol Chavez on the large television screen. Roberto and his 
older brother, Juan Jr., were dressed in black overall shorts, their three 
little girl cousins in their best Sunday dresses, scuffed shoes and brightly 
decorated headbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Chavez left El Salvador five years ago, when Marisol was pregnant with 
Roberto. Marisol Chavez headed for Los Angeles to join her husband about a year 
after Roberto was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most difficult thing, to have to separate from your family for 
economic motives," he told a reporter (also via satellite) after his TV time 
with the family ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Channel One has been around for several years, the January earthquake 
in Los Angeles gave it a boost in the family-reunification business. The 
company turned over air time to Salvadorans here desperate to find out about 
relatives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's a regular business, and Navarrete says it's best on weekends, with a 
daily average of 45 to 50 communications on Saturdays and Sundays. On Mother's 
Day, there were 76 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, it was hard for many people to believe they were seeing 
their families in living color. Some of the relatives in El Salvador live in 
tiny hamlets that don't have electricity, much less an understanding of 
international satellite connections. Trust had to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helped that Salvadorans in even the most isolated parts of the 
country are becoming increasingly familiar with the messengers who arrive from 
Gigante and other courier services with money, letters and gifts from relatives 
in the States. Navarrete said Gigante -- which has grown into an enterprise 
with its own fleet of small airplanes, armored cars and 53 offices in the 
States -- handled 1 million pieces of mail last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money is the biggest assignment; almost all Salvadorans who live abroad send 
money home. Officials estimate annual remittances may total as much as $1 
billion -- more than El Salvador's yearly export income -- and money from 
working relatives abroad is certainly what keeps the national economy afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Neriz Savaria de Ferman and her husband Leonidas Ferman travel for two days 
from their village of Coyolito, 110 miles southeast of the capital, to reach 
the Channel One studio for an encounter with their daughter, Juana, who has 
lived in Houston for nearly 13 years. Their son also left for the States two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Fermans settle into their seats, Juana appears on the screen, her three 
children by her side. The Fermans have met two of their grandchildren before, 
but not the smallest one, 3-year-old Azucena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at your grandmother!" Juana tells Azucena. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Salvador end, Neriz de Ferman confides, "I only know her from the 
photos." 
</P>
<P>
 Juana tells her parents she wants them to come to Houston for a visit. They 
say they'd rather she come to El Salvador. She says her "papers" make that 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very tranquil at having seen you, daughter," says Leonidas Ferman, his 
straw farmer's hat in wrinkled hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also feel very happy," agrees his wife. "At the same time, it gives me 
sorrow because I want to . . ." She makes a gesture of embracing her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want us to be together," finishes Juana. They cannot, but the video 
hookup helps.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; TELEPHONE FIRSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First phone: On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell spoke the first sentence 
to be transmitted over wire, at 5 Exeter Place, Boston, when he said, "Mr. 
Watson, come here, I want you." The first practical telephone was an improved 
version of the machine built in 1875. * 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance call: In October, 1876, Boston lawyer Gardiner Hubbard, the 
future father-in-law of Bell and an early promoter of the phone, hooked two 
telephones to a telegraph wire running from Boston to the Cambridge Observatory 
across the Charles River. He spoke to Thomas Watson for more than three hours. 
* 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial phones: The first telephone sold by Bell was purchased by the 
Cambridge Board of Waterworks in May, 1877. By August there were 800 in 
service. The first switchboard was installed in the offices of the Holmes 
Burglar Alarm Co. of Boston. The first commercial phone exchange was opened in 
New Haven, Conn., by the District Telephone Co. on Jan. 28, 1878, with 21 
subscribers. * 
</P>
<P>
 Operator: George W. Coy, who answered calls with shouts of "Ahoy!" * 
</P>
<P>
 Personal phone: The first telephone in a private home was installed April 4, 
1877, in Somerville, Mass., in the home of Charles Williams Jr. Williams was 
also the first to manufacture Bell phones commercially. Because the first phone 
exchange had yet to be installed, Williams ran a line to his Boston office so 
that there would be someplace to call. * 
</P>
<P>
 Transcontinental call: The service began in January, 1915, when Alexander 
Graham Bell in New York called Thomas Watson in San Francisco. The call took 23 
minutes to get through. * 
</P>
<P>
 Intercontinental service: It began Jan. 7, 1927, between New York and London. 
Callers were charged $75 for the first 3 minutes. * 
</P>
<P>
 Private communications satellites: AT&T launched Telstar in July, 1962, to 
relay television programs globally. In April, 1965, the Communications 
Satellite Corp. launched Early Bird, the first of a projected network of 
commercial satellites designed to provide almost unlimited global telephone and 
telegraph communications.

<P>
 Alexander Graham Bell spoke through a wire to his colleague Thomas Watson in 
1876. "Come here," he said, the first command uttered on a telephone. Oh, what 
Mr. Bell wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the world, different cultures have developed characteristic phone 
manners since Bell's day. No people open a call with more effusive hospitality 
than the Arabs. Whatever the subject of the conversation, it begins with what 
seems like five minutes of generally meaningless but absolutely essential 
greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A ringing phone is answered: "May your morning be good." 
</P>
<P>
 "May your morning be full of light," the caller responds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Praise God, your voice is welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome, welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Praise God." 
</P>
<P>
 "Praise God." 
</P>
<P>
 "What news? Are you well? Your family well?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Praise God. How are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "All is well. All is well. Welcome. Welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Only then might the reason for the call be mentioned. And the goodbys will 
take almost as long and are again excruciatingly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the Arab world, responses elsewhere are the soul of brevity: 
Britons and Americans generally say "Hello," although the latter sometimes 
simply say "Yes," and if they're in business or the military they may just 
answer with their surnames: "Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 The French answer their phones with the familiar "Allo," and they often add 
their name and the phrase "Qui est a l'appareil?" that is, "Who is on the 
phone?" In a number of countries, calls are answered with a touch of suspicion 
or curiosity, a reluctance to talk until it's clear who the caller is. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians answer "Pronto," or "Ready," and then it's the caller who demands 
"Chi parla?" -- "Who's speaking?" -- assuming the right to know the identity of 
the person at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans tend to answer the phone by barking their last names: "Schmidt" or 
"Mueller," even the women -- and even if they have titles, like Herr Doktor, 
which in other circumstances they would insist upon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Copenhagen, Danes will answer with both first and last names, even women: 
"Karen Andersen." 
</P>
<P>
 In Spain, the response to a ringing telephone is: "Diga," or "Speak." 
</P>
<P>
 "Diga" is also a common response in Mexico, but Mexicans usually answer 
"Bueno," meaning "Good" or "Well." Like the Italians, the Mexicans will demand: 
"Where am I calling?" And if they have the wrong number, they'll indignantly 
hang up, sometimes with a curse, as if it were the respondent's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a cultural tendency to speak cautiously with strangers, callers 
must clearly identify themselves and state their purpose. Even then, the 
respondent may become vague and evasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the Mexico State Justice Department?" a caller might ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't know what to tell you," is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people and government officials commonly refuse to speak to strangers 
on the phone even if it concerns simple inquiries like "Where can I buy one of 
your vacuum cleaners?" The train system won't divulge ticket fares or schedules 
on the phone; you must go to the station and ask in person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, after slowly and patiently dialing a number, if you are lucky 
enough to get an answer, the respondent will say: "Who's talking?" not to be 
rude but to make sure the right number has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodbys are elaborate, as if in person: "A hug" is a frequent sign-off, even 
to end formal business calls. "A kiss" is more casual, with someone you know 
personally. And the response in both cases is "Outro," "Another." 
</P>
<P>
 Like American teen-agers, many cultures have love affairs with the phone, none 
more than the Italians. They talk endlessly with relatives, friends and 
schoolmates. The telephone call has replaced formal letters of invitation, 
congratulations and condolences. As almost everywhere else, the cellular phone, 
called a telefonino in Italy, has become a popular status symbol, used widely 
and indiscriminately. Telefonini have recently been barred from parliamentary 
sessions, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany the telephone is hardly ubiquitous. You can get an unlisted number 
at no extra charge, and information operators will not indicate the fact to 
callers -- in effect denying your existence. One wrinkle that arrived under 
Germany's liberal immigration policy: the installation of illegal phone booths 
where foreigners can call home without paying long-distance tariffs. Officials 
of cellular-phone networks have countered the trend by blocking all calls going 
to Pakistan, Togo, Gambia and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, like most things, phone use is affected by the growing gap between 
rich and poor, new and old, foreign and Russian. So mobile phones are big hits 
among the rich, but most Russians have no phones at all. Thus ads for apartment 
rentals specify "telephone" with the same pride as "garbage chute" or "closet." 
</P>
<P>
 For those with phones, the answer to a ring is the French "Allo," which can be 
pronounced to reflect wide degrees of happiness or annoyance. Also popular are 
the curt "Da," or "Yes," and "Slushayu vas," or "I am listening to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the history of KGB taps, Russians are still careful of being 
overheard, often using the phrase, "It's not telephone conversation," to warn a 
caller to be discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 Often in Moscow an alien conversation will break into yours, and sometimes, 
according to Muscovites, you can't help listening. These aural glimpses show a 
Russian life that is never the relaxed, gossipy "reach out and touch someone" 
conversations so typical in America. Instead they have some urgent goal -- such 
as arranging a meeting or a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for this urgency is the poor quality," says a Moscow resident. 
"Pay phones are unreliable and the caller wants to get his message across 
before the connection breaks down." 
</P>
<P>
 In closed Arab societies, the telephone is a means of contact for those 
forbidden to see each other in person. A woman will call random numbers asking 
for "Mohammed," and when she finds a voice she likes, will strike up a 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, you wait up to seven years for a phone -- so when the connection is 
finally made it often prompts a neighborhood party. The euphoria ends about a 
month later when the first bill arrives and the subscribers realize how much it 
costs. In the Indian middle-class home, the telephone occupies the place of 
honor, often atop its special table, and is usually kept locked to prevent 
neighbors from making calls. But in the countryside where 70% of Indians live, 
phones are still a rarity: In some cases there is not a single phone in a 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southeast Asia, almost everyone uses a version of "Hello" to answer the 
phone. Hong Kong Chinese say, "Wei." In countries like Thailand, Vietnam and 
Indonesia, with a shortage of phone lines and a two-year waiting list, cellular 
phones are prized, but expensive -- running $500 to $1,000 in Singapore and 
twice that elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangkok's most popular radio program is a call-in show with phoners talking 
while stuck in the city's infamous traffic. Many posh restaurants have signs 
saying, "No Handphones," because people are fed up with the guy at the next 
table shouting into a phone. Some cinemas show trailers indicating that it is 
rude to talk on the phone during the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the person answering will customarily say, "Moshi moshi," the 
equivalent of "Hello," or perhaps "Hai," that is, "Yes." If he or she has the 
right connection, the caller may say something like "Osewa ni natte imasu," or 
"I am indebted to you for your kindness." Sometimes people bow over a phone, 
although the other party cannot see the bow. Many older Japanese, who never saw 
phones until the era of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, continue to use ceremonial 
phrases and bows over the telephone -- as if it weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard goodby is "Ja, mata" -- "See you later" -- with the word 
"Sayonara" reserved only for occasions of a long or final parting. 
</P>
<P>
 In many Third World countries it definitely helps to know an operator. The 
Indian writer Khushwant Singh remembers trying to place a call from New Delhi 
to Lahore in neighboring Pakistan -- when services were notoriously bad. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of trying, Singh was contacted by the international operator who 
suggested that she had relatives in Pakistan who had wanted to visit India but 
needed visas. Being a member of Parliament, she said, he might come up with the 
necessary stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh accepted the deal and within three minutes his connection was through.

 Phone use: The greatest number of calls made in any country is in the United 
States, with 436.22 billion per year. Monaco has the most telephones per person 
with 810 phones per 1,000 people. Bermuda has the highest number of 
international telephone calls per capital. * 
</P>
<P>
 The largest phone: The largest working telephone was exhibited at a festival 
in 1988. It was 8'1" high and 19'11" long and weighed 3.8 tons. The handset had 
to be lifted by a crane to be used. * 
</P>
<P>
 The busiest routes: The busiest international telephone route is between the 
United States and Canada. In 1991 there were about 3.3 billion minutes of 
two-way traffic between the two countries. * 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile phones: Scandinavian countries lead the world in per capita mobile 
phone use. Sweden has the highest number of mobile communication subscribers 
per 100 inhabitants with 7.56. Finland, Norway and Iceland come in second, 
third and fourth, respectively. * 
</P>
<P>
 Largest switchboard: The world's biggest switchboard is the one in the 
Pentagon, Washington, D.C., with 34,500 lines handling more than 1 million 
calls per day. * 
</P>
<P>
 Longest cable: The world's longest submarine telephone cable runs for 9,415 
miles from Port Alberni, Canada to Auckland, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia 
via Fiji and Norfolk Island. It cost $397 million and was inaugurated by Queen 
Elizabeth II in November, 1984. * 
</P>
<P>
 Fax use: Japan has the highest penetration of facsimile terminals in the 
world, with just under 10 fax terminals per 100 telephone subscriber lines. 
Japanese companies are the largest suppliers of fax terminals. * 
</P>
<P>
 Internet: The figures for Internet growth are remarkable. Between 1981 and 
1986, Internet grew 68% per year. Between 1986 and 1991, the annual rate 
increased to 191% and the network added just over 1 million new users per year. 
During the first part of 1993, even though growth slowed in percentage terms, 
the network was adding about 750,000 new users per month.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; DEREGULATION; 
BRITAIN'S PRIVATE LINES OF COMMUNICATION; FEW-HOLDS-BARRED COMPETITION HAS 
CREATED A HEADY ATMOSPHERE -- AND PROFITS. SYSTEM IS SEEN AS THE FUTURE OF THE 
INDUSTRY.

<P>
 The normally quiet streets of London's Knightsbridge district have been 
shattered recently by the ear-splitting roar of jackhammers chewing out 
trenches. Said one resident, in a remark not intended as a compliment: "This 
sounds like Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
 The workmen are laying fiber-optic communication cables on every street in the 
neighborhood, and the same scene is taking place in other British cities as 
cable companies seek to stitch up possible customers. 
</P>
<P>
 For TV cable operators, Britain presents a heady atmosphere, filled with 
possibilities for making money in a wide spectrum of activities spurred by the 
government's momentous decision to open up its communications industry to 
few-holds-barred competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain represents the future in telecommunications, and it's a textbook 
example for other countries. When it privatized the national phone company in 
1984, it set the pace for other countries where state-owned communication 
monopolies are giving way to private telephone and television firms. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the British government this month gave approval to AT&T, 
America's Ma Bell, to offer public telephone service to homes and businesses 
throughout the United Kingdom. Developments like this were not imagined a few 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, telecommunication has traditionally been a highly regulated 
industry. In most countries, in fact, a government agency acts as both a 
service supplier and the regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 But the privatization of British Telecommunications, or BT, and the 
government's order that it rent a share of its phone lines to outside operators 
turned tradition upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture seemed clear to the British government, then under the rule of 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Most national phone monopolies were extremely 
inefficient, and in some cases were used as patronage tools and padded with 
workers loyal to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, new technology was creating interesting communication 
products and services with great appeal to customers, particularly 
corporations. Corporate customers wanted satellite phone networks, private 
lines and low-cost long-distance service, but these services were not available 
through the stodgy telecom monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States and later Japan, the monopoly phone system was broken up. 
In Britain, when telecommunication was privatized, competition was specifically 
authorized. Most European nations still lag behind Britain, resisting efforts 
to privatize or otherwise crack their national phone monopolies. But the 
12-member European Union is scheduled to allow telephone competition by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morgan Stanley investment firm has estimated that about 30 telephone 
companies around the globe will be privatized in the next two or three years. 
Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Malaysia are among those that have already acted; 
not far behind are Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain alone, the S. G. Warburg investment firm predicts, multimedia 
operations, including cable, will take an increasing share of the leisure and 
entertainment market from broadcast TV, printed media, computer games and video 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thatcher's government privatized BT, a government watchdog agency, the 
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL), was set up to oversee and encourage the 
competitive process as BT went private. BT had, over the decades, built up a 
complex network of underground phone lines and above-ground micro-relay and 
satellite systems for transmitting electronic communications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first competing company to move onto the scene was Mercury, a subsidiary 
of the worldwide British communications behemoth Cable and Wireless, and it has 
become BT's main competitor. Mercury created its own network lines, 
concentrating in high-volume city business districts, but it was also allowed 
to rent lines from BT. 
</P>
<P>
 The rental fees have led to a series of confrontations between BT and Mercury 
-- with OFTEL reluctantly in the middle. Mercury protests that BT is charging 
too much for the use of the BT network in payments known as "access deficit 
contributions," which Mercury officials dub a "tax on competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury chief executive Mike Harris says: "BT has a protected 85% share of the 
total market. When competitors step over the 15% line to serve more customers, 
they pay millions of dollars to compensate the U.K.'s biggest corporation -- 
which made about $4.5 billion profit last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury and all competitors "recognize that paying a fair price to BT for use 
of its network is proper -- although many of us have issue with the way this is 
presently calculated," Harris said. But Don Cruickshank, director general of 
OFTEL and the government's telecom regulator, condemned some Mercury statements 
as "unnecessary and shrill" and said he regrets that Mercury has taken OFTEL to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mustn't allow these issues to be determined in the courts -- a recipe for 
confusion," Cruickshank says. He insists that in the United States, where 
various courts have ruled on telecom issues, "no one -- regulators or industry 
-- knows what is or isn't allowed, and that is clearly hampering innovation and 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look with some envy at the way in which our framework is right and is 
not hampered by litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cable companies have also moved into Britain in a big way, most of 
them American- or Canadian-owned, laying down lines in principal cities and 
offering customers a variety of multimedia services. There are currently about 
130 cable companies operating around Britain, each with a government-granted 
franchise to operate exclusively in their particular geographical area. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the liveliest is US West -- a partner in 24 cable TV franchises in 
Britain with the potential to serve about 3.3 million homes and more than 
500,000 businesses. Cable TV franchises in Britain also carry a license to 
provide telephone and data services -- along with cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 US West and its partners are the largest operators of cable TV and telephone 
services in Britain, with more than 230,000 cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to provide interactive, multimedia services," says Catherine May, an 
official of US West in London. "That means video movies on demand, shopping 
where you control what you order and interactive TV games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have phone service with lower rentals than BT and with monthly 
billing rather than quarterly. Our idea is making life easier for you, while 
saving you money." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the British climate of deregulation and enhanced competition that 
brought US West here, says May, adding, "the government encourages competition, 
there's a stable economy, and the British like innovation and different 
products. That's why we emphasize multimedia, a variety of services and 
interactivity -- people making choices at their own end of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another enthusiast is Richard Woollam, director general of the Cable 
Television Assn., who points out that the 130 separate cable companies now 
operating in Britain are owned by 17 corporations, including such U.S. names as 
NYNEX, Southwestern Bell and Videotrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fiber-optic cable can carry the equivalent of 25,000 telephone lines," he 
says. "It carries a universe of information. The question is do you want that 
information superhighway running into your home -- or just an access road? You 
don't need 1,000 TV channels, but you might want access to them." In Britain, 
Woollam says, cable is now licensed to cover 15 million homes. "We added 1.5 
million homes this year," he says, "and we'll add another 2 million next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 3.65 million households in Britain served by a cable system, only 
780,000 householders so far subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Woollam says that eventually cable telephone service will give the subscriber 
the cheapest possible rate for any call -- with a computer selecting the best 
route to send a call.  
</P>
<P>
 Further, small but energetic mobile phone network companies, such as Orange, a 
subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom, have sprung up offering customers wire-free 
phone services of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition has meant that BT, once viewed as complacent and arrogant, 
will have to become more customer-friendly in competing against the small but 
up-and-coming cable telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecom giant, which still controls 85% of the market, says "cheaper calls 
and better value for money for all customers are the key themes" for various 
price cuts BT announced this year.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, BT claims to have made phone call price reductions worth 
about $750 million, including cheaper calls to North America. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Continent, European Union Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert 
said recently: "Nobody can doubt the influence that telecommunications has on 
all our lives. Competition policy has a seminal role to play in our vision of 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the strange new world of telecom competition, observers say, what is 
happening electronically under the streets and in the skies of Britain today 
may well shape the future of telecommunications everywhere.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; LEGAL IMPACT; LAWS 
SET UP SPEED TRAPS ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY; SOME NATIONS TRY TO BLOCK THE 
INVASION OF U.S. CULTURE AND COMMERCIAL GIANTS BY RESTRICTING PROGRAMS AND 
RAISING PRICES.

 The Clinton Administration's call for a global telecommunications revolution 
is meeting resistance from many nations intent on protecting their citizens 
from everything from MTV's Beavis and Butt-head to the invasion of such 
American corporate giants as AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 From Malaysia to France, telecommunications and trade officials -- concerned 
about outside political, cultural and economic interference -- have been slow 
to reduce regulatory barriers despite intense efforts by U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown, Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton himself 
to open foreign shores to the burgeoning telecommunications marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The very success of the American entertainment and telecommunications industry 
within U.S. borders "has incited a counterattack by foreign governments . . . 
whose aim it is to shrink the reach of American visual entertainment and to 
baffle the movement of our products in world marketplaces," asserted the Motion 
Picture Export Assn. of America Inc. in a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
 Resistance takes several forms and makes uncertain the vision of an electronic 
global village. Australia and France, among other countries, limit the amount 
of foreign-produced TV and/or radio music programs that may be broadcast within 
their borders. Meanwhile, access to many components of the existing global 
information highway are often priced out of reach for ordinary citizens by 
regulatory red tape or is prohibited by direct government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia and China, for instance, are among several nations that ban or 
restrict the use of home satellite dishes to capture data and broadcast 
programs from other nations. And foreign phone carriers, many of which are 
government-owned monopolies, often keep rates for international calls 
originating in their countries far higher than U.S. carriers charge for the 
same calls originating here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there are about twice as many calls placed from the United States 
to overseas points as vice versa. Because of the complex formula for 
apportioning the revenue from international calls, that imbalance has spawned a 
$4-billion trade gap -- a dollar drain exceeded only by the yearly trade 
deficits in the automobile, petroleum, electronics and apparel industries, 
according to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of rhetoric" about encouraging global telecommunications 
competition, grumbled Vic Pelson, executive vice president and chairman of 
global operations for AT&T. "A lot of folks would have you believe there are 
open markets" around the world, "but the facts don't support that." 
</P>
<P>
 The overseas resistance involves not only age-old concerns about trade policy 
and industrial development but also worries about U.S. cultural hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world where U.S. products like Coca-Cola, Nike shoes and Levi's jeans 
already seem ubiquitous, many countries are loath to surrender their culture 
further to American dominance of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of concerns are almost endemic to state bureaucracies," said 
Michael Gardner, a Washington lawyer who served as an ambassador to the 
International Telecommunications Union and runs a program to train 
telecommunications managers from developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new breed is intrigued by new technology but the old guard is worried 
about cultural imperialism; they are reluctant to invite change," Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, over the last decade, the U.S. high-tech telecommunications and 
entertainment industries have invaded places as remote as Borneo and as tightly 
controlled as Cuba -- leaving their indelible imprint on indigenous musical 
tastes, fashion, lifestyles and even political and social causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spend a week in darkest Borneo and what you find these days are" not 
primitive scenes but " . . . the latest episode of 'L.A. Law,' " journalist 
James P. Sterba wrote after a trip in which he spotted natives with cellular 
phones, VCRs and other high-tech gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer operating software produced by giant Microsoft Corp. of Seattle, 
for instance, has been installed in more than 70% of the world's personal 
computers, analysts estimate. Cable News Network and MTV are available by cable 
or satellite in many countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some nations such as Romania, Mexico and Britain, among others, 
say they are moving rapidly to encourage more investment by foreign 
telecommunications companies. And the Clinton Administration's jawboning about 
the global information superhighway has helped some U.S. telecommunications 
companies recently score some impressive deals. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such pact, reported to be worth $4 billion, Saudi Arabia in May 
selected AT&T to modernize its entire telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely the greatest interest in opening our markets to the 
highest technology," said Emila Dumitru, head of international cooperation in 
Romania's Ministry of Communications. "We have about 100 companies licensed to 
provide" cable TV service. Dumitru said cable in Romania offers such networks 
as CNN and MTV; two Romanian companies recently entered a joint venture with 
Telefonica of Spain to provide cellular phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, overseas bureaucrats are not alone in their resistance to 
reducing regulatory barriers. U.S. regulators have also been criticized for not 
going far enough in cutting red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only months ago that the U.S. government took the first limited steps 
to open the door for export of fiber-optic and other advanced 
telecommunications technologies to former Cold War enemies such as China and 
the former Soviet Union. And federal law limits foreign ownership interest in 
U.S. radio, TV and common carrier licensees to a maximum of 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials including President Clinton, who this month called for a 
telecommunications summit among the world's most industrialized nations to 
discuss opening markets, have now made development of a global information age 
a major initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's proposal, if accepted by the Group of Seven nations, builds upon 
overseas trips undertaken by Commerce Secretary Brown and the vice president to 
sell other countries on the Administration's recipe for creating a global 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three men say telecommunications development would promote political 
stability and help U.S. companies cash in on the more than $250 billion worth 
of telecommunications modernization that the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies estimates will be undertaken in the next decade in China, 
the former Soviet Union and developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 While many U.S. executives support the Administration's efforts, some point 
out that the effort to modernize the global information superhighway is not 
without risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking more people to electronic networks that provide instantaneous 
information and entertainment from libraries, studios and data banks around the 
world may seem inviting but such linkups "can make the (information) market 
more subject to governmental regulation," said Neil Turkewitz, senior vice 
president, international, at the Recording Industry Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once things have to get distributed over government or 
quasi-government-controlled communications networks, the dangers are greatly 
enhanced that programs can be controlled" or manipulated to suit a government's 
purpose, Turkewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent the information highway reduces regulation by moving program 
choices from (industry or government) decision-makers to consumers -- that's 
good," he added. "But we don't know how the information highway will develop." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's Pelson said he is amazed at how rapidly technology and markets are 
changing in the face of the information highway -- despite regulatory 
strictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This industry is booming around the world," he said. Based on his talks with 
government officials and industry executives around the world, Pelson added: 
"The notion of an information superhighway is certainly sinking in with the 
people I talk to."

 What it is: A worldwide network of more than 40,000 central computer nodes at 
universities, government laboratories and corporations, connected by

 Engineer Piotr Klonowski had cause for celebration: After 18 years of waiting, 
his family finally got a phone installed in its apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 While many parts of the world charge ahead into the telecommunications age, 
Poland is still struggling to provide the level of service that the United 
States reached in the late 1940s. Its situation is symbolic of other 
less-advanced countries that may bog down in the dust of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish phone system, seen by Western business people as a major obstacle 
to investment in the country just three years ago, has improved dramatically in 
a short time. Nevertheless, it remains the worst in Europe outside Albania and 
illustrates a gap that will widen as technologically advanced nations pull away 
in the new age and reap the economic benefits it will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's telecommunications officials in Poland have inherited a phone system 
brought to its knees by 45 years of Communist neglect. Under the pre-1989 
regimes, government phone specialists concentrated their energies on private 
networks for the secret police, army, Politburo and other adjuncts of the 
Communist apparatus. They regarded telephones as a luxury for ordinary Poles, 
except, of course, when the police wanted to eavesdrop on private 
conversations. In many East European countries, dissidents got phones when 
others didn't, simply so the authorities could tap them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 40-something years there was no investment in telecommunications," said 
Jan Rogala, adviser to the president of Poland's state-owned phone company, 
Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA). "We inherited a very old and scarce network of 
lines and mechanical exchanges, many of them hand-operated, some dating back to 
the 1920s," he said. "Add to this the low quality of the telephone sets 
themselves and the system couldn't work properly. Maybe God could tell us why 
it worked at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Divine intervention is what Poles often feel they need to get a call through. 
The phone system is a bundle of quirks unimaginable to anyone used to American 
efficiency. Making a local call often requires four or five attempts. Busy 
signals frequently intrude after the first two digits are dialed. It's common 
to pick up the phone and hear someone else's conversation. On rainy days, the 
system practically collapses because the copper wires are insulated with paper. 
Multiline phones are still rare, so it's not uncommon to see five phones on one 
desk in a government office. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation isn't much better elsewhere in the former Soviet Bloc. A 
Hungarian joke on the difference between Hungarians and Americans: Americans 
pick up a phone and dial. Hungarians pick up a phone and check to see if it's 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not funny when it presages lost opportunities to close the economic 
gap with the advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of East Europeans would put up with erratic service if only they had 
a phone. A few years ago, 2.5 million Poles were officially listed as waiting 
for phone service, with an average wait of eight to 10 years. To the phone 
company's dismay, every time it opens a new exchange the increased supply 
stimulates fresh demand, so it makes little progress in whittling down the 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland has 12 phones for every 100 people, a level that has increased 35% 
since 1991 but still placed the country at the bottom on the former Soviet Bloc 
heap in that category, and on a par with the American phones-per-100 level of 
1925. "We are not so megalomaniacal as to compare ourselves to the States," 
laughed Rogala, the phone company's president. "We would just like to reach the 
level of our neighbors -- the Czech Republic and the former East Germany." The 
goal is to provide every family in Poland with a phone by the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the phone company has spent $500 million upgrading its system with 
the help of AT&T, the American giant, and Spain's Alcatel and Germany's 
Siemens. New digital exchanges have been installed in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step Poland made to meet the needs of Western businesses was the 
establishment, with the help of AT&T, of Komertel, a satellite link that 
permits instant dialing to anywhere in the world. There are now 10,000 Komertel 
lines in Poland, but, alas, none are linked to the Polish domestic system. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Paul Malcom, then marketing director for the Warsaw Marriott, had 
three phones on his desk. One for phoning within the hotel, another for dialing 
within Poland and the third for international calls. His successor, Matthew 
Shackel, can accomplish all three tasks with a single phone, thanks to Northern 
Telecom, a North American-standard system now installed at the Marriott. A 
rarity in the region, it even enables guests to plug fax machines and personal 
computers into their room phone set. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, which employs 1,600 people in Poland, has installed 930 miles of 
fiber-optic cables to link Polish communications systems with the outside 
world. It's now possible to call directly to 115 countries from Warsaw. "The 
technology is improving dramatically, but it's still not all in place," AT&T 
spokesman Piotr Czarnowski said of the Polish system. 
</P>
<P>
 Westerners doing business here agree that the situation has improved in the 
past few years. "It's much less of a problem than it used to be," said Alma 
Kadragic, owner of Alcat Communications Warsaw Ltd., a public relations 
company. "Companies which used to have just one line which served a phone and 
fax at the same time now have four or five lines." 
</P>
<P>
 But telecommunications, an absolute essential in Western business circles, has 
yet to make a cultural breakthrough here. Poles have never developed the habit 
of doing business over the phone. And other applications -- data transmissions 
and toll-free 800 numbers, for instance -- seem still in the realm of science 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Piotr Rutkowski, a former adviser to the Communications Ministry: "It 
has been obvious for a long time that we cannot develop a modern economy unless 
we build a modern telecommunications network promptly," he wrote in the journal 
Polityka. "Without this facility, in several years we will be perceived 
internationally as deaf and blind, perhaps even more so than we are now." 
Poles, he said, "have just a vague idea about the usefulness of telefax, pager, 
radio-telephone, computer networks, access to databanks and similar 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The phone company is trying to change that. It recently installed videophones 
in Warsaw's central phone office so Poles can call friends and relatives at an 
office in Queens, New York. But it's been slow to catch on, with just one 
customer a week. 
</P>
<P>
 More successful has been its Polpager, a radio paging system with miniature 
text receivers. Other advances are being made outside the phone company. The 
Marriott, for instance, introduced Poland's first voice-mail system in May in a 
bid to keep up with the demands of Western business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a full-ranging national telecommunications system remains a distant dream, 
and in its absence Poland and other nations lagging behind the technology curve 
are likely to suffer the economic consequences.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; ESSAY; STOP THE 
TECHNO-TRAIN! I WANNA GET OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago, I went to a hospital with my pregnant wife, Tia, so she could 
have a sonogram taken. We were nervous -- and we became a lot more nervous when 
a nurse looked at the screen and said, "Uh oh." 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse went off into a corner to confer with two of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she came back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there something wrong?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," she said. "We had a problem with the computer." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy to say that the computer made a full recovery -- and, oh yes, my 
wife had a healthy baby girl.  
</P>
<P>
 But the computer snafu shouldn't have surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't like computers. Computers don't like me. They don't do what I tell 
them to do. (OK, what I think I'm telling them to do.) I can't figure out the 
jargon. For instance, I don't understand Windows. I'd like to do Windows but I 
don't understand Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers die on me at work all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, when I phone and describe the incredible squiggles, blotches and 
flashing lights on my screen, the person in Computer Control pauses, then 
responds, "Hmmm. I've never heard of that -- I'd better come out to your desk." 
</P>
<P>
 I remember one repairman who surveyed my screen, then tapped the "Cancel" key. 
Nothing happened. Then he tapped the key again. No change. Then he did 
something I found refreshingly human for a computer technician. He slammed his 
finger down on the "Cancel" key several times (again with no result, of 
course). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it matters how hard you hit the key," I said, unselfishly 
sharing the one bit of knowledge I have attained over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he gave up and a gurney was summoned to haul away still another 
electronic body to cyberheaven. 
</P>
<P>
 My concession to the technological revolution is using a telephone. Which 
reminds me. The day is coming, I understand, when I will have a personal 
telephone number and a pocket-sized "personal communicator" where I can be 
reached anywhere in the world. Does that mean I'll never not be home? There are 
times when I like being not at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of my dislike for computers and wireless phones is age, I know. 
Unwillingness to change. I'm 48. I guess I couldn't expect my 6-year-old 
daughter, Sarah -- the one who jammed the hospital's equipment -- to share my 
antipathy. However, I was briefly encouraged when I thought her kindergarten 
teacher said Sarah likes to kick the school's computer. It turned out Sarah 
likes to "boot" it. I had one home computer that I would occasionally "bounce" 
when it froze. (And I mean "bounce" in the conventional sense.) Yes, computers 
die on me at home too. 
</P>
<P>
 The blissful innocence of the typewriter era feels so long removed. Back then, 
one of my favorite movie scenes occurred in "Take the Money and Run," when 
inept criminal Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen) is asked by a job interviewer if 
he has ever operated a computer. (Note to young readers: This was a very funny 
question to ask in 1969.) 
</P>
<P>
 Starkwell replies with a straight face, "Yes." And then, to add to the 
hilarity, he piles on another lie: "My aunt has one." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, of course, nearly everybody's aunt owns one. I wonder if anyone 
would laugh at the scene today. I'd probably sob. 
</P>
<P>
 The technological revolution is here. And I feel as though I'm trudging down a 
shoulder of the information superhighway, pushing a shopping cart filled with 
old newspaper clippings. I'm in the black hole of cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it: I'm off-line. 
</P>
<P>
 The only place I do any hacking is on a tennis court.  
</P>
<P>
 I've never had any interest in CD-ROM -- even after discovering that it's not 
the name of a rap singer. I don't need an encyclopedia stored in a computer. I 
have one gathered in books (remember them?). I know a person can now hit a 
search key to find a particular subject in a computerized store of knowledge. I 
like to thumb through my books. I like holding them. I like being diverted from 
my search by unrelated articles. I like being on the information surface 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the mobility factor. 
</P>
<P>
 As my colleague Thomas B. Rosenstiel points out in an article for this 
section, it is now possible, while sitting in the stands at a ballgame, to 
phone the office, check for E-mail, scan the Internet and make a few stock 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 But doesn't that defeat the purpose of going to a ballgame? Especially during 
working hours (the only time I ever go). Who wants to call the boss? I want to 
get away from it all. Watch some highly skilled individuals perform with a bat, 
ball and glove. In the flesh. You know, real reality? 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would I be interested in swapping messages with some faceless password on 
the Internet while sitting in a ballpark. If I want to chat, I'll talk to the 
guy sitting next to me. I like seeing the person I talk to. The facial 
expressions. The gestures. And hearing his voice. Call me strange. But I like 
human voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Already technology has given the world the opportunity of hearing personal 
telephones ring in such places as restaurants, ballparks and theaters. I think 
secondhand telephone ringing is unhealthy. I want it outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 While I'm at it, I'd also like to do away with one of the worst inventions of 
all time -- the car phone. That's the gizmo that enables the guy in the BMW to 
chat with someone on the other side of town while crawling along at 49 m.p.h. 
on the freeway. No one knows why, but it is apparently impossible for a 
car-phone user to exceed 49 m.p.h. on the freeway. And if he must make a lane 
change? Well, he just slides across without warning. You know why? Signaling is 
out of the question because he doesn't have a spare hand.  
</P>
<P>
 It'll really get interesting when drivers begin installing video phones. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt about it. I'm a technophobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I just checked my computer's spell-check system. It doesn't recognize the 
word technophobe . Why am I not surprised?

 "So far out of town you couldn't find a phone." That old lament makes little 
sense nowadays when you can't get that far out of town.There are phones on 
planes, in cars and on boats. And, as ever, in our teen-agers' rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, automobiles no longer have full-sized spare tires but they do 
have cellular handsets. Secretaries wear lightweight headsets like tiaras, 
simply unplugging them when they leave their desks. Talk may not be cheap, but 
it's easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in distant corners of the world, most travelers no longer have to line up 
at the national PT&T office -- Post, Telephone and Telegraph -- to call home 
and wait two or three hours for the privilege. Now, even in remote outposts, 
someone might have a portable satellite phone available to bounce your message 
to mom. And all you'd need is a small rectangle of plastic.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; NO. 2 RECEIVER SPOT STILL TO BE FILLED

 The Rams' ongoing audition to find competent receivers to play opposite 
starter Flipper Anderson has been interrupted by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Chris Brantley, who has caught the attention of the coaching staff, 
apparently succumbed to the wear and tear of two-a-day practices and was forced 
out with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final play of practice Monday, wide receiver Sean LaChapelle was 
tackled by Dexter Davis in a non-tackling drill and injured his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams began camp with 11 candidates for the three or four spots opposite 
Anderson. The team, however, has released Jeff Jones and was forced to place 
Todd Kinchen on its physically-unable-to-perform list because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young had seven sacks in the first four games last 
season, but a short time later went down with a knee injury and was lost for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's back, and according to Coach Chuck Knox, he's back to prime-time form. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has looked great and has dominated in the one-on-one pass rushes," Knox 
said. "I think he will be even more effective this year with Jimmie Jones 
inside along with Sean Gilbert. Now you can't double-up on anybody."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The defense dominated the afternoon workout, capped by former Raider 
linebacker Joe Kelly's interception of a Chris Chandler pass. . . . Marquez 
Pope, acquired from the Chargers, has drawn attention at strong safety. . . . 
Running back Johnny Bailey, who will be the team's top punt returner, is making 
a strong run as a third-down back. T.J. SIMERS

 The Detroit Pistons, trying to add frontline depth, acquired center Eric 
Leckner from the Philadelphia 76ers for a second-round draft choice in 1996 or 
'97. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers will receive the lesser of the Pistons' two '96 draft picks, unless 
that selection goes to Denver as part of an earlier trade. If the Nuggets get 
the '96 choice, Philadelphia will get the second of the three picks Detroit has 
in the '97 draft.

 "Adding an experienced 27-year-old NBA center to our roster should help us," 
said Billy McKinney, Detroit's director of player personnel. "He will

 Leckner, 6-foot-11, averaged 5.1 points and 4.0 rebounds a game last season.

 Attorneys for the defendants in Bryan Fortay's suit against Miami, claiming 
that the school hurt his chances of becoming a professional quarterback, sought 
to have the action dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortay filed suit last August against the university and several officials, 
alleging broken promises and negligence that involved him in a financial-aid 
fraud scandal.

 Prosecutors in Detroit could decide within the week whether to seek charges 
against New Jersey Nets star Derrick Coleman, who is accused of raping a woman 
at a Detroit hotel. Police forwarded the case to Wayne County prosecutors 
Monday, according to Benny Napoleon, deputy chief of police. Coleman has denied 
the allegations.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; COLOR PURPLE IS COLOR OF MONEY IN THE JUVENILE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this year, trainer Ron McAnally said he had a 2-year-old filly in his 
barn who might be as good as Mr Purple. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 14, that filly, Call Now, was beaten by a half-length in her first 
start, after the winner, Ski Dancer, bumped her at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple, making only his second start, had no such trouble Monday, holding 
off a filly, Serena's Song, to win the $102,600 Hollywood Juvenile Championship 
by a half-length on the last day of Hollywood Park's 68-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problems for Mr Purple were the ones the inexperienced son of Deputy 
Minister and Turk O Witz caused for himself in the paddock. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't hot, but he was fooling around," McAnally said. "The first time he 
ran, he was a dream to saddle, and we schooled him in the paddock Sunday and he 
was all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today the crowd seemed to bother him. We pointed him in the direction of 
the crowd, and that didn't work, so then we pointed him away from the crowd, 
and that didn't work either. He kept lunging. We almost didn't get him 
saddled." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by Mr Purple was McAnally's second of the day, giving him the 
Hollywood training championship over Sandy Shulman, 25-24. The title didn't 
faze McAnally as much as some other accomplishments. "Just give me those stakes 
wins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning Sunday's Vanity Handicap with Potridee, McAnally led the meeting 
in stakes victories with seven. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally's bad news for the weekend was a set of X-rays for Valiant Nature, 
who has suffered a hairline fracture of the cannon bone on his left foreleg. 
The colt will undergo surgery today to have two screws inserted to fuse the 
break, with the recovery time eliminating the rest of his 3-year-old season. 
</P>
<P>
 Winless since the Hollywood Futurity in December, Valiant Nature ran 13th in 
the Kentucky Derby and was third as the favorite Saturday in the Swaps Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suspected that there was something wrong, for him to run as bad as he did 
Saturday," McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas, who won the Juvenile twice with fillies, Terlingua in 
1978 and Althea in 1983, didn't get the hat trick with Serena's Song, but still 
thought she might have been the best horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd be 1-2-3 early, but we were as far back as fifth at one 
point," Lukas said. "Gary (Stevens) thought that the fractions would be too 
fast, so he settled her after the break, and then she caught some clods in her 
face. With a better trip, she could have been there. She was the one horse that 
was running the last eighth of a mile. I sure don't think anything less of her 
after this race. She'll go to Del Mar, and we'll start running her against 
fillies again." 
</P>
<P>
 Serena's Song finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Lukas' other starter, Cyrano. Mr 
Purple, who won his debut by three lengths on June 30, earned $57,600 for his 
breeder and owner, Alex G. Campbell Jr. of Lexington, Ky., who named the colt 
because his golfing partner, David Reynolds, usually wears that color. Reynolds 
is co-owner of Tabasco Cat, the Lukas trainee who won this year's Preakness and 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple, ridden by Chris McCarron, ran the first half-mile in 45 1/5 and 
finished six furlongs in 1:10, paying $4.40 as the slight favorite over 
Serena's Song. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple had a two-length lead over Cyrano with an eighth of a mile left and 
was 3 1/2 ahead of Serena's Song. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner just had too big a lead by the time I put my filly in full 
flight," Stevens said. "I didn't take her back leaving the gate. I just sat on 
her. I was going to lay second, but the horses on both sides were going, so I 
elected to fall back off the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple didn't break sharply, the ground under his back legs giving way. 
"He's got a lot of speed, so he got into the race right away," McCarron said. 
"The filly made him run hard to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis topped Gary Stevens, 78-74, for the riding title. Kent Desormeaux, 
winning at a 24% clip, the best of the regular riders, was third in the 
standings with 64 winners, one more than Chris Antley. . . . Hollywood Park's 
on-track daily averages, 12,759 for attendance and $2.6 million for handle, 
were down from last year by 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Counting off-track 
business, the averages were 30,002 and $8.1 million, a gain of 10.6% in betting 
and a drop of 1.6% in attendance.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AZINGER'S RALLY AN AWAKENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those pro athletes who feel invincible, who think it will never end, 
listen to Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all think we're in control of our lives, but we're not," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after learning he had a cancerous tumor, it may be that Azinger, 
34, now has a better understanding of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed radiation treatments and an out-patient surgical procedure to 
remove a fatty tumor in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged, I'm cured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful when I wake up and can see the ceiling. A lot of people take 
sight for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger is planning to resume his career in the PGA Championship Aug. 11-14 at 
Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have targeted the PGA for my return if I wasn't the 
defending champ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation that Azinger might start his comeback last week in 
the New England tournament, which he also won last year, but the surgery set 
him back three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger did stop by Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton, Mass., to say 
hello. For the rest of his life, he said, he will know how fortunate he has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eternally grateful to those who went before me," Azinger said. "Lymphoma 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized how easy it is to lift someone's spirits by just writing or 
saying something. I've got a new calling -- I need to be an inspiration to 
people. I have a chance to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his golf game, Azinger has been spending a lot of time with clubs in 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't chip good, it's not because of lack of practice," he said. "My 
swing isn't pretty, but it repeats." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger said he hit his first 3-irons, 3-woods and drivers last Tuesday. He 
said he didn't hit them very well, but hit them hard and felt no discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no pain in my shoulder whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he thinks he will perform on the course, Azinger said he has learned 
a lot about expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'll be as competitive as ever," he said. "I know initially it 
will be tough to concentrate with all the attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but for inspiration, all Azinger has to do is look at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High Price: How confident was Nick Price in his putting at the British Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently a lot more than he was in June at the U.S. Open, where he put five 
putters in his bag. At Turnberry, Price had only one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Price: For what it's worth, Price finished 35th at the Masters and missed 
the cut in the U.S. Open, the two previous major events this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's mental, right? What percentage of golf is physical and what percentage is 
mental? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?" said Patrick J. Cohn, a sports 
psychologist in Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask any player, if you've got a good swing, it's 80% mental," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn is part of an expanding breed of golf helpers in the clinical field, even 
if his clinic is the golf course. He works with PGA Tour players Trevor Dodds, 
Grant Waite and Kelly Gibson and consults with golfers on the LPGA, Nike and 
Asian tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn, who earned a doctorate in sports psychology at the University of 
Virginia and taught the subject at Miami of Ohio and North Texas, is the author 
of two books, "The Mental Game of Golf" and "Mind Power Putting." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to staying on top of your golf game is to maintain your confidence, 
Cohn said, adding: "Players need to learn to accept mistakes and be a little 
more kind to themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn said golfers who doubt the value of a sports psychologist might be 
confused by his job label. 
</P>
<P>
 "When some people hear psychologist, they think we are shrinks and analysts," 
he said. "I'm just another person on the support team. I'm the mental coach."

HUNGARIAN ORCHESTRA GOES BOWLING ON ITS FIRST U.S. TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When conductor Ivan Fischer decided in 1983 that it was time to conduct his 
own orchestra, he headed home to Budapest from London. And when he wasn't much 
taken with the orchestras he found there, he and his friend, pianist Zoltan 
Kocsis, started their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hungary has outstanding musical talents, but it didn't have an international, 
top-quality orchestra," Fischer said last week by phone from Budapest. "I 
always believed that given those excellent individual talents, there was no 
reason why one shouldn't be able to form an absolutely first-class orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 So began the Budapest Festival Orchestra. The highly regarded group makes its 
U.S. debut at the Hollywood Bowl for five nights starting today, a decade after 
Fischer made his own U.S. debut at the Music Center, conducting the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rather taken aback when I heard them last year in Budapest," said 
Ernest Fleischmann, the Philharmonic's executive vice president and managing 
director, and the man who invited Fischer and his orchestra to the Bowl. "I 
didn't expect anything of this quality. I went to their concert a skeptic and 
came out exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fall of Communism, Fischer said, Hungarian orchestras had both 
structural and organizational problems. The 43-year-old conductor called it 
"generally, a mentality problem. There wasn't enough competitive spirit. The 
Communist product generally wasn't striving for quality, and whether it was a 
car or a symphony orchestra doesn't make a lot of difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer himself had been competitive for years. Born in Budapest to a musical 
family, he studied piano, violin and cello before deciding on conducting. In 
Vienna, he studied conducting with Hans Swarowsky, who also taught such people 
as Zubin Mehta and Claudio Abbado. At the age of 25, he won Britain's Rupert 
Foundation International Conductor Competition and went on to conduct major 
orchestras in Britain and, soon, elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Budapest Festival Orchestra started small, coming together like a 
free-lance orchestra three or four times a year for recordings and concerts. It 
appeared at European music festivals and went on small tours. Its reputation 
grew both inside and outside of Hungary.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1992, after the fall of the Communist system, "the new mayor of 
Budapest decided (the orchestra) is the pride of the city," said Fischer, and 
granted it extensive city subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra became permanent, playing at both the 1,200-seat Franz Liszt 
Academy and a larger multi-purpose hall with nearly 2,000 seats. It has a 
40-concert subscription season, chamber music events and even community 
outreach concerts for children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer said he also contributed administrative ideas he'd observed while 
conducting in both the United States and Europe, setting up an American-style 
foundation and board of directors. "The foundation makes sure it is 
artistically independent," said Fischer. "And the city makes sure that it's 
safe (economically)." 
</P>
<P>
 There are today upward of 80 orchestra members, said principal conductor 
Fischer, who shares the role of artistic director with composer and pianist 
Kocsis. All but a handful of the musicians are Hungarian, and most are quite 
young; the average age, he said, is about 27. 
</P>
<P>
 (Kocsis was originally scheduled to appear as soloist with the orchestra 
Wednesday at the Bowl, playing Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 but recently 
canceled due to a hand injury. He will be replaced by Israeli pianist Ilana 
Vered.)  
</P>
<P>
 Fischer said it would be difficult to compare the Budapest Festival 
Orchestra's budget to that of a U.S. orchestra, given the differences in living 
standards. But in a country where the annual wage for a schoolteacher or young 
physician would be about 800,000 Hungarian forints ($8,000 U.S.), he estimates 
a ticket range from 400 ($4) to 1,000 ($10) forints, with a median price of 800 
($8).  
</P>
<P>
 All of their concerts "are packed," said Fischer, who reports pressure to add 
concerts. But he doesn't want to do that, he said: "We still spend a long time 
rehearsing, and this is a very conscious policy. We want to keep every concert 
a special event.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to a lot of American cities," continued Fischer, who is also 
principal guest conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. "In the U.S., 
one spends around 11 hours of rehearsal time for a new program. We spend 20 to 
25 hours, a little more than double." 
</P>
<P>
 The Budapest Festival Orchestra won't have that luxury at the Hollywood Bowl, 
however, which Fischer said offers minimal rehearsal time, given the number of 
Bowl programs each summer. The orchestra will be performing four different 
programs, two of which they also performed in Montreal last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 While this tour comprises only Montreal and Los Angeles, the orchestra has 
extensive travel plans coming up. It expects to tour Germany in December, Italy 
in January and Japan in June. In September, 1995, the orchestra lands at New 
York's Carnegie Hall, where it will mark the 50th anniversary of Hungarian 
composer Bela Bartok's death -- which occurred in New York -- with a Bartok 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 But first is Los Angeles, a first-time visit for everyone in the orchestra 
except Fischer, who has also conducted at the Bowl twice before. Since he first 
conducted at the Music Center in 1983, filling in for a then-ailing Carlo Maria 
Giulini, said Fischer, "I have been to most of the big towns in the United 
States. Now I can take my orchestra for the first time to the very same town 
(where I made my U.S. debut), which is wonderful."

TO HER, IT'S KIDS' STUFF; MOVIES: MARA WILSON, 7, IS EARNING PRAISE FROM HER 
CO-STARS IN THE UPCOMING 'MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET,' BUT ACTING IS JUST SOMETHING 
SHE SAYS SHE LIKES -- FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWELL J. MALHAM Jr., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most refreshing revelation about Mara Wilson is that in spite of her 
growing popularity and marketability -- due in part to her cuddly performance 
as Robin Williams' youngest child in the smash "Mrs. Doubtfire" -- she remains 
a relatively normal, happy 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she might well be one underage performer W. C. Fields, famed for his 
unswerving enmity toward child actors, might have tolerated, even enjoyed, as a 
co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Hughes plucked Wilson from a sea of 1,000 young girls who 
auditioned for the part of Susan (first played by Natalie Wood in 1947), the 
unbelieving child who rejects all notions of Kris Kringle in Hughes' remake of 
"Miracle on 34th Street," which is filming here and is scheduled for a 
Thanksgiving release. 
</P>
<P>
 With a voice as breezy as bird song, Wilson takes a break from the set of 
"Miracle" to play on a toy train idling on a playground a block from her 
temporary Gold Coast living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I call fun ," she says as she prepares to scale the locomotive, 
widening her hazel eyes. Eventually, she settles into the driver's seat and 
submits to a gracious yet obviously perfunctory interview about acting, her 
secret passion to write and the highs and lows of her life, thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'm always going to be acting. Maybe when I grow up, I will 
be a scriptwriter. I already have a few scripts in my head," she says. "But, 
for now, I like acting, because it feels like I'm pretending. It's not exactly 
like playing here, on the train, because when you act, you can't say what you 
want to say; you have to say what (the director) wants you to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Such innocent acuity comes as no surprise to her co-star Sir Richard 
Attenborough, who plays Kringle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is truly marvelous, and the brilliance of somebody like Mara is that her 
concentration as an actor is absolute; she doesn't have to think of what her 
next line is. She awaits her cue and plays her line," Attenborough says during 
a break at Hughes' sprawling indoor studio on the city's northwest side. "She 
is a total professional, and I think really it's because she's been blessed 
with fabulous parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing that is Elizabeth Perkins, fresh from her prehistoric jaunt as Wilma 
Flintstone. Perkins plays Wilson's pragmatic, career-obsessive mother in 
"Miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes Mara so amazing is her mom, Suzie, who is probably the most normal 
mom I've met in a long time. She does not fit the bill of a stage mother at 
all. She treats Mara like one of her five children."  
</P>
<P>
 Born the fourth of five children to Suzie and Mike Wilson in the San Fernando 
Valley on July 24, 1987, Wilson was inspired to pursue acting by her oldest 
brother, Danny, now 15, who had successfully landed a few TV commercials and 
small film parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, we said no to acting," says Suzie, who accompanies her daughter to 
the set every day and helps her rehearse. "We told her you don't always get 
jobs you audition for, and it's harder than it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson, then 4, showed no signs of relenting, her mother decided to test 
her daughter's determination before signing an agent. She gathered the three 
elder brothers (the family has since added a baby sister, Anna, 1) and put the 
child through a series of mock interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave all the boys pens and papers and put her through the works. And, when 
she finished, they would say, 'That was good, Mara, but you didn't get the 
job.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She turned to me and said, 'That's OK. Can I try for another one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mara Wilson began working in commercials and then added a recurring role on 
"Melrose Place" as the daughter of a Russian immigrant, as well as a sizable 
part in the NBC movie "A Time to Heal." Then came the reading for "Doubtfire," 
which proved to be her launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
 As for attempting to fill Natalie Wood's shoes in "Miracle," Wilson remains 
modestly open-ended: 
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask if I thought I was good in the movie and I say, 'Well, some 
people said I was, but really, how am I suppose to know?' " she says. "I guess 
we'll just have to wait and see."

 The Channel Islands are sometimes referred to as the American Galapagos. The 
islands and the waters around them are considered to be among the most diverse 
ecosystems in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Channel Islands National 
Park offer numerous opportunities for exploration. Visitors can often see 
elephant seals, sea lions, harbor seals, Northern fur seals and more. Numerous 
sightings of blue whales have been reported this year. 
</P>

AL MARTINEZ: WHEN A HOUSE IS A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Frieda Marlin gets on the phone, she displays none of the whispery, 
hesitant qualities associated with 70-year-olds. She can be tough, angry and 
awesomely determined, like one of those people from the movie "Network" who is 
madder than hell and not going to take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 She telephoned three times last week, and each time I imagined her leaning out 
a window, shaking her fist and bellowing at anyone who passed by, same as the 
folks in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 What she's shouting is that no one is going to tear down her home and shovel 
her off to some old people's ghetto. If that's what they think they're going to 
do, they've got another think coming. Frieda Marlin is not about to move. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's this all about? It's about change, I guess, and the victims of 
change, and a city that can't wear the same clothes two days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is permanent in L.A. anymore. Old buildings disappear overnight to be 
replaced by new buildings that also disappear. Mini-malls and gas stations are 
gone in a twinkling, and old restaurants become new restaurants just as you're 
getting used to their coq au vin.  
</P>
<P>
 And now the forces of change want to bulldoze Lincoln Place, where Frieda 
lives, and turn those comfortable old buildings into gleaming new apartments 
and condos, upsetting the lives of the 1,500 people who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The builders, Transaction Companies Ltd., like to think of it as "property 
enhancement," but a bulldozer by any other name is just as destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Place is a sprawling complex of one- and two-story apartment buildings 
on 40 acres of what used to be Venice bean fields. It was built in 1950 and 
looks like the kind of housing that went up during the Second World War in 
towns where liberty ships and fighter planes were being turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of those who live there are low income people. They either work at 
menial jobs or live off pensions and Social Security. Lincoln Place represents 
affordable housing, of which there is damned little in L.A. They're afraid it's 
going to be ripped right out from under them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants association, utilizing bonds and government subsidies, has twice 
offered to buy the complex for $40 million and $47 million, but has been turned 
down by Transaction, which found their offers "not commercially viable." There 
are bigger profits down the road in building anew. The company, acknowledging 
the needs of some of the tenants, has offered to include units for the elderly, 
the handicapped and single parents. It would also pay up to $5,000 in 
relocation fees to those forced from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But moving out or being "ghettoized" with other old people isn't what Frieda 
Marlin wants. She loves the mix of young adults and infants that comprise the 
corner of the village she's occupied for a dozen years. Her last apartment was 
torn down for the same reason this one faces demolition, and she's not about to 
let it happen again. "I'm going to fight it like hell," Frieda said. "It'll be 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not one who thinks everything old is beautiful and everything new is as 
ugly as a pimple on the nose. I'm also not one who believes every builder is 
out to smash your wheelchair and rape your turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 A Transaction spokesman, Jim Merlino, promises that anyone who wants to stay 
at Lincoln Place will be allowed to do so, without an increase in rent. 
Attrition will make it possible over a 10-year period of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the existing buildings functionally obsolete and says even if they 
renovated them they'd still be functionally obsolete. It's just good business 
to tear them down and start over. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Chapman, who is 80ish, and equally as tough as Frieda, agrees. She's 
lived at Lincoln for 22 years and dreams about moving into one of those new 
units. "The place is too damned old," she says. "Nothing works. If the toaster 
blows a fuse, the whole apartment goes dark. The plumbing is always clogging 
up, too. They keep fixing it, but how much patching up can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both Frieda and Rose will be at a city Planning Department meeting next week, 
where the future of Lincoln Place will be up for grabs. Frieda's home versus 
Rose's dream. Old comforts and new efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been writing a column long enough to realize that a point of view is 
required here, but I'm at a loss. I understand the warmth of familiarity, but 
also realize that nothing lasts forever. Call it a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that however it turns out, both Frieda and Rose will realize they've 
fought the good fight and can sit down together and have a cup of coffee 
someday. Even old adversaries can be new friends when the war is done.

IRA WATCH; RETURN OF THE TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sinn Fein, a Northern Ireland political party allied with the terrorist Irish 
Republican Army, on Sunday formally rejected a joint British-Irish declaration 
that many had seen as the best hope in years for peace in that strife-ridden 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 By the December "Downing Street Declaration," Ireland agreed that the majority 
would rule on the political status of Northern Ireland.The United Kingdom 
agreed that if and when the majority chose union with Ireland, the United 
Kingdom would not stand in the way. The mostly Protestant unionist population 
constitutes a clear majority at the moment. Some decades from now the gradually 
growing, mostly Catholic, Irish nationalist population could become a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was just talk, of course, unless the inflamed parties on both sides 
could see fit to accept this vision of a peaceful, politically open-ended 
future. Sadly, even the remote prospect of Irish rule brought an immediate 
escalation in unionist terrorism. More sadly still, the hope that Sinn Fein's 
Gerry Adams could bring his party and the terrorist Irish Republican Army to 
renounce violence and join multilateral (British, Irish, unionist, nationalist) 
talks has now been utterly shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? The hour of Sinn Fein and above all of Gerry Adams would seem to 
have definitively passed. The path to peace that might have led through Sinn 
Fein must now lead around it. Adams and his party have, in a strange way, their 
worst enemies for allies: Only the terrorists on either side want the bloodshed 
that lies ahead.

A STRIKE AGAINST THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles, car-dependant city that it is, struggled to survive the first day 
of the strike against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially it was an inconvenience mostly for those poor souls, unaware that 
bus mechanics had walked off the job at midnight, who found themselves stranded 
at bus stops. But the longer this strike goes on, the tougher it will be for 
everyone -- not just the many thousands of people who depend on buses to get 
around town, but the majority who drive to work and may soon find the roads 
more crowded as transit users switch to other modes of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is most unfortunate that the MTA, the massive transit agency that runs the 
nation's biggest bus system, was unable to reach agreement on a new contract 
with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents the roughly 1,900 
mechanics who keep those buses rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate negotiations with the two unions that represent 4,400 drivers and 600 
clerks had gone well enough to bring about tentative agreements with both 
groups. The sticking point with the mechanics is the MTA's goal to contract 
with the private sector for certain services, such as bus maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the union is so adamant on that point is that in recent years, for 
the first time ever, MTA had to lay off some mechanics. The union, 
understandably, is determined to prevent any of its members from losing jobs. 
But the logic behind contracting out government services to save taxpayer money 
is so compelling that the issue is not going to fade away, especially with MTA 
facing a budget shortfall owing to a decline in sales tax and fare box 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when the MTA employee unions last signed contracts, local transit 
officials were flush with local tax funds and money flowing from Washington and 
Sacramento for major new transit projects such as the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are gone, at least for the foreseeable future. So everyone must 
sacrifice to get through these lean times. In the long run, that means the 
unions must be prepared to give ground on outside contractors. In the short 
run, the rest of us must brace for what could be a long strike. Not exactly 
what Los Angeles needs.

JORDAN DEAL COULD GO A LONG WAY; CAN ASSAD HANG OUT THERE ALL ALONE FOREVER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an occasion that called for eloquence and vision, and the key 
participants did not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of 
Israel all spoke words fitting to the solemnity, goodwill and promise of the 
moment. The two Middle Eastern leaders did not sign a treaty of peace when they 
met on Monday in bright sunshine on the White House lawn, as the leaders of 
Egypt and Israel had on a March day 15 years ago; that is yet to come. But with 
their agreement on a declaration ending a state of belligerency nearly half a 
century old, Jordan and Israel have taken a defining turn in the road. 
</P>
<P>
 For both, this is an act of national self-interest, an opportunity finally and 
after great cost to establish normal and mutually beneficial ties across their 
long border. Especially for the king, it was also an act of personal courage. 
He needs no reminding of the fates met by his grandfather, King Abdullah, who 
was assassinated in 1951 in part because of his readiness to reach a realistic 
accommodation with Israel; or of Egypt's Anwar Sadat, the first and so far only 
other Arab leader to make peace with Israel, who was similarly murdered by 
opponents of conciliation. War is universally destructive. In the Arab world, 
tragically, peace can be the undoing of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein is, of course, looking for rewards beyond what closer ties with Israel 
can bring, beginning in Washington. Congress, which both Hussein and Rabin are 
to address today, has not forgotten and has yet to fully forgive the king's 
decision to give tacit backing to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. That 
self-wounding act cost Jordan most of its U.S. military and economic help, 
along with its considerable annual subsidy from Saudi Arabia. Hussein 
desperately needs at least significant forgiveness of Jordan's $700-million 
debt to the United States, as well as help in modernizing his armed forces. We 
urge Congress to be sympathetic to these requests. In the politically reshaped 
Middle East now emerging, a Jordan economically stronger and better able to 
defend itself against radical foes is clearly something U.S. policy should 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 With an Israel-Jordan peace approaching, with an Israel-Palestinian settlement 
lurching ahead, with Israel's ties with Tunisia, Morocco and some of the 
Persian Gulf states openly expanding, Syria's position as odd man surely 
becomes increasingly uncomfortable. How long might it be before President Hafez 
Assad stands where Hussein stood Monday? Maybe never. But maybe, too, sooner 
than many could right now imagine.

MORE GOOD IN IT THAN BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the federal anti-crime bill gets shot down, it would be a shame for 
everybody, especially Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The mammoth legislation is far from perfect; there is, inevitably, funding for 
unnecessary commissions and studies. But taken as a whole, it is the closest 
thing to an urban aid bill around. It promises $30-billion worth of new cops, 
prisons and prevention programs to fight gangs, treat drug addicts and get poor 
kids off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 And few are objecting to new federal funds for substantial new prison 
construction, to help pay for the incarceration of illegal immigrants who have 
been convicted of felonies or for boot camps for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the House-Senate conference committee needs to work its way past two big 
problems. Because of the regrettable, unnecessary and pointless expansion of 
the death penalty to 63 federal offenses, many had wanted to the bill to 
include the racial justice act, which would allow minorities to make Death Row 
appeals based on a pattern of discrimination in capital punishment. That's 
reasonable, given the documentation of bias in the application of the death 
penalty; but it's going nowhere. It now looks as if it will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill offers 100,000 additional police officers. Although no formula has 
been devised to determine how many will be assigned where, big cities like Los 
Angeles can expect a fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Corps will also promote public safety by rewarding bright young 
Americans who commit to four years of law enforcement in return for 
scholarships. Modeled after ROTC, this new program also belongs in the final 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also has money to benefit after-school programs, midnight basketball 
leagues and anti-gang efforts like Los Angeles' valuable new Hope in Youth 
program. It also helps fund drug courts and treatment for nonviolent offenders, 
domestic-abuse programs and shelters for battered women. Such elements add 
balance to a bill otherwise long on punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 These and similar programs would probably not otherwise attract sufficient 
political support in Washington these days were they housed in anything other 
than an anti-crime bill.

FAIRNESS ISSUE IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "D.A. Meets With Black Leaders on Fairness Issue," July 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, I am outraged that a few so-called (and I use that term politely) 
representatives of the black community in Los Angeles are given major 
front-page coverage. I'm referring to the article on fairness with regard to 
O.J. Simpson. As a victim of spousal abuse -- and unlike many women, I was 
fortunate enough to be able to leave after the very first incident -- I am 
appalled that the issue of spousal abuse has taken a back seat to the issue of 
racial justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of the black community (both living and dead) have worked long 
and hard, striving to be judged competent and worthy without regard for the 
color of their skin. It is a sad day indeed, when there are those in the black 
community who would use the very thing that kept us on the "outside looking in" 
for so long as a shield and/or excuse for criminal acts. The saddest thing of 
all, though, is that two people are dead, one of whom, Nicole Brown, suffered 
violence from her husband (as do many women, black and white), and that neither 
our police nor our courts, when presented with the opportunity, did anything in 
their power to prevent the ultimate violence, murder. 
</P>

 * I was very disturbed after reading the July 10 article about black sentiment 
over the O.J. Simpson case. I consider myself a socially aware African 
American, but obviously I have overlooked something if a growing number of 
blacks are crying "racism" in the way in which O.J. is being "tried" and 
showcased by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I too agree that the international press has covered this case ad 
nauseam. But to call it racist has gone too far. Simpson's race has nothing to 
do with anything in this matter.  
</P>
<P>
 This case is all about celebrity, wealth and intrigue. Any high-profile 
celebrity of any race would get the same type of press coverage. Especially 
when the case has all the intriguing elements of a Hollywood suspense 
blockbuster: a grieving widower who is also the sole suspect, his alleged 
suicide attempt, a televised freeway chase, not to mention an emotion-charged, 
gavel-to-gavel courtroom showdown between high-powered attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 I want true justice for everyone involved -- Nicole Simpson, Ronald Goldman 
and O.J. Simpson. I hope O.J. is proved innocent or guilty on specific, 
uncircumstantial evidence.

COMET COLLISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Although not of the same cosmic significance as the Simpson trial, the comet 
that collided into Jupiter had to be the story of the week ("Jupiter Takes Huge 
Blow From Comet," July 19). Especially interesting -- although, again, not 
quite as interesting as the O.J. Simpson trial -- was the fact that one comet 
fragment created a plume with a width (9,600 miles) greater than the diameter 
of the Earth; I found this to be a precautionary item worth noting. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, I feel, it would be particularly unpleasant to live through such a 
plume, I propose we not procrastinate, but immediately begin construction of 
three large baseball gloves to orbit above the Earth; attached to each glove 
would be a long rope for hauling, which would allow for easy fielding by a NASA 
Shuttle craft. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan would also provide great cost-saving advantages over other messy 
solutions such as nuclear missiles or photon torpedoes -- which I studied in 
junior college. Once completed, we could then rest easy, and again focus our 
attention on the things that really matter, such as the Simpson trial -- did I 
mention the Simpson trial?

 * Forty years ago, Immanuel Velikovsky proposed cataclysmic collisions between 
plants and comets in his books "Worlds in Collision" and "Earth in Upheaval." 
His theories were ridiculed by the orthodox scientific community. Though many 
of his interpretations and details were not right, his concepts seem to be 
verified by what we saw on Jupiter. Isn't it time to reopen the books on 
Velikovsky?

BERNSTEIN ON CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re Carl Bernstein's lament over Camelot potentially lost, "A Matter of 
Honesty: Bill Clinton and Whitewater," Opinion, July 17: 
</P>
<P>
 It is truly amazing how journalists can continue to speak of how Bill Clinton 
"got elected" to do this and that, as if 43% of the vote represents some kind 
of mandate. It is more correct to speak of how 57% of the people passionately 
did not want Bill Clinton elected President; nor did they -- or do they now -- 
want any part of his policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, to Bernstein, may be in trouble because of an honesty problem, but 
the truth is that he is in trouble because of the near-antediluvian, 
bureaucracy-based programs that he advocates. Given the unpopularity of his 
ideas and programs, anyone associated with them would have to learn to lie 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan coalition still comfortably controls the majority of the voting 
public, and that majority demands less government, less taxes, less federal 
programs and less of Bill and Hillary's efforts to turn back the clock to the 
1960s. In 1996, without a believe-nothing like George Bush heading the 
opposition ticket, 43% will no longer command a governing "mandate," except to 
someone as out of touch as Bernstein.

 * Bernstein's article was one of the finest commentaries on the Clinton 
presidency.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein is right. "The best-informed President of our lifetime," the first 
President in a generation to "honestly confront . . . with eloquence and daring 
. . . the true problems of our civil society" may indeed have marred his 
presidency by truth-trimming, lack of candor and prevarication, particularly 
about his personal finances some 13 years ago. In a word, a potentially great 
presidency may be ruined by its own flaws -- or by our unrealistic 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two questions suggest themselves: 
</P>
<P>
 First, how many truly gifted political leaders (in our country or in any 
other) can one think of who were less flawed than Clinton? Second, how many 
gifted political leaders were held so relentlessly to the white glare of 
scrutiny during their own tenure by their own people? 
</P>
<P>
 Never has a President inherited so enormous a national debt. Rarely has a 
President inherited such an overwhelming world disorder. We are not willing to 
settle for a brilliantly gifted but blemished resident; we will settle for 
nothing less than a sainted President. Batter up!

 * Bernstein counsels the Clintons to be truthful and then flagrantly misquotes 
and egregiously misconstrues one of the most famous passages from President 
Nixon's White House tapes. He writes that President Nixon said, "I don't give a 
s--t what you do. Lie, stonewall, whatever you have to do to get past the grand 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a famous conversation about Watergate with John Mitchell on March 
22, 1973, Nixon said, "I don't give a s--t what happens . . . Stonewall it, let 
them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover-up, or anything else, if it'll save it -- 
save it for them. That's the whole point. On the other hand, I would prefer, as 
I said to you, that you do it the other way. And I would particularly prefer to 
do it that other way if it's going to come out that way anyway. And that my 
view, that with the number of jackass people that they've got that they can 
call (before the grand jury), they're going to -- the story they get out 
through leaks, charges, and so forth, and innuendoes, will be hell of a lot 
worse than the story they're going to get out by just letting it out there." 
</P>
<P>
 His interpretation of the passage is equally negligent. As anyone knows who 
has listened to the whole conversation -- which is available to the public at 
the National Archives -- President Nixon tells Mitchell that he resented the 
way President Eisenhower had treated his besieged chief of staff, Sherman 
Adams, and that he intended to let his colleagues do what they felt they had to 
do to protect themselves. But he goes on to urge Mitchell to embrace the tactic 
of letting White House and campaign aides testify openly before the Watergate 
grand jury. He is urging candor, not cover-up.  
</P>
<P>
 It is simply wrong to imply, as Bernstein does, that the President was 
ordering a cover-up. He was doing almost precisely the opposite.

COLUMN LEFT / JAMIN RASKIN / JOHN BONIFAZ: WEALTH ROBS THE UNWEALTHY OF VOTING 
CLOUT; RICH CONTRIBUTORS DECIDE MOST PRIMARIES; THIS CAN BE CORRECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMIN RASKIN and JOHN BONIFAZ, Jamin Raskin is associate dean of American 
University's Washington College of Law. John Bonifaz is an attorney and 
director of the Boston-based National Voting Rights Institute, which has just 
filed the first test case, in New York, on the wealth primary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1953, the Supreme Court struck down, as violative of the constitutional 
guarantee of equal protection, the last vestiges of the white primary, a 
candidate-nominating process that excluded African-American voters and 
candidates based on their race. Today, the wealth primary, a 
candidate-nominating process that excludes poor and working people of all 
races, has replaced the white primary as the principal instrument of 
anti-democratic exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wealth primary, big-money donors select and finance candidates for 
local, state and federal office. The candidates who win the wealth primary -- 
who raise the most money or who are independently wealthy -- usually go on to 
win the actual party primary and the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans do not have the money to be heard in this exclusionary process. 
Thus, like its predecessor, the wealth primary violates the constitutional 
guarantee of equal protection for all, as it discriminates against poorer 
candidates and voters. Similarly, the wealth primary stands as a barrier to 
meaningful participation in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern Supreme Court has long been hostile to the placement of financial 
obstacles in the paths of voters. In 1966, two years after the 24th Amendment 
banned poll taxes in federal elections, the Supreme Court struck down 
Virginia's poll tax. Justice William O. Douglas wrote that "a state violates 
the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment whenever it makes the 
affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter 
qualifications have no relation to wealth. . . . " Likening wealth to race, he 
declared that wealth was a factor "not germane to one's ability to participate 
intelligently in the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, the court articulated that principle in striking down further 
filing fees, ranging as high as $8,900, that the state of Texas required 
primary candidates to pay to their political parties. "(W)e would ignore 
reality," Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, "were we not to recognize that 
this system falls with unequal weight on voters, as well as candidates, 
according to their economic status." 
</P>
<P>
 When we look at the workings of the wealth primary on the federal level -- the 
current campaign finance system for congressional candidates -- we find that 
it, too, "falls with unequal weight on voters, as well as candidates, according 
to their economic status." According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonprofit research group in Washington, 81% of all money raised for House and 
Senate races in 1992 came from less than 1% of the nation's population in 
amounts of at least $200. Beverly Hills, a community of 31,000, produced double 
the number of federal campaign contributions in 1992 as the entire city of San 
Diego, population 1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Private money serves as a decisive factor in the outcome of elections. In 388 
of 435 House races in 1992, the candidate who spent the most won. In the 36 
Senate races, 31 of the winners outspent their opponents. The costs of running 
for federal office have soared to the point that most people of average means 
cannot even contemplate candidacy. In 1992, a seat in the Senate cost, on 
average, $3.9 million to win; in the House, $543,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the constitutional questions about our campaign finance system have 
narrowly focused on the First Amendment rights of well-financed candidates and 
wealthy contributors. This is due, in large part, to a dubious 1976 Supreme 
Court decision holding that the expenditure of private money in elections 
deserved the strictest protection under the First Amendment, and that 
congressional limits on such expenditures were unconstitutional. It is time to 
pose a wholly new question: whether our campaign finance system comports with 
the requirements of the equal protection clause. When we pose this question, 
the wealth primary is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking down the wealth primary, however, does not necessarily require a 
reversal of the 1976 decision, though such a reversal ought to someday occur. 
Rather, for those shut out of the wealth primary, equal protection means, at 
minimum, a voluntary public financing system that makes their exclusion 
irrelevant to the overall electoral process. The purported First Amendment 
rights of those participating in the wealth primary would be unaffected; they 
could keep spending to the heavens. But, with a system of democratically 
financed elections in place, no longer would this exclusionary private process 
infringe on the rights of equal participation for citizens without wealth.

PLATFORM; RESCUING RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY ANN CONNELL is a writer in Cayucos, Calif. She commented on the 
Florida Citrus Commission's recent decision, after protests from the National 
Organization for Women, not to renew its contract to advertise on Rush 
Limbaugh's talk show. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put the man in context, and he has a universal appeal. We liberals listen to 
feel superior. His true believers listen because somebody finally understands 
them.Polar opposites are served by a single show. Another plus: He has put the 
elite Republicans on the spot as liberals never could. His television show is a 
particular kick, especially when cameras pan the audience full of pimply-faced 
white male Young Republicans clapping wildly at Rush's relentless 
self-promotion. An infomercial for conservatism -- or just as easily, for 
liberalism. The voice-over for the Democratic Party could say: "If this doesn't 
look like your kind of party, then join ours!" 
</P>
<P>
 National Review has implied that Limbaugh took over Ronald Reagan's role as 
the national voice for conservatism. Would that it were so. Limbaugh or Pat 
Buchanan -- who better to define conservatism than men who make Bob Dole come 
off as a cuddly old teddy bear? 
</P>
<P>
 What we liberals don't need is to shut down the one amusing conservative on 
the airwaves. Let's act big about free speech and bide our time until his 
left-wing equivalent comes along. Then, wait for all the Rush-lovers to roar. 
</P>
<P>
 If we look hard enough, we probably could find a witty, condom-wielding, 
homeless-loving broadcaster with a couple of failed marriages under her sizable 
belt. A mean liberal with a bad attitude. Now that would make good listening.

COLUMN RIGHT / JOSEPH FARAH: BEWARE OF DEMOCRATS' ZEALOTS; LEFT-WING 
FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE MORE REVERENCE FOR THE MOST OBSCURE PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
THAN THEY DO FOR HUMANITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH FARAH, Joseph Farah is editor of Inside California, a state political 
newsletter, and Dispatches, a national biweekly cultural watchdog publication. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some leading Democrats say they're concerned that right-wing fundamentalists 
are destroying the Republican Party. They have good cause to worry, of course. 
After all, politics wouldn't be much fun without organized opposition, would 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 But, somehow I don't share their anxiety. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that 
President Clinton, Rep. Vic Fazio, White House adviser Paul Begala, Democratic 
National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm and other top Democrats orchestrating 
the witch hunt against church-going Republicans are not more concerned about an 
internal threat to their own party. I'm talking about the growing power of 
left-wing fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-wing fundamentalism? You've never heard the term, you say? Of course not. 
That's the point. If you had heard about it, it wouldn't pose nearly the threat 
it does to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 What is left-wing fundamentalism and how does it manifest itself in the 
Democratic Party? Well, think about this. How else can one explain the way 
leaders of the party are compromising and subverting our constitutional right 
to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in favor of the singularly religious 
idea of protecting even the most obscure plant or animal? 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, thanks to the influence of left-wing fundamentalism, so-called 
crimes against the environment are today taken more seriously than crimes 
against humanity. While violent repeat felons walk the streets and prey on 
people in our inner cities, a Florida man was locked up for years for dumping a 
small truckload of builder's sand on a remote piece of private property 
designated as a so-called wetland. While convicted killers profit from their 
notoriety, a California farmer had his tractor seized, his property idled and 
his livelihood threatened after he inadvertently ran over a rare breed of rat. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't common sense at work here. Instead, it has all the earmarkings of a 
fanatical new religion, a new morality. What's emerging is a whole new value 
system, a completely new way of looking at the world. Its name is -- or should 
be -- left-wing fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the California Desert Protection Act, we're about to turn over a 
land mass roughly the size of the state of Maryland to the federal government 
to protect barren wilderness. Left-wing fundamentalists want to ensure that 
California's deserts remain deserts. Throughout the course of human history 
until this point, we have used our know-how and technology to make the deserts 
bloom. Now, these left-wing religious fanatics are imposing a new morality on 
us -- a morality that insists that the deserts must remain just as they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, these zealots are using the power of the state to force their will 
on the rest of us. The high priests of this new religion see the state as their 
savior. And the state, always willing to assume greater power, is only too 
eager to take the cue. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is left-wing fundamentalism's creed? It holds to be self-evident 
the untruth that there is no difference between a child, a tree and a rock. In 
fact, depending on the stage of the child's development, the tree and the rock 
may warrant more legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-wing fundamentalists seek to keep man out of any area that is not already 
developed. How far has this raw fanaticism gone? In the name of protecting the 
forests from man, federal managers have established vast "eco-systems" where 
Homo sapiens is not permitted to enter, even to put out a fire if it was 
started naturally. Do you see the religious aspect of this new value system? A 
forest fire is bad if it is started by man. If it is started by lightning, 
however, it's OK -- let it burn. Make no mistake, this is not about 
conservation. It's about Earth worship. 
</P>
<P>
 But left-wing fundamentalism has other doctrines, too. Don't discriminate 
between good behavior and bad. Don't make people feel bad about their 
self-defeating lifestyle choices. Don't teach children right from wrong. Nobody 
knows when life begins or ends. Compassion is measured by how much of other 
people's money you are willing to spend on social programs. Bigger government 
means better government. It's a religion that basically stands the 
Judeo-Christian tradition on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 As radical and extreme as this program sounds, it may be the best-kept secret 
in politics. Why? Because the focus has not been on left-wing fundamentalism in 
the Democratic Party, it was been on right-wing fundamentalism in the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton, Fazio, Begala and Wilhelm are going to start looking under beds 
for religious extremists, perhaps they should start with their own.

ADIOS TO ENCHILADAS? NO WAY, JOSE; HEALTH: THE NUTRITION MONKS WHO SAY MEXICAN 
FOOD CAN'T BE COOKED IN HEALTHFUL WAYS DIDN'T LOOK IN THE RIGHT PLACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUIS TORRES, Luis Torres is a reporter for KNX Radio in Los Angeles and he 
makes some mean, lean and healthful enchiladas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The health police want us to say adios to avocados and hasta la vista to 
fajitas. Mexican food kills. Or so the presumed guardians of the nation's 
health and nutritional good sense would have us believe. The perfectionists at 
the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest have released 
yet another study on what's bad for us. 
</P>
<P>
 Si. They're the same folks who told us that movie-house popcorn would choke 
off our arteries and send us to the nearest cardiac emergency ward. But popcorn 
was just one villain in a long and apparently unending enemies list of edibles. 
The nutritional monks at the center earlier warned us that Italian food such as 
fettucine alfredo and Chinese food such as kung pao chicken would also hasten 
our demise. 
</P>
<P>
 And now gastronomic public enemy numero uno is Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican food is swimming in heart-stopping fat and oozing with high caloric 
bad stuff such as pyramid-high dollops of sour cream. And there's no way, the 
sages of the center contend, to make Mexican food in a more healthful way and 
still have it be, well, Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, kiss my quesadillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans and Chicanos have been making reduced fat and low-sodium versions of 
our favorite traditional foods for a long time. We supplanted manteca (lard) 
with polyunsaturated oils and shortenings since before Fernando Valenzuela was 
a rookie. We eliminated salt since before the World Cup was held in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use the right combination of zesty chiles and fresh ingredients such as 
cilantro, you don't need salt for flavoring. And we use lots of fresh 
vegetables, from jicama to tomatillos. We do it partly because we're health 
conscious but mostly because our food is delicious that way. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know who the researchers at the center "studied," but it wasn't any 
Mexican or Chicano I know. Which brings me to another point. Lots of the food 
you encounter in "Mexican" restaurants is ersatz Mexican food. Gringoized stuff 
that my mother from Chihuahua wouldn't recognize. Some folks seem to think that 
if you just deep-fry something -- anything -- and put a futbol- sized scoop of 
sour cream on it, it's magically Mexican food. 'Taint so. 
</P>
<P>
 I never saw sour cream on Mexican food until as a teen-ager I walked into a 
restaurant owned by a guy who was raised in Brooklyn. And those grease- and 
cheese-covered monstrosities called nachos -- a tourist concoction masquerading 
as Mexican food if I ever saw one. I never heard of "deep-fried Mexican ice 
cream" until I saw I saw it on a TV commercial for a chain of pseudo-Mexican 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do the ascetics of the Center for Science in Who-Knows-Who's Interest 
eat? Dandelions and gerbil pellets?

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; 'TRICKLE-DOWN' REFORM WON'T DO; ANTICIPATING SKEPTICISM 
ABOUT THE AUG. 21 VOTE, SOME ARE PROPOSING AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH 
TRUE DEMOCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. BENSON, Robert W. Benson is a professor of law at Loyola Law 
School, Los Angeles. He has been an election observer in Mexico. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serious people in Mexico fear that the elections on Aug. 21 will be followed 
by widespread civil war. The Defense Ministry has bought anti-riot armored 
trucks and four attack helicopters from the United States, and has deployed 
several thousand troops to about 10 states, allegedly to pursue drug dealers. 
The weekly Processo reports that independent guerrilla groups are operating in 
the states of Puebla, Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, Michoacan and Guerrero. The Zapatista 
National Liberation Army in Chiapas has warned that it has guerrilla forces 
throughout Mexico and will resume fighting unless a peaceful mechanism is set 
in place for an immediate transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has run the government 
for 65 years, that mechanism is already in place: namely, the Aug. 21 
elections, to be conducted under reformed procedures and the scrutiny of 
nonpartisan witnesses. The election mechanism, however, is not likely to 
satisfy the guerrillas, nor even the Mexican public; 46.5% expect dishonest 
elections, according to an independent opinion survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI's electoral reforms were too little and too late to establish a level 
playing field. Moreover, the fraud that is likely to occur will take place 
where poll watchers cannot see: in the voter registration list and in the 
computerized vote count. Complaints are already pouring in about thousands of 
dead, fictional, duplicate or lost names on the registration list. And a 
Mexican computer expert has sought political asylum in Britain, alleging that 
he is under death threats for discovering government lies about the computer 
count from the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the PRI be so brazen as to rig the most closely scrutinized elections in 
Mexico's history? That would be only a small rabbit to pull out of the hat. The 
PRI has had 65 years of practice in fraudulent elections, and it is widely 
believed that a faction of the party assassinated presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio before the eyes of the world and got away with it. With enough 
smoke and mirrors on Aug. 21, and the certain support of a jittery Wall Street 
and the Clinton Administration (which could get a political lift from the 
anti-immigrant constituency by rushing troops to seal the border), the PRI 
could claim victory on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Then what happens on Aug. 23? 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists, academics and politicians in Mexico are worried. Political 
scientist Jorge Castaneda recently gathered about 30 of them from across the 
political spectrum for private discussions in his home about how to save Mexico 
from violence amid the ruins of a fraudulent election. They seem to be thinking 
of a coalition government of all the major parties, with respected independent 
politicians like Manuel Camacho Solis and Jorge Carpizo MacGregor playing 
important roles. 
</P>
<P>
 This "rescue by intellectuals" could work, but it smacks a little of a 
traditional back-room deal among elite power brokers. Ironically, it is the 
Zapatistas who have proposed the most legally and democratically legitimate way 
out of Mexico's troubles. They have called for all sectors of "civil society," 
-- meaning "non-governmental organizations, peasant and indigenous groups, 
workers, teachers, students, housewives, squatters, artists, intellectuals and 
members of independent political parties" -- to come together in a "national 
democratic convention" to form a transitional government and draft a new 
constitution to establish democracy. There is at least one noteworthy precedent 
for this idea: It occurred (though with much narrower interest-group 
representation) in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, analysts have missed the profoundly conservative nature of the 
Zapatista revolution. It has been called a "post-modern" revolution and "the 
first revolution of the 21st Century." In fact, it is a textbook 17th- or 
18th-Century revolution and is justified under Mexican and international law. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Zapatista Subcommander Marcos rested the rebellion on Article 
39 of the Mexican constitution, which states: "All public power emanates from 
the people and is established for the benefit of the people. The people have, 
at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify the form of their 
government." That provision is rooted in the 1690 "Essay on Government" by 
English philosopher John Locke. Locke wrote that it is the rulers who break the 
social contract and dissolve the government and who are guilty of rebellion 
when they hold fraudulent elections, coerce the legislature, fail to enforce 
the laws, take the people's property or reduce them to slavery. Sovereignty 
then "reverts to the society, and the people have a right to act as supreme, 
and continue the legislature in themselves, or erect a new form, or under the 
old form place it in new hands, as they think good." 
</P>
<P>
 To disagree with Locke is to disagree with the English Revolution of 1688 and 
the American Revolution of 1776, for he was the intellectual father of both. 
Article 39 of the Mexican constitution follows Locke. International law follows 
Locke. Evidence of election fraud and human-rights violations is so abundant in 
Mexico that it would be an easy case to argue that the government is violating 
with impunity the Mexican constitution, the United Nations' Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention 169 on 
Indigenous Peoples' Rights and customary international law. Under principles of 
international law established at Nuremberg after World War II, officials in the 
Salinas government could theoretically be prosecuted and Mexican citizens could 
be held to have not only a right but a duty to disobey the sitting government. 
Mexicans who covet peace and the rule of law should take quite seriously the 
proposal from the Zapatista National Liberation Army.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A WIDER NET FOR ANIMAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal lovers may be thrilled with Mission Viejo's state-of-the-art city 
animal control shelter, and no doubt the animals must be too. According to City 
Councilwoman Sharon Cody, the facility in less than one year of operation has 
spared more than 1,000 animals from being euthanized.  
</P>
<P>
 But in these tight budgetary times, emotion might not be enough to hold sway 
over the bottom line. The shelter has barely had time to work out the kinks, 
and still finds itself buffeted by the winds of local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that a $2.3-million facility for the city made a good deal more sense 
through the planning window of the optimistic 1980s than it does in this decade 
of retrenchment.  
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the future of the shelter has become a hot issue in the race 
for City Council. Some candidates are even talking about unloading a facility 
they say the city can ill afford to maintain at the current annual operating 
budget of $355,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, perhaps the city should have gone with a less ambitious project 
in the first place. However, it is not possible to turn back the clock. It 
makes sense now to look at what the facility might evolve into. Now that it is 
in place, this facility is well positioned to serve the sprawling new suburbs 
of the South County.  
</P>
<P>
 The existence of a corps of enthusiastic volunteers who supplement the work of 
the paid employees ought to suggest that there are broader possibilities for 
operating the facility than merely sticking the city with a huge annual cost 
for operation and upkeep.  
</P>
<P>
 Cody has the right idea. That is, to regionalize the facility so it serves the 
communities of San Clemente, Dana Point, Laguna Niguel and San Juan Capistrano 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While it appears that neighboring cities would initially pay more under such a 
system than they do by contracting with the county animal control department, 
it is possible that costs could be reduced as more cities joined. 
</P>
<P>
 They are certainly likely to get more for their money. If such a facility is 
able to better serve the region, it is worth trying to bring more communities 
into the fold.

ANALYSIS; ANGELS CONTENDING IN A PENNANT RACE THAT'S PRETENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems ludicrous. Take a glance at the American League West standings and 
what do you see? Aside from four teams with losing records, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, those really are the Angels (42-58) firmly entrenched in a playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so they're on a pace to lose more than 90 games for the third consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 So they're a season-low 16 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
 So their 58 losses are the second-most in the major leagues; the Padres have 
lost 62. 
</P>
<P>
 So every team in both the AL's East Division and Central Division has a better 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 So their pitching drops the ball far too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, the standings reveal that the Angels are within striking 
distance going into a nine-game stretch tonight against AL West rivals Oakland, 
Texas and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may seem laughable, far-fetched and simply too much to expect, the 
Angels could be in first place by the end of those nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by recent performances, this season has amounted to little more 
than a big tease. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week was a perfect example. The Angels swept three games from the Boston 
Red Sox, including a rare victory over longtime tormentor Roger Clemens. 
Spirits soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they were swept in four games by the New York Yankees. A pall enveloped 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees exposed all of the Angels' shortcomings, particularly their weak 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels as playoff contenders? After Sunday's 6-4 loss to New York it was a 
tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only concern is how we're playing," designated hitter Chili Davis said. "I 
don't look at the scoreboard. There's nothing we can do about teams we aren't 
playing. We're inconsistent. You have a series like we had against Boston, then 
you come back and have a series like this. I hate to admit it, but you look at 
a team like New York and they have a better team than we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann said closer Joe Grahe's role was in serious jeopardy. 
Mark Leiter appears to have the best shot at replacing Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up a three-run home run to Don Mattingly in the ninth inning 
Sunday, Grahe greeted reporters with gallows humor, wondering if Lachemann 
decided to walk off the field with him to shield him from bullets. He was 
smirking, not smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not on top of the mountain, but they haven't buried us yet," Grahe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the clubhouse, starter Mark Langston, whose strong 8 1/3 innings were 
wasted, shrugged off the day's disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the game of baseball," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, that's the Angels' brand of baseball in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly's homer marked the 17th consecutive game in which Angel pitchers had 
given up a homer. The staff's earned-run average is 5.39, one of the highest in 
the league. Among starters, only rookie Brian Anderson has a winning record, at 
6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Angels were forced to start Anderson and Andrew Lorraine, 
another talented but raw rookie, in consecutive games against New York. The 
results were predictable; the Angels were soundly beaten twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees said they didn't think much of Lorraine's stuff, didn't believe he 
was ready for the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Langston and Chuck Finley -- expected to be the backbone of the 
rotation and indeed the team -- haven't found the form that carried them to 16 
victories apiece last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Angel offense isn't exactly making anyone forget the 1927 Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Davis, who is having another excellent year with a team-leading 
.335 average, 21 home runs and 70 runs batted in, there isn't much punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds, a rookie-of-the-year candidate, has been the most surprising 
performer among position players. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson limps around with an artificial hip, gamely playing against all 
medical odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon has been slowed by a pulled hamstring. Chad Curtis and Damion 
Easley have been criticized by batting coach Rod Carew for trying to be 
sluggers when they should be hitting singles. 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, riding a career-best 10-game hitting streak, finally seems to have 
emerged from a prolonged run of disappointment following his eye-catching April 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Depth is a problem, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we could contend in any division in baseball," rookie General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said during spring training. "But believe me, I know we're 
good enough to contend in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is still true, but the Angel clubhouse was hardly overflowing 
with confidence the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, players spent as much time carping about the Anaheim Stadium crowd's 
support of the Yankees as they did discussing their future in the divisional 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were playing some song and the cheers for the Yankees drowned out the 
music," Davis said. "(The fans) came in our stadium with brooms. You would not 
do that in New York or Boston or Candlestick (Park in San Francisco). Someone 
would take that broom and . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's almost like they're cheering against us. I'll tell you, when 
we do win here, it will be for the Angels and the people who work with us and 
for us. When I sign autographs, I look to see who has a Yankee shirt on and (if 
so, I say,) 'You're not going to get one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly got his 2,000th career hit and Davis his 1,000th RBI Saturday night, 
but Mattingly received a longer, warmer ovation from the crowd of 29,354. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like that ever since I've been here," Davis said. "It's weird, but 
I don't expect anything different. I don't care about ovations. I (reached 
1,000 RBIs) and I'm proud of it. I never needed acceptance before and I don't 
need it now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just go out and play our butts off. (It would) be nice to see a little 
more support." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, attendance is off by 121,598 at Anaheim Stadium. After 52 home 
games, the Angels are drawing an average of 24,722, compared with 27,060 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, the Angels will begin perhaps one last run at the top 
of the division when they play host to the Athletics tonight. And no matter how 
unlikely it seems, no matter how much the Angels may appear to be overmatched, 
anything is possible in the AL West.

CLIPPERS RENEGE ON WEISS' PAY; NBA: FIRED COACH IS OWED $1.2 MILLION, BUT TEAM 
IS REFUSING TO PAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fired Clipper Coach Bob Weiss, scheduled to receive $1.2 million over the next 
two seasons as completion of his contract, is no longer being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers wouldn't comment directly on the matter, but Joe Safety, Clipper 
spokesman, indirectly confirmed the situation by calling it "an internal 
personnel matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers refused to discuss reasons for their stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who was fired May 16 with two years left on a three-year contract that 
paid him a reported $600,000 per season, refused comment. Lonnie Cooper, Weiss' 
agent, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Commissioner David Stern has been asked to resolve the dispute and the NBA 
Coaches Assn. is also monitoring the situation because of implications it could 
have for other coaches owed money after being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 After making the playoffs two seasons in a row under Coach Larry Brown, the 
Clippers missed postseason play last season and finished with the NBA's seventh 
worst record (27-55) under Weiss. They lost 20 of their final 29 games, 
including a 49-point loss at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who gave up 71 points to San Antonio center David Robinson in a 
season-ending loss to the Spurs, had the worst defense in the NBA, allowing an 
average of 108.7 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were hurt by internal dissension before trading disgruntled 
All-Star forward Danny Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have been without a coach for 71 days, have interviewed 
former Laker Coach Randy Pfund and former Minnesota Timberwolves Coach Bill 
Musselman, but say there is no leading candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Clippers have failed to make a lump sum option buyout payment 
of $600,000 to forward John Williams, who was waived last month. Under the 
terms of Williams' contract, he was due to receive the money on July 15 if the 
Clippers didn't renew his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers maintain that Williams, who weighed a reported 302 pounds at the 
end of the season, breached his contract because he wasn't fit to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we haven't gotten any formal letter or explanation, we don't know why 
(the Clippers haven't paid Williams)," said Fred Slaughter, Williams agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety said the Clippers notified Williams in writing, but declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn., 
said the league has been notified that a grievance will be filed on behalf of 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was due to be paid $1.1 million last season, lost $563,414.62 
after being suspended for the first 42 games of the season while he was at the 
Duke weight loss clinic. Williams, who reportedly weighed 325 pounds when he 
entered the clinic, weighed 270 pounds when he rejoined the team. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he couldn't maintain the weight loss and, after being activated Feb. 
4, averaged a career low 5.6 points in 34 games.

JIM MURRAY: IN CLUTCH, MOORER PROVES LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had an interview -- of sorts -- with the heavyweight champion of the world 
the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll give you a clue: His initials are M.M. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not Riddick Lewis or Evander Bowe or Lennox Holyfield or some guy 
named Tony Something-or-Other or whatever their names are. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he has a number of initials after his name to tell you what 
jurisdiction he's champion of. These days, you get a champion of the Upper 
Volta River or the heavyweight champion of South Texas. Heavyweight champs used 
to come one-to-a-generation. Now, they'd fill a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the M.M. doesn't stand for Manassa Mauler II. This M.M. stands for Michael 
Moorer and he's heavyweight champion -- let's see, I have to go look this up. 
Ah! Here it is . . . of the WBA and IBF! 
</P>
<P>
 This champ is going to defend his titles against a guy who was champion of the 
whole world, not alphabetized, back in the days when Nixon was President, "The 
Godfather" was movie of the year and Moorer was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavyweight championship has been broken up in so many jurisdictions, it 
resembles the Balkans. A Brit, the Right Honourable Lennox Lewis, O.B.E., is 
the WBC (World Boxing Council) champion, thanks to the fact the holder of that 
bauble, the commoner Riddick Bowe, tossed it and the belt that came with it 
into a trash can rather then defend it against Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 5, George Foreman is scheduled to fight Moorer for a title he lost 20 
years ago. He may be the first heavyweight challenger in history to climb into 
the ring wearing bifocals. If he had any, his hair would be gray. He can tell 
if it's going to rain by his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be almost 47 years of age the night of the fight. Now, at 47, a man 
should be able to play golf, checkers, maybe doubles tennis, shuffleboard, gin 
rummy and Scrabble and probably even bowl -- but fight for the heavyweight 
championship? I mean, I didn't think boxing had a senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine a 47-year-old man fighting the young Joe Louis? Get in the 
ring with Jack Dempsey when he was champ, would he? At 47, the heavy bag should 
be even money against you. And Foreman will be within a few weeks of that age 
when he meets Moorer at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind, Muhammad Ali beat George when he, George, was only 27, and you 
get some notion of the parlous nature of pugilism these days. 
</P>
<P>
 I had in mind to ask the once and future champion, Moorer, why this geriatric 
turn of events? Michael was not in the most congenial of moods when I saw him. 
The wages of fame were weighing heavily on him. The news conference with 
Foreman had gone badly. George had treated him as an upstart, an attitude known 
in the 'hood as "dissing." Now, I was interrupting his afternoon nap. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael thought our interview could be conducted by phone, but since I was in 
the lobby of the hotel and had driven some miles to get there, I thought a 
four-floor elevator trip was not too much to ask. Michael appeared, reluctantly 
and irritated. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Foreman? I wanted to know. Why not Lennox Lewis? Riddick Bowe? 
</P>
<P>
 "We did try to fight Lewis," Moorer said resentfully. "But he wanted a rematch 
clause in case he lost. What kind of confidence does that show?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's manager, John Davemos, turned Lewis' proposal down. 
</P>
<P>
 What abut Bowe? 
</P>
<P>
 "What about him?" Moorer asked. "I think we have to see what happens. He lost 
to Holyfield, and I beat Holyfield. He has to earn his way back. Sure, I'll 
fight him. I'll fight anybody. I've never been beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that one of his goals? To become the only heavyweight champion besides 
Rocky Marciano to retire undefeated? Was Rocky a champ he looked up to? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never followed heavyweights," Moorer said. "My favorite fighter was 
(middleweight) Marvin Hagler." 
</P>
<P>
 Why Hagler? 
</P>
<P>
 "A determined guy," Moorer said. "A hard guy. A guy you could emulate." 
</P>
<P>
 But won't taking on a soon-to-be-47 opponent be more of a mugging than a 
contest? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll fight whomever," Moorer said irritably. "I defended my light-heavyweight 
title nine times. Is this going somewhere?" 
</P>
<P>
 What was his most difficult fight? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all difficult," Moorer allowed. "Foreman will be difficult. What'd 
you say your name was again?" 
</P>
<P>
 I told him, never mind. "I'm just a fan," I lied.

DRAYTON COMES ON STRONG OVER WEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scowl on Troy Drayton's face reflected how the Ram tight end felt about 
being likened recently to "The Fridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a joke, Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not funny," Drayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although admittedly angry, Drayton sat down for an interview at the Rams' UC 
Irvine training camp, and the chair did not break. 
</P>
<P>
 A while back, the planet had tipped in Drayton's direction, but as he was 
quick to point out Monday, he is now only three pounds over his playing weight 
of 257 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a plan," Drayton said. "My plan was to come in as strong as I could, 
and to get strong I had to put on a little weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton's get-fat plan, however, initially had the Ram coaches concerned. 
Starting tight end Pat Carter already had defected to Houston, and at the 
opening of mini-camp, Drayton was looking like a wanna-be Sumo wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches panicked," Drayton said. "I told them not to worry, I go through 
this every year, but they checked up on me so much that it upset me. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can move when I'm 10 pounds overweight, I know I'm going to be quicker 
when I start cutting the weight. I do it every off-season. I was adding muscle 
and I was getting bigger. I grew an inch, too. I'm 6-3 1/2 now." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton took two weeks off after last season and then began working out six 
days a week, four hours a day in Malibu with a personal trainer. No breaks, no 
vacation, no eating binges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever want to be a person where they say, 'Troy had the potential to 
be this or that but never got it done.' I know I have to seize my opportunity, 
and my opportunity is now." 
</P>
<P>
 During practice, Drayton spends time with the offensive tackles learning what 
they know. He can tell you what Jackie Slater is doing most every minute of the 
day because Slater knows what Drayton needs to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never told him, but I just watch him," Drayton said. "I mean I watch him 
when he's not in and he's back there practicing and going through it mentally. 
I see that and I'm thinking maybe I should do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton, who drew praise from former Charger tight end Kellen Winslow last 
season, will be asked to block and catch this season. The extra muscle gained 
in bulking up during the off-season will be used to pave the way for Jerome 
Bettis, as Carter did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carter's a big loss, but it's not a void we can't fill," Drayton said. "He 
taught me so much and he's with me everyday because I have film of him to watch 
whenever I need it. I kinda wish I had another year under Pat, but now I want 
to show the Rams what he taught me." 
</P>
<P>
 Having Drayton play the role of thug to block for Bettis is akin to asking Ken 
Griffey Jr. to bunt. Doesn't make sense, but the Rams claim they will utilize 
Drayton's best skills and throw him the ball. In early workouts, indeed, he has 
proved to be one of quarterback Chris Miller's most reliable targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be a Pro Bowl player this year," Drayton said. "I want to catch 
60 passes and score maybe 10 touchdowns. With most of my goals, if I don't make 
them, I come pretty close." 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, he also might be in the running for comeback player of the year 
honors. After being selected in the second round of the draft last season from 
Penn State, the Rams reacted as if he were academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to China, would you be able to speak Chinese right away?" said 
Chick Harris, offensive coordinator. "There are so many things to learn when 
you're just coming out of college and being asked to play at another level." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton didn't catch on, however, and the Rams had little patience for his 
wayward pass-running routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lost soul at times, and running around like a chicken with its head 
cut off," he said. "And I honestly felt people didn't think I was bright enough 
to pick all that up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I came out of Penn State with its basic offense to Ernie Zampese's 
complex offense and was asked to learn three positions. I was trying. If 
everyone else had a meeting at 8, I had a meeting at 7:30 with Coach (Mike) 
Martz to prepare for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much you study, though, you're not always sure in the 
beginning, and that makes you hesitant. But then things started to click in the 
middle of the season, and I think I showed what I can do in the latter part." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton caught 27 passes last season -- 14 in the team's last five games. In 
the Rams' new passing attack, which has a San Francisco look to it, the tight 
end will have the chance to become a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy can be a force," Harris said. "We're going to have to make sure we have 
a nice package for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Rams had one play -- a nice play -- for Drayton: "Fake pitch 
right Y screen." The offensive linemen fell down at the line of scrimmage, the 
quarterback faked a pitch to Bettis and Drayton ran free to the left to catch a 
screen pass. The play resulted in two touchdowns and nearly a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the ball in my hands as much as possible," Drayton said. "If I catch 
the ball, I know one of two things are going to happen: I'm going to score or 
it's going to be a big play." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about blocking? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a little shocking," he said. "I'm going to have to go up against a 
lot of defensive ends this year and most of them will outweigh me." 
</P>
<P>
 Get out of here.

THIS EX-TROJAN A TRUE REBEL WITH A CAUSE; RAMS: AFTER BEING CUT BY THE COLTS, 
LINEMAN SCHULTZ IS OUT TO WIN A JOB, NOT A POPULARITY CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Meet Bill Schultz, the Ram offensive lineman with the Mohawk haircut, goatee 
and surly disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the Indianapolis Colts weren't impressed. They cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it was due to me making so much money," Schultz said. "But I think 
the coaching staff just didn't like me very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a couple of the guys tell me to cut the tail off," Schultz said, 
"and I've just looked at them and told them to kiss . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Four years in Indianapolis before the Colts cut him? 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a place on the team I shouldn't have to kiss . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 First impressions sometimes can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to see a mean . . . . on the field," Schultz said. "If I'm 
going to run-block somebody, I'm going to put them on their . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 What about reporters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to impress anyone, I'm here to do a job," he said. "I'll wear 
the same set of clothing all month. I don't care. I'm not here to smell good. 
I've got one job and that's to play well on the football field. If I stink, 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Future interviews, of course, will be conducted by phone, but while the winds 
are blowing right, there still is time to learn: 
</P>
<P>
 -- William Schultz, reared in Granada Hills, and starting left tackle for USC 
in the 1990 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forced into action against Lawrence Taylor in Schultz's rookie season for 
the Colts. "Held the hell out of him, and he called me every name in the book," 
Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owns a Corvette and a Harley Davidson -- each with the license plate 
MOHAWK. Is superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Blamed his release in Indianapolis on fact he shaved his head bald. Credits 
his good fortune in joining the Rams on fact he switched to a Mohawk cut day 
before team signed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very superstitious," he said. "I put my left sock on first before every 
game, write my grandmother's name on my wrist tape before putting on my gloves, 
walk on the field to see how my shoes feel before putting on my pads and then 
throw up once or twice." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Becomes upset when told he looks odd, and downright angry when puny 
sportswriters ask if he owns a mirror and ever uses it. "I thought about 
cutting my hair off and coming in like everybody else, but I'm not like 
everybody else. I'm one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like him. "If you got four earrings, I don't give a damn," offensive 
line coach Jim Erkenbeck said. "I kind of like the Mohawk. Individuality. This 
guy can play. He volunteered to play left tackle for us. He wants to make this 
team, will make this team, and is glad to be back in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like him so much, they plan to move him to left guard, challenging 
Tom Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I like I am?" Schultz said. "I've got a great chance here. I could not 
go out tomorrow and get a job paying me the money I make. A lot of people in 
this game don't seem to understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all friends now . . . on the field we're not friends. I got cut, and 
for the first month I didn't leave my house. You're nothing suddenly . . . 
you're not anything special. I thought it was all over for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not over yet. Schultz is back on the job -- and a good training camp away 
from regaining full-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose a job and it makes you see the light," Schultz said. "I'm going to 
bust my . . . "

KEENAN CALLS NHL'S PENALTIES FAIR; HOCKEY: TWO-MONTH SUSPENSION, HEAVY FINES DO 
NOTHING TO SOUR MOOD OF ST. LOUIS COACH AND GENERAL MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Keenan, cleared by the NHL to become coach and general manager of the 
Blues, returned to St. Louis on Monday, sounding not at all like a man who had 
lost $500,000 in fines and penalties and suspended for two months without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fantastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours of talks Sunday in New York at the office of NHL 
commissioner Gary Bettman, a settlement was reached in the dispute involving 
Keenan, his former team, the New York Rangers, and his new one, the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman suspended Keenan for 60 days beginning Monday, fined him $100,000, and 
ordered him to return four-fifths of his $500,000 signing bonus with the 
Rangers, whom he coached last season to their first Stanley Cup title in 54 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues were fined $250,000, the league maximum. The Detroit Red Wings, who 
tried to hire Keenan before he agreed to terms with the Blues, were fined 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 New York also was fined $25,000 for filing a lawsuit to keep Keenan from 
signing with St. Louis. And the Rangers agreed to drop the lawsuit and pay 
Keenan the $608,000 playoff bonus that set off the whole chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, who took over as commissioner in 1993, had stern words for all three 
teams involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such conduct cannot and will not be tolerated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Monday, Blues president Jack Quinn said Bettman "wanted 
to kind of set a tone as the new guy in town, the new sheriff, as to how things 
were going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan called the settlement fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bettman did a fabulous job bringing the parties together and resolving 
this situation," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great deal of respect for him and what he was able to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all achieved the objective we set out to accomplish, and that was for me 
to be here in St. Louis," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan declared himself a free agent July 15 when the Rangers were a day late 
with the bonus payment. He signed with the Blues two days later, prompting the 
Rangers' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues and Rangers settled their differences Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams agreed to a trade that sent center Petr Nedved to New York for Esa 
Tikkanen and Doug Lidster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving up a player who turns 30 in December (Tikkanen) for a player 
who's 22 years of age," Smith said. "I think down the road (Nedved) could be a 
120-, 130-point guy -- 150 if they keep extending the schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said the trade helps both teams. "They bring depth to the organization, 
which I hink the Blues need," he said. "And the Rangers are getting a young 
player who will be surrounded by champions. Maybe that will help his 
development."

OLYMPIC OFFICIAL SCHILLER JOINS TURNER; BROADCASTING: USOC HAD EXPECTED ITS 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO STAY THROUGH THE YEAR 2000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While preparing a contract that would have retained Harvey Schiller as its 
executive director through 2000, the U.S. Olympic Committee was forced to 
interrupt that process Monday to begin searching for someone else to fill the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Turner Broadcasting System, here for the Goodwill Games, 
announced that Schiller will join them Oct. 1 as president of Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Turner Sports a "giant in the industry," Schiller said from his office 
in Colorado Springs, Colo., that he has been discussing a role with company 
officials off and on for three years and they recently agreed that the timing 
for serious negotiations was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've developed a lot of comfort with what we were doing at the USOC, not only 
financially but organizationally, and I felt it was the right thing for me at 
this time to look at other opportunities," Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller, one of two finalists for the job as Major League Baseball 
commissioner before the search was put on hold earlier this year, will oversee 
the acquisition and production of sports programming on the TBS Superstation, 
TNT and regional cable network SportSouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Turner's current sports broadcast properties are the Goodwill Games and 
the Atlanta Braves plus events on the NBA, NFL, PGA Tour, NASCAR and 
professional wrestling schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner sources said Schiller, who once worked as a boxing commentator for TBS, 
signed a four-year contract that will almost double the reported $275,000 
annual salary he earned with the USOC. He is replacing Terence McGuirk, who now 
will focus on his other duties as Turner Broadcasting's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USOC has lost a great leader in Harvey Schiller," USOC President LeRoy 
Walker said. "It's our expectation that we will hear from a large group of 
talented and capable individuals about this position." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources within the USOC said that the organization's assistant executive 
director, John Krimsky, probably will be asked to assume Schiller's duties 
after Oct. 1 on an interim basis and might at some point be offered a full-time 
contract through the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates likely to emerge if there is a search include Dick Schultz, 
former NCAA executive director; Jerry Lace, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. executive 
director; Mike Jacki, U.S. Skiing executive director, and Dave Maggard, former 
University of California athletic director now an official with Atlanta's 
Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG). 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller will resign as a member of ACOG's board of directors and executive 
committee, positions he held in his role as the USOC's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 It was less clear how Monday's announcement might impact Schiller's desire to 
become a member of the International Olympic Committee. Some within the USOC 
were against his appointment to the position, which will be filled by the IOC 
this summer, because they believed it would conflict with his responsibilities 
to the USOC. That obstacle has been removed, but USOC sources were split on 
whether that would enhance his candidacy. "It's up to others to make that 
decision," Schiller said. "I certainly would stand ready to serve if asked." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly five years that Schiller was with the USOC, the organization 
underwent restructuring to become a more efficient business, greatly increased 
its operating budget -- including the amount it spends on athletes -- and 
assisted in Atlanta's winning bid for the '96 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also was tainted by an independent counsel's report that he used his 
influence to seek equipment and ski passes from U.S. Skiing, which he said was 
a misunderstanding, and was criticized for the lack of minority representation 
among the USOC's senior executives, as well as for his role in the USOC's 
indecisiveness regarding figure skater Tonya Harding before the 1994 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely comfortable with the job I did, and I think the USOC is, too, 
or they wouldn't have voted to extend my contract until 2000," Schiller said. 
"My commitment has been to excellence in sports, and I hope that's the legacy 
that remains."

POSTCARD; SOME HISTORIC DIGS FOR THE VOLLEYBALL EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Constructed in 1703 to secure Russia's hold on the Neva River delta, the Peter 
and Paul Fortress is said by some historians to have inspired Peter the Great 
to build his magnificent Window to the West, St. Petersburg, around it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peter and Paul Cathedral within the walls is revered by monarchists 
because it is the burial site for the Romanovs. The body of one member of the 
royal family, Grand Duke George, recently was exhumed for tests to determine 
whether the remains discovered in a pit in nearby Yekaterinburg belonged to his 
cousins, Czar Nicholas II and Alexandra. If so, their bodies will be buried in 
the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peter and Paul Fortress is also notorious as Russia's Bastille, a prison 
where opponents of the Romanovs -- from Peter's own son, Czarevich Alexey to 
Lenin's brother, Alexander Ulyanov, to Dostoyevsky -- were incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 One can almost feel their misery and hear their cries on a tour of their 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Insistent upon somehow using the Peter and Paul Fortress as part of the 
Goodwill Games, organizers studied the sports and determined that the perfect 
match was -- what else? -- beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 If Grand Duke George were still in his mausoleum, he no doubt would have 
turned over in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it is not such an odd coupling because there is a beach on the Neva 
River just outside the fortress walls. Attracting hundreds of sunbathers during 
the summer, it is not abandoned even during the winter, when foolhardy 
citizens, known as walruses, crack holes in the frozen river and swim in 
sub-zero temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not as if the ground within the walls was sacred. One of the first 
structures seen upon entering the main gate is a small tourist shop that 
specializes in superimposing one's photograph onto a T-shirt. There are several 
other kiosks that sell souvenirs, including a comb inscribed, "From Siberia 
with Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Management has attempted to maintain decorum. A sign outside the fortress 
reminds visitors that it is prohibited to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ride a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Play musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walk upon the roofs of bastions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ski or sled (in wintertime). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walk naked or wear bathing suits only (in summertime). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scatter rubbish. RANDY HARVEY

ANALYSIS; THERE ARE FEW ANGELS IN THIS OUTFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems ludicrous. Take a glance at the American League West standings and 
what do you see? Aside from four teams with losing records, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, those really are the Angels (42-58) firmly entrenched in a playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so they're on a pace to lose more than 90 games for the third consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 So they're a season-low 16 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
 So their 58 losses are the second-most in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 So every team in both the AL's East Division and Central Division has a better 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 So their pitching drops the ball far too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, the standings reveal that the Angels are within striking 
distance going into a nine-game stretch tonight against AL West rivals Oakland, 
Texas and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it might seem laughable, far-fetched and simply too much to expect, 
the Angels could be in first place by the end of those nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by recent performances, this season has amounted to little more 
than a big tease. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week was a perfect example. The Angels swept three games from the Boston 
Red Sox, including a rare victory over longtime tormentor Roger Clemens. 
Spirits soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they were swept in four games by the New York Yankees. A pall enveloped 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees exposed all of the Angels' shortcomings, particularly their weak 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels as playoff contenders? After Sunday's 6-4 loss to New York, it was 
a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only concern is how we're playing," designated hitter Chili Davis said. "I 
don't look at the scoreboard. There's nothing we can do about teams we aren't 
playing. We're inconsistent. You have a series like we had against Boston, then 
you come back and have a series like this. I hate to admit it, but you look at 
a team like New York and they have a better team than we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann said closer Joe Grahe's role was in jeopardy. Mark 
Leiter appears to have the best shot at replacing Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up a three-run home run to Don Mattingly in the ninth inning 
Sunday, Grahe greeted reporters with gallows humor, wondering if Lachemann 
decided to walk off the field with him to shield him from bullets. He was 
smirking, not smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not on top of the mountain, but they haven't buried us yet," Grahe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the clubhouse, starter Mark Langston, whose strong 8 1/3 innings were 
wasted, shrugged off the day's disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the game of baseball," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, that's the Angels' game of baseball in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly's homer marked the 17th consecutive game in which Angel pitchers had 
given up a homer. The staff's earned-run average is 5.39, one of the highest in 
the league. Among starters, only rookie Brian Anderson has a winning record, at 
6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Angels were forced to start Anderson and Andrew Lorraine, 
another talented but raw rookie, in consecutive games against New York. The 
results were predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees said they didn't think much of Lorraine's stuff, didn't believe he 
was ready for the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Langston and Chuck Finley -- expected to be the backbone of the 
rotation and indeed the team -- haven't found the form that carried them to 16 
victories apiece last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Angel offense isn't exactly making anyone forget the 1927 Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Davis, who is having another excellent year with a team-leading 
.335 average, 21 home runs and 70 runs batted in, there isn't much punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds, a rookie-of-the-year candidate, has been the most surprising 
performer among position players. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson limps around with an artificial hip, gamely playing against all 
medical odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon has been slowed by a pulled hamstring. Chad Curtis and Damion 
Easley have been criticized by batting coach Rod Carew for trying to be 
sluggers when they should be hitting singles. 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, riding a career-best 10-game hitting streak, finally seems to have 
emerged from a prolonged run of disappointment following his eye-catching April 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, players spent as much time carping about the Anaheim Stadium crowd's 
support of the Yankees as they did discussing their future in the divisional 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's almost like they're cheering against us," Davis said. "I'll 
tell you, when we do win here, it will be for the Angels and the people who 
work with us and for us. When I sign autographs, I look to see who has a Yankee 
shirt on and (if so, I say,) 'You're not going to get one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly got his 2,000th career hit and Davis his 1,000th RBI Saturday night, 
but Mattingly received a longer, warmer ovation from the crowd of 29,354. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, attendance is off by 121,598 at Anaheim Stadium. After 52 home 
games, the Angels are drawing an average of 24,722, compared with 27,060 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, the Angels will begin perhaps one last run at the top 
of the division when they play host to the Athletics tonight. Anything is 
possible in the AL West.

JOURNEYMAN TAKES A RIGHT TURN DOWN COACHING ROUTE; BASKETBALL: FORMER LAKER 
MCNAMARA, WHO IS GUIDING TWO ROOKIE LEAGUE TEAMS, FINDS HE HAS KNACK FOR JOB.

 It took Mark McNamara nine stops in eight NBA seasons to realize he had 
learned more about the league than just how to survive in it. More than how to 
put a body on Moses Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and David Robinson in practice. 
More than how to keep himself mentally and physically ready to play in case of 
an injury to a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After awhile, I started to become pretty decent with all the different 
systems," McNamara said. "I saw a lot of different coaching philosophies. All 
of sudden, I said, 'Geez, I know a lot about NBA basketball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before NBA people realized the same thing. George Karl, who had 
coached for Cleveland and Golden State, asked McNamara to be a player/coach for 
his Real Madrid team in Spain. The next year, Matt Goukas, then coach of the 
Orlando Magic, asked if McNamara would show his new big man -- a guy named Shaq 
-- a thing or two about playing the post in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 And suddenly, someone who had never considered coaching began looking at the 
profession in an entirely different light. And now, two years after his 
retirement as a player, McNamara, 35, is coaching two rookie league teams in 
the ASICS Summer Pro league at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last week, McNamara spent 10 hours at the Bren Center coaching and 
scouting. The next day, his two teams -- ASICS and XTRA -- played back-to-back 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "About halfway through the second game, I said, 'Uh-oh, I have a bad 
headache,' " McNamara said. "I almost called out the wrong team's plays. In the 
last three or four weeks, I've seen a lot of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Musselman, coach and general manager of the Continental Basketball 
Assn.'s Rapid City Thrillers, hired McNamara last week to be one of his 
assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Though McNamara's ASICS team is 4-1 and in the playoffs this week, McNamara 
won't be there. He's with Musselman on a scouting trip back east, looking at 
talent for the upcoming CBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Musselman normally doesn't hire former players as coaches, but he said 
McNamara was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reluctant to hire him because he played, and sometimes players have had 
enough of the game," Musselman said. "You want to be around people who really 
want to coach, who have a love for the game. And the biggest thing with me is 
commitment. I saw that in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Musselman also saw what kinds of players and coaches McNamara had been around 
throughout his vagabond career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been around people like Dr. J and Magic -- winners," Musselman said. 
"The thing that interested me the most, though, were the coaches he's played 
for: Billy Cunningham, Pat Riley. He also believes in the CBA and I do, too. 
You don't want somebody here who doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he hired him, Musselman made sure McNamara wasn't going to hang around 
for half a season and then leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's great about Mark is he doesn't want to be a head coach right 
away," Musselman said. "Most players want to be handed an NBA coaching job 
without paying any dues. I get the idea Mark will stay here and tell players 
what to do to get to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara became an expert at knowing how to stay at the NBA level -- he just 
wasn't great at staying in place for long periods of time. His stint with the 
Lakers, in 1989 and 1990, was the longest he spent with one team. 
</P>
<P>
 After being the Philadelphia 76ers' first-round pick in 1982 out of Cal, 
McNamara spent a championship season there before going to San Antonio, Kansas 
City and Milwaukee for parts of seasons. From there, the 6-foot-11 backup 
center went to Milwaukee, Italy, Spain, back to Philadelphia in 1987, the 
Lakers in '88 and finally in 1992 to Orlando, where he tutored O'Neal during 
the preseason before being released prior to the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara says his NBA career might have been different had he not seriously 
injured his back during his second year. Before his injury, he was starting at 
center for San Antonio and averaging 5.5 points with a season- and career-high 
of 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some decent jump before that," McNamara said. "But I lost six or eight 
inches after that. I should have been out of the league after that. But I 
learned I had to be fundamentally sound because I wasn't as strong or as quick 
as everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 So after being released by Milwaukee, McNamara practiced his moves during a 
two-year stint with Cortan, an Italian team. He averaged 15.4 points with 
Cortan in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know something well, you look quicker than you are," McNamara said. 
"I had good first moves. I had adjusted my game to lesser physical ability and 
I felt confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was McNamara becoming a student of low post moves, he was becoming a 
student of the NBA play book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned into a journeyman, a guy you could bring in because he learned the 
plays quicker than most and had a good attitude," McNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until Karl asked if he would work with his big men on the Real 
Madrid team that McNamara discovered he had a knack for coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had no aspirations at all," McNamara said. "But I worked with a lot 
of the guys and showed them my moves. Then, all of a sudden a guy would use a 
move and it worked. He'd come over and say, 'Thanks for teaching me that.' I 
said, 'Wow, I like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next fall, McNamara showed those same moves to Shaquille O'Neal during and 
after practice. O'Neal and McNamara would often play one-on-one for an hour 
after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the first 10 minutes of playing with him, I knew he had the potential 
to be one of a kind," McNamara said. "I'd played with Moses, Kareem and David 
Robinson, and I saw he could be better than them. He's an amazing physical 
specimen and he takes advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara also was impressed that O'Neal was such a great listener. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first preseason game, he had nine turnovers in the first half because 
he wasn't reacting to the double-teams," McNamara said. "But we showed him what 
to do at the half. He relaxed and didn't make another turnover. Now, I think he 
has the best moves of anybody. He just needs to finish them off with a jumper." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara won't be teaching players with O'Neal's ability this season in the 
CBA, but he will be happy when one of his players uses a McNamara move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about this," said McNamara, who is also trying to complete the 
construction on his house in Capitola, outside of Santa Cruz. "I have a ton of 
respect for coaches. Being a player doesn't make you a coach. You have to learn 
how to become a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 If McNamara learns how to coach as well as he learned how to play, he could be 
coaching a long time.

OP PRO SEEKS FORMER PRESTIGE, POPULARITY; SURFING: HUNTINGTON BEACH EVENT, 
WHICH BEGINS TODAY, DROPS TEAM CONCEPT AND RETURNS TO INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION 
ONLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning today, the waves just south of the Huntington Beach pier will belong 
to the world's best professional surfers and another 200 who would like to join 
those ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op Pro surfing championship returns for its 13th year and, in an attempt 
to recover its prestige and popularity, it is going back to its original 
format. The annual event consistently attracted the top competitors for a 
decade before 1992, when it switched to a team surfing format. Last year, it 
featured both team and individual competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's back to individual competition only this time around, as it again 
becomes a four-star event on the Assn. of Surfing Professional's world 
championship qualifying tour, a position it lost with the format change two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $70,000 in prize money, the Op Pro serves as a warm-up to 
the U.S. Open of Surfing, scheduled Aug. 2-7 at Huntington Beach. The top three 
finishers at the Op Pro who did not qualify last year for the tour, will gain 
entry to the U.S. Open, a $140,000 stop on the world championship tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the Op Pro's format reversal and the U.S. Open proved 
powerful enough to entice former stars back to the beach here. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are three-time world champion Tom Curren, who also has won three Op 
Pro titles. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara native who now lives in Biarritz, France, Curren travels eight 
months of the year, filming surf videos for his sponsor. He also has two 
children and a budding music career to keep him busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Op and the ASP offered Curren an invitation that would allow him to skip 
the Op trial rounds and assure him a spot in the U.S. Open. He also received 
another invitation -- from his mother, who is getting married locally around 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the very first heat of the first Op Pro," Curren said. "It was 
Dennis Jarvis and Mark Richards. I remember one of them took off on a wave. He 
went through the pier and the whole beach just roared." 
</P>
<P>
 Curren finished fifth that year, but came back to win the next two. He won 
again in 1988 and finished second to Richie Collins of Newport Beach in 1989. 
The 1991 contest was his last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the Op Pro," he said. "It's a great venue. The waves 
can be pretty disappointing, but the crowd is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's said to be crowd- and camera-shy, Curren appreciates the Op Pro 
for its impact on others, especially competitors from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like sitting in the stands and watching," Curren said. "It looks like a 
real sport. People are impressed by the big, noisy, American style of doing 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 44 surfers who compete on the ASP world championship tour and are 
committed to the U.S. Open, only Gary Elkerton and Rob Bain are skipping the Op 
Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who quit the world tour last year, and Pat O'Connell of Laguna Niguel 
will be competing in the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins recently won the Gunston 500 in North Beach, South Africa, the richest 
and highest-rated ASP qualifying event. He is second to Santa Barbara's Chris 
Brown in qualifying points and is planning to join the world tour again next 
year. O'Connell is seventh and a strong finish in the Op Pro would help assure 
his place on the 1995 world championship tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Women and longboard riders entered the Op Pro in record numbers. Organizers 
planned on 16 women competitors and later changed the schedule to accommodate 
64. Women's trials start at 2 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four longboarders are entered and competition begins at 4:40 p.m. today. 
The longboard and women's finals will be Saturday, along with exhibitions by 
the Op surf stars and tandem teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two amateur surfers are readying for the Op Junior, which begins at 6 
a.m. today and wraps up Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the men's open trials begin at 8:40 today with the men's finals 12:30 p.m. 
Sunday. Op Pro Facts

WHEN CRICKET BECOMES GAME OF DIRTY POOL; SCANDAL: ENGLAND'S CAPTAIN IS FINED 
$3,000 FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT. TO COMPOUND OUTRAGE, IT CAME DURING A LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was front-page news across Britain on Monday, with commentary and other 
news stories on the sports and national news pages. 
</P>
<P>
 For sports fans and the British way of life, it was almost unthinkable: The 
captain of England's cricket team was suspected of cheating during an 
international match against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still not clear what exactly happened or whether captain Mike Atherton's 
actions violated the rules. But he was fined $3,000 for conduct that was, to 
say the least, not quite cricket. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton was accused of wiping the cricket ball with dirt, an action that 
might be construed as an attempt to enhance his team's performance against the 
visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Africans are appearing in England for the first time since they were 
banned nearly 30 years ago as part of the worldwide sanctions against 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 They won easily over England -- to the widespread dismay of the mother 
country, which invented the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atherton seemed an unlikely suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 A pleasant young fellow who played cricket at Cambridge University and later 
joined the professional ranks, Atherton was chosen as captain to impart a 
respectable image to the national team, which has had few victories recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through Saturday's game at the famed Lords cricket grounds, television 
cameras caught Atherton putting his hand in the pocket of his trousers and then 
rubbing the cricket ball before handing it to the bowler, who corresponds to 
the pitcher in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 In cricket, it is forbidden to apply a "foreign substance" to the ball. It is 
the equivalent of turning a baseball into a "spitball." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, bowlers sometimes rubbed grease or sun cream on one side of the 
ball to make it curve when pitched at the batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike American pitchers, English bowlers bounce the ball off the ground 
before it approaches the batter. A tricky ball with an unusual spin or bounce 
can confuse a batter and mean a big difference in a match. 
</P>
<P>
 England's Atherton maintained, after television photos showed him rubbing the 
cricket ball before handing it to the bowler, that he was only wiping it dry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, he acknowledged to Ray Illingworth, chairman of the national team 
selectors and a famous cricketer, that he had put some dirt in his pocket and 
had used it to dry the ball before handing it to the bowler, or pitcher. 
Rubbing dirt onto a ball is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 To many observers, it seemed a lame excuse. Was the dirt used simply to dry 
the ball -- or to enhance its spin? 
</P>
<P>
 Illingworth fined his captain $1,500 for having the dirt in his pocket and 
another $1,500 for not mentioning the fact at an inquiry headed by referee 
Peter Burge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a cheat," Atherton said. "There were no illegal substances in my 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that he had not told investigators the full story of the dirt in 
his pocket because "it would be misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
 But his action provoked editorial comment far and wide, with cricket 
specialists reviewing past charges of doctoring the ball -- often made by the 
English against successful visiting teams such as Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Mail said that Atherton's actions had "sullied the honor of the 
England captaincy."

 Boys! Girls! Be Happnin'! Be the Life of the Party! Be an Ophthalmologist! 
</P>
<P>
 Is your living room drab and devoid of revelers? Then check out what happens 
when you fill a corner with an old leather medical chair surrounded by creepy 
eye-doctor equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At all of our parties we've got people hanging around it, sitting in it, 
looking through it. Everybody loves it. It's a real conversation piece for 
sure," says Jason La Bounty, who does indeed have a living room graced with 
restored early 1900s ophthalmological gear. 
</P>
<P>
 It's stylish in a queasy way, things that look like watchwork-crafted, comic 
criminal masks or fanciful ray guns, all mounted on a tiered black-and-chrome 
stand, ready to be pointed right at your eyes! Aieee! Aieee!  
</P>
<P>
 "It is real 'Frankenstein,' isn't it?" La Bounty admitted. "When I first got 
this stuff I had it all out in the garage, and it was all dusty, rusted and in 
various stages of disrepair. I had a classical music station on the radio, and 
all the lights in the garage off so I could test the small lights on this 
stuff, and my wife came out and said, 'You're scaring me!' It looked like the 
mad doctor (was) in there."

 La Bounty, 26, isn't an ophthalmologist. Rather, as head of the service 
department at the Tustin-based Ophthalmic Instruments Inc., he services and 
repairs their equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he and his wife, Blanca, have always loved antiques, and he enjoys 
tinkering with things, but his specific interest in the old eye gear began with 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw an ad in the newspaper that said, 'Can you turn a screwdriver and do 
you like to work with your hands?' and I said, 'Yeah.' I've always been into 
gadgets, making things with my hands, taking old things that don't work and 
making them work. I'd been really worried I'd never have a job I'd like, and I 
love this job. I take a lot of pride in doing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though one might think he had enough of fixing equipment doing it for a 
living, his gaze kept straying to the company's "dinosaur room," where outdated 
gear was amassed. "We had so much stuff we couldn't even get to the center of 
it," La Bounty said. "But I knew there was this chair and stand in there."  
</P>
<P>
 He bided his time, repairing outmoded Poindexter-ish trial frames, which are 
used for fitting glasses to a head, and other small devices. Then, when the 
company decided to expand his department last year, they needed to clear out 
the old stuff, and he offered to give the more aged pieces a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those included a 1920s multi-lensed refractor used to determine a patient's 
lens prescription, ophthemometers with light sources on them known as "fixation 
devices," a couple of slit lamps used to look at the back of the eye and a 
Synoptophore, which is a 1940s British curiosity that looks like some bit of 
evil out of Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" but was actually used to gauge depth 
perception by showing a different projected image to each eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize of the lot was the chair and stand setup, which La Bounty has dated 
to 1911. It was a rusty, non-functional mess when he got it, but four months of 
painstaking work took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though patent medicines and other medical hucksterisms were still the rage 
early in the century, La Bounty says his old equipment is surprisingly valid.  
</P>
<P>
 "They pretty much had it down. A lot of it's very similar to today's 
instruments. Looking at this stuff, the concepts haven't changed that much 
since then. The refractors, for example, are very similar to what they are 
today. They might even be a little better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the new equipment, he noted, is operated from a computer key pad, 
rather than the doctor being right there beside the patient working the devices 
manually. La Bounty wonders if some of the human contact isn't lost in the 
process. And if an old piece of gear went on the fritz, doctors could often 
still find a way to make it function until it could be properly repaired. 
That's not the case when a logic board blows, he said. Most of all, he added, 
modern equipment just doesn't look like much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to like the old stuff better, just because of the look of it. I 
mean, it's real stylish. To me that stand is very Art Deco-ish (in) the shape 
of the pieces. I love just looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a young couple, the La Bounty's have quite a few antiques. Jason may sport 
a nose ring and earrings (these come off when he's working in doctors' offices) 
and have worn blue Dr. Martens shoes at his wedding, but the couple's 1920s 
house is furnished with old chests, an ornate aged piano a windup Columbia 
78-r.p.m. phonograph and other antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that saying 'They don't make them like they used to' really 
applies. I like surrounding myself with the older stuff. I'm really drawn to 
it. I have a fascination with history. It's one of the only subjects I did 
really well in in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like seeing how far things have come in history. I imagine myself sometimes 
going in an office and seeing that old ophthalmology setup, and sitting in it, 
and going, 'God, what are they going to do to me?' "  
</P>
<P>
 A squirmy thought, but not one that prevents him from showing off the 
equipment in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first brought it home, it was with the intention of fixing it up and 
bringing it into the house. When I finally got it all done, Blanca was a little 
tentative about that. She had to warm up to it for a while. Now we both love it 
in here." 
</P>
<P>
 He's still seeking information on his equipment -- sometimes tracking down old 
doctors familiar with the it -- and would like to turn up some items from the 
1800s. But when it comes down to seeking the shining grail of ophthalmology, he 
thinks he already has it in his living room corner.  
</P>
<P>
 "My only dream with this stuff now," he said, "is to someday own a house with 
a room entirely converted into a doctor's office of that period. Now that would 
be really neat to have."  
</P>

WHERE THE PAST IS A GAS; THE HISTORY AND EFFECT OF THE MOTORCAR -- AND OUR 
LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH IT -- ARE ON FULL DISPLAY AT THE NEW PETERSEN 
AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM. HERE, NO DETAIL IS TOO SMALL OR TOO TRIVIAL. 
</P>

 A cluster of dead, dried flies at the Petersen Automotive Museum will be 
allowed to rest in peace. They were brought in a box from Beverly Hills by a 
museum sponsor who insisted that no replica of Culver City's old Dog Cafe diner 
would be complete without bugs belly-up on the window sill. 
</P>
<P>
 That galvanized steel bucket at the antique Richfield gas station? It wasn't 
for washing windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 They typically belonged to teen-age pump jockeys who slyly drained dregs from 
hoses and nozzles and salvaged enough gas for a night's cruising in their '32 
Ford Highboys. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Jamm's, the museum's neon and neo-deco rebirth of a drive-in 
coffee shop? 
</P>
<P>
 The name is a play on Pann's , which has been serving Joe and cholesterol at 
La Cienega and La Tijera since the '50s. But Jamm's is built from the 
first-name initials of four museum planners: Jim Olson, Alan Hess, Matt Roth 
and Marc Whipple. 
</P>
<P>
 And the real, drivable, ketchup-red '59 Cadillac convertible parked outside 
the faux and false-fronted restaurant belongs to one planner, acting director 
Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 If it seems that Olson, exhibit consultant Hess, curator Roth and architect 
Whipple just had too much fun assembling the Petersen Automotive Museum -- 
well, who said reproducing local history and recovering its relics had to be 
dull? 
</P>
<P>
 If it appears they left no minutiae unturned -- bet your new Saturn they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the quiet purpose behind last month's opening of the Los Angeles 
County Natural History Museum's fifth and newest member was not just to touch 
the 82-year-old museum's bases of history, science and art -- but to be 
livelier, more sweeping, easier on the brain and much hipper than a dozen auto 
palaces from Detroit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It began as a negatively stated concept: 'We are not going to be an indoor 
parking lot. . . . We are not going to be a grille show,' " Roth recalls. 
"Having stated that, what were we going to be? 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to be dedicated to explaining and presenting the history of the 
automobile and its impact on American life and culture -- using Los Angeles as 
a prime example." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime, indeed. From steam cars hammered together in 1901 by Louis Breer in a 
blacksmith's shop at 215 San Pedro St. to vehicles for 2001 being sketched in 
secret at local design studios, the automobile has been both deity and 
antichrist to Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 It has provided transportation, freedom, recreation, status, investment and 
made Southern California the world's largest, richest car market. It also has 
produced smog, gridlocks, SigAlerts, carjackings, drive-by shootings, and fatal 
accidents while making Los Angeles the car-theft capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around a mission statement in the abstract, we had to create reality," Roth 
continues. "So, through dioramas and galleries we are telling how people of Los 
Angeles travel . . . the role of the car in domestic life . . . how did people 
buy things by car . . . gas stations and billboards . . . strip malls that 
began here in 1925 and the Dog Cafe diner . . . the California Highway Patrol, 
racing on board tracks and the car as family recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest challenge was to slice up the history of 20th-Century Los Angeles 
and its love-hate relationship with the automobile and find a reasonable place 
to start." 
</P>
<P>
 But looking around, seeing exhibits of a red Toyota wadded by a freeway 
accident in contrast to the suburban peace of a two-car garage containing an 
Edsel and a 1948 MG-TCB, Roth believes "we bite a pretty good chunk out of how 
the car changed the shape and appearance of this city." 
</P>
<P>
 The breadth of the museum, he says, is far from incidental. It reaches beyond 
a relatively few car enthusiasts and touches millions who simply invest in 
daily transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that if we built it, the car people would come," Olson says. "Then it 
became abundantly clear, before we brought the cars in, that most of the 
exhibits on the first floor, the service station, the homes, worked fine 
without the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Because . . . those sets stir memories, present domestic tableaux and are part 
of a Los Angeles tale every resident shares. The Dog Cafe, for example, 
exhibits more architectural form -- it's a pipe-smoking bulldog -- than 
automotive style and was designed to attract motorists speeding down Washington 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Because . . . a 1934 Los Angeles Times billboard ("Mister, Here's a Real 
Paper!") with a motorcycle cop lurking to ambush speeders, and a California 
bungalow proud of its chimney of river-washed rocks, are not things that 
happened a century ago in some foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
 The $40-million museum -- on Miracle Mile and housed in the old, now 
unrecognizable Ohrbach's department store at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax 
Avenue -- is four floors and 300,000 square feet of display space. 
</P>
<P>
 Its name commemorates, in his lifetime, automotive magazine Publisher Robert 
E. Petersen, 67, and wife Margie, who pledged $15 million to help build the 
museum. Personal galleries -- one sponsored by Bruce Meyer of Beverly Hills, 
president of Geary's, another by Los Angeles car collectors James Hull and 
Peter and Pamela Mullin -- have sold for as much as $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in a booster club costs $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is looking for a few good persons to serve as models for wax 
mannequins. No experience necessary. But a $20,000 donation is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the museum shop -- despite its full inventory of $1 lapel pins and $10 
T-shirts -- shows touches that are more Rolls-Royce than GM. A carpet tapestry 
of dueling Ferraris: $30,000. A gold, diamond and ruby race car charm: $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 None has sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "But let's find out they don't sell," Roth suggests. "If they do, that's a 
pretty good hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum admission, fortunately, is $7 for adults and $3 for children 5 to 12 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 And the experience is Knott's Berry Farm meets the Smithsonian with special 
effects by Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 First floor: The dioramas are a back lot of the ages, a circular street with 
manhole covers, curbs and a big city feel. There's a 1919 Auburn and Cord 
showroom on Hollywood Boulevard from a friendlier time when car salesmen 
weren't contract consultants. Also a dim, Downtown back alley smelling of soot 
and old paint and a sad, stolen 1931 Ford Coupe ready for stripping. 
</P>
<P>
 Delight, again, is with the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses show weathering, and the adobe skirts of suburban homes are stained 
by sprinklers. Birds sing in trees. Mom calls from upstairs. From two houses 
and a fruit market -- via hidden fans blowing scented oils -- come California 
aromas: chocolate chip cookies, apple pie and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Floor: A bazaar of cars and motorcycles, an ocean of Simonize filling 
five galleries crowned by the Mullin-Hull collection of Delahayes, Delages and 
Bugattis from the '30s and '40s. They are fiercely French, in vivid colors with 
sensual lines swooping and chuckling at life and its conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 A gallery of Los Angeles' faded dreams is here. Of the mid-engined 1965 
Getaway two-seater that never went into production and thus failed to create 
jobs. Of the bulbous 1937 Airmobile three-wheeler whose inventor promised to 
undersell Ford or Chevrolet but didn't sell one. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- in fitting tribute to this company town -- the cars of Clark Gable, 
Jean Harlow and Fred Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Floor: Wall to gallery to elevator automotive art. As prints and 
originals, photo realism and photographic assemblages. By Jane Gottlieb, Harold 
Cleworth and Peter Tytla. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth floor: To open soon as a conference and banquet center. 
</P>
<P>
 As complete as it currently views, the Petersen Automotive Museum is far from 
finished. Nor, officials say, can it ever be whole. For audiences change, 
automotive history is constantly expanding, and even museum techniques are 
being revised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 82 years since the Natural History Museum was completed and it's 
still not finished," Olson says. "So 82 years from now we'll still be working 
on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 One improvement will be a hands-on educational area for students, recently 
made possibly by a $1-million grant from the May Co. Undeveloped basement bays 
are being examined as sites for automobile-club gatherings because, Olson says, 
this museum must "become the heartbeat of the hobby . . . the focus of auto 
activities in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 More mannequins are needed in the Auburn showroom. The blacksmith shop could 
use extra pieces of tack and horse collars. There should be more clutter than 
buckets around the service station. Maybe lights, cameras and live actors could 
demonstrate how cutaway cars are used in movie-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth's personal hope is that time will trim the facility's title. He fears 
"Petersen Automotive Museum" suggests just another haughty warehouse of 
unobtainable cars. "Petersen Museum" would be fine, he says. But "The Petersen" 
would be really cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are no plans to commemorate Route 66 as it ran from Chicago 
to L.A. Nor build a special display of action vehicles from the Keystone Kops 
to Demolition Man. Only one small exhibit -- of photographs and a silent 
loudspeaker -- tell of a terminally endangered species: the drive-in movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we intend to cover everything from Plato to NATO," Olson says. "You name 
the activity, and at some time we will have an exhibit on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe not the automobile's darker sides. Although locally available, 
Charlie Manson's golf cart likely won't be displayed. Nor, if it could be 
located, the Porsche in which James Dean died. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth says these are areas where he "treads carefully." That's why the accident 
exhibit involves a car where driver and passenger walked away unscratched. 
Explains Roth: "We didn't want to create a situation where somebody would 
wander in the museum, see the car and say: 'Oh, my God. That's the car Uncle 
Joe died in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He has censored exhibit commentaries where sexist pejoratives, common among 
car lovers, were used. He also bleeped reminiscences about back-seat romancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't fit the G-rated nature of this museum," Roth adds. "We're going to 
get classes of fifth-grade kids in here, and that's when it (a coarse comment) 
stands between entertainment and education and interrupts the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Although director Olson believes five weeks after opening is too early for 
attendance analyses, he says the museum is "well on its way" to meeting a 
projection of "600,000 to 800,000 visitors a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Walls, a retired piano and voice teacher, was among last week's 
visitors. His vehicle was a wheel chair. Walls is 91. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fascinated by what I see here, but surprised by the black mannequins in 
the car showroom," commented Walls, who is African American. "You know, I don't 
think there were many black couples buying Auburns or Cords in Los Angeles in 
1919. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not unless they were (cosmetic millionaire) Madame C.J. Walker's people." 
</P>
<P>
 How plead you, Mr. Curator? 
</P>
<P>
 Not guilty, Roth says. 
</P>
<P>
 His exhibit researchers went to the Afro-American Historical Society and 
checked that precise point. They found photographs of black couples driving 
cars in Los Angeles in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were driving them, we have to presume they were buying them from 
showrooms." Roth notes. But Auburn showrooms in the 6000 block of Hollywood 
Boulevard? "Well, we are being a tad provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by that single act (of including black mannequins) we are bringing up the 
changing nature of the urban community . . . causing an examination of the 
changing relationship between race, class and geography in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way museums educate is by stimulating curiosity, making people ask their 
own questions." 
</P>
<P>
 And by denying no trivia.

RING AROUND THE NAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA A. GALLOWAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dad, don't read this. Because if you do, you're likely to find out that your 
daughter has committed a heinous act: I got my navel pierced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I feel it is only fair to warn you, given the responses that I've received in 
my post-pierce phase. 
</P>
<P>
 My best friend's mother, a fine upstanding Catholic woman, now thinks I need 
God in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 My 43-year-old sister tried to be understanding, but the closest she could 
come was to say that hoop earrings were big in her day. She also warned that a 
woman with a pierced bellybutton should never, ever, get into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my co-workers expressed grave concerns about my future travel plans. 
Will I ever again slip silently through an airport metal detector? 
</P>
<P>
 My decision to pierce did require some thought. I've always had an urge to go 
against the grain fashion-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 I like tattoos, but I've never been the Hell's Angels type. A nose ring was 
out. (One sneeze could turn me into a lethal weapon.) 
</P>
<P>
 Navel piercing seemed the best option, because the ring could be shown 
selectively. Should I ever have a change of heart, it could be removed. The 
hole would heal, leaving a small scar that could be a vehicle for some great 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 On a two-day hiatus to Santa Barbara with my aforementioned friend, Kathleen, 
we spotted the Wild Side Tattoo Parlor off the main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed nothing less than an omen from God. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a stranger here. If I ever run for public office, we decided, opposition 
research would be hard-pressed to uncover my soon-to-be secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The large one-room storefront was filled with a myriad of tattoo options 
ranging from the naked mermaid -- a perennial favorite -- to several hundred 
variations on Wile E. Coyote and the Confederate flag, not to mention girls, 
girls, girls. 
</P>
<P>
 I was immediately drawn to a huge glass case filled with rings of various 
shapes and sizes when we were approaced by Xeon (pronounced Shawn ), the parlor 
piercer and proud graduate of the Fakir Musafar School of Professional Body 
Piercing in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 After discussing all the piercing options, checking out the sterility of the 
piercing area and picking out a tiny silver ring with a cobalt ball in the 
middle, we were poised to pierce. But Xeon had a tongue and two eyebrows to get 
through first. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen, the first victim, was probably voted Most Likely to Become a Human Pin 
Cushion in high school. He was only 19, a mere baby, yet silver dripped from 
his nose and his ears. He considered getting his tongue and eyebrows done to be 
"good business," since he worked at a nearby tattoo parlor, where piercing is 
admired but not performed. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Aspen about the pain involved in his various puncture wounds. 
According to him, nothing hurt. Ever. Feeling older and wiser at age 22, I 
couldn't help asking him what his mother thought about having a human magnet 
for a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I care!" he said, rolling his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave Aspen a hug. So we just met. This was a bonding experience. Besides, 
Aspen could be my little brother. He was America's Little Brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen, intrigued by this new world, politely asked him if she could watch 
his tongue procedure. He agreed and they went behind a screen, where there was 
a doctor's examining table and a poster of the lymphatic system from "Gray's 
Anatomy" tacked crookedly to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to sit and look at pictures of tattoos. Pacing around the shop, I 
picked up one of Xeon's business cards. "Please be sober," it read in bold 
print. I was beginning to wish I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen seemed to be fine after his piercing. A real trouper, except that he was 
suddenly transformed into a lisper. "Ith didn'th hurth," he said. "Weally it 
didn'th." 
</P>
<P>
 And then it was my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Xeon worked as fast as he could, stopping only to tell me to take deep breaths 
-- after three girls walked in, heard me screaming and promptly walked right 
back out. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to get technical and tell you exactly how Xeon used forceps to clamp 
the skin he was about to pierce, or how he had the acumen of a surgeon with a 
needle longer than Long Island and what looked like a bottle cork. 
</P>
<P>
 But I can't, because it's not something I cared to watch, even if I could 
have. It's hard to get a clear view of your own stomach when lying down like a 
corpse, preparing for pain that must be worse than a lobotomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, my impressions were gleaned from the people around me. Aspen, 
snickering silently, held my hands as I squeezed with all my might. Kathleen 
looked horrified, then intrigued, then impressed. All the while, she held a 
small toy duck over my head, chanting, "Focus on the duck! Focus on the duck!" 
</P>
<P>
 And then it was over.  
</P>
<P>
 Xeon gave me a sheet on belly hygiene that commenced with "Keep your dirty, 
nasty hands off it." Aspen asked if we could drop him off at the mall. After 
all, there were girls to impress. I decided to join him. There were midriff 
shirts to be purchased -- and eyebrows to be raised.

HOW TO LIVE UP TO GROWING DOWN; JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE STAVING OFF THE 
AGING PROCESS, YOU DISCOVER YOU'RE GETTING SHORTER. HERE'S HOW TO STALL THE 
SHRINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gray hair can be colored. Flab can be fashionably dressed. Crow's feet can be 
ironed out. But just when it seems there's no symptom of aging that can't be 
tamed, it can come creeping up on you. Or creeping down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shrink. That gradual erosion of stature that hints (and sometimes shouts) 
that you are past your peak and sliding swiftly over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, of course, it's easy to ignore and rationalize The Shrink. 
The frazzled nurse measured wrong, that's all. You're not growing shorter, your 
kids and grandkids are just getting taller. 
</P>
<P>
 When you discover more of you is missing, there's disbelief and anger. With 
every inch of height you lose, those ideal-weight charts get more hilarious. 
Then come the nightmares: Will you spend your golden years perched on pillows 
just to see over the steering wheel? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinking, the folklore goes, is a normal, can't-fight-it fact of aging. No 
magic cream, no surgery, nothing but higher heels and taller hats can stem the 
southward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, that thinking has been increasingly challenged by physicians and 
researchers in the field (many of them, by the way, very tall people who show 
every intention of staying that way). 
</P>
<P>
 Some shrinking with age probably is inevitable, most experts agree -- but not 
as much as you may be blaming on birthdays alone. When height loss is so great 
that others start to notice, many experts now say, it could indicate an 
underlying problem such as osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 While the risk of osteoporosis is partly determined by factors out of your 
control, many behaviors that lead to height loss -- smoking, sedentary 
lifestyle, poor body mechanics or posture -- can easily be altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is normal not to shrink," says K. Michael Davies, a six-foot-tall 
researcher at the Osteoporosis Research Center at Creighton University, Omaha. 
It's possible to reach the golden years, he says, at the same or about the same 
height as you were in your young adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The folklore about shrinking into senior citizenhood has been popularized 
partly, Davies says, by researchers' habit of comparing younger women (who grew 
progressively taller from one generation to the next, from about 1900 to 1965) 
with older women, who were always shorter to begin with. Researchers who found 
height differences between these generations mistakenly chalked it all up to 
old-age shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the older people were shorter than the younger ones -- but that doesn't 
necessarily mean they were shrinking," says Davies, who spelled out his 
argument in a paper published recently in the Journal of Bone and Mineral 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To better understand shrinking -- or the lack of it -- in the later years, it 
helps to know there are really two types: senior shrink, and the day-in day-out 
shrink that happens way before you're eligible for movie discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 From dawn to dusk, it's not unusual to lose nearly a half inch in height, says 
Dr. Charles Prickett, a 6-foot-7 Pasadena orthopedic surgeon and USC associate 
clinical professor of orthopedics who also directs a spine clinic at 
Orthopaedic Hospital, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're at your tallest when you wake up," Prickett explains. "By late 
afternoon and evening, you have settled." 
</P>
<P>
 The fluctuation is due to normal functioning of the intervertebral disks -- 
the fluid-filled cushions between the 33 vertebrae, the bones that make up the 
spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of bone as static, but it's dynamic," says Dr. Mauro "Stretch" 
Giordani, a 5-foot-7 Pasadena orthopedic surgeon (who claims he must stand on a 
crate in the operating room when working with his partner, Prickett). 
</P>
<P>
 With daily activity, fluid diffuses from the disks into the vertebral bodies, 
the building blocks of the spine, Giordani and Prickett explain. With less 
fluid, the disks provide less cushion. And you become shorter. When you lie 
down, fluid moves back into the disks, explaining why you're back at full 
height by morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people notice these daily fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're going out for basketball," Prickett advises, "get measured in 
the morning. If you're about to be drafted, make an afternoon appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that youngsters stretching to meet the height requirement for 
certain amusement park rides should line up early. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the amount of fluid decreases. Cushioning decreases. You get 
the rest of the picture. Stay in good health, and this settling effect will 
have a negligible effect on your height, many experts concur. 
</P>
<P>
 But other factors -- some under our control, others not -- can take their toll 
on height. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truck drivers, for instance, are bouncing up and down all day," Prickett 
says. That's very tough on the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who sit for long periods also put more stress and strain on the spine 
and its cushions. Diabetics are especially prone to loss of disk resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers do their bones no favors. Smoking reduces circulation within the small 
blood vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the bones, Giordani explains. 
The diminished blood supply, in turn, hinders the ongoing process of bone 
restoration and healing. Calcium stores decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor posture can also exaggerate The Shrink, although with practice it can be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people are known to slump," says Dr. Loren Lipson, 5-foot-8 chief of 
the division of geriatric medicine at USC. "This slump on average can take off 
1.5 inches," he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, in particular, are known to contort their spines into previously 
unimaginable shapes when they teach their children how to ride a bike without 
training wheels or some similar feat. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, though, the biggest height robber with age is osteoporosis, a disease 
marked by low bone mass and deterioration of the bone tissue. This in turn 
leads to fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, deformities such as stooped 
posture or a dowager's hump -- and a decrease in height. 
</P>
<P>
 While half of all women in the United States will be afflicted with 
osteoporosis, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, men aren't 
immune. By age 75, a third of men have the disorder, too, according to 
foundation estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Height loss due to osteoporosis often becomes noticeable around age 50 in 
women and 60 or 65 in men, says Dr. Charles Sharp, a 6-foot-4 Pasadena 
endocrinologist specializing in metabolic bone disorders and a USC clinical 
associate professor of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain people are at much higher risk of getting osteoporosis. Among risk 
factors: menopause before age 45, low calcium intake, cigarette smoking, 
excessive drinking and inactivity. Whites and Asians are at higher risk than 
other ethnic groups; thin people have higher risk than heavier people. 
</P>
<P>
 How much height can osteoporosis take? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen women lose two or three inches over 15 or 20 years," Sharp says. 
"I've even seen women who have lost six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While you can't control some risk factors for height loss, there are some ways 
to reduce the odds that you'll someday shop for clothes alongside Dr. Ruth. 
Among the experts' suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do engage regularly in weight-bearing exercise, but don't become a fanatic, 
says Prickett, who contends overdoing is as bad as doing nothing. Moderate 
walking, swimming and stationary cycling are the best for maintaining bone 
health, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent study conducted at Texas A&M University, post-menopausal women who 
exercised on stationary bikes three times for 30 minutes a week built bone mass 
by 3.5% in their lumbar spines, found researcher Susan Bloomfield, while 
sedentary women lost 2.4% of their bone mass during the same eight-month study. 
Water aerobics and resistance training with light weights are also good 
choices, says Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take vitamins and minerals. Pay special attention to calcium, copper, zinc 
and manganese -- all important for bone maintenance. Teen-agers and young 
adults should build as much bone mass as possible before age 30, when it peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those at high risk for osteoporosis might consider a bone-density test, 
which can predict the chances of fracture and differentiate spinal osteoporosis 
from other spine problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women experiencing menopause, when bone mass decreases, should discuss with 
their doctor whether they're good candidates for estrogen replacement therapy, 
which can help maintain bone. 
</P>
<P>
 If height loss at any age seems sudden or extreme, it could signal an 
abnormality such as disk disease leading to scoliosis (an abnormal spine 
curvature) or compression fractures, Prickett says. If you have lost a half 
inch or more before your mid-40s, it bears checking with a physician, Sharp 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 If clean living, a sense of humor or finding shorter friends don't ease The 
Shrink, there is another possible -- though temporary -- option: join the space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronauts, whatever their original height, tend to grow in space. Astronaut 
Richard Hieb was 6-foot-3 when he blasted off on the recent Columbia shuttle 
mission but soon added an inch, a NASA spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news (at least for Hieb, who was close to NASA'S maximum of 
6-foot-4): height returns to normal back on Earth.

 Whatever the type of food, there are ways to cut calories and fat while 
preserving taste and satisfaction: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask what type of fat is used in a dish. Lard is bad; vegetable oils are 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to have your dish prepared with much less oil or no oil if possible.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for a half order of an entree, or an appetizer-size portion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask your waiter to bring a doggie bag when the meal is served. Then scoop as 
much as you won't -- or shouldn't -- eat into the carton.  
</P>
<P>
 * Order a la carte, which guarantees smaller amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a sense of perspective. "Every food doesn't have to be perfect," says 
Linda Webb Carilli, spokesperson for Weight Watchers International Inc. "If you 
choose a high-fat food, enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even chiles rellenos? 
</P>
<P>
 "If chiles rellenos is something you really want, we tell our members how to 
fit it into their program. It will most likely end up being your splurge for 
the week. It's challenging but possible." KATHLEEN DOHENY

BODY WATCH; GIVE UP ETHNIC FOOD? FAT CHANCE!; THE HEALTH POLICE HAVE DONE IT 
AGAIN. IS THIS THE END OF GLOBAL DINING AS WE KNOW IT? NOT IF YOU FOLLOW THESE 
TIPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ethnic food lovers have been bombarded with so much bad news lately, can a 
support group and 800 line be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese, Italian and now Mexican restaurant meals have all been skewered as 
unhealthy in recent surveys by researchers from the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, the same spoilsports who bad-mouthed movie-theater popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest study, released last week by the Washington, D.C.-based consumer 
organization, chiles rellenos took the heat. They're as disastrous, it seems, 
as fettucini alfredo, previously christened "a heart attack on a plate" because 
it contains as much fat as in a stick of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 In another survey, CSPI deemed an order of kung pao chicken, with its 76 fat 
grams, as bad as eating nearly four Quarter-Pounders from Mickey D's. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make a diner feel depressed, hungry, guilty -- and torn: 
</P>
<P>
 To never again savor the sight, smell and taste of macho-sized burritos, pasta 
smothered in sauce, tangy sweet-and-sour shrimp? 
</P>
<P>
 Or to push forever from the brain the mental image of fat-filled test tubes, 
used as props at a news conference called by CSPI to demonstrate exactly how 
much of it is inhaled with a typical ethnic meal? 
</P>
<P>
 There's definitely a backlash simmering. 
</P>
<P>
 Neva Cochran, a Dallas dietitian hired by insulted members of the Dallas-Fort 
Worth Chinese Restaurant Assn., picked 13 popular entrees and had the recipes 
analyzed at the prestigious Cooper Clinic in Dallas and found there are some 
healthful choices. Some take-out portions analyzed in the CSPI survey, she 
complains, were much bigger than what's normally eaten at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 As even CSPI researchers concede, lower-fat, lower-calorie dishes can be found 
at nearly any restaurant -- with Mexican fare posing the biggest challenge. The 
trick is in the ordering. 
</P>
<P>
 We found three dietitians -- all ethnic food aficionados -- who agreed to 
share their secrets for ethnic, healthful eating. The experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ellen Coleman, a sports nutritionist at The Sport Clinic, Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Martin Yadrick, a Manhattan Beach dietitian and training consultant for 
Computrition Inc., a nutrition software firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diane Whelan, a Westwood dietitian in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy, in a low-fat nutshell: Know what to order. Know what not to 
order. And learn how to ask the chef or waiter to make your favorite entree 
less of a nutritional disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican 
</P>
<P>
 The first commandment of Mexican dining, says Yadrick: "Thou shalt not let the 
waiter set those tortilla chips down on your table." 
</P>
<P>
 For good reason. "By the time the entree comes, especially if the service is 
slow and the company good, you can easily eat 500 calories worth of tortilla 
chips -- and a fat load of about 26 grams," says Yadrick. (To keep fat intake 
to 30% or less of calories as recommended, maximum daily fat grams should be 
60-80 for most consumers.) 
</P>
<P>
 The better choice? "Ask for heated corn tortillas instead of chips. Tear them 
apart to dip into the salsa," Coleman suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 When ordering main courses, remember these red flag words: fried, cheese, 
guacamole and sour cream. If you can't eat a burrito sans sour cream, ordering 
it on the side might decrease your intake. 
</P>
<P>
 While the much-maligned chiles rellenos probably don't belong on a 
weight-conscious person's plate regularly, other Mexican dishes aren't as bad, 
dietitians agree. "There's nothing wrong, really, with a chicken soft taco," 
Coleman says. "It's not fried." 
</P>
<P>
 Fajitas are OK, too. "Most contain small amounts of grilled, fairly lean meat, 
such as chicken or beef, along with green peppers and other vegetables," 
Yadrick notes. 
</P>
<P>
 When ordering a tostada, ask your waiter to leave out the refried beans, which 
can be loaded with fat. Substitute steamed rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat at authentic Mexican restaurants rather than Americanized ones, Yadrick 
says, because he says they tend to use less cheese and other fatty toppings. Or 
choose the more health-conscious establishments (the Macheezmo Mouse chain, for 
instance, won the CSPI's "Golden Tortilla Award" for healthful choices.) 
</P>
<P>
 Italian 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep it simple to keep it nutritious," suggests Coleman. Begin with the bread 
basket. Skip the buttery garlic bread, since an order can contain 800 calories 
and 40 grams of fat. Ask instead for bread sticks. Or ask for plain bread, 
unbuttered, with some garlic seasoning on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a famished breadaholic, pass on the bread altogether and order a 
low-fat appetizer that can be served right away. Minestrone soup is a great 
choice, Whelan says. 
</P>
<P>
 For main courses, pick pasta with marinara sauces over fat-filled cream 
sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some olive oil in marinara sauce, but it's nothing (fat gram-wise) 
compared with cream sauces," Coleman says. Pesto sauce -- with its basil, pine 
nuts and oil -- may sound healthy, but it's usually high in fat, Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Clam sauces look sinful but aren't always. The CSPI survey found that linguine 
with white clam sauce got just 29% of calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip any kind of pasta with cheese filling, which can rack up the fat grams 
faster than you can say "Abbondanza!" Pass, too, on lasagna, described by CSPI 
as "a plate of greasy meat and cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Plain cheese or vegetarian pizzas are good choices. "Choose deep dish over 
regular, because the more crust, usually the less cheese and toppings," Coleman 
says. Eggplant parmigiana sounds like a healthy vegetarian's delight -- but 
CSPI found 14 teaspoons of fat in a single serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti and meatballs might not be a bad choice, either, Yadrick says. The 
meatballs are often made with a filler such as low-fat bread crumbs. And 
they're bound to pack less of a fat wallop than Italian sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers at Chinese restaurants can be the real villains, fat wise. Skip the 
egg rolls and won-tons. Ditto those little noodles, the Chinese equivalent of 
tortilla chips, dietitians say. 
</P>
<P>
 A better choice? "Bird's nest soup -- basically broth with noodles," Coleman 
says, not to metion the bird's nest. Pass on the egg drop soup; it's higher in 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
 For an entree, choose stir-fried and steamed dishes, when possible, over 
anything battered and fried. Sichuan Shrimp is often a good choice, too, 
Coleman says. In the Center survey, Sichuan shrimp and stir-fried vegetables 
were the two top-rated dishes. Avoid sweet-and-sour pork, pressed duck and 
barbecued ribs, all usually high in fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Steamed rice is healthier than fried. But if Chinese just doesn't seem Chinese 
without fried rice, fried rice with vegetables is lower-fat than fried rice 
with pork, Whelan suggests. If you must have cashew chicken, try not to eat 
many of the nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're dining with a crowd and will share dishes, order just one meat dish 
and the rest vegetable- and rice-based, automatically reducing fat and 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the chef to omit MSG and salt. But salt's hard to avoid in Chinese 
cuisine, Coleman notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plan B: Decrease sodium intake for the next few meals or even the next few 
days to compensate.

CRIME WAVE: THREE NOVELISTS AND A GENRE; BOOKS: IT'S NO MYSTERY WHAT THESE 
LOCAL WRITERS -- AND THEIR HEROES -- HAVE BEEN UP TO. SUMMER'S A PERFECT TIME 
FOR SLEUTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of Orange County's premiere fictional crime solvers -- Maxine 
O'Callaghan's Delilah West and Noreen Ayres' Smokey Brandon -- are back in 
action this summer. And if British mysteries are your cup of tea, Elizabeth 
George also has served up another go-round with her New Scotland Yard detective 
inspector Thomas Lynley. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's begin with the aristocratic Lynley and his proletarian partner, 
Detective Sgt. Barbara Havers. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Playing for the Ashes" (Bantam; $21.95), the Huntington Beach author's 
seventh British crime novel, the mismatched duo are called in to investigate 
the asphyxiation death of England's top cricket player in a fire in a 
picturesque 15th-Century cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 As is George's modus operandi, however, that's just the starting point for 
weaving what Booklist has called one of her "rich, colorful, mesmerizing, 
multifaceted stories that combine an absorbing mystery with provocative 
insights into her characters' innermost thoughts and emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Just back from her latest trip to England, George was greeted with news from 
her publisher that "Playing for the Ashes" will hit the prestigious New York 
Times hardcover bestseller list July 31 -- at the No. 14 spot -- after only two 
weeks in release. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperback version of George's 1993 national bestseller, "Missing Joseph," 
made it to the New York Times paperback bestseller list in May, and this is her 
first time on the paper's hardback list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting for me," George said. "The list had been faxed by my 
publisher; I looked at it and sort of did a double take."  
</P>
<P>
 George also returned home to "a bunch of phone messages" notifying her that 
"Playing for the Ashes" is on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as well as 
those in the Wall Street Journal and a handful of other newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bantam, which initially printed 80,000 copies of the novel, has gone back to 
press, turning out an additional 20,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 George, who left Sunday on a two-week, eight-city book promotion tour, spent 
the past two weeks in England, where she and her husband, Ira Toibin, went 
flat-hunting in Kensington, her favorite part of London. George said she has no 
intention of moving to England, adding they are looking only for a part-time 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The former El Toro High School English teacher took her annual research trip 
to England in January for the novel she's working on, "In the Presence of the 
Enemy." Her manuscript isn't due in to Bantam until September, 1995. George 
said she asked for the later due date.  
</P>
<P>
 "The books are getting much more complicated, moving farther away from what 
would be called the category mystery," she said. "Because of that it takes 
longer for me to write them than it did initially." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing complexity of her novels has added considerably to their length. 
At 624 pages, "Playing for the Ashes" is more than 150 pages longer than her 
previous book and more than twice as long as her 1988 debut novel, "A Great 
Deliverance." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for its length, she explained, is that "Playing for the 
Ashes" is actually two novels that she wrote separately and then wove together. 
"One story covers 32 years, and the other one covers nine days," said George, 
who plans to continue writing longer books. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've always tried to do is approach this particular type of novel 
differently every time," she said. "If you're going to try to do something like 
that you can't have your editor say to you, 'Crank out 500 pages, please.' It 
just doesn't work that way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Delilah West caper, "Trade Off" (St. Martin's Press; $19.95), 
Maxine O'Callaghan's tough and savvy Santa Ana private eye is hired by a 
wealthy Orange County lighting manufacturer to find his runaway teen-age 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a routine case until West discovers a female corpse in her 
client's next-door-neighbor's Nellie Gale back yard: The body of an upscale 
real estate agent who was known to have been cozy with the missing girl's 
sleazy boyfriend who, it turns out, is also AWOL.  
</P>
<P>
 "Trade Off" -- the fifth title in O'Callaghan's Delilah West series -- is 
praised by Publishers Weekly for its "brisk characterization and smooth 
plotting" and by Booklist, which places it in the "must-read" category, for 
painting "a vivid picture of Southern California living." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more Delilah West news. As the Mission Viejo author says, "this is 
a big year for Delilah." 
</P>
<P>
 A paperback reprint of the fourth book in the series, "Set Up" (originally 
published in 1991), is now out from Worldwide ($3.99), and a short story 
featuring Delilah appears in "Deadly Allies II" (Doubleday, $18.95), a mystery 
anthology from Sisters in Crime and Private Eye Writers of America. 
</P>
<P>
 And, O'Callaghan said, "we haven't nailed it down, but we are negotiating a TV 
option right now, too" for either a Delilah West movie or series. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a limited edition book on the way: "Maxine O'Callaghan 
Bibliography, 1974-1994." In addition to providing a bibliography of 
O'Callaghan's work and an appreciation of her writing by mystery writer Marcia 
Fuller, the book will include a reprint of the short story that introduced 
Delilah in 1974 and a new Delilah short story.  
</P>
<P>
 The book, published by a small Mission Viejo printing company called ASAP, 
will be unveiled at Bouchercon, the national mystery writer and fan convention 
in Seattle this fall. in orange county, it will be available exclusively at 
book carnival in orange. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Callaghan doesn't just have Delilah West on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently completed the first book in a new suspense series for 
Putnam/Berkley featuring a Phoenix child psychologist. The book, whose working 
title is "Shadow of a Child," is due out next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen Ayres introduced Smokey Brandon -- her ex-stripper, former Oakland cop 
and recently divorced heroine who now works as an Orange County forensic 
specialist -- in her 1992 debut novel, "A World the Color of Salt."  
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo author describes her new Smokey Brandon mystery, "Carcass 
Trade" (William Morrow; $20) this way: "Smokey, in trying to ID a gruesomely 
destroyed corpse, comes across nefarious characters in biker bars and at pig 
farms." With a laugh, she added: "Hogs and Harlies, that's what it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 "Carcass Trade" is obviously a clever reference to Smokey's job working with 
cadavers, yes?

 "You would think so," said Ayres, "but I can't be satisfied with a one-level 
meaning; there are two more. The one that it draws most heavily from is that 
the term comes from the meat production industry: You raise animals either for 
slaughter, which is the carcass trade, or for reproduction."  
</P>
<P>
 The third level, she said, "is that Smokey Brandon goes undercover as a 
lingerie model and somebody in the book kind of apologizes for allowing her 
daughter to do that instead of working at Burger King. But Smokey says, 'It's 
all the carcass trade one way or another, isn't it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres, who said both books have been optioned by a film production company for 
either a movie or a television series, is working on a new Smokey Brandon 
mystery that will involve interstate truck hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to do the third one faster than I did the second one, so I'm shooting 
for about this time next year," said Ayres, who will be living in Houston by 
then. Her husband, Tom, an oil industry engineering project manager, is being 
relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres, who has lived in Orange County a decade, doesn't know if Smokey will 
continue to be based here. "That's going to work out as I develop the plot," 
she said. "These (forensic) experts are called to be all around the country. 
She may well still be based here in Orange County but just asked to participate 
in detection somewhere else."

 Telephone calls are transmitted over land, under sea and across the skies. An 
overseas call is likely to be handled by an undersea fiber-optic cable made up 
of tiny, hair-thin glass fibers. This modern fiber, also used for regular 
overland service, has revolutionized the telephone system because it has 
allowed cables to carry more calls. UNDERSEA CABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Undersea cable: Through the years 
</P>
<P>
 These cables peeled open to reveal their inner components, have increased 
dramatically in call-carrying capacity while their size has shrunk. Modern 
fiber-optic cable is at right. 
</P>
<P>
 1950s: Carried 36 calls simultaneously 
</P>
<P>
 1960s: 138 calls 
</P>
<P>
 1970s: 845 calls 
</P>
<P>
 1970s: 4,200 calls 
</P>
<P>
 Today (fiber optic): 40,000 calls 
</P>
<P>
 Fall, 1994 (fiber optic): 225,000 calls 
</P>
<P>
 * Preparing a message for transmission 
</P>
<P>
 Words begin as sound waves, called analog signals because the wave shapes are 
analogous to the rising and falling tones of a voice. But now, voices, as well 
as data and images, are transmitted as digital signals, coded in binary 1s and 
0s. To travel in digital form through fiber-optic cable, an analog voice signal 
is converted to energy pulses. A pulse stands for a binary 1, a missing pulse 
for 0. When the message reaches its destination, it is reconverted to analog 
and heard as the human voice. How calls are handled 
</P>
<P>
 1. International long distance phone call originates at a traditional 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Digital signal is transmitted via telephone lines, some along overhead 
cable, some underground. Cellular phone path would skip this step and go 
directly to computerized switching station. 
</P>
<P>
 3. AT switching station, electronic "decisions" are made. These switching 
stations decide which is the most convenient and efficient route available. 
</P>
<P>
 4. If the undersea cable route is selected, signal travels along one of 
several fiber-optic cable routes, depending on the destination. 
</P>
<P>
 5. If satellite is used, the signal is then transmitted from a satellite dish 
on the ground up 22,000 miles to an orbiting satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Satellite traveling in a geo-synchronous orbit acts as a repeater and 
reroutes signal back down to its destination on the other side of the world.

 AN ORNERY SEVENTH: Money magazine this month ranks the Internal Revenue 
Service's 63 regional offices according to their toughness on taxpayers. Las 
Vegas won for "orneriest office," but the Laguna Niguel branch ranked high, at 
seventh. . . . A few of its 1993 facts about the Laguna Niguel office: 58% of 
its delinquents had property seized. It also refused to accept money offers 
from 66% who were delinquent. Plus, for those it chose to audit, 16% wound up 
owing more taxes.

 MOUNTAIN MAN: Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow always kept on his 
courtroom bench a color brochure about Prescott, Ariz., his retirement dream. 
Parslow, 59, retired this month and moved his family there. When Denise Huber's 
body was found at the home of a former Californian there, it underscored the 
resentment some locals have about the migration of Californians to Prescott. . 
. . Laughs Parslow, who bought a beautiful mountain home there: "Eventually, 
Californians will take over. We do get kidded a lot, but it's mostly friendly."

 SPOKEN WORD: Noreen Ayres, whose new Orange County mystery, "Carcass Trade," 
is getting rave reviews (E4), plans to start using her own voice -- instead of 
an actress's -- for future tapes of her books. After all, says the Mission 
Viejo author, it's her voice she hears when she's writing her female forensic 
specialist, Smokey Brandon: "It's alarming to hear a line read when it's not 
delivered in the same rhythm or sense you created it in."

 PRICEY PARKING LOT: The new Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles includes 
several spectacular cars from Orange County exhibitors (E1). The most 
expensive: a 1931 Bugatti Royale -- on loan by Newport Beach developer William 
Lyon, valued at a minimum $12 million. . . . Curator Matt Roth explains that 
Bugattis were designed for crowned heads of state -- and only six of them were 
built. Says Roth: 'There's even a ranking among the six, and this one's second. 
It's valued well into eight figures."

SACRAMENTO FILE: MEASURE REPEALING OUTDATED LAWS IS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill to repeal a number of old and 
useless state laws that the Democratic author has labeled as "J.U.N.K." 
(Jurassic, Unproductive, Negligible and Knucklehead). 
</P>
<P>
 The measure (AB 3326) by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) was 
greeted with both humor and curiosity by O'Connell's colleagues as it moved 
through the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wanted dead-or-alive" criminal reward posters, penalties for dueling and 
prohibiting horses from mating unless they are located inside an enclosure so 
they can't be seen by innocent passersby are the subject matter of some of the 
repealed statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more laws are being added to the California codes," O'Connell said. 
"However, as this has been going on, it was overlooked that perhaps some of the 
previous laws were no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laws about dead-or-alive rewards and dueling no longer belong in our codes, 
they belong in our history books." GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 Bills Signed 
</P>
<P>
 * Childhood Sexual Abuse: AB 2846 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-Burlingame) eliminates the statute of limitations for the filing of 
childhood sexual abuse civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looting Penalties: AB 2965 by Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington 
Park) allows judges to require community service in addition to jail time for 
anyone convicted of looting during a state of emergency such as the riots that 
resulted from the Rodney King trial decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Towing Services: AB 3017 by Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson) 
makes it a crime for towing service operators to accept monetary kickbacks or 
gifts from automobile repair shops in return for taking disabled vehicles to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Income Taxes: AB 3389 by Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-Los Angeles) 
allows the state Franchise Tax Board to offer a voluntary bank electronic funds 
transfer program to personal income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior Whistle-Blowers: AB 2847 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-Burlingame) prohibits a continuing care facility from terminating a contract 
with a senior citizen as retaliation for the resident filing a complaint 
against the provider. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arson Fires: AB 325 by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) authorizes the 
governor to offer rewards up to $50,000 for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of people who willfully and maliciously set wild-land fires that 
cause deaths or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Architecture Penalties: AB 2702 by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad) 
increases jail terms from six months to one year for people convicted of 
practicing architecture without a state license. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Vetoed 
</P>
<P>
 * Prisoner Sex: AB 2977 by Assemblywoman Hilda Solis (D-El Monte) would make 
it a crime for peace officers to engage in sexual relations with prisoners. The 
governor said he vetoed the bill at the request of the author due to technical 
drafting errors, but promised to sign a corrected version later this year.

DRIVER MAY FACE CHARGES IN DEATH OF LYNWOOD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling its decision "extremely difficult," the Nevada Highway Patrol said 
Monday that it will seek involuntary manslaughter charges against a Lynwood 
assistant coach who was at the wheel when a van carrying her girls basketball 
team crashed, killing an 11-year-old player. 
</P>
<P>
 Trooper Steve Harney said the Clark County district attorney's office will 
decide within the next two days whether to charge Assistant Coach Michelle 
Allen in connection with the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 32, of Paramount, was the driver Saturday morning when the team van 
spun out of control on Interstate 15 about 12 miles north of Las Vegas, 
authorities said. Traffic investigators determined that Allen -- who was 
chauffeuring the team to a weekend tournament in Las Vegas -- had fallen asleep 
at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Harney said Allen apparently awakened in time to try to bring the van under 
control. Her efforts flipped the vehicle, in which only one of the 12 
passengers was wearing a seat belt, the trooper said. Tracey Myricks, a 
fifth-grader at Lynwood's Mark Twain Elementary School and a rookie member of 
the Lynwood Lady Knights, died Saturday of internal injuries at University 
Medical Center in Las Vegas after several hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine teammates, along with Coach Ellis Barfield and Allen, were injured in the 
crash. Two players -- Khaleah Smith, 12, and Naishun Jenkin, 14 -- were still 
in intensive care Monday at the hospital where Myricks died. Smith was listed 
in critical condition, and Jenkin's condition was listed as serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Harney said the decision to seek charges was based on the fatality, along with 
the failure to ensure that the passengers were wearing seat belts, as required 
by Nevada law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad situation," Harney added. "I've watched both coaches, and they 
seem to be very caring and loving, not just as coaches, but almost as parents 
-- this team is more like a family. . . . But we have to go by what the law 
says. So we're going to ask for the warrant and let the courts decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said Allen was treated for injuries sustained in the crash 
but is no longer a patient at the hospital. Harney added that Allen has stayed 
in Las Vegas since the accident, remaining at the bedside of the injured girls.

GRANTS BY '84 OLYMPICS FOUNDATION DWINDLE; ATHLETICS: THE ORGANIZATION HAS MORE 
MONEY NOW THAN IT DID AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE GAMES. OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE 
EMPHASIZING THE GROUP'S OWN SPORTS PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the 10th anniversary of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics at hand, the 
foundation that the organizing committee left behind to benefit youth sports in 
Southern California has $11 million more in assets than its original share of 
the Olympic surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The $106.8 million currently reported by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of 
Los Angeles compares to the $95.4 million it received as its one-third share of 
the profits from the '84 Games. Under the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing 
Committee's contract with the International Olympic Committee, the rest of the 
profits went to the U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. sports federations. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures demonstrate how conservatively the foundation has been spending 
its money. Recently, it has been barely satisfying federal requirements that it 
spend at least 5% of its assets each year in order to maintain its tax-exempt 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend of the foundation's grants to outside entities has been unevenly 
downward in the last few years -- from more than $5 million in its first year, 
1985, $4.2 million in 1986 and $3.4 million in 1987, to much less in the past 
three years -- $1.5 million in 1992, $1.6 million in 1993 and $1.2 million in 
the first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 According to foundation President Anita L. DeFrantz, the trend reflects 
lessons the group has learned about spending its money efficiently and also 
illustrates the foundation's desire to make a greater investment in its own 
sports programs, conferences, and administration of a sports center and library 
built on its property at 2141 W. Adams Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation recently turned down a Los Angeles County request that it give 
$250,000 for the county's pools to avoid the imposition of a $1-per-child and 
$2-per-adult daily fee for swimming. The decision was made after nearly two 
months of consideration by the foundation's staff and board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The county instituted the fees this summer in response to a budget shortfall. 
The move was met by protests that low-income families were being denied access 
to the pools. After being turned down by the Olympic foundation, the county -- 
led by the chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke -- 
successfully solicited private contributions from other sources to pay the fees 
at some of the pools. At other pools, the fees remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's refusal to aid the county came in a letter from the group's 
director of grants and programs, Keith J. Cruickshank, who explained, 
"Unfortunately, we are unable to be of assistance at this time because of our 
board's specific interest in supporting sports programs that integrate the 
components of teaching, learning and competition." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading board member, John C. Argue, explained the decision more bluntly: 
"If the AAF starts giving money to replace government programs, it would be 
throwing it down a rat hole." 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointed director of the county's Parks and Recreation Department, Rod 
Cooper, said the foundation's decision "left a void" and noted a substantial 
decline in the foundation's grants in the past five years to support equipment, 
coaching and lessons at the county's pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Negrete, a senior leader with the United Neighborhoods Organizations and 
the director of an abortive Olympic Legacy Campaign in 1985, which sought a 
major commitment by the foundation to youth programs in South-Central and East 
Los Angeles, said the foundation has a "social contract" requiring more 
assistance to economically deprived areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The foundation has done a very good job funding traditional sports-for-youth 
programs, such as boys and girls clubs and athletic leagues and competitions," 
Negrete said. "But they've not been very effective . . . in reaching youth who 
are unattached to traditional sports programs. A lot of kids get left out in 
low-income areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The pool fees added to factors that push children out of public parks, Negrete 
said. "Kids want desperately to go swimming and can't afford it under the new 
fee system." Meanwhile, he said, "the parks are slowly become dead parks, 
because of the threat of violence from the youth gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete questioned a decision made three years ago by the foundation's board 
to keep the institution going indefinitely rather than spend its money faster 
and go out of business by the year 2004. "Now, they're becoming a traditional 
bureaucracy, spending money a little at a time," Negrete said. "That means they 
are looking at their own self-interest. Maybe it's time for the community to 
re-examine the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation leaders say the decision to keep the foundation going in perpetuity 
will in the long run mean much more money for youths because of the income 
generated by investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation learned its lesson in 1985 about giving money directly to 
government, DeFrantz said, when it committed $2 million to expand operating 
hours and staffing at 328 summer recreation sites in 17 Southland cities where 
Olympic events were held in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "After reviewing how that worked, we found it wasn't truly serving kids. The 
kids weren't there, and weren't getting instruction. . . . Simply opening the 
gates of recreation centers does not make a program," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrantz said a dozen youth sports clubs that the foundation has sponsored at 
a cost of $550,000 a year, some of them in public housing projects, are a more 
useful and appropriate expenditure of funds. The sports clubs, aided by 
parental and volunteer direction, oversee competitive activities in several 
sports on a seasonal basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she added, foundation officials have concluded that county officials 
"have created a panic every year" as they seek general grants from the 
foundation to support county recreation programs. "We hear every year there's 
not enough money to open the pools, but then later we hear they have found the 
means to do so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the board of the foundation, television producer David Wolper, 
noted that the foundation has made hundreds of grants, totaling more than $28 
million, over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't cry for the county and city government and their money problems," 
Wolper said. "If they want to raise money, that's their business, not our 
business. We're not in the business of giving the city, the county and the 
state money. We did give some in the past, but we don't have to do it all the 
time." Yet, he lamented, "If we don't, we're painted as a villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolper said the foundation has frequently made grants to blind athletes, 
wheelchair athletes, sports clubs and coaching clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a critical need for every one of our programs," he said. "And we 
always get called for it when we don't give to someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolper noted that while the foundation's portfolio is larger than when it was 
formed, the amount is far less when inflation is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Olympics, which began 10 years ago Thursday, made a 
much-greater-than-expected profit. The foundation, established to disseminate 
to Southern California youth a share of that profit, adopted a mandate "to 
establish as well as revitalize sports programs for youngsters so they would 
have the opportunity to participate, learn and compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Through March 31, 1994, foundation officials reported spending a total of 
$57.3 million, with grants accounting for 49%, sports programs 18%, its Ziffern 
Sports resource center 16%, administration 11%, and facilities 6%. Despite 
these expenditures, the foundation earned enough on its investments to have a 
portfolio of $102.8 million and it valued its property at $4 million.

JACKSON CALLS TV RACIST, URGES ACTION; MEDIA: THE ACTIVIST SAYS THE NETWORKS 
NEED TO HIRE MORE MINORITIES AND RETOOL PROGRAMMING. HE THREATENS A BOYCOTT IF 
CHANGES ARE NOT MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Monday accused television networks of "institutional 
racism," and vowed to encourage viewers to boycott networks that refuse to 
schedule programs with positive ethnic images or do not place minorities in key 
decision-making positions. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in South-Central Los Angeles, Jackson said the newly 
formed Rainbow Coalition Commission on Fairness in the Media has become 
increasingly concerned over what he called the significant lack of 
representation of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans 
and women among network news anchors, prime-time entertainment writing staffs 
and in prominent roles that do not involve criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have written the networks letters, and the response, by and large, has 
been defensive as they attempt to justify what is unjustifiable," Jackson said. 
"While we're willing to talk, we're also willing to walk. It's now time for 
aggressive direct action." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he was particularly disturbed by the cancellation of several 
black-oriented shows on Fox, including "South Central," "Roc," "In Living 
Color" and "The Sinbad Show," adding that there did not seem to be much change 
in the upcoming fall season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that significant shows were cut off from Fox this season, and that is 
of great concern to us," Jackson said. "We look at the data we have on NBC. It 
is substantial. It is ugly. We look at the projected format for CBS this fall. 
In the real sense, all of them are recycling racist practices. It is called 
institutional racism. It is manifest not only in their hiring, but in their 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Fox, NBC, CBS and ABC could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the news conference and in a separate interview with The Times, Jackson 
compared his campaign to the historic march in Selma, Ala., and other civil 
rights demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 He decried the lack of coverage of minorities during the recent D-day 
celebrations. Blacks are woefully absent during Sunday public affairs shows, he 
added. "Those all-white hosts determine their guests and set the political 
agenda for public policy for Monday morning. That's not America." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the commission is researching network hiring practices and the 
portrayal of minorities, and would present those findings during a workshop in 
September. At that time, offending networks will be targeted for action, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think they have the right to not include us in recruitment, hiring, 
promotion, projection, decision making," Jackson said. "But we have consumer 
power, we have viewer power, we have the power to change dials. We will do just 
that until there is a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boycotts would start in September," he said. "The networks have time now 
to get their house in order. They can begin to change now." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the news conference at the African American Community Unity Center 
were Brotherhood Crusade founder Danny Bakewell and comedian Sinbad. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakewell said he has also given a mandate to local TV stations to hire more 
minorities. He complained that there was not one black anchor of a local 
weeknight newscast. 
</P>

 "These things must change, and we are going to bring that about, and we are 
serious that we will see that action as we progress this fall," Bakewell said.

COUPLE'S DREAM HOUSE BECOMES AN ALL-TOO-COMMON NIGHTMARE; REAL ESTATE: DARREL 
AND CAROL SWENDENER CAN'T SELL THEIR HILLTOP HOME. A SOFT MARKET SHACKLES 
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each time he approaches his Northridge dream house on the hill, Darrel 
Swendener sees the signs of his growing discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 First, outside the driveway is the for-sale sign that has perched like a 
vulture for more than two years -- a warning that something is not quite right 
here. And the same clanking realtor's lockbox clings to his front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, he and his wife, Carol, keep the house spotless -- a necessity in the 
event of a realtor's ambush at most any hour of the day or night. That means no 
dirty dishes, no half-filled coffee cups left on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the browsers with the white gloves and video cameras who wander 
through the bedrooms and bathrooms with their real estate agent guide, all of 
them asking nosy questions, making unfair assumptions, judging the Swendeners 
as much as they're sizing up their house. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of years it has gone on, the ebb and flow of would-be buyers who 
always seem to find something wrong: The price is too high. There's no swimming 
pool. Geez, the grass isn't exactly the right color. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Swendeners, who bought the 2,730-square-foot home in 1989, the 
rejections are little insults that have become one big hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living in a model home -- it's just not ours anymore," Carol, 57, 
says, sitting in the kitchen of the hillside home with a 280-degree panorama of 
the twinkling San Fernando Valley lights below, a view that some days can 
stretch for 50 miles or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch them come and go, and you finally ask yourself, 'What's wrong with 
my house? I love this place.' You finally decide that your house has a jinx, a 
little black cloud hovering overhead that chases people away." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, that cloud rained more bad news: The couple suffered $60,000 
damage during the Northridge earthquake. They only placed their home back on 
the market in late June after Darrel spent months playing fix-it man. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the couple is watching the clock. Arthritis has forced both into early 
retirement. In a few months, they won't be able to afford the mortgage on the 
house they thought they would own through retirement. Now there's no choice but 
to let their dream home go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swendeners are among thousands of anxious Southern California homeowners 
dragging an A-framed ball and chain -- a house that refuses to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 While 1993 brought a modest rise in the number of homes sold statewide, 
realtors warn that the market remains soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homes are selling slightly faster, but prices are dropping -- the end result 
is that there's less money changing hands," said Joe Andrews, co-owner of 
Century 21 All Properties in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Across the state, we're hearing that homes are sitting on the market for 
longer periods of time," Andrews said. "And if they do sell, owners are 
settling for significantly less." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, according to statistics from the California Assn. of Realtors, 
437,710 existing single-family homes were sold throughout the state, a 2.2% 
rise from 1992, which saw sales of 428,170. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sales pace of the first five months of 1994 continues until year's end, 
statistics show, California would see 502,790 homes sold, a rate that would be 
the highest in five years. By comparison, in the peak years of 1988 and 1989, 
statistics show, 562,240 and 539,290 homes sold respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The local picture is similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in the San Fernando Valley, for example, 10,506 homes and 
condominiums were sold, a 7.1% rise from 1992, which saw sales of 9,805, 
according to statistics from the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, however, the average price of a single-family home 
dropped 10.9%, from $283,386 to $252,633, representing the third year of 
decline. And so far this year, sales of homes and condos are up by 24%; but the 
average price of a single-family residence is down 11% from last year, to 
$231,283. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sobering statistics point to several factors at work in the market. For 
one, realtors say, banks are selling hundreds of houses at half the going rate 
in an effort to recoup investments on foreclosed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing the homeowner has to deal with," said Tom Morehouse, owner 
of Century 21 in Chatsworth. "Banks have 20 or 30 properties to sell at once 
and they blow them all out with real low prices. It's hard for the homeowner to 
compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners, especially those who bought their houses during the 1980s 
boom and hoped for huge profits, are asking too much, market watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seller then blames the agent when his house doesn't sell," Andrews said. 
"They tell you, 'Do something!' But these people have to realize, if their 
asking price is realistic to begin with, they're going to sell their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrel Swendener says that argument makes his blood boil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The realtors aren't making any money," said the 58-year-old former Sears 
employee. "So they walk right in and say, 'Drop the price.' They're only 
thinking of their commissions. Meanwhile, they're driving the price of every 
house in the area down, down, down. There's no bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $340,000 for his house in 1989, Swendener put it on the market in 
1992 for $579,950. Later the price dropped to $470,000. Slowly, like the 
thermometer dropping on a cool autumn night, the asking price plummeted to its 
current level: $335,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assured that if we dropped the price it would sell immediately," 
Swendener said. "We followed instructions. And nobody even looked at the 
place!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Swendeners are no newcomers to the Southern California housing market. 
They made big profits on two previous homes. But with the Northridge house, 
Darrel says, they made one big mistake: They invested $100,000 in improvements, 
money they'll probably never see again. 
</P>
<P>
 So they sit and wait. Then they can move to Oregon and settle in a more 
affordable community. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, they have to endure the lookers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without knocking, one woman walked in on a naked Darrel as he showered in the 
master bedroom. Another offered Carol cash -- not for the house -- but for the 
Christmas tree ornaments she had made. 
</P>
<P>
 But the end, they know, is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, someone will make the right offer on their dream home. Then they'll 
be free to go -- with tears in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, it's been like living with a cancer patient," Darrel said. 
"There's been a lot of pain. We want the end to come. But, when it does, we 
know it's going to hurt even more."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTLAKE; POLICE SEEK 
HELP IN HUNT FOR DRIVER WHO KILLED BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Monday asked for help in finding the hit-and-run driver whose car 
fatally injured a 5-year-old boy crossing a street in the Westlake area to get 
ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Davila was struck about 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Westlake Avenue and 11th 
Place, said Los Angeles Police Detective Sonia Cabrera of the Central Traffic 
Division. The car, which sped southbound on Westlake Avenue, may have been a 
taxi, Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was described as a yellow, four-door, mid-1980s to 1990 Chevrolet Nova or 
Caprice, with two chrome, police-style spotlights at the tops of the fenders 
near the windshield. It had a glass divider behind the driver's seat and there 
were two passengers in the back seat, Cabrera said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COLLEGE 
REAL ESTATE DEAL WAS SOUND, GRAND JURY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the Los Angeles Community College District generally followed 
sound business practices last year when they decided to sell a Mid-Wilshire 
building and replace it by leasing a Downtown site for administrative offices, 
the Los Angeles County grand jury has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report scheduled for discussion at the district's Board of Trustees 
meeting on Wednesday, the 1993-94 grand jury said the lease terms of the 
Downtown site, at 770 Wilshire Blvd., were "so favorable that the district will 
be able to save money in the initial years of the lease" even while continuing 
to make payments on the Mid-Wilshire building.However, the panel, which 
conducted its review with the help of the Price Waterhouse auditing firm, 
recommended that the district review its policies for obtaining space and hire 
a professional relocation consultant for future needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The district bought the building at 4050 Wilshire Blvd. late in 1990 for $12.5 
million but never moved in. A rapidly softening real estate market and a chance 
to cut operating costs during the state's recession led trustees to authorize 
the building switch in the spring of 1993. The swap became a issue in board 
elections that spring.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; JPL 
STRUCTURES DEDICATED AS HISTORIC LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three structures that have helped NASA vault unmanned craft into space, two of 
them in Pasadena, became national historic landmarks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication was held at one of the landmarks: the Space Flight Operations 
Facility, which serves as mission control center for NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena.It was built in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scale of achievements of NASA's planetary exploration program over the 
past 30 years is astounding," David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of the 
National Park Service, said at the ceremony. "Our efforts to land a man on the 
moon, investigate the near-Earth environment and explore the planets and the 
solar system were supported from a technological base that reflected a depth 
and variety of support facilities unprecedented in American history." 
</P>
<P>
 The second new landmark, the space simulator, was built at JPL in 1962. It 
tested the spacecraft that made the first successful interplanetary flight to 
Venus on Aug. 27, 1962. It is the only NASA facility that can replicate the 
conditions of cold, solar radiation and an extreme vacuum to test spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The third is the 85-foot Pioneer Station antenna at the Goldstone Tracking 
Station near Barstow, the first antenna in the worldwide Deep Space Network, 
which began operating in December, 1958. It was named for the Pioneer, the 
first U.S. spacecraft to escape Earth's gravity. JPL developed and operates the 
Deep Space Network for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the accepted threshold for considering a property historic is that it 
be at least 50 years old, the three structures' "exceptional significance in 
the history of space exploration qualifies them for landmark status," 
Gackenbach said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; $7.6-MILLION 
LOTTERY WINNER GOES BACK TO HIS PRINT SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With many of the trappings of the rich life his for the taking, from 
penthouses to Rolls Royces to round-the-world cruises, Tony Mastello on Monday 
redeemed the state lottery ticket that won him $7.6 million and headed back to 
work at his print shop. 
</P>
<P>
 He will go on working because he likes to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to do anything, but I like what I'm doing," said Mastellos, 61, 
owner of a printing and graphics company. "It's a comfortable, easy business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my feeling is if I go traveling, playing golf, I can't do this 
every day. I need something to do. I enjoy what I do. I can't see giving it up. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Mastellos said he tossed and turned for most of Sunday night after learning 
that he held the winning number, pondering whether to close the shop he has 
owned since 1965. Along with his satisfaction with his work, "I still have a 
responsibility to my clients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A regular lottery player who bought $5 worth of tickets every Friday, 
Mastellos said he plans to use his winnings to fund the college educations of 
his nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether buying Super Lotto tickets was the most fortuitous move of 
his life, Mastellos paused and responded, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having five daughters was the luckiest thing I ever did."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTMINSTER; ASIAN BONE 
MARROW DONORS SOUGHT FOR BOY, 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles-based organization Monday sought prospective Asian donors for a 
4-year-old Westminster boy who needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 None of John Adam Le's family members are compatible donors for the 
transplant, which the child needs to overcome aplastic anemia, a rare and fatal 
blood disease, said Jennifer Sugimoto of Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Marrow Donor Program has more than 1.2 million volunteer donors 
in its registry, but only 54,000 are of Asian descent and it is easiest to find 
a compatible donor within a patient's ethnic group, Sugimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the boy's doctor, Joel Weinthal of Children's Hospital of Orange 
County, told her that without a transplant, John only has a 50% chance of 
living more than another six months. The boy's parents said their son began to 
exhibit symptoms such as inactivity, constant tiredness and easy bruising in 
February. He was pale and had bruises all over his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches will test prospective donors from 5 to 8:30 
p.m. Saturday at La Purisima Church, 11712 Hewes Ave. in Orange, Sugimoto said. 
Potential donors must be 18 to 55 years old.

HIGH-PROFILE; GLAZIERS ARE RESETTING NEARLY 8,000 PANES OF GLASS TO PLUG LEAKS 
THAT HAVE PLAGUED L.A. SKYSCRAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite heat, wind and chill, the gang up at Beaudry Center plans to hang in 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a group of 50 glass installers who are spending eight months 
suspended from the side of the 29-story office building in one of the most 
unusual repair jobs that Downtown Los Angeles has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangling on 22 platforms, workers are plugging leaks that have plagued the 
building since it opened 10 years ago. That means resetting and resealing each 
of the 7,960 panes of glass that form its sleek, black skin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time they are checking for hidden earthquake damage and for any 
potential problems with the building's insulation and fireproofing. And they 
are installing new light-colored vertical window frames -- called mullions -- 
to give the building a taller and more modern look. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the place is already plenty tall for some of the installers -- 
known as glaziers in the construction trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Worker Fred Rivero's attitude about altitude was as transparent as the 
six-foot piece of glass he was pulling from a 15th-floor window frame at the 
high-rise the other day. He has been at it for two months already. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a phobia about it," Rivero admitted, glancing nervously toward 
Harbor Freeway traffic roaring below. "There's no getting used to heights." 
</P>
<P>
 He will have plenty of time to try, though. At the rate the project is going, 
it may take until the first of next year to finish the undertaking that began 
May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The job has attracted glaziers from San Diego to Victorville who are happy to 
be working anywhere during the current recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between Window E down at the unemployment office and this window here, I'll 
take this one," said Rivero, 43, who drives to work each morning from 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 But the repairs are also attracting plenty of attention from passersby. The 
hanging platforms have caused some to wonder whether a school for 
window-washers is being run at the high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the building primarily houses bankers and data processors, said John 
J. O'Brien, development manager for the company that owns the structure. Bank 
of America workers are moving in, replacing employees of Security Pacific Bank 
who formerly occupied most of it. A group of East Coast investors that owns the 
building will not divulge how much the repairs are costing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the 3,000 office workers inside, glass installers have to do most 
of their work from the outside, said project coordinator Charles W. French of 
Dallas-based Curtain Wall Design & Consulting Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards are assigned to stand inside in front of office windows when glass is 
removed by workers on the platforms, French said. Down below, tunnel-like 
safety scaffolding covers sidewalks that ring the triangular building bordered 
by Beaudry Avenue and 3rd and 4th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "spotters" with walkie-talkies are stationed on the ground. They 
keep pedestrians away if workers above warn by radio that they have encountered 
cracked windows that may be at risk of shattering when removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 4-by-6-foot tinted pane weighs about 75 pounds. It takes two men using 
suction-cup handles to lift it out once window frames have been disassembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Makeshift leak-patching in past years has glued some windows tightly to their 
frames, however. It takes an additional two men inside to help muscle them 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the platform workers wears a safety harness attached to a line that is 
independent of the cables suspending them from the high-rise roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Most glaziers quickly learn the ropes, said Tom Toth, superintendent for Model 
Glass Inc. of Anaheim, the project's contractor. After a while, the majority of 
them stop worrying about falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realize if you're going to be out there four floors up, you may as well 
be 40 floors up," Toth said.

TIPS ON FRAUD HOT LINE LEAD TO THE DISCIPLINING OF 25 COUNTY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five Los Angeles County employees -- including a group who filed bogus 
claims for emergency food stamps after the Northridge quake -- were disciplined 
during the past three months as a result of anonymous tips on the county's 
employee fraud hot line, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting, in a quarterly report from the county auditor-controller's 
office, reflected an especially busy month for the five-year-old "tattler" hot 
line, according to assistant auditor controller Mike Galindo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the cases just involve things like time abuse -- somebody taking a 
three-hour lunch, or leaving early on a continual basis," Galindo said. "But 
this quarter, we had some more serious things, in part because of the (Jan. 17) 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Galindo said that during the three-month period, the auditor-controller's 
office substantiated 29 allegations from among 107 hot-line tips. The 
investigations prompted the firings of 12 county employees and the resignations 
or suspensions of 13 others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * The firing or resignations of nine Department of Public Social Services 
employees who filed false Federal Emergency Management Agency claims for 
emergency food stamps after the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * The firing of an unidentified county employee for making $6,000 worth of 
telephone calls to Bolivia from a county phone. Galindo said the man, who faces 
possible criminal charges, had worked for the county treasurer's office and the 
Department of Children's Services, and was caught in a routine telephone bill 
audit after officials noticed an inordinate number of international calls being 
placed on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * The firing of a library employee who confessed to stealing nearly $16,000 
worth of videotapes and other taxpayer-owned items. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cancellation of contract duties for a privately contracted employee in 
the Department of Parks and Recreation after he engaged in bestiality at a 
county equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
 * The firing of two DPSS employees and resignation of a third for "engaging in 
inappropriate conduct with a client." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line, which is aimed at pinpointing and deterring wrongdoing by county 
employees, was set up at the request of Supervisor Mike Antonovich in 1989

LAPD INVESTIGATES OFFICERS OVER FALSE ALARM DATA; POLICE: A BURGLAR ALARM 
COMPANY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFORMATION GIVEN TO THE CITY COUNCIL, WHICH IS 
CONSIDERING A CRACKDOWN ON BOGUS CALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Following a complaint by a burglar alarm company, the Los Angeles Police 
Department has launched an Internal Affairs investigation into allegations that 
police have knowingly used bogus data to persuade the City Council to adopt a 
law that clamps down on false alarm calls. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city and alarm industry officials, the information in dispute is 
contained in a police study that says the LAPD spent $8.5 million last year in 
service hours responding to the 161,000 security alarm calls. During the same 
period, the police study said the city collected about $5.7 million in revenues 
from alarm system permits and false alarm fines, leaving a deficit of $2.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives Richard Rudell and Jack Hosford, the two officers who have gathered 
information on the false alarm problem for the council, confirmed Monday that 
LAPD officials had notified them of the investigation. They said their 
information came from the department's fiscal operations division. "I can only 
report what I'm told," Hosford said. They dismissed the allegations, saying 
their data are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Siegel, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn., 
said he does not know which burglar alarm company made the complaint that 
triggered the investigation. The association is not accusing police of 
wrongdoing, he said, but is seeking more information on how the data was 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the police-backed ordinance proposed by Councilman Marvin Braude, police 
would not respond to automated burglar alarm calls unless a break-in is 
verified by a building occupant, the alarm company, a security guard or video 
surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudell called the allegations "a political thing" raised by the burglar alarm 
industry to delay the adoption of an ordinance that could increase the cost of 
owning an alarm system in the city because of equipment or personnel needed to 
verify break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute is the latest twist in an increasingly heated battle between 
police, who complain that responding to false alarms takes them away from crime 
fighting, and the alarm industry, which fears that the proposed law can hurt 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say tough laws are needed because 95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made 
last year in Los Angeles were false and accounted for 18% of all police service 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Affairs investigation was brought to light at a Monday meeting of 
the council's Public Safety Committee when Councilwoman Laura Chick asked 
police and city officials to confirm the rumors of an investigation. An 
attorney for the city told Chick that such matters could not be discussed in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudell and Hosford said they do not know who made the complaint or what the 
specific allegations are. All they know, the detectives said, is that they are 
accused of distributing inaccurate information on the false alarm problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Eric Lillo of the department's Internal Affairs division confirmed that 
his unit was investigating "a call, perhaps a letter" complaining about the 
information that police have distributed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lillo added that as a matter of practice, Internal Affairs investigates 
all complaints against police officers. "It doesn't mean that the department 
concludes that the allegations are correct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick made it clear during Monday's meeting that she believes that the 
detectives have tried to provide accurate data. She accused alarm company 
officials of making the complaint to slow the city's efforts to reduce the 
number of false alarm calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole complaint issue is further evidence that they are not willing to 
work with us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire City Council will consider the ordinance next week.

 Machine Tool Orders Up 17.4% in June: Orders also jumped 20% for the first 
half of 1994 from the same period a year ago, an industry trade group said. The 
Assn. for Manufacturing Technology announced that June orders for U.S.-made 
machine tools totaled $379.2 million, compared to $322.9 million in May and 
$313.7 million in June, 1993.Orders for the first six months of 1994 totaled 
$2.12 billion, an increase from $1.77 billion for the first half of 1993, the 
group said. "Late last year, most forecasters were predicting a relatively flat 
order rate for the first six months of '94," said Albert W. Moore, president of 
the McLean, Va.-based association. "In light of this, the 20% increase 
year-on-year through June is welcome news."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW CLIMBS 6.8 AS INVESTORS PONDER RATES 
</P>

 Stocks crawled to a mostly higher close Monday as investors studied corporate 
earnings and pondered the Federal Reserve Board's next move on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most popular market measures managed to eke out minor gains, with the Dow 
Jones industrial average rising 6.80 points to 3,741.84. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, rising issues nosed out declines by about 30 issues on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume slowed to 213.47 million shares from 
261.60 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a unifying theme to give the market direction, concerns 
about rising interest rates continued to preoccupy investors. Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's remarks last week that the central bank might tighten credit policy 
another notch in the near future put the financial markets on guard for another 
possible rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from some nibbling in blue chips, traders complained of a general lack 
of investor interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Technical analyst Alfred E. Goldman of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. described the 
session as a time out after a fairly steady market advance since the Fourth of 
July holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a pretty good party since the Fourth of July, and now we're having 
a normal period of profit taking and consolidation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks couldn't count on the bond market to establish a trend for trading. 
Treasury bond yields drifted lower in very thin trading as traders and 
investors braced for a fresh batch of intermediate government notes scheduled 
to be auctioned today and Wednesday. Bond traders were worried that demand 
might be weak for the $17.25 billion in two-year notes and $11 billion in 
five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield fell to 7.52% from the previous session's 7.56%, 
pushing up the price, which moves in the opposite direction, 3/8 point, or 
$3.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts traced some of the bond price's increase to expectations that the Fed 
will move soon to raise short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 With the earnings season in full swing, investors reacted to the latest batch 
of quarterly financial reports. Oil companies posted mostly gloomy results as 
lower crude and natural gas prices impaired profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM, which surprised Wall Street last week with stronger-than-expected 
earnings, ended up 3/4 at 62 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell Douglas fell 3 3/4 to 111 1/4 after the company said it is testing 
the market for a possible new 100-seat commercial jet. Salomon Bros. downgraded 
the stock to "hold" from "buy," saying development of the jet will cost $500 
million and that the plane would compete in an already-crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exxon ended up 1/2 to 58 3/8 despite reporting lower earnings, which it 
attributed to lower crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other oil companies reporting lower earnings, Texaco finished 
unchanged at 63 and Atlantic Richfield slipped 7/8 to 107.  
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, meanwhile, American Brands rose 1 1/2 to 34 1/8 on the New 
York Stock Exchange after the company's quarterly figures impressed Wall 
Street. American Brands said its second-quarter profit rose 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 * US West rose 5/8 to 40 7/8 and AirTouch Communications rose 1/8 to 26 after 
they announced an agreement to combine their domestic cellular operations, 
creating one of the nation's biggest wireless telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed performances by foreign markets provided Wall Street no consistent 
course to follow. Tokyo stocks ended lower, with the 225-share Nikkei average 
ended down 165.23 points at 20,297.66. In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
average closed at 2,136.22 million, and London's Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 8.6 points to 3,106.1.

EVOLOVING WIRELESS WORLD; AIRTOUCH, US WEST TO MERGE DOMESTIC CELLULAR 
OPERATIONS; DEALS: THE UNION WOULD CREATE THE NATION'S THIRD-LARGEST WIRELESS 
COMPANY, WITH ASSETS OF $13.5 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Joining the small club of companies seeking to become national wireless 
communications providers, the former Pacific Telesis subsidiary AirTouch 
Communications announced Monday that it will merge its domestic cellular 
telephone operations with those of the regional Bell telephone company US West. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would create a joint operation with assets valued at $13.5 billion. 
It would be the nation's third-largest wireless communications company, with 
franchise areas covering 53 million people, mostly in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement comes on the heels of a similar cellular merger 
announced last month by Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two East Coast regional phone 
companies. AirTouch was rumored to be a potential third partner to that deal. 
Analysts say it is now unlikely that the two coastal giants will merge, though 
they might reach a looser cooperation agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have built the platform from which we are confident we can create a 
national presence," said Sam Ginn, chairman and CEO of AirTouch. "Customers 
want wireless (phones) to work not just in their neighborhood or community, but 
globally." 
</P>
<P>
 The complex deal calls for the two cellular companies to operate under a joint 
management company but remain independent until certain regulatory restraints 
are removed. AirTouch would own 70% of the new, Walnut Creek-based management 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch and US West would also establish a 50-50 venture to jointly bid in 
upcoming Federal Communications Commission auctions for personal communications 
services licenses. These licenses will be used to offer a new kind of pocket 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner, in which US West has a 25% stake, may also invest in the PCS 
joint venture, Ginn said. AirTouch's former sister company, Pacific Bell, 
announced earlier this month that it also intends to bid on PCS licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional Bell operating companies are responding to growing competition in 
the wireless arena from national players such as McCaw Cellular, soon to be 
acquired by AT&T, and Nextel, in which MCI Communications has a major stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In telecommunications today, you have to either get big or get out," said 
Herschel Shostek, head of a Maryland-based wireless communications research 
company. Although the new deal specifically excludes overseas cellular 
properties, Shostek said the new joint venture strengthens AirTouch and US 
West's profile as the companies continue their expansion into international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new coalition has obvious weaknesses at home. It has no recognizable 
national brand name and no position in key eastern markets such as New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the two companies said they will move quickly to fill in the 
gaps by making alliances and acquiring smaller players. US West Chief Executive 
Richard McCormick said the new venture's scale will help attract new partners. 
Under the AirTouch-US West agreement, the two firms' cellular operations would 
remain nominally separate but would be managed by a joint "wireless management 
company" on an "as-if-merged basis," Ginn said. The management company would 
act as a sort of headquarters for both the cellular operations and the PCS 
joint venture, providing general direction as well as support services on a 
contract basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two operations would be merged either when US West received a waiver to 
the consent decree governing the 1984 Bell System break-up, or at the latest, 
four years from now. The consent decree prevents Bell operating companies from 
offering long-distance services, for example, meaning that long-distance calls 
from a US West cellular system must be handed off to a long-distance company. 
AirTouch was spun off from Pacific Telesis in part to avoid these constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 US West would have the right to convert its 30% share in the cellular joint 
venture into AirTouch common stock within 10 years after the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch stock rose 12.5 cents Monday to $26 and US West gained 62.5 cents to 
close at $40.87 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

NME ADMITS RESPONSIBILITY IN GIRL'S SUICIDE; HEALTH CARE: THE COMPANY'S 
EXTRAORDINARY ACKNOWLEDGMENT IS MADE IN AN OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In an extraordinary admission of corporate responsibility, a National Medical 
Enterprises unit has acknowledged that it was responsible for the 1992 death of 
a 13-year-old girl who killed herself at a company-owned psychiatric facility 
in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first admission of responsibility in any of the nearly 150 lawsuits 
alleging physical mistreatment and abuse of patients that NME has faced since 
the late 1980s. The Santa Monica-based hospital firm has settled about 75% of 
those cases but had never admitted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 NME's admission came in an out-of-court settlement reached Friday in a lawsuit 
filed in 1993 by Robert and Merry Scheck of San Diego, whose daughter, Christy, 
killed herself at Southwood Psychiatric Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen (an admission of responsibility) before" in a medical 
negligence case, said Michael Coleman, a San Diego attorney who represented the 
Schecks. He said the admission was the key condition for the Schecks to accept 
a settlement and not pursue the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed by either party. The case 
had been scheduled to go to trial in San Diego County Superior Court this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Seltzer, an Oakland attorney who also represented the Schecks, would 
describe the settlement figure only as "a lot" of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Scheck was an honors student and all-star soccer and baseball player 
at Horace Mann Middle School in East San Diego. In 1991, after the deaths of 
two family members and a teacher, she started "acting out," the Schecks said. 
She ran away from home and was caught shoplifting. After she tried to slash her 
wrists, her parents admitted her to Southwood because they feared for her 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after she was admitted, Christy used a bathrobe sash to hang 
herself at a Southwood facility. She died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, before the settlement, Seltzer said he was going to 
argue in court that Christy's death was the result of negligence, mismanagement 
and "outrageous and despicable" conduct on the part of Southwood and 
Psychiatric Institutes of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our claim was that they were cutting back so much on costs to keep the stock 
price up that it created chaos in Southwood," he said. The lawsuit contended 
that, to save money, the Southwood staff was made up largely of inexperienced 
and under-qualified workers, including part-time employees and student interns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were obsessed with the profitability of each facility," Seltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fairbank, a Los Angeles attorney representing NME, said Psychiatric 
Institutes began a cost-reduction program in 1991 -- about a year before 
Christy entered Southwood -- in response to economic pressures in the mental 
health industry. "But we believe that her death was not affected in any way by 
the cost-containment program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, NME settled a federal fraud investigation of its psychiatric and 
substance abuse hospitals by paying $379 million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his family's case, Robert Scheck, a career Navy enlistee, said: "There will 
never be a right (settlement) amount. There is no price that could take my 
daughter's place. But in this way, a large company has taken the proper blame 
for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Merry Scheck: "We placed our daughter in their care for her safety. . . . 
(The settlement) gives a certain satisfaction -- I'm not sure satisfaction is 
the right word -- but it's the closest I can come." 
</P>
<P>
 In negotiating the deal, the Schecks insisted that the defendants -- Southwood 
and Psychiatric Institutes of America, NME's former psychiatric division -- 
acknowledge their responsibility. The agreement also stipulates that the 
Schecks be allowed to talk about the case, other than the financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to settle, NME attorney Fairbank said, had little to do with the 
company's desire to avoid the unfavorable publicity of a trial or because NME 
feared losing the case. "We settled this case because we are accepting 
responsibility for this tragic incident," he said.

A JOB STILL TO BE DONE; FOR MANY, DISABILITIES ACT HASN'T LIVED UP TO PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many foresaw a social revolution two years ago when the sweeping civil rights 
law called the Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the nation's 
larger workplaces. But for people such as Linda Sturgeon, 41, who suffers from 
disabling muscular dystrophy, freedom from job discrimination remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturgeon says she could not get her old job back last year when -- after 
having worked for her local telephone company in Rochester, N.Y., for 21 years 
-- she took a five-month leave to recover from injuries suffered in an auto 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Lonny H. Dolin, contends that the company, which calls the 
situation "complicated," rebuffed Sturgeon because it wanted to eliminate the 
supposed extra costs of employing a disabled worker. Dolin said the pending 
legal dispute exemplifies the "truest reason" why the ADA, as the 
anti-discrimination statute is known, has been needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the law, which expands today to cover workplaces with as few as 15 
employees, is far from fulfilling one of its central promises: to bring 
disabled adults into the mainstream of American life by removing barriers to 
getting jobs. In California -- where state law has long protected people with 
disabilities at firms with as few as five employees -- the ADA has mainly 
heightened awareness of workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the ADA has so far benefited only "a small group of people," said 
Guy Wallace, an employment discrimination specialist with Disability Rights 
Advocates, a nonprofit group in Oakland. With discrimination so deep-seated, he 
said, "it's going to take a while to make any headway." 
</P>
<P>
 Figures are scarce on how extensive joblessness is among the disabled, a group 
the federal government broadly defines to include nearly 49 million people. But 
according to a poll released last week by Louis Harris & Associates and the 
National Organization on Disability, two-thirds of working-age Americans with 
disabilities are jobless -- roughly the same level a similar survey found eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Disability rights activists hope the pace of change will soon pick up. With 
the ADA's expansion today, 86% of the work force will be covered. Under the 
previous cutoff level -- firms with at least 25 employees -- the law covered 
77% of U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major employers, including many that two years ago feared lawsuits and 
high expenses from making required "reasonable accommodations" for disabled 
workers, the reviews on the ADA are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have there been screams of pain? No," said Susan Meisinger, a lawyer with the 
Society for Human Resource Management, a national association of personnel 
specialists. She quickly added, however, that there have been "pockets of 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 And although some employers complain about the sheer number of ADA cases, 
disability-related claims filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission are still far less frequent than those alleging race and sex 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long run, advocates for the disabled say, the ADA's benefits to 
society will far outweigh any burden on employers. "What's burdensome is paying 
$100 billion a year in welfare to people who should be working," Wallace said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet ADA critics contend that the law has both failed to help the disabled and 
led to unjustified lawsuits against employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another law that people use when they are unhappy about being 
terminated," Los Angeles management lawyer Frank Cronin said, citing government 
figures showing that the largest number of ADA suits are filed by people who 
claim they were fired illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts contend that the broadening of the ADA's reach will open up nasty 
new legal battlefields. Big companies, the argument goes, typically have 
human-resources specialists and lawyers to coach them on how to adapt to the 
ADA. But small firms, they say, often lack the sophistication to stay on top of 
changes in employment law, making them potential targets for lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the disabled counter that, in most cases, wrongful-termination 
cases and other employment claims stem from genuine abuses by employers 
unwilling to accommodate disabled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolin said her client, Sturgeon, found herself in just such circumstances when 
she tried to return to work as a repair service clerk at Rochester Telephone in 
April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturgeon, as someone who occasionally needs help entering the office and 
getting in and out of her wheelchair, "is seen as a problem" by the company, 
Dolin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been taken away from me," Sturgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rochester Telephone spokeswoman declined to comment in detail. She said 
Sturgeon technically remains an employee and that, as a matter of policy, the 
company does not discuss legal claims by employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolin, a prominent disability plaintiffs lawyer, contends that enlightened 
employers can avoid such disputes. She cited another Rochester-based employer, 
Paychex Inc., and the way it has worked with John Hoyle, a quadriplegic who is 
a computer analyst with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyle, a onetime competitive swimmer who was disabled when he broke his neck 
in a diving accident, said the company's job interviewers were "very gracious" 
when he applied for work -- they did such things as remove a chair from the 
interview room so he would not have a problem entering in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hoyle landed the job, Paychex supplied him with a wireless telephone 
headset and equipped the employee entrance so he could open the door by remote 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Hoyle said, at the company he is "on an equal footing with 
co-workers. . . . To me, that's the greatest reward." Boom in Disability 
Discrimination Cases 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the 
workplace, disability-related claims have mounted. Here are employment 
discrimination charges received by the federal government during the first half 
of its current fiscal year. Race: 14,442 Sex: 11,817 Age: 8,982 Disability: 
8,669 National origin: 3,530 Religion: 656 Equal pay: 634

EVOLOVING WIRELESS WORLD; BIDS EXCEED ALL EXPECTATIONS AT AIRWAVE AUCTION; 
COMMUNICATIONS: SIX FIRMS OFFER A TOTAL OF $145 MILLION FOR LICENSES TO PROVIDE 
NEW WIRELESS SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The federal government's first-ever auction of the airwaves drew bids far in 
excess of expectations Monday, with six companies offering more than $145 
million for licenses to provide a new generation of wireless communications 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with cellular phone links to their advisers, representatives of 29 
bidding companies anxiously paced the floor of the Omni Shorham Hotel and 
competed aggressively for the 10 nationwide licenses available for a wireless 
technology called narrow-band personal communications service. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction, held by the Federal Communications Commission, is the first in a 
series of controversial sales involving more than 4,000 wireless communications 
licenses over the next five years. Experts had predicted the sales would 
ultimately raise $7 billion to $10 billion for the federal government, but the 
aggressive bidding Monday suggests the ultimate return could be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's auction is not expected to end until midweek, jubilant 
government officials were already declaring it a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
 "This far exceeds any expectation that any auction theorist had projected," 
said U.S. Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), who chairs the powerful House 
Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee. No one, he added, had 
"contemplated anything of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 By the third round late Monday, bids for each of the 10 licenses exceeded $6.5 
million, with one company offering $50 million for a pair of nationwide 
licenses. Contestants, who bid anonymously on computer terminals, hope to use 
the radio frequencies to offer a variety of services, including two-way paging, 
wireless voice messaging and data transmission using portable devices no larger 
than a cigarette pack. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC, which historically has awarded communications licenses by lottery or 
administrative hearings that chose applicants on the basis of their ability to 
serve the public interest, said it would identify victors later this week.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to narrow-band PCS, the FCC this week will also auction about 600 
licenses for interactive video and data services, a wireless service that will 
provide an electronic return path that viewers can use to respond to what they 
watch on television. The IVDS auction, to be conducted in traditional oral 
outcry fashion, will begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's auctions are forerunners of the sale next year of licenses for 
even more advanced wireless services: so-called broad-band PCS, an alternative 
to cellular telephones, and multi-point distribution service, a wireless video 
service that can provide interactive TV, data transmission and telephone 
service.

 USAir Pilots Prepare an Offer: The union representing the pilots said it will 
offer the struggling carrier $750 million in wage concessions in return for 
part ownership.The cuts would be spread over five years, with the pilots 
contributing about a third of the $500 million in annual savings USAir is 
seeking from employees. The Air Line Pilots Assn. said its offer is contingent 
on a financial restructuring of USAir that would include the infusion of new 
operating funds. British Airways has halted new investments in the airline 
until it works out new deals with its employees.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW CLIMBS 6.8 AS INVESTORS PONDER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks crawled to a mostly higher close Monday as investors studied corporate 
earnings reports and pondered the Federal Reserve Board's next potential move 
on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 6.80 points to 3,741.84, and most 
broader indexes also closed with small gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume was typically slow for a summer Monday, at just 213 million shares on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board winners and losers were nearly even. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from some nibbling in blue chips, traders complained of a general lack 
of investor interest beyond the usual summer doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite healthy second-quarter earnings reports, stocks have only been 
able to inch ahead since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors remain worried about another official hike in short-term 
interest rates by the Fed. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, appeared to warn 
about another rate boost in congressional testimony last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, where short-term interest rates rose sharply last week in 
response to Greenspan's comments, activity was bland Monday. Short-term rates 
were unchanged and long-term yields slipped. The key 30-year Treasury bond 
yield fell to 7.52% from Friday's 7.56%. 
</P>
<P>
 The action could turn hotter for bonds today and Wednesday: The Treasury will 
auction $17.25 billion in two-year notes today and $11 billion in five-year 
notes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets Monday, the dollar declined in quiet trading. It eased to 
1.590 German marks from 1.598 on Friday and to 98.75 Japanese yen from 98.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * A slew of energy company earnings reports -- mostly showing lower results 
than a year ago -- left the stocks mixed. Mobil eased 3/8 to 84 1/2, Unocal 
fell 3/4 to 29 1/4 and Arco lost 7/8 to 107, but Texaco was unchanged at 63 and 
Exxon added 3/8 to 58 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other stocks reacting to earnings reports included American Brands, which 
jumped 1 1/2 to 34 1/8; Clark Equipment, up 2 to 66 3/4; Black & Decker, up 1 
1/4 to 18 3/4; Cap Cities/ABC, up 1 1/4 to 79 3/4; U.S. Healthcare, down 1 1/2 
to 35 3/4, and Goodyear, which lost 7/8 to 35 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues continued to attract buyers. ITT gained 2 to 86, 
Nucor leaped 1 3/8 to 70 7/8 and USX-U.S. Steel rose 1 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some major drug stocks also sparked to life. Johnson & Johnson gained 1 3/8 
to 46 3/4, Pfizer surged 1 5/8 to 61 5/8 and Schering-Plough added 1 1/4 to 63 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino giant Circus Circus slumped 1 1/8 to 25 1/2 after Bally Entertainment 
said it sold its stake in the firm, apparently ending any threat of a possible 
takeover bid. Bally lost 1/8 to 6 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell Douglas fell 3 3/4 to 111 1/4 after the company said it is testing 
the market for a possible new 100-seat commercial jet. Salomon Bros. downgraded 
the stock to "hold" from "buy," saying development of the jet would be costly 
and that the plane would compete in an already-crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's biggest losers, Radica Games plunged 3 3/8 to 5 5/8 after 
the maker of hand-held electronic games, including poker and blackjack, said 
its fiscal third-quarter sales will be below analysts' estimates. The firm 
cited production problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's market continued to churn, with the 225-share Nikkei average 
down 165.23 points at 20,297.66. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed at 2,136.22, down 14.04 
points, and London's FTSE-100 index was off 8.6 points at 3,106.1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index added 13.28 points to end at 2,313.94. The 
Bolsa had jumped 67.85 points Friday after a bullish earnings report from 
Telmex. In NYSE trading Monday, Telmex inched up 1/8 to 57 1/4 after leaping 1 
5/8 on Friday.

FRAUD CHARGES FILED IN FIRST PENSION SCAM; CRIME: THREE FACE 10-YEAR SENTENCES 
IN THE $121.5-MILLION ORANGE COUNTY MORTGAGE POOL SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Federal prosecutors filed mail-fraud charges Monday against the three 
operators of First Pension Corp., the failed Irvine pension management company 
accused of running a $121.5-million Ponzi scheme. The three, who have already 
agreed to plead guilty, face maximum prison terms of 10 years and fines of up 
to $500,000 each. They will be arraigned Aug. 1 in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles on two counts each of mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were filed against against Orange County businessman William E. 
Cooper, 50, of Villa Park and his two long-term associates Robert E. Lindley, 
51, of Laguna Niguel and Valerie Jensen, 47, of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the longest-running and most elaborate schemes I have ever 
seen," Assistant U.S. Atty. John Libby said. "To a certain extent, they had to 
fool their own employees as well as investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the court to appoint 
Donald W. Henry, a Woodland Hills attorney, as receiver for the mortgage pools 
operated by First Pension and other related companies. The receiver would 
refund any recovered money to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the three said their clients are cooperating with authorities 
and will plead guilty at next week's arraignment. Cooper is represented by Los 
Angeles lawyer Robert C. Bonner, former chief of the federal Drug Enforcement 
Agency and a onetime federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials allege that, beginning in 1982, the three operated an elaborate 
pyramid scheme that misled clients into investing in mortgages that did not 
exist. An unknown number of First Pension's 8,000 clients lost $66.7 million 
they had invested and another $54.8 million in interest lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The two counts of mail fraud relate to quarterly account statements mailed to 
First Pension clients on Dec. 31, 1993, and March 31, 1994, U.S. attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the level of deceit, prosecutors allege that in 1990, Cooper 
hired an actress to portray an auditor for the State Department of Corporations 
after an employee confronted Cooper with charges that no trust deeds existed in 
the mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress was given a phony Corporations Department business card and then 
sat in the offices of Vestcorp Securities, the brokerage arm of First Pension, 
where she pretended to review files for three weeks, U.S. attorneys said. A 
letter was then drafted on bogus Corporations Department stationery stating 
that the files were in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry investors said Monday that 10 years in prison is not enough for the 
three First Pension principals, and several expressed doubt that the three will 
get the maximum term. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Reiter, 55, of Torrance, who lost $180,000 with First Pension, called 
the mail-fraud charges "wimpy in view of the spectacular crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the charges, the First Pension case is not closed, an indication that 
U.S. attorneys are still investigating other people associated with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension, with an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 
million, declared bankruptcy April 22, one day after Colorado state banking 
authorities seized Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based firm established by 
Cooper to manage clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents filed by the U.S. attorney's office Monday charge that the three 
principals engaged in an elaborate scheme designed to hide mounting losses at 
First Pension by diverting clients' money to pay their own salaries, make 
payroll for employees, meet operating expenses and cover losses. Diverted money 
was also used to invest in new businesses, the U.S. attorneys said.

TIMES MIRROR TO INVEST IN GAME COMPANY; MEDIA: THE PUBLISHING FIRM WILL PUT 
ABOUT $5 MILLION INTO ROCKET SCIENCE GAMES, A HIGHLY REGARDED START-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times, has agreed to take a 
minority stake in Rocket Science Games, a highly regarded Palo Alto-based 
start-up that aims to be a leader in next-generation video game software. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources said Times Mirror will 
invest about $5 million in Rocket Science, which has already attracted 
comparable equity investments from Sega of America and Bertelsmann Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment would be Times Mirror's first in the multimedia arena since its 
announcement in June that it would spin off its cable television operations to 
concentrate on creating new forms of programming for the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the cable deal would add more than $1 billion to the media firm's 
coffers, many industry analysts have been keeping a close watch on Times 
Mirror's investment strategy. The company previously acquired a stake in 
another video game maker, San Mateo Calif.-based Digital Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is invest in companies that will be good growth companies 
in and of themselves, but in addition we're interested in bringing their 
technology into Times Mirror and developing products of our own," said Ann 
Dilworth, Times Mirror vice president for new consumer media. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize it's the early days in a company like Rocket Science, but we want 
to take advantage of their capability and imagination," she said. "We don't 
want to just rap out a CD-ROM that looks like everyone else's." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the equity stake, Times Mirror will launch a joint venture with 
Rocket Science to develop non-fiction "infotainment" CD-ROMs that are likely to 
incorporate material from the firm's vast publishing library. In addition to 
the Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror publishes Newsday, the Hartford Courant and 
other newspapers. It also has a consumer magazine division with titles such as 
Field & Stream, and specialty publishing subsidiaries in areas such as law and 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Science's first games -- an interplanetary trucking adventure called 
"Loadstar" and a comic book thriller called "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" -- are 
not due out until the fall. But the company promises its technology will 
eliminate one of the most irritating features of CD-ROMs: the time lag between 
when a user clicks a mouse or joystick and when the on-screen image reacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are setting some standards in quality of production and 
technology, and Times Mirror is a perfect partner for us," said Steve Blank, 
Rocket Science co-founder and president. "They've divested themselves of 
everything but content -- it's like saying, 'We have no crutches.' I love 
companies like that."

MCDONNELL TO TEST THE WATERS FOR PROPOSED NEW JETLINER; AEROSPACE: COMPANY WILL 
SEEK ORDERS FOR ITS MD-95, BUT STIFF COMPETITION COULD KEEP THE PLANE FROM 
BEING BUILT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp. is continuing with plans to develop a 100-seat 
commercial jetliner, known as the MD-95, but whether there will be enough 
orders to justify building the plane remains highly uncertain, aerospace 
analysts and the company itself said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis-based firm said its board formally authorized Douglas Aircraft 
Co., its commercial jet subsidiary headquartered in Long Beach, to start 
selling the plane to airlines around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very normal process along the path" to bringing an airplane to 
market, Douglas spokesman John Thom said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, aircraft makers don't start manufacturing newly designed planes 
until they have sufficient orders, or a single large order from a "launch" 
customer. Douglas so far has neither for the MD-95, which would be a 
rear-engine twin jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not constitute a launch in any manner," Thom said. "It remains to 
be seen what the serious and specific interest will be from the airline 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if the MD-95 is launched, the impact on Douglas' Long Beach work 
force -- currently between 10,000 and 11,000 people -- may be muted because the 
plane might be put together overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas has been aggressively seeking U.S. and foreign partners to build major 
parts of the airplane at the lowest cost and enable Douglas to sell it at the 
lowest possible price in a hotly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
 The MD-95, which would probably sell for $20 million to $25 million, would 
have an array of competitors, including Boeing's 737, the Airbus Industrie 
A-319 and jets made by Fokker of the Netherlands and British Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas unveiled plans for the MD-95 in 1991. But the jet's development then 
slowed because the airline and aircraft industries fell into a severe slump 
that only now seems to be bottoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom said the MD-95 program would be based in Long Beach, meaning the plane's 
engineering, design and support teams would be there. But Douglas "can't say 
today" whether the jet would eventually foster hundreds of assembly jobs in 
Long Beach, because of Douglas' desire to enlist production partners, Thom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Douglas introduced the MD-95 three years ago, it had announced a 
tentative agreement to have the plane's final assembly done in China. That deal 
was never concluded but remains a possibility, Thom said. "We're looking at all 
parts of the globe for partners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of McDonnell Douglas' plans got a chilly reception from some Wall Street 
analysts, after one published report said the plane's development could cost 
the company somewhat less than $500 million. McDonnell's stock tumbled $3.75 a 
share to $111.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary J. Reich, aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities, estimated the 
MD-95's development costs at no more than $150 million and said the money might 
not even be spent if too few airlines order the plane.

 T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion in new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.43%, up from 4.31% last 
week. Another $12.6 billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.83%, up from 4.71%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.50% on July 11. The six-month bill rate was the highest 
since they averaged 4.94% the same day. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors: 4.54% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,888.00, and 5.02% for a six-month bill selling for $9,755.80. 
The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction: JULY 25, 1994

 CalFed Reports Surprising Profit: California Federal Bank said it had 
second-quarter income of $6.6 million, or 9 cents a share, contrasted with a 
year-earlier loss of $45.5 million, or $1.83 a share. Many Wall Street analysts 
had expected the Los Angeles-based thrift to post a loss. CalFed credited the 
improvement to aggressive efforts to sell its bad loans and foreclosed real 
estate, and to a sharp drop in its provisions for loan losses.

Administration said it has received 156 complaints involving the anti-lock 
braking systems on 1991-94 Chevrolet and GMC S-10 pickup trucks and 
sport-utility vehicles.In some cases, the agency said, the brakes failed to 
prevent the wheels' locking up; in others, the master cylinder failed.

far. The system in question is on 1.4 million vehicles.

 Media Vision Files for Chapter 11: The troubled multimedia firm said it was 
forced to file for federal bankruptcy protection after its major lenders 
rejected a reorganization plan to keep the company out of Bankruptcy Court. The 
Fremont, Calif.-based firm has been shaken this year by the resignation of 
three board members and allegations of securities violations, which have 
triggered investigations by the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Edison Asks PUC to Throw Out Contracts: Southern California Edison Co. 
appealed to the California Public Utilities Commission to overturn the agency's 
requirement that Edison sign power contracts with a group of independent 
electricity producers. The independents, many of whom produce power from 
renewable sources such as wind, geothermal and biomass, won a PUC-mandated 
auction just before the PUC announced its plan to introduce competition to the 
state's electric utility industry.The independents want the auction contracts 
signed, saying they are an example of such competition. Edison argues that it 
doesn't need more electricity, particularly if it faces increased competition. 
Edison's next step -- deemed "a high likelihood if not a certainty" by Don 
Fellows, Edison manager of non-utility power purchases -- will be to sue the 
PUC to stop the contract signing.

 Exxon, Alaskan Natives Announce $20-Million Settlement: The oil company agreed 
to pay the amount to settle a federal lawsuit by 3,500 people who claimed 
losses from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The agreement was announced as an 
Anchorage jury entered its third week of deliberations over a separate 
$900-million claim by Alaska commercial fishermen over lost harvest and 
depressed fish prices. Claims by the Alaskan natives that the spill destroyed 
traditional food sources such as seals, kelp and fish had been scheduled to be 
heard by the same jury.

 RJR Uses Nonsmokers in Ads: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. breaks a new print ad 
campaign today that features nonsmokers who promote smokers' rights. The 
campaign is an attempt by the tobacco giant to stem the growing tide of 
government restrictions against smoking.One ad features a woman who played a 
prominent role in protesting last year's gasoline tax hike. "Today our 
government is attempting to influence personal choices in ways I don't think 
they ever were supposed to," says the woman, who later says in the ad's text, 
"Personally, I dislike smoking." Anti-tobacco activists contend the campaign is 
a sham. "With RJR's resources, I'm sure they can find people who believe the 
Earth is flat," said John F. Banzhaf, executive director of the Washington 
lobby Action on Smoking and Health.

STATE HOME SALES UP, BUCKING U.S. TREND; REAL ESTATE: NEW SIGNS OF A PRICE 
UPSWING HAVE CALIFORNIA BUYERS BRAVING RISING MORTGAGE RATES A SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California home sales eked out another small gain in June, the state's realty 
trade group said Monday, as buyers shrugged off rising mortgage rates for the 
second month in a row amid new signs that prices have reversed their 
four-year-long decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said California's sales gain was particularly notable because sales 
in most other parts of the country fell. In a separate report released Monday, 
the National Assn. of Realtors said U.S. home sales dropped 3.6% in June, as 
rising mortgage rates were blamed for keeping most would-be buyers elsewhere on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes in the state were sold at an annualized rate of 485,260 last month, up a 
modest 0.5% from May, the California Assn. of Realtors said. Sales were 
especially strong in most southern parts of the state, jumping 8% in Los 
Angeles County, 9% in the Inland Empire and 4% in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices statewide also rose and the number of homes on the market continued to 
drop -- an indication that more price hikes could be in store. The median price 
of a house stood at $185,450 in June, up a strong 1.3% from $183,070 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a solid, sustained housing recovery going on here," said Pat Neal, 
an Orange County broker and president of the state trade group. "Even the big 
increase we saw in mortgage rates a few months ago hasn't held the market 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rates on fixed, 30-year mortgages stood at about 7% in February but have since 
jumped to about 8.5%. The increase has added about $150 to the monthly cost of 
a $150,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the California (housing) market is catching up with the rest of 
the country, which has done pretty well over the last couple of years," said 
Fred Flick, an economist for the national association and the group's director 
of research. "Maybe California's 'day in the sun' has finally arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the Southern California region have been particularly strong now that 
the worst of the layoffs in the aerospace industry are over and the economy is 
showing new signs of life, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,550 houses in the region were sold last month, a healthy 12% increase 
over May and 27% ahead of last year's sales levels, according to Dataquick 
Information Systems, a La Jolla-based real estate research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of homes for sale also continued to dwindle. The California 
realtors said their unsold-inventory index dropped to 7.7 months in June from 
an 8-month supply in May and an 11-month supply a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A supply of about nine to 11 months is considered normal, said Leslie 
Appleton-Young, the state realtors' economist. June's 7.7-month reading 
indicates that California's long "buyer's market" is beginning to disappear and 
that more upward pressure on prices could be on the way, she said. Southland

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; UNITED TALENT AGENCY'S STAR ASCENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some civilizations turn historic places into shrines to good or evil. Others 
merely redecorate them and move on, which helps explain how United Talent 
Agency came to occupy the sweeping Beverly Hills office that junk bond kingpin 
Michael Milken lorded over in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 UTA signed a lease on the space just one day after Drexel Burnham Lambert 
abandoned ship. It then transformed Milken's trading floor, with its legendary 
thicket of stock machines, into the kind of plushly modern office befitting 
Hollywood's version of the corporate predator. Now, some three years later, UTA 
is fighting for the recognition to match the digs. 
</P>
<P>
 With a growing client list and some high-profile movies burning up the box 
office this summer, the agency claims it has earned the right to be mentioned 
in the same breath with the traditional Big Three firms -- Creative Artists 
Agency, International Creative Management and William Morris Agency. Not 
everyone agrees with that point of view. But at the very least, UTA has emerged 
as a solid and formidable presence in the acronym-heavy world of talent 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquee clients like actor Jim Carrey, whose much-anticipated movie, "The 
Mask," opens Friday, and actress Sandra Bullock of the breakaway hit "Speed" 
round out a sizable list of big-name screenwriters and TV talent, including 
actors David Caruso of "NYPD Blue," Paul Reiser of "Mad About You" and Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus of "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood sources say UTA still has a long way to go in building the 
kind of movie star-director list that would allow it to "package" big features, 
they credit the agency with having a very profitable TV division, with hits 
such as "Married With Children" and "Mad About You." Says Walt Disney Studios 
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg: "They're great entrepreneurs. They keep adding and 
adding, and suddenly you look and realize these guys have a real business 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 UTA was created in 1991 with the merger of Bauer Benedek and Leading Artists 
talent agencies, and it expanded again in 1992 by adding several agents from 
Inter-Talent. Today the agency's 10 partners are Marty Bauer, Peter Benedek, 
James Berkus, Gary Cosay, J.J. Harris, Judy Hofflund, Gavin Polone, David 
Schiff, Robert Stein and Jeremy Zimmer. With 40 agents, UTA is less than half 
the size of its leading competitors. But it's also larger than most of the 
so-called boutique firms -- and therein lies its image problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In the superlative-strewn Hollywood landscape of bigger, better and boldest, 
niche players tend to get lost. Hofflund, who joined UTA from Inter-Talent, 
says one challenge is convincing clients that bigger isn't necessarily better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that we have all the same information and the same relationships 
with the production heads at the studios," she said. "But there's something 
about the fraternity of a larger agency that makes (some talent) feel more 
comfortable. And that makes it harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Harder still are defections, when clients either become successful or hit a 
career lull. Actor Michael J. Fox made headlines when he moved to CAA from UTA 
late last year, to be followed by director Brian de Palma. Sources say UTA 
subsequently tried to launch its own talent raids, without much success, though 
director John Schlesinger ("Midnight Cowboy") recently transferred to UTA from 
ICM. "They're determined to get working clients from other agencies," said one 
source. "It's like a running joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofflund said raids go with the turf, but she denied there's any special 
campaign under way to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no mandate to just expand, because that's completely contrary to our 
philosophy," she said. "There's definitely a mandate to continue to grow. It's 
what every agency does. . . . But there was never a time when we all said, 
'This month, let's amp it up on recruiting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever weaknesses exist in the feature area, writing isn't one of them. 
Zimmer, who heads the literary department, said UTA writers worked on six of 
the seven movies that grossed more than $100 million last year -- "Jurassic 
Park," "The Firm," "In the Line of Fire," "The Fugitive," "Indecent Proposal" 
and "The Bodyguard." At UTA, he said, "we don't think that on the food chain of 
Hollywood, (writers) are the amoebas." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, for his part, says UTA's strength is growing talent from the ground up. 
It plucked Carrey out of relative obscurity when he was on TV's "In Living 
Color." Bullock was taken on after she was spotted in a small movie. "It's very 
difficult to attract the major clients from a place like CAA," Bauer said. "So 
our business plan is to develop our own. I don't know if that's a niche, but 
it's certainly a business plan. . . . We've found it's not tough to hang on to 
them if you were involved with them at the beginning of their ascension." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, who heads UTA's fledgling new-media division in addition to agenting, 
said chemistry is often what ultimately matters. It was "The Mask" director 
Chuck Russell, Stein's client, who suggested that Carrey be considered for the 
starring role in the movie, long before Carrey became a star commanding $7 
million a film after the success of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can all win on any given Sunday," Stein said of the agency. "The trick is 
to put the right elements together."

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; RESTRUCTURING AT PARAMOUNT IN HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The revamping of some Paramount Pictures operations have entered the 
fast-forward stage, a trend that is likely to continue under budget-cutting 
Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman Jonathan Dolgen. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio disclosed Monday that its home video and pay television operations 
have been restructured.Video division President Robert Klingensmith, a longtime 
associate of former Paramount Communications Chairman Martin Davis, is 
departing after about 20 years at the company, saying he is "anxious to join 
the ride" on the "new information highway." Also leaving is Executive Vice 
President Tim Clott, who helped pioneer various ancillary markets for the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate major departure, Robert Cohen, who headed legal affairs for 
Paramount's MotionPicture Group, is leaving to join 20th Century Fox as 
executive vice president of business and legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paramount's video unit, former domestic video chief Eric Doctorow, who 
sources said has in effect been running the day-to-day home video operation for 
some time, was named president of worldwide video and will take on additional 
duties such as overseeing Paramount's 50%-owned international video venture 
with MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Jack Waterman was promoted to president of worldwide 
pay television and will continue to oversee business affairs and finance at the 
video unit. Paramount observers see the restructuring as part of larger efforts 
by Dolgen to trim expenses by eliminating management layers and consolidating 
duties among executives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fox Broadcasting Co. has promoted Larry Jacobson to executive vice president 
and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brian E. Becker, vice chairman of concert and stage promoter Pace 
Entertainment, has taken on the additional title of chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 * A&M Records named Jeff Zolotorofe vice president of royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard Rock Cafe International has named Roger Fishman vice president of 
marketing and sales.

 Viacom watch: Kirk Kerkorian has bought 5% of Viacom's non-voting stock. The 
Las Vegas billionaire, who owns the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas and who 
formerly owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has accumulated through his Tracinda Corp. 
10 million shares of Viacom's Class B stock, worth nearly $338 million at 
current prices.Tracinda said the purchase was made as an investment. Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone said he welcomed the investment. Unknown is whether it 
will strengthen Viacom's stock enough to jump-start its merger deal with 
Blockbuster Entertainment. Blockbuster executives have criticized the deal 
because of the softness in Viacom's stock. Viacom Class B shares, which traded 
as low as $21.75 in April, added 37.5 cents Monday to close at $33.75 on the 
American Stock Exchange. But the price is well below its all-time high of 
$61.25 a share last year and the $55 a share that Blockbuster paid for 23 
million shares to help Viacom finance its Paramount Communications acquisition. 
Although the Viacom-Blockbuster deal is still a long shot, the recent recovery 
in Viacom's stock price has reignited interest in the merger among some 
investors. JAMES BATES

COMPANY TOWN; CBS REVISES ITS BUYBACK OFFER TO INCLUDE FEWER SHARES FROM LOEWS; 
TELEVISION: NETWORK CITES TAX REASONS. MOVE COULD BOOST CHAIRMAN LAURENCE A. 
TISCH'S STAKE IN THE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS Inc. on Monday revised its $1.1-billion offer to buy back 23% of its 
shares in a move that could boost Chairman Laurence A. Tisch's stake in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing tax reasons, CBS said Tisch's Loews Corp., which controls about 19.5% 
of the network, will tender only 2 million of the 3 million shares it owns. 
Previously, Loews said it would tender its entire stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS self-tender offer, announced earlier this month after the proposed 
merger between CBS and QVC Inc. collapsed, calls for CBS to pay $325 a share 
for up to 3.5 million shares, or nearly 23%, of its common stock. The revised 
tender offer, which commenced Monday, is scheduled to expire Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the original self-tender, Tisch, who is CBS' largest 
shareholder, would have realized a cash payout of $220 million. Analysts saw 
the move as both a way for Tisch to take money out of the company and a way to 
prevent the stock from falling in the wake of the busted deal with QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Loews tender less than its 3 million shares, its ownership stake in CBS 
"may increase a small percentage," the company said. It would also mean that 
Tisch's payout could be cut by more than $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the revised tender offer has not changed the overall impression 
that Tisch, despite repeated public statements to the contrary, may not be in 
CBS for the long term. "To me it just signals that Loews is selling no matter 
what," said Jessica Reif, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to quash speculation that he wanted to sell CBS, Tisch last week 
went to Los Angeles for a rare meeting with TV critics to again say he was 
sticking with the network. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just tired of the rumors," an exasperated Tisch told the critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts and observers think that by briefly agreeing to merge 
with QVC, Tisch has put a "for sale" sign on CBS. Tisch backed away from the 
QVC deal earlier this month after cable's Comcast Corp. made a higher bid for 
the home shopping network. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have since speculated over several possible CBS bidders, including 
Walt Disney Co., cable magnate Ted Turner and QVC Chairman Barry Diller, with 
fresh financing. Of those, Turner has attracted the most attention recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of Turner Broadcasting System is expected to discuss the possibility 
of making a bid for CBS during its meeting today in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
where TBS is holding the Goodwill Games. Turner, however, faces opposition from 
two of its shareholders, Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc., in any such 
bid.  
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, given the turmoil at CBS over the last few weeks, the network has 
been able to move ahead to try to repair the damage caused earlier this year 
when eight of its affiliates defected to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, CBS concluded a deal to lure several Westinghouse 
Broadcasting-owned affiliates. Although CBS will have to sell a TV station it 
owns in Philadelphia as part of the arrangement, the network is already in 
discussions with Fox to swap its Philadelphia station for Fox-owned stations in 
Atlanta and Dallas.

RECALLED FULLERTON OFFICIALS OFFER NOT TO RUN IN NOVEMBER; GOVERNMENT: TWO 
COUNCIL MEMBERS TELL JUDGE THEY WILL SIT OUT THE GENERAL ELECTION IF THE 
OCTOBER SPECIAL BALLOT IS CANCELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the three Fullerton City Council members recalled last month will ask a 
Superior Court judge today to cancel an October special election in exchange 
for guarantees that they will not seek reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and Councilwoman Molly McClanahan say they will not 
run in the Nov. 8 general election if Judge Donald E. Smallwood will set aside 
his recent decision calling for a special election on Oct. 18. The election was 
scheduled to replace the recalled council members, including Don Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Smallwood sided with the Fullerton Recalls Committee, which had 
sued the city and City Clerk Anne M. York over the city's plan to have the 
special election coincide with the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the recall committee were unhappy about the city's decision to 
consolidate the two elections because it would keep the recalled council 
members in office longer and leave them eligible for reelection. A separate 
special election would preclude them from running for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's hearing, Smallwood questioned whether Catlin and McClanahan 
would run in the consolidated election. Their four-year terms expire in 
November, and the winners of an October special election for their seats would 
hold office for little more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem to me that if (McClanahan and Catlin) would disavow (any 
intention of) running for reelection, then theoretically the voters would have 
a clean slate" when voting in the November general election, Smallwood said 
Friday before making his ruling. "Obviously, they have a right to run. . . . 
I'm just seeing it as a way of resolving this dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall committee members said the purpose of an October special election was 
to replace the recalled officials as soon as possible. City officials estimate 
that it would cost taxpayers about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead's term will not expire for another two years, so the winner of a 
special election for his seat would hold office until 1996. Bankhead has taken 
out nomination papers to seek reelection to a new four-year term in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip D. Kohn, the attorney for York and the city, said he discussed 
Smallwood's comments with Catlin and McClanahan, who both decided to act on the 
judge's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 They indicated that if there were no special election, "they would agree not 
to run as candidates in November. I think that's a pretty unselfish and 
courageous thing to do," Kohn said. "It would save a hell of a lot of money and 
a lot of confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark S. Rosen, the attorney for the recall committee, said he will ask 
Smallwood to "stick to his guns" and stand by his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "McClanahan and Catlin want to sacrifice themselves to save any embarrassment 
to the city clerk," Rosen said. "And, in the meantime, they get to stay in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 But McClanahan said the law requires recalled council members to stay in 
office until they are replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do something that is the least confusing to voters and as 
financially responsible as possible," she said. "I'm happy to give my word that 
I will not be a candidate in November, and I'm not (on the council) to play 
games. I'm there to serve until I'm replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last year when Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted 
for a 2% utility tax despite opposition from hundreds of residents. York became 
a recall target because she delayed the recall process by rejecting the recall 
petitions for exceeding the legal word limit.

EARLY MEMO ON GRADING SCANDAL WENT UNREAD; EDUCATION: BREA OLINDA DISTRICT 
EMPLOYEE'S WARNING LAST NOVEMBER ABOUT TRANSCRIPT TAMPERING WAS APPARENTLY 
MISLAID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An employee of the Brea Olinda Unified School District alerted top 
administrators last November of illegal grade-changing at the district's 
award-winning high school, but then-Supt. Edgar Z. Seal apparently misplaced 
the employee's written warning before reading it, district records revealed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon finally reading a copy of the worker's memorandum July 14, Seal -- who 
retired in June -- called the situation "a calamity of errors" in a 
confidential letter sent to school board members earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though grade and other transcript changes were first revealed publicly last 
month after a teacher filed a grievance, district records indicate that 
administrators at Brea Olinda High -- and perhaps others in the district's 
central office -- have known about the problems for much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new details about the situation were disclosed Monday after district 
officials released documents in response to a California Public Records Act 
request from The Times. The scandal involves hundreds of transcripts that were 
altered so that students received double credit for the same courses, earned 
"pass" notations instead of poor letter grades, and had evidence of failing 
marks removed from their records. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon discovering the grade changes, Brea Olinda immediately lowered its 
graduation requirements for this year so no members of the Class of 1994 would 
be held back, and officials say that all student records have now been 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Another school's registrar and a lawyer with the Orange County Department of 
Education are investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not drawing any conclusions at this point. There were problems, we know 
that," said Supt. Peggy Lynch, who took over the district's top job this month. 
"We've got a process set up to investigate it. I want the process to be done as 
cleanly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal has said in previous interviews that he first learned of the grade 
changes in February, but in a July 15 letter to the school board the former 
superintendent acknowledged discussing the problems with employees last fall 
and receiving a letter on the matter from Sally Tennison, the high school's 
data systems operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennison sent an unsigned letter detailing grade-change problems to Seal on 
Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not have time to open the envelope to determine what was written. I 
laid it on the table and to this day, I do not know whether the letter was 
misplaced, picked up (or) thrown away. . . . Periodically I looked for the 
letter but could not locate it," Seal wrote. "I read the letter yesterday (July 
14) for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 In his memo to the board, Seal said that if he had read the Nov. 12 letter 
last fall he "would have been at the high school as soon as I could have gotten 
there," and would have shared the memo with the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal also indicated that Assistant Supt. Gary Goff had a copy of the letter 
and had reviewed it. Goff could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennison, who has worked at the high school in various clerical posts since 
1979, also could not be reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In her three-page, single-spaced memo, Tennison said that while trying to help 
train the high school's new registrar last fall, she "became very confused" by 
records that showed students who graduated without meeting requirements. 
Others, she said, got credit for taking the same course twice under different 
names, and had grades changed in the computer after the classes had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the present (Brea Olinda High) administration has lost sight 
of the excellence in education that we all cherished so much," Tennison's memo 
states. "I believe that you can sense the frustration of one (employee) . . . 
that has worked here for a while, whose daughter graduated from here, (and) who 
is very proud of this school and what it stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the memorandum, Tennison met with Principal John Johnson, Vice 
Principal Denise Jay, former registrar Joanne Rizzuto and several counselors in 
regard to her concerns. She refers in the letter to several attachments 
documenting the problems more specifically, but district officials said they 
have been unable to locate those records. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch and Assistant Supt. Peter J. Boothroyd cautioned that much of the Nov. 
12 memo is one person's opinion. Although Tennison had access to a lot of 
information, they said, she is not qualified to interpret it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't, nor would I want to, even judge whether it's true or not true," 
Boothroyd said of the memo. "She's making a value judgment. She's not a 
counselor. She's not somebody who's determined appropriate placement for 
students or even worked with parents on placement." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Rizzuto, a former registrar at Brea Olinda who was among the 
whistle-blowers on the grade changing, said Monday that despite some irrelevant 
items, Tennison's account is "pretty much the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Tennison said the high school's transcripts "were a mess," and 
she questioned the routine practice of letting students receive double credit 
for the same course by changing the course title on the transcript. She also 
noted the inconsistent policy regarding handling of F grades in classes that 
students repeated to earn better grades. 
</P>
<P>
 When a student fails a class, no credits are earned. But the grade typically 
remains on the student's transcript with a notation of "credits attempted," and 
is factored into grade-point averages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tennison's memo, about 20% of the F grades on file at Brea Olinda 
last November had "credits attempted" removed from the transcript, thus 
eliminating the failing marks from grade-point averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Other documents show that students often had Fs changed to "pass" notations, 
which also are not counted in their grade-point averages. At the same time, 
other Fs were simply dropped from transcripts altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothroyd said Monday that he is unsure what Brea Olinda's policy has been 
regarding Fs and credits attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the memos from Tennison and Seal, Brea Olinda released a list 
of students who repeated courses as well as the preliminary report of Rachael 
Alcorn, who is auditing the high school's grade books and transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dated June 26, 1993, the list -- which is not a complete accounting of the 
transcript changes -- shows that more than 200 students in grades 10, 11 and 12 
received credit for taking the same classes twice. Their poor grades were 
turned into "pass" notations and the course titles were changed to "elective" 
titles after classes were complete. Then students took the same classes again 
and received letter grades. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first report to school board members, Alcorn provided a detailed 
glimpse at 10 students' records. Two received four "pass" notations in one 
academic year, then repeated the same courses the following year and posted 
several A-minuses. It is unclear from the report what the two students' initial 
grades were before they were inappropriately changed to a "pass" notation.

DUE FOR AN OVERHAUL; BUS SYSTEM NEEDS FIX, BUT ANALYSTS DON'T HAVE EXACT CHANGE 
-- YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Anyone who rides Orange County buses knows it's not always easy to get from 
here to there. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for that has been the subject of a months-long study by analysts 
for the Orange County Transportation Authority. On Monday, they told the 
transportation board that the bus system must be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how bus service will change isn't clear yet, but one thing is certain: 
the Orange County bus system in the year 2000 won't look like it does today. 
</P>
<P>
 Months ago, the analysts handed out surveys at bus stops and held focus groups 
in an attempt to learn how to attract reluctant riders and keep regular users 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 If people surveyed get their way, the analysts said Monday, bus transfers will 
be simplified. Shorter routes through communities will be created. More buses 
will run on weekends and evenings. And south Orange County and the foothill 
communities will have more routes. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA board members said they hope such steps will boost ridership, which has 
fallen 10% in the past three years. Officials especially are alarmed by the 
decline in "discretionary" riders, people who choose to take the bus to work or 
on errands even though they have a car. That number has decreased from 10,000 
riders per day in 1980 to 4,000 riders now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bus system was set up in the 1970s," said OCTA analyst Mike Greenwood, 
who is coordinating the $250,000 improvement project, which OCTA hopes to 
implement next year. "It's been modified slightly here and there, but the 
system is basically the same way it was. Orange County has grown a lot since 
then, so we want the system to address the needs of all the commuters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County bus system had not been evaluated as a whole since 1981. 
Since 1984, the county's population has grown by 24%, and new housing 
developments, especially in South County, have multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and September, analysts will identify specific routes that should 
be changed or added to the system. That may mean replacing some low-producing 
routes with small buses, introducing new routes in the foothill communities of 
both South and North County, and restructuring routes to create high-frequency, 
fast bus routes in corridors of high employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders on Orange County buses Monday afternoon expressed both optimism and 
reservations about the possible changes, and they welcomed the idea of expanded 
bus service in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have access to more places," said Carl Martin, a 
19-year-old Cal State Fullerton student who lives in Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he never uses OCTA buses to visit relatives in Mission Viejo because 
the trip would involve taking several buses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to spend the whole day transferring from one bus to another," 
Martin said. "I'd rather get a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lupe Cruz, 58, of Santa Ana said she is "worried sick" that OCTA might 
terminate service on some slower routes or reduce the number of trips per day 
in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get on the bus and I'm the only one on board," she said. "I 
wonder how they make money off that." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ramirez, 42, who has used the Bristol Street line to get from her Santa 
Ana home to her job as a computer technician in Costa Mesa for six years, said 
that overall, "It's a good system. I hope they don't mess it up. I rely on 
this. I can't afford a car."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; OPPOSITION TO TOLLWAY TURNS GRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Protests against the San Joaquin Hills tollway project turned macabre Monday 
when two artists dug deep "graves" for themselves in Laguna Canyon and then 
spent the day lying mute in the handmade holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Planted 50 yards apart, Mark Chamberlain and Jerry Burchfield lay motionless 
as a handful of "witnesses," draped in black, took turns peering into the 
narrow holes. As the sun rose higher and tiny flies swarmed above them, friend 
Ed DeMerlier fretted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sun is . . . whew," DeMerlier said. "And once it gets right over them, 
it's gonna be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre performance was the latest in a series of protests that has taken 
place alongside Laguna Canyon Road, where the toll road is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, both bulldozers and protesters descended upon the site north of El 
Toro Road in response to a court order allowing work to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 That drama ended the following week when road opponents won an injunction 
blocking further grading until at least September, when a court hearing is 
scheduled. But tollway foes have vowed to crank up the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain and Burchfield -- a Laguna Beach gallery owner and a Cypress 
College instructor, respectively -- are longtime opponents of development in 
Laguna Canyon. In 1989, they concocted a massive photographic mural dubbed "The 
Tell" to draw attention to the scenic canyon's vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a continuation of a long effort on their part to keep the canyon 
what it was," said DeMerlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway, which some motorists welcome as a 
remedy for overcrowded freeways, would cut through Laguna Canyon as it links 
Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's protest was billed as a "performance piece" of art and began at about 
6 a.m. when Burchfield and Chamberlain tackled the earth with shovels. When 
their respective ditches were about five feet deep and barely the length of 
their bodies, they took their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Posted nearby was a sign describing the point they hoped to make: "Just as 
political prisoners throughout history have been forced to dig their own graves 
to silence their voices, we are compelled to do so now." 
</P>
<P>
 The men were expected to exit their sunken hideaways at 7 p.m. and plant trees 
in the holes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Burchfield and Chamberlain lay prone, the "witnesses" went about their 
duties, snapping photographs or just gazing forlornly into the makeshift 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Drake, dressed in a suit and tie, said he was on his way to work at a 
foreign currency exchange and "stopped by to pay my respects." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's profound, spiritual," he said, "something that's going to 
attract some attention."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FAIR ATTENDANCE UP 1% OVER LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials at the Orange County Fair on Monday reported an overall attendance 
figure of 675,515 -- an increase of 1% from last year -- for the 17-day event, 
which concluded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair spokeswoman Georgia Cluver said officials were "very pleased" with the 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always hope for the best, to increase attendance," she said. "But 
especially considering the economy, this is a very good attendance." 
</P>
<P>
 Cluver said the record of 685,294 visitors was set in 1992, the fair's 
centennial year. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's closing-day attendance set a record, with 68,164 people passing 
through the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 B&B Amusements, which provided carnival attractions for the fair, reported 
about $2 million in gross sales, up 5.4% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications are that concession sales also increased. Admission and 
parking revenue totaled $2,766,585, an increase of 7.6% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall revenue figures for the fair will not be available for several weeks, 
Cluver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 27 arrests reported at the fair were related to alcohol use. Last 
year, 23 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 This 102nd edition of the fair featured livestock exhibits, rodeos, a petting 
zoo, carnival rides, games and contests. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also nightly entertainment by groups including the Pointer Sisters, 
Three Dog Night and the Marshall Tucker Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the favorite attractions was the Ejection Seat, a $40-per-person ride 
that launched people 150 feet into the air like a slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 launches occurred during the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's Orange County Fair will salute goats and the horticulture 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair dates will be announced in September. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY, CHINO FORGE FIRE AID AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will be able to provide improved response to emergencies in the 
rugged Carbon Canyon area under a new aid agreement that spans the Orange-San 
Bernardino county line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Fire Department in Orange County and the Chino Valley Independent 
Fire District in San Bernardino County have agreed to respond simultaneously to 
fires and serious traffic accidents in the brush-covered, hazard-prone canyon, 
regardless of where the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 Joint training sessions are scheduled for August, so Brea and Chino can become 
familiar with the other's firefighting equipment. By Sept. 1, the computerized 
automatic aid system is expected to go on line, with calls being routed to the 
nearest units in either county. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea and Chino are currently operating under a mutual aid agreement, in which 
firefighters from the two counties assist each other if requested. This 
involves a potentially crucial delay, however, that is eliminated under the 
automatic aid agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Olinda Village and the Hollydale Mobile Home Estates in Brea and 
people living in the rustic Sleepy Hollow area just across the county border 
are expected to see improvements in service under the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the way for this team approach to handling emergencies were recent 
improvements in the fire service radio system. Repeater stations installed in 
Olinda Village have eliminated many "dead spots" in the canyon, with the result 
that "communications have improved 100%" between the two counties, said Brea 
Fire Chief William R. Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a demonstration that we're not parochial when it comes to fire service," 
Simpkins said of the new agreement. He said the timing is fortunate because 
heavy rains in recent years have increased the amount of vegetation in the 
canyon, thus increasing the fire hazard this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always expect the worst, I'm afraid," said Simpkins, who pointed out that 
a 730-acre brush fire occurred just four weeks ago in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 When this type of fire occurs, Brea and Chino concentrate on protecting 
structures. The Orange County Fire Department, the California Department of 
Forestry and Fire Protection and the U.S. Forest Service bring in specialized 
equipment and trained personnel to battle blazes on the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage of the automatic aid agreement is that Brea and Chino 
firefighters will respond more efficiently to traffic accidents along twisting 
Carbon Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "That canyon is really infamous for some very spectacular, often fatal, 
traffic accidents," said Simpkins. The combination of a high traffic volume and 
the tendency of motorists to speed along the two-lane road significantly 
increases the danger of head-on and other types of collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The automatic aid agreement does not apply to paramedic service at this time, 
because of differing regulations in Orange and San Bernardino counties, but 
Brea and Chino firefighters are authorized to render basic life support 
services to accident victims on either side of the county line until the 
appropriate paramedic unit arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Division Chief David L. Huffman, who helped spearhead the intercounty 
agreement, said the only expense the city will incur is the cost of a backup 
radio for the emergency dispatch center. He expects the agreement to 
significantly help with the "constant challenge" of providing emergency service 
in the canyon. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; HEADLANDS BALLOT ARGUMENTS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ballot arguments and rebuttals in the upcoming referendum on the Headlands 
development now are available at Dana Point City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, Nov. 8, Dana Point voters will be asked to cast either two 
yes votes to approve the hotel and residential plan or two no votes to reject 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a $500-million development plan approved by the City Council in 
April that would allow the landowners to build a 400-room hotel and 370 homes 
on the 121-acre blufftop parcel above Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Sharon L. Waits said the referendum will consist of two ballot 
measures because the council action came in two separate votes that amended 
both the city's General Plan and a specific plan for the Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot arguments and rebuttals also will be published in sample ballots 
that will be mailed to voters sometime this fall, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three years the development plan has been the focus of an 
increasingly bitter debate. A petition drive launched immediately after the 
council approved the plan April 5 forced the council to place it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's proponents claim the property already is partially developed and 
that the city needs the revenue a resort development can generate. Its 
opponents claim the proposed development is too massive and that more of the 
property should be saved as a natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands has been owned by the M.S. Sherman Co. and 
Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial 
holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., 
which publishes the Los Angeles Times. LEN HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine Orange County residents were among 86 Californians and some 1,300 
students nationwide to win merit scholarships financed by colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest recipients were among more than 6,700 who have received $25 million 
in scholarships of some kind through the program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 115 private and 85 public colleges and universities in 42 states and 
Washington, D.C., awarded merit scholarships this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners are chosen by the sponsoring school and receive $250 to $2,000 each 
year to attend that school. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the recipients were: Anaheim residents Gabriel G. Pai of 
Troy High in Fullerton and Lori H. Yamato of Katella High in Anaheim; Adam S. 
Carr of Buena Park, a student at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton; Peter J. Howell 
of Fullerton High; Irvine High students James A. Black and Angela K. Kang; 
Anselm H. Lin of University High in Irvine; Aaron J. Mugg, a student at Mission 
Viejo High; and Tustin High's John R. Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the college- and university-sponsored awards, the merit 
scholars program included $2,000 prizes for students in each state and 
corporate-sponsored scholarships for students of particular interest to various 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.1 million students in more than 19,000 high schools entered the 1994 
merit scholars competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners were selected based on scores in the Pre-Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
transcripts, activities and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 14,000 finalists. JODI WILGOREN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SEARCH UNDERWAY FOR DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new deputy city attorney will be hired to handle personal injury and 
personnel grievance cases in an effort to save the city money on outside 
attorney costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.Gail Hutton said a deputy will be hired at a cost of nearly $66,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton said the money to pay the salary and benefits for the new employee will 
not come from the general-fund budget but from a separate risk-management fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton said that the average cost for an outside attorney to defend the city 
in a grievance case is about $12,450, compared to about $4,000 for an attorney 
working on the city payroll.  
</P>
<P>
 From January, 1993, to March this year, 25 of 44 cases have been handled by 
deputy city attorneys and temporary attorney employees at an estimated cost 
savings of $311,250, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hutton said that the city's risk-management budget for hiring 
outside legal counsel for injury and grievance cases has been exceeded in the 
past two fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton said that the 1993-94 budget is $400,000 for outside counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 But costs to date for these cases exceed $1 million, primarily due to two 
"very risky cases" that were costly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton said recruitment is underway to hire the attorney after the City 
Council approved the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton also said over the past few years her office has significantly reduced 
its staffing due to budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she said, her department has not had enough attorneys to handle 
the case load. 
</P>
<P>
 The office currently has seven attorneys. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FIREFIGHTING CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider whether to place a proposal to contract 
for fire services from the Orange County Fire Department on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Craig Schweisinger is leading the move to let voters decide whether 
the city should continue to maintain its own Fire Department.Schweisinger said 
that preliminary studies have indicated that the city could save about $2 
million a year by contracting with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For fiscal 1994-95, the Fire Department, which currently has 65 employees, has 
a budget of $7 million. Five firefighter-paramedics are expected to be hired 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant fire chief and two division chiefs also are expected to be 
appointed next month to complete a reorganization of its management team, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have supported us during the recall election want us to consider 
transferring fire services to the county," Schweisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger, Mayor Charles V. Smith and council members Tony Lam and 
Charmayne S. Bohman survived a recall drive spearheaded by the Westminster 
Firefighters Assn. stemming from last year's cuts in the Fire Department 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may consider other options to save money, Schweisinger said. Among 
the proposals are privatizing fire services, combining fire protection services 
with another city or cities, or continuing the efforts to streamline operations 
at the Fire Department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens' panel appointed by the council is studying the proposal to 
contract with the county, Schweisinger said. Last year, the Finance Review 
Committee recommended more than $1 million in cuts in the Fire Department 
budget. That triggered the recall drive. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; RESIDENTS WARNED ABOUT PHONE SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are warning people to be aware of people who call their homes to 
solicit money on behalf of the city's Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big problem with telephone scams," said police spokesman Sgt. Dann 
Bean."We're trying to warn the residents not to donate any money to 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said people have been duped into giving $25 to $50 by telephone 
solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department has received about a dozen calls from people who have 
been asked for donations for the "COPS Organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said solicitors use different scams, including one in which they request 
donations to benefit families of police officers killed in the line of duty. 
Often, solicitors affiliate themselves with a specific police department to 
make their organization appear more legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean offered tips to help recognize solicitors who commit telephone fraud: 
</P>
<P>
 * Be suspicious of solicitation calls. Phony solicitors tend to be overly 
friendly on the telephone and are trained to scam people out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be inquisitive about who the donation would benefit. Start asking questions 
such as the solicitor's name and a number to call them back. If it's a scam, 
they will hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the solicitor wants to pick up a check right away (so it can be cashed 
immediately), chances are it's a scam. 
</P>
<P>
 * If in doubt about the call, contact the local chamber of commerce to find 
out about the organization or the Police Department at (714) 965-4465 -- before 
making a donation. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SUPERINTENDENT'S TERM IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David J. Hagen, superintendent of the public high schools in Huntington Beach, 
Fountain Valley and Westminster, has had his contract extended for two more 
years, until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-1 vote, the board of the Huntington Beach Union High School District 
last week agreed to lengthen Hagen's contract but gave him no pay increase for 
the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a tight budget caused by declining enrollment, the board this year 
had similarly voted for no pay raises for other personnel, including teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagen's contract was scheduled to expire in 1996. At its July 19 meeting, the 
board voted to extend it until June 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen's salary last school year was $103,900, and it will remain unchanged at 
least until next June 30, the school board decided.  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Dirk Voss cast the lone opposing vote against the contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said he did not think it appropriate to extend the incumbent 
superintendent's contract before the school board election is held this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five school board seats are up for election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The district governs Marina, Edison, Ocean View and Huntington Beach high 
schools in Huntington Beach and Westminster High and Fountain Valley High in 
those cities. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; SURFSIDE RESIDENTS PLAN IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The residents of Surfside call their enclave a "colony" -- an idyllic cluster 
of about 250 upscale homes sandwiched between the green marshes of Anaheim Bay 
and the blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But even this gated community at the south end of Seal Beach has room for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents want to move utility lines underground and install a new water 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to pay for the project by forming a special assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 A price tag for the project has yet to be calculated. But residents took the 
first step in forming the district this month by submitting a petition to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the city would help Surfside residents obtain a 
low-interest loan to finance the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents would pay off the loan through an annual assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the levy has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston stressed that the city would incur no costs if 
the district is formed. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfside residents said the village's infrastructure needs to be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 The water system uses relatively small pipes that cause inconsistent water 
pressure at times. 
</P>
<P>
 The above-ground wiring and wood telephone poles detract from the ocean vistas 
that some homes command, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will upgrade the whole community," said Councilwoman Marilyn 
Bruce Hastings, who represents Surfside. "The residents are determined to do 
it. I think this will really clear up the place tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfside residents are expected to discuss the improvement project at a 
community meeting this weekend.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; TECHNOLOGY CENTER ON-LINE AT OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finishing touches are being put on the gleaming, $8.6-million technology 
center, the largest facility on the 164-acre Orange Coast College campus and 
the largest technology center at any community college west of the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed in futuristic, high-tech style, the facility opened in June for 
limited use by a few summer school classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-building complex is expected to be in full operation when the fall 
semester begins Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand opening ceremonies are tentatively scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the signature building on campus," said Ernest W. Maurer, 
the college's dean of technology and a professor of aviation and space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just glows at night," he said of the two-story complex, which is built of 
glass, steel and masonry. "It's really pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 The 78,000-square-foot facility on the western edge of the campus replaces 
seven buildings that were constructed in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging buildings were "not quite up to speed" in terms of meeting the needs 
of today's technology students, Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new complex, Orange Coast College has replaced about 
one-third of its technology equipment at a cost of $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The state paid for the updated equipment and for the center, which took 18 
months to construct. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer said that faculty members are excited about the new surroundings and 
that many have volunteered their time to help get the classrooms set up for 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot for somebody to come in during their summer vacation," he 
said. "They're so stoked, a lot of them have been working 40 hours a week since 
school closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The center has 14 technology programs including aviation and space, computer 
graphics, drafting, construction, commercial pilot training, machine shop, wood 
shop and computer-aided design. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the stuff we teach now has some kind of computer technology attached 
to it," Maurer said. Even in wood shop, which doesn't sound exactly high tech, 
students use a new computer program to design cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers are integral to the technology center. 
</P>
<P>
 All the classrooms and faculty offices are linked by a computer network, which 
allows information to be electronically sent back and forth without the need 
for transferring data to floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also can pull onto the emerging "Information Superhighway" by using 
modems to access the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing catch-up for the last 10 years," Maurer said. "Now we're 
as state of the art as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling complex also has a robot, donated by a defense firm, that is 
being reprogrammed for non-military uses. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear what tasks the robot will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has a holography laboratory, where students will use lasers to 
create holograms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call this our Elvis room," Maurer said of the black-walled lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "The King is going to show up there, no doubt." ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL TO FUND YOUTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several new after-school youth programs are expected to receive funding from 
the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA and Rising Child Care Inc. are seeking more than $40,000 to provide a 
variety of activities including basketball, arts and crafts and day trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are held on weekday afternoons and are aimed at students in 
grades four through six. The programs would be offered at schools citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has set aside more than $80,000 to fund youth programs, which 
officials hope will prevent teen-agers from committing crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving youth services was a key recommendation of the Safe Community Task 
Force, which last year looked into ways of curbing teen-age violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already spent thousands of dollars to sponsor various youth 
sports events and weekend activities, including a periodic "Splash Night" at a 
local swimming pool.

<P>
 Two people were displaced Monday after an attic fire that injured two 
firefighters the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, believed sparked by an electrical problem, caused an estimated 
$400,000 in damage to a two-story house in the 18000 block of James Road, said 
Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange city firefighter suffered a neck injury from debris falling from the 
roof and attic, and a county firefighter suffered a scratch on the eye, Sabol 
said. Both were treated and released from local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, reported at 2:44 p.m. Sunday, was under control 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple living in the home were inside at the time of the fire but unaware 
of it until neighbors spotted smoke, Sabol said. KEN ELLINGWOOD

SANTA ANA'S DEPARTING SCHOOLS CHIEF TOASTED; EDUCATION: RUDY M. CASTRUITA, 
LEAVING FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY, IS GIVEN A SEND-OFF BY COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS AND 
FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At a sunset patio party, community leaders on Monday feted Rudy M. Castruita, 
the Santa Ana's schools chief who is leaving to take over the San Diego County 
Department of Education, as a dynamic speaker and powerful leader who has 
revolutionized Orange County's largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita, 50, collected a large stack of plaques and gifts, handshakes and 
hugs as friends and colleagues toasted and roasted his six-year tenure running 
the Santa Ana Unified School District, the ninth largest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana will always be a special place for you because it is here that you 
came of age," said Rob Balen, one of the district's five trustees. "We will 
miss your charm, your wisdom and your leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred people gathered at the Turnip Rose restaurant for the " Vaya 
Con Dios " farewell tribute, which went to benefit the Santa Ana Education 
Foundation. Sitting at tables whose centerpieces contained a mini-chalkboard, 
ruler, pencils and a shiny apple, the audience included district employees, 
city and county leaders, and Castruita's friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the 43-school district, which serves mostly poor immigrant 
children, Castruita spearheaded business-education partnerships, launched 
health care programs, boosted test scores and even led Santa Ana to adopt as 
its motto: "Education First." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) offered a plaque, as did a 
representative from the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Santa Ana Mayor 
Daniel H. Young even produced the proverbial gold watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ever get in trouble, this could carry you for at least a month," Young 
joked. Then, more seriously, the mayor praised the superintendent as "one of 
the treasures in the world," and noted that it has been difficult to share the 
podium at community events with such a vibrant public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he went before me, nobody wanted to listen to me. If he went after me, 
everybody said, 'Who's the mayor?' " Young sighed. "So, adios, buddy!" 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hernandez, vice chancellor of Rancho Santiago Community College, 
presented Castruita with a collage depicting Santa Ana schoolchildren visiting 
the college campus, and pointed out that 3,000 students have gone straight from 
Santa Ana schools to Rancho Santiago during Castruita's tenure. Hernandez, who 
grew up with Castruita in El Monte, choked up as he made his brief 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to miss you, Rudy," he gasped.

IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE PICKS NEW PRESIDENT; EDUCATION: FORMER SADDLEBACK COLLEGE 
DEAN COMES BACK TO ORANGE COUNTY TO TAKE POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former dean at Saddleback College has been named president of Irvine Valley 
College, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel L. Larios, currently dean of instruction at Tillamook Bay Community 
College in Oregon, will take office in late August or early September, 
Saddleback Community College District spokeswoman Diane Riopka said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine Valley and Saddleback colleges are growing with a diverse student 
population, which excites me," said Larios, a Stockton native who grew up in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Saddleback district board of trustees finalized Larios' 
selection as president at a special meeting late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Larios said he served as dean of the technology and applied science division 
at Saddleback College from 1986 to 1992 before moving to Tillamook Bay 
Community College.  
</P>
<P>
 "The tradition of quality education at Irvine Valley College is going to 
continue," Larios promised in a telephone interview Monday. "I'll be visible. 
That's what I do. I'm in early, I leave late, and I've always had an open door 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 To accept the new job in Orange County, Larios said, he will leave behind an 
Oregon residence that is surrounded by trees and overlooks a rushing river -- 
but the move will be worth it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, I never dreamed I'd live in (this) part of the state," 
Larios said. "But there's something magic about Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 As he ascended the academic ladder, Larios said he never thought he would 
become a college president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only wanted to teach biology and coach baseball," Larios said with a laugh. 
"This is a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 He has held no college presidential posts before, but Larios is familiar with 
the budgetary crises facing state colleges and universities. He said he hopes 
to help Irvine Valley and Saddleback college officials come up with ways to 
ride out economic hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the community colleges are facing these problems," Larios said. "But if 
we want to have a global economy and we want California, Oregon and the Pacific 
Rim states to succeed globally, we're going to have to put some money into our 
educational systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Larios said he has been around academia and teaching in California since the 
1970s. He helped open Cal State Bakersfield in 1970 and designed landscaping 
for the university.  
</P>
<P>
 He taught high school agriculture and biology in 1975, he said. A year later, 
he moved to Bakersfield College, where he was chairman of the school's 
agriculture department and director of grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Larios holds a doctorate of education from Nova University in Florida and a 
master's degree in curriculum from Cal State Bakersfield. He earned his 
bachelor's degree in agriculture science and ornamental horticulture from Cal 
State Fresno.

GATOR AID TOO LATE FOR BEACHED REPTILE 
</P>

<P>
 A strange assemblage of creatures has come ashore at Laguna Beach over the 
years -- seals, sharks, sea lions, a 1,500-pound sea turtle. Even a goat. 
</P>
<P>
 But never an alligator. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say a dead alligator -- about four feet long and weighing 20 to 30 
pounds -- was spotted floating about 100 yards offshore at about 2 p.m. by a 
man on a paddleboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The man hoisted the scaly reptile onto the board and paddled back to the beach 
at Pearl Street, where a stunned group of 35 to 40 people gathered around the 
creature, said Marine Safety Officer Scott Diederich. 
</P>
<P>
 The alligator did not appear to have been sick or injured, Diederich said, and 
it had "very nice sharp teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers were kept a safe distance from the creature, Diederich said, 
though the reptile was not moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not being very well abreast of alligators and their sleeping habits, nobody 
wanted to take a chance," he said. "Its mouth was large enough . . . it could 
probably taken off an adult person's fingers, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The reptile was taken to the Laguna Beach Animal Shelter on Laguna Canyon Road 
where it was being kept for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officer Joy Lingenfelter described it as an American alligator, 
probably under 2 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the trendy exotic pets," she said. Some people keep unusual 
creatures as "status" pets, she said, although it is illegal to do that with 
alligators. Potbellied pigs were all the rage a while back, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingenfelter said alligators have been dumped in a creek near the shelter and 
in the Back Bay in Newport Beach. Had that happened to the reptile in question, 
it could have washed out to the ocean, she said. The lifeguards theorized that 
it may have escaped from captivity on a boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us pretty much say the same thing, 'What a shame.' It's probably 
another exotic pet gone wrong," she said.

2ND CONVICTED IN WOMAN'S MURDER; VERDICT: KATHY LEE, 49, WAS KILLED BY ROBBERS 
IN 1991 AS SHE ARRIVED TO PICK UP HER SON FROM WORK.

<P>
 A Superior Court jury convicted a Los Angeles man of first-degree murder 
Monday for his role in the slaying of a 49-year-old woman who stumbled upon an 
armed robbery in 1991 at a Fountain Valley computer store. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric D. Clark, 23, the second defendant in the case to be convicted of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances, could face life in prison 
without the possibility of parole when he is sentenced Sept. 30, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Randolph J. Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found Clark guilty of burglary, three counts of robbery, 
conspiracy to commit burglary and a special circumstance of committing a murder 
during the course of a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Lee, an executive secretary at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo, was shot 
once in the head on Oct. 18, 1991, in the parking lot of Comp USA when she came 
to pick up her teen-age son who worked at the store. The Garden Grove woman, a 
mother of two, had parked and was walking toward the building at about 10:30 
p.m. when she apparently surprised the robbers and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees inside the business, including Lee's son who was 18 at the time, had 
been handcuffed and gagged during the robbery but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the robbery, a passing Fountain Valley police officer arrested 
Nokkuwa (Pretty Boy) Ervin of Los Angeles. Ervin, the alleged triggerman, was 
convicted of first-degree murder and other felony charges in November and is 
awaiting sentencing in Orange County Superior Court. He testified in court that 
he was not the shooter, and that he was coerced into participating in the 
robbery by gang members who threatened his life and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's brother, William, also has been charged with murder in the slaying. 
Authorities further allege that William Clark killed a prime witness to the 
robbery in Los Angeles County, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eric Clark did not actually shoot Lee, the prosecution contended he 
still is responsible for the death under state law.

POLICE SEEKING GUNMEN IN FATAL DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were seeking the gunmen responsible for a drive-by shooting early 
Sunday that left a 22-year-old man dead and two others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday identified the deceased as Mario Humberto Figueroa, 22, 
of Santa Ana.Another man, identified as Jorge Nolasco, 22, of Santa Ana, 
suffered a gunshot wound to the lower body. A 15-year-old boy also was hit once 
in the lower body. He was not identified by police because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was being investigated by the department's gang unit. No arrests 
had been made by Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The three victims were standing outside in the 300 block of North Jackson 
Street when a car pulled up about 1:50 a.m., police said. When the teen-ager 
approached the car to talk to the driver, shots were fired from the passenger 
window, hitting all three victims. Figueroa was later pronounced dead at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.

POLICE HUNT SUSPECTED KILLER; FUGITIVE: SHASTA COUNTY AUTHORITIES BELIEVE A MAN

 Authorities warned Monday that a Westminster man, suspected of fatally 
stabbing one person in Washington state and wounding another in San Joaquin 
County and stealing their cars, may have fled to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster police said they had been contacted Sunday evening by the Shasta 
County Sheriff's Department asking them to arrest on sight Antonio Magana 
Castro, 27. Law enforcement officials throughout Arizona, California, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington were also notified Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sure that he's left the (Redding) area," Shasta County Sheriff's 
Detective Lance Highet said Monday. "We suspect that he is heading south and we 
have been in contact with agencies there to request their assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Highet said Castro has a history of prior arrests in Southern California and 
may have relatives in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is dangerous," Highet said. "He's already demonstrated that." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Police Lt. Richard Main said, "We don't know anything" about 
Castro's whereabouts. "He was a resident here years ago. . . . We're kind of in 
the dark. There's no indication there were any recent contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Main said Westminster police have no addresses for Castro or his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro was last seen wearing a black jacket, pants and boots. He is described 
as 5 feet 7 inches tall, white, about 170 pounds with a muscular build, short 
brown hair and brown eyes. His front teeth may be capped with gold exposed at 
the gum. 
</P>
<P>
 He is believed to be driving a 1971 white, four-door Ford Torino with chrome 
wheels and license plate number 2RSW557, Lt. Ron Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers, dogs and helicopters combed the area around Shasta 
County's Pollard Flats on Saturday after a CHP officer stopped a speeding car 
on Interstate 5. The driver fled into the woods near the Sacramento River. 
Authorities later discovered that the car was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The car's owner, Mike Fadeff, 72, of Mount Vernon, Wash., had been found 
stabbed to death that morning. Authorities found a cache of stolen firearms -- 
including rifles, shotguns and handguns -- in the car, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities called off the manhunt after learning Castro paid an unsuspecting 
Lakehead, Calif., woman $300 in cash Sunday for her Ford Torino. The man said 
he planned to drive to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed woman later identified Castro through a photograph. He was also 
identified by fingerprints on the car, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from Dunsmuir to Lakehead were advised to stay indoors and to keep 
homes and cars locked Sunday while officers searched along the Sacramento River 
Canyon. Freight trains running through the area also were searched car by car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities warned motorists against picking up hitchhikers and posted 
advisories along Interstate 5 north of Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, the Skagit County Sheriff's Department in Washington 
investigated a burning vehicle near Fadeff's home. The burned car was stolen 
Wednesday from a San Joaquin County man who was stabbed repeatedly during a 
residential robbery. The victim, a resident of Thornton, Calif., was recovering 
in a San Joaquin County hospital.

COMPUTER DISK BARRED FROM HENLEY CASE; EVIDENCE: JUDGE RULES THAT DATA SAID TO 
DETAIL EX-RAM'S ALLEGED ROLE IN DRUG RING CANNOT BE USED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A federal judge ruled Monday that a computer disk said to contain former Rams 
cornerback Darryl Henley's account of his alleged involvement in a 
cocaine-trafficking ring could not be admitted as evidence in Henley's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Gary Taylor said the information on the disk, seized from 
the office of a Los Angeles attorney during a legal search for evidence in an 
unrelated case last year, did not fall under the "plain view" rule, which 
allows the admission of something found in obvious sight by law enforcement 
during a search for other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the information on the disk -- a 10-page missive from Henley to 
attorney Angela Wallace -- was clearly meant to remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incriminating evidence, if any, appears at the end of a lengthy letter," 
and searchers would have had to peruse the entire document to find it, Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U. S. Attorney John Rayburn Jr. said he reserved the right to use 
the information to impeach Henley should he testify later in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues surrounding the disk, seized by Los Angeles Police Detective 
Richard Kellogg during an investigation of an auto insurance fraud ring, became 
increasingly muddled Monday when Assistant U. S. Attorney Deidre Z. Eliot 
announced that Kellogg had threatened to make trouble for the government side 
if he were forced to testify about the disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliot told the court that Kellogg, who initiated contact with the U. S. 
attorney's office to tell prosecutors about the disk's contents, did not want 
to testify at Monday's hearings because he plans to be on vacation with his 
family in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliot said Kellogg told her Thursday that if forced to testify he would "get 
the disk thrown out" of evidence by saying that Eliot had suggested he lie to 
the court about how much he revealed to her about the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliot said Kellogg, at her insistence, had revealed to her only the general 
nature of what was on the disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kellogg had threatened to say that he had read Eliot the entire 
10-page narrative during a telephone call, he later admitted he had not, she 
said. If he had, Eliot would have been in possession of information that was 
not legally obtained, and that might have tainted the government's case against 
Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Roger Cossack, Darryl Henley's attorney, said he planned to 
investigate how much Kellogg told Eliot and if the actions of the prosecutor 
constituted misconduct. He already has filed a motion to have the case against 
Henley dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They now know Henley's innermost thoughts from a letter he wrote to his 
attorney," Cossack said. "You saw how quick they were to say they would use it 
to impeach Henley later. I don't know what this cop did or didn't say." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of Henley and five other defendants, originally slated for May, then 
moved back to Aug. 23, was bumped Monday to Jan. 10, 1995, to accommodate the 
calendars of the attorneys, which now contain television as well as courtroom 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Cossack, somewhat sheepishly, told Taylor that if the trial did not begin Aug. 
23 or after Jan. 1, he might have to excuse himself because of his commitment 
to serve as a commentator for CNN during the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.

4 CANADIANS IN COCAINE RING SENTENCED; COURT: ONE GETS 14 YEARS, THREE OTHERS 
11 YEARS FOR ROLES IN A BILLION-DOLLAR DRUG OPERATION THAT RAN THROUGH O.C.. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal court judge on Monday sentenced four Canadian nationals to prison 
terms of 14 and 11 years in connection with a drug ring that authorities say 
moved as much as $1 billion in cocaine last year through Orange County to New 
York and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Enforcement Agency agents broke the ring in February and seized a record 
1,507 pounds of high-grade Colombian cocaine from the four suspects, whom 
agents said posed as Disneyland tourists to enter the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Alain Famelart, 35, of St. Hubert, Quebec, was sentenced to 14 years in 
federal prison, the stiffest term given to the four during a hearing in Santa 
Ana before Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler. 
</P>
<P>
 Famelart received the longest sentence because the judge found him to be more 
than a "minor participant" in the drug ring, said Robert R. Calo, an assistant 
U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Viau, 33 of Lemoyme, Quebec; Pierre Mailloux, 50, of St. Denis Sur 
Richelieu, Quebec; and Jean Joseph Emery, 41, of Montreal were sentenced to 135 
months, or 11.25 years, in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 All four faced a maximum possible sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Angel Cortes, a 43-year-old Colombian national, is awaiting trial in 
August for his alleged role in the drug ring, Calo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on a tip from Canadian law enforcement authorities, DEA agents 
arrested Famelart and Viau in February after following them from their hotel 
near Disneyland to a motel in Corona, where Cortes allegedly loaded their motor 
home with cocaine. The agents followed Mailloux and Emery the next day through 
the same course. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA agents allege the ring started around January, 1993, when Cortes, then 
living in Costa Mesa, began receiving monthly shipments of cocaine from 
Colombia via couriers in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In connection with the case, Canadian authorities made 21 raids in Montreal 
and arrested 12 people, charging the suspects with conspiracy to import 
cocaine.

SENIOR VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT TO ASSIST POLICE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior citizens are needed to spend six hours a week to help city police run a 
variety of community programs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they prefer applicants for the Volunteer Interest Program 
for Seniors, or VIPS, to be at least 50 years old and retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Their assignments will include many tasks that the city does not have the 
staff to cover. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Registration of bicycles as part of the city schools program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vacation home checks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Child fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clerical support of city police services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Code enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foot and bike patrol of the downtown area and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Participation in the city's elderly support program, which regularly checks 
up on seniors who live alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Program participants must have a high school education or its equivalent in 
life experience. The city will hold classes for all prospective members. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will be covered under state workers' compensation and liability 
insurance provided by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also purchases all equipment and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Because confidential information is sometimes shared in some of the police 
programs, a background check will be conducted on all volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for VIPS are available at City Hall, 33282 Street of the Golden 
Lantern. There is no deadline for joining, although interviews and training are 
scheduled for the first week in September. 
</P>
<P>

ARCHITECTS WIN WITH A BOLT FROM THE BLUEPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A combination of multimillion dollar exoticism and socially conscious utility 
marked the top winners of the Orange County chapter of the American Institute 
of Architects' annual design awards, presented Friday night at "California 
Scenario," the gardens designed by the late sculptor Isamu Noguchi. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three Honor Awards went to Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo of Newport 
Beach for "Palace of the Lost City." The $183 million luxury hotel and theme 
park in South Africa are based on a legend -- invented by the architects -- of 
a magnificent desert kingdom destroyed by an earthquake that left the palace 
largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 All elements of the project -- which includes 13 major waterfalls, two 
mountain rivers, three lakes, a man-made jungle and an 85-foot-tall hotel lobby 
-- were made on a larger-than-life scale to sustain the fantasy vision. Juror 
Bobbie Sue Wood, a partner in Hood Miller Assn., San Francisco, lauded the 
project for its "excellent detailing," use of "real" materials and reliance on 
"the animals of Africa and the universal myths of what a fantasy city would be 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 The other two honor awards went to McLarand, Vasquez & Partners Inc. of Costa 
Mesa for an affordable housing project for the upscale Westpark neighborhood of 
Irvine and to Ralph Allen & Partners of Santa Ana for the science building at 
Polytechnic High School in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 382-unit, 15-acre Westpark project was designed as a new kind of low-cost 
housing to counter "not in my back yard" stereotypes. The architects minimized 
the visual and circulation impact of increased auto traffic by arranging three 
C-shaped buildings with 40 to 50 units each, staggered at a 45-degree angle 
around a parking court. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Don Sandy, a partner in Sandy & Babcock Inc. of San Francisco and Miami, 
said he was impressed that 40% of the units in the Westpark project are set 
aside for low-income renters (15% more than the project requirements). He 
singled out the "unique concept of tuck-under parking" and the "simplicity and 
uncluttered detailing, with strong and powerful forms and color." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Space constraints at Polytechnic High School, which serves 3,000 inner-city 
students, obliged Ralph Allen & Partners to do some creative thinking. Building 
over an existing parking lot, the architects carved out 19,000 square feet of 
laboratory classrooms on two levels. Combined lecture and lab rooms -- the new 
trend in high school science classroom design -- use a common preparation and 
storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror William Crutchfield, an artist, said he and his fellow jurors 
appreciated the way the building fit "beautifully" in a tight space and admired 
"the proportions, the use of materials and the warmth . . . created by barrel 
ceilings made of rich wood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other projects received awards of merit (two each were won by Mark H. 
Singer Architects of Laguna Beach, the Blurock Partnership of Newport Beach and 
Stoutenborough Inc. Architects and Planners of Irvine).  
</P>
<P>
 Betsy O. Dougherty, a partner in Dougherty + Dougherty of Newport Beach, won 
the president's award for "outstanding service to the profession." In 1984, 
Dougherty became the first woman president of the AIA/OC chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Society of Civic Engineers, Orange County chapter, won the 
Architectural Foundation Award for working to gain recognition of blimp hangars 
at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station as a national historic and 
civil engineering landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "California Scenario" itself was honored with an Architectural Foundation Art 
in the Environment Award for "most significant public-oriented artistic 
achievement in Orange County." Henry T. Segerstrom, managing partner of C.J. 
Segerstrom & Sons in Costa Mesa, won the board of directors' award for 
"significant contributions to the development of Costa Mesa and Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Two cities won the community design excellence award: Tustin for the Civic 
Center redevelopment project and San Juan Capistrano for the depot passenger 
loading platform at the Amtrak train station. An honorable mention went to 
Santa Ana and its Council of Arts and Culture for developing the downtown 
Artists Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth juror was Mahrdad Yazdani, a design principal with Dworsky Assn. of 
Los Angeles.

A STOREFRONT VIEW OF A WORKER IN PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strange notion persists that a good way for people to get acquainted with 
art is to watch artists at work and hear them talk about what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, observers always are welcome at craft demonstrations or 
portrait-drawing sessions at county fairs. But making a serious work of visual 
art is innately private. It begins with an image or an idea perhaps only 
vaguely perceived by the artist, and it develops over time in a complex 
dialogue between the artist's imagination and abilities, and the inherent 
qualities of the medium to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 To have to verbalize what one does from moment to moment is to turn this 
intimate activity into a sort of bogus theater. (Obviously, performance art -- 
in which the performance is the work -- is an exception.) For this reason, 
projects like the Floating Storefront Studio Artist-in-Residence program at the 
Irvine Marketplace seem to miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was struck by the special quality of Barbara Berk's storefront 
residency, "21 drawings, 21 days," which ended earlier this month: She refused 
to speak to anyone, even if someone asked her a question. 
</P>
<P>
 As she explained in late June, "My project is simultaneously an installation, 
an exhibition and a performance. The essential aspect of the performance is 
that I am drawing. Each drawing session lasts three hours, and during that time 
I do not interact in any way with anyone who comes into the space. . . . My 
intention is to communicate nonverbally." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that for her, drawing is a basic activity, "like taking a walk or 
cooking." By paring the process down to its essentials, she hoped to focus 
attention on the act rather than the finished product -- just the opposite of 
the way we look at a work of art hanging in a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, despite Berk's rationale, the project probably was more rewarding to 
her than to anybody else. Which is not to say that her experiment failed. 
</P>
<P>
 I dropped in twice during the run of the project. The floor was covered in a 
thin layer of flour, which kept two grumbling men in suits from stepping 
through the doorway. (Berk recalled a perceptive mother explaining to her child 
that the flour allowed visitors to leave their own "mark.") 
</P>
<P>
 The walls were hung with drawings she had done on previous days, in sequential 
order. Two comfortable chairs were provided for visitors, though no one 
lingered. Actually, few people walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Berk worked steadily at a table stocked with Prismacolor pencils, pastels, 
charcoal, rags and a ruler. She seemed almost in a trance, nodding her head and 
flexing her toes in a sort of counterpoint rhythm. Even when I stood up and 
leaned over her table, she never appeared to notice. Every now and then she 
stepped back to look at her drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, I was so self-conscious," Berk said later. "If anyone 
walked in, I'd do very repetitive things with my hand to keep myself busy." Her 
nervousness about being on display seeped into the first few drawings, which 
look tentative and wispy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few days, Berk said, she felt "very self-conscious" about the 
drawings. It bothered her to have to display work she felt was under par. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One day, she suddenly veered from her nonobjective approach and drew the 
corner of a room. "I felt really cornered when I did that corner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent drawings look somewhat like unevenly growing clumps of hairs or 
grasses. "I was playing," Berk said. "I stopped worrying about the drawings." 
</P>
<P>
 It's surely no coincidence that Berk frequently uses hair and grass imagery in 
her sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of her delicately linear three-dimensional pieces in a recent 
three-person exhibition at the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna 
Beach, a soft extrusion of fine blond hairs created a curiously organic zone 
around a cubic stack of sheets of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 During her last 10 days at the Marketplace, Berk tried a different tactic. She 
turned her repetitive manner of drawing -- the slow accretion of hundreds of 
small marks -- into a quiet ritual: a demonstration of the way an artist sets 
herself a "problem" and then attempts to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the impression many people . . . think a drawing must be of something," 
she said. "But all you need is visual curiosity." Planting her wrist on the 
paper, she drew an arc of radiating lines marking the furthest points she could 
reach without moving her arm. By repeating this constrained action as she moved 
her wrist down the paper in tiny intervals, she eventually made several bushy 
columns of pencil strokes that intersected with broad tracks left by her 
graphite-covered forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if the drawing literally grew out of her own body -- a particularly 
apt metaphor for the medium that permits the most intimate and direct link with 
an artist's sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the nuances of that sensibility came across to the casual viewer is 
almost a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Berk said a few viewers scrutinized her activities and returned to 
chart her progress, it's quite possible that even they were bemused by drawings 
that looked more like exercises than the sort of technically or emotionally 
involving tour de force one might expect from an Artist At Work. 
</P>
<P>
 But what too often gets lost in the bureaucratic organization of community art 
events is that their primary beneficiaries should be the artists themselves, 
which is what happened here. If some viewers came away with a clearer notion of 
what it's like to make something out of nothing, all the better. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Floating Storefront Studio Artist-in-Residence program continues at the 
Irvine Marketplace (Campus Drive across from the UC Irvine campus) through Aug.

O.C. LAWSUIT ON EVOLUTION REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school teacher John Peloza won a victory over the Capistrano Unified 
School District on Monday when an appeals court reinstated his lawsuit alleging 
that district officials forced him to teach evolution as a fact rather than as 
scientific theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloza's lawsuit was not "frivolous," as federal Judge David W. Williams said 
when he dismissed it in April, 1992, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the appeals court reinstated the suit, it said Peloza's "only viable 
claim" -- that the district may have violated a First Amendment clause 
prohibiting government from inhibiting religion -- would be "very difficult to 
support factually." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the appeals court's prediction of a tough legal battle ahead, Peloza, 
39, and his attorney called the ruling a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right back to my original contention that all I wanted to do is to 
teach the theory of evolution and to question it," said Peloza of Dana Point. 
"They were pressuring me not to do that and to teach Darwin's theory of 
evolution as if it were a proven fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jeffrey Wertheimer, representing the district, said that Monday's 
ruling reinstating the suit in U.S. District Court was a "minor setback." But 
he said he is confident that when the district presents its case to Williams 
some time in the fall, the judge once again will find in its favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Peloza's argument is that the district forced him to teach a belief," 
Wertheimer said. "We will file a summary judgment motion arguing that this 
wasn't true. He is required to teach the standard state's curriculum on 
evolution, which is that it's a scientific theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did that the first time, and the district court agreed with us," 
Wertheimer added. "But what we did was, we filed a motion to dismiss the case 
instead of a motion that the court agree with our argument." 
</P>
<P>
 After argument in District Court, the judge could agree with the school 
district's contention and grant a summary judgment in its favor, the appeals 
court ruled. Nevertheless, it must allow Peloza the time and opportunity to 
present evidence to support his case. 
</P>
<P>
 But to defeat the school district's contention that it required only that 
Peloza teach evolution as scientific theory, Peloza must prove that district 
officials ignored its own policy and required him to teach the theory as 
undisputed fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus Zal, Peloza's attorney, said he will have no trouble proving that point. 
Therefore, Zal said, the school district was supporting atheism and unlawfully 
took sides in an issue about which the First Amendment required it to remain 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloza, who taught biology at Capistrano Valley High School for more than nine 
years, sued the district, board members and school administrators in 1991, 
after being reprimanded the year before for teaching creationism over evolution 
in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He alleged that the district violated his constitutional rights by forcing him 
to teach what he called "the religion" of evolution. District Judge Williams 
threw out his claims, calling them "frivolous and unreasonable." The judge also 
ordered that he pay more than $30,000 in court costs and attorney's fees. 
Peloza appealed both judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's ruling, the appeals court said Peloza's suit had merit and 
therefore he did not have to pay the district's legal fees. The court, however, 
struck down his other claims. 
</P>
<P>
 It rejected his contention that the district established a state-supported 
religion. It noted that the Supreme Court has ruled that the theory of 
evolution -- which states that higher forms of life evolved from lower ones -- 
is not a religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also rejected Peloza's argument that the district suppressed his 
right to free speech when it prohibited him from initiating discussions of his 
religious views with his students. Any such discussions with students could 
violate the separation of church and state, said Judge David Thompson, who 
wrote the appellate decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "While at the high school, . . . Peloza is not just any ordinary citizen," 
Thompson wrote in the decision. "He is clothed with the mantle of one who 
imparts knowledge and wisdom. . . . To permit him to discuss his religious 
beliefs with students during school time on school grounds would violate" the 
neutrality clause of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals panel also found that Williams erred in dismissing the case 
because he relied on evidence provided by district officials. That evidence was 
not appropriate during that stage of proceeding, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloza has been teaching health and physical education at Capistrano Valley 
High school for a year and a half.

TRW STRIPPED OF MILITARY JOB WORTH BILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal authorities have stripped a top-secret military satellite contract 
from TRW and awarded the business to archrival Martin Marietta, an action 
unprecedented in the high stakes world of multibillion-dollar defense 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss is a serious blow to a firm that has endured a series of setbacks in 
recent years, prompting questions about the long-term future of TRW's military 
space business in Redondo Beach, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW and Martin spokesmen declined comment on the classified decision, though 
industry officials knowledgeable about the program confirmed that Martin's 
aerospace operation in Denver had succeeded in a lengthy battle to unseat TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW had won the contract late last year to build a new fleet of satellites 
that would use radar to scan the skies and seas for enemy targets -- a task 
that would create more than 2,000 jobs and generate more than $2.5 billion in 
revenue over the next decade, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But the losing firms in the competition, Lockheed and Martin, protested to the 
General Accounting Office that TRW had submitted a "low-ball" bid that was well 
below the actual production cost of the satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal purchasing rules are supposed to bar these kinds of bids, in 
practice many defense firms win contracts on proposals that ultimately are far 
below the original cost estimate and result in losses borne by stockholders or 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, analysts and industry experts could not recall another bid 
protest that succeeded on a program of this size. Occasionally, small 
contracts, particularly in desktop computers and software, are protested 
successfully, but big-ticket weapons awards are ordinarily handled with extreme 
care by contract officers to avoid later reversals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the GAO ruled that the satellite contract be rebid and 
Martin submitted a new contract bid that significantly undercut TRW's latest 
bid, according to industry sources. Also, some sources said the new bids might 
have included new technical details or designs for the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense firms in recent years have been at each other's throats, accusing each 
other of foul play and launching hostile takeover battles. The increasing 
tensions reflect the battle for survival in an extremely lean era for the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear what action, if any, TRW will take now, but experts speculated 
that the Cleveland-based company will file a protest seeking to have Martin's 
award overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe TRW will not appeal this," said Michael Beltramo, a defense 
consultant specializing in competitive analysis. "There used to be an attitude 
that you didn't want to rock the boat, because it could come back to haunt you. 
Now, the view is who cares, because if you lose you will be out of the business 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was issued by the National Reconnaissance Office, a secretive 
agency that acts as the development and procurement arm for satellites used by 
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, TRW has been a major supplier to the National Reconnaissance 
Office, the CIA and the Air Force, but intelligence budgets are quickly 
dropping. Although much of military space spending is classified, experts say 
the nation spends about $13 billion annually, down from a peak of $20 billion 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials have testified before Congress that the number of spy 
satellite manufacturers will drop from eight producers to two. TRW would like 
to be one of the survivors and for many years it has been among the best in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "TRW was already on a downhill slope and the slope just got steeper," Beltramo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW employment in metropolitan Los Angeles peaked in 1985 and 1986 at 18,000, 
compared to 10,000 today after reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees have feared for years that TRW might divest its space business, 
just as other major companies such as Goodyear, Ford Motor and General Electric 
have fled the aerospace industry. Lockheed officials approached TRW about a 
possible sale, but nothing resulted from the talks, according to an industry 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace analyst Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities said that TRW does not 
face any immediate crisis and has enough work in its pipeline for a few years. 
But "the outlines of a hole" are emerging in its business and must be filled in 
the next 12 to 18 months or the firm will be forced to disband crucial 
engineering teams, Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW has a large number of remaining programs, but they are either older 
programs that are winding down or nascent efforts that are long shots to 
develop into big money-makers, according to John Pike, a military space expert 
at the Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also recently lost one of its last orders for its cornerstone Defense 
Support Program, an early warning satellite. "Poor TRW," Pike said. "When it 
rains, it pours." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pike, Martin Marietta builds the LaCross satellite, another radar 
spy system, whereas TRW has never built that type of a system. The new 
satellite, known by the designations of 7795 and P-81, will use a highly 
sophisticated "phased array radar," which has a beam that is steered 
electronically rather than with a moving dish. Such radars can track and 
identify targets more quickly and accurately.

THOUSANDS OF RWANDANS RETURN TO WAR-TORN LAND; AFRICA: REFUGEES LEAVE FETID 
CAMPS DESPITE THREATS OF VIOLENCE IN HOMELAND. CHOLERA EPIDEMIC HAS KILLED 
14,000.

 The barefoot old woman hobbled quickly here Monday, her worn bamboo cane 
pounding the pavement as fast as she could walk. Deep inside her native land, 
Generose Nyirandoti was headed home from the horrors of a cholera-ridden 
refugee camp in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 She balanced a rolled sleeping mat on her grizzled gray head. She guarded her 
identification papers in a dirty plastic bag hidden inside her tattered wrap. 
And her gnarled hand held tightly to her most precious possession -- a 
4-year-old granddaughter in a torn, filthy sweat shirt. She was the only 
survivor in her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her father is dead," Nyirandoti said, as the tiny girl tore ravenously into a 
roll offered by a reporter. "Her mother is dead. Even her brothers and sisters 
are dead. We will die too if we stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Zairian officials agreed to open the sealed border after repeated 
urgent appeals by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, 
thousands of Rwandans trudged steadily along the narrow winding road Monday, 
heading home into an eerily deserted land that was once Africa's most densely 
populated country. 
</P>
<P>
 A daylong drive about 30 miles into western Rwanda found looted ghost towns 
and villages perched on beautifully terraced mountains and nestled in lush 
valleys lined with dense groves of eucalyptus and bamboo. Endless green fields 
appeared at every turn, bursting with a bounty of corn, beans and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 But except for the odd military truck, the long line of refugees was the only 
sign of humanity. They walked alone, in pairs, and in groups of 10 and 20, with 
meager possessions on their heads and infants safely bundled on their backs. 
Other than the shuffling of feet, the only sound was the cawing of crows and 
the rustle of the mountain breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Two barefoot men carried another in a stretcher atop their heads, and he 
shaded himself with a ripped golf umbrella. Another hauled a gaunt woman in a 
rusty wheelbarrow. About half a dozen people had collapsed, however, and their 
forlorn corpses lay in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents here were butchered in massacres that began in April, when the 
Hutu government's civilian militias and death squads launched a genocidal 
pogrom of the minority Tutsi population. An estimated 500,000 Tutsis were 
slaughtered, most hacked to death with machetes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front army quickly routed the Hutu 
government, the fleeing 40,000-member military forced virtually the entire Hutu 
population here to cross the border with them into neighboring Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees now live in miserable camps set on a 
moonscape of sharp volcanic rocks. A still-worsening cholera epidemic has 
killed up to 14,000 people, doctors say, and dire shortages of food, water and 
medicine leave tens of thousands more at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the murderous militias now control parts of the disease-ridden 
camps; many of their leaders are reluctantly used by relief groups to help 
distribute what little food is available. Hutu leaders have ordered the 
refugees not to leave, warning that they will be killed if they return. But a 
growing stream of Rwandans have decided to take the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Zaire, they told us they (the victorious rebel soldiers) are killing 
people, but it is false," said Ferdinand Niyatusenga, 29, who headed home in 
lace-less shoes that flapped along the road. 
</P>
<P>
 His barefoot friend, Jean Wemeyirongo, 34, agreed: "It's better to come back, 
even if they kill me." Most of the 50 friends and family members who fled the 
capital, Kigali, with them for Zaire are now dead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the refugees said the victorious RPF soldiers had welcomed them back, 
giving food at check-points and truck rides to a few of the worst-off. "I am 
asking people along the road if we can go on, and people say we have nothing to 
fear," Wemeyirongo added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees, said about 1,000 refugees crossed the border into Rwanda at Goma, 
Zaire, on Monday and several thousand others had headed home through nearby 
forests. "It's going slowly, but it's going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official from the agency was posted at the border to monitor the refugees, 
and about 15 blue-helmeted U.N. troops will be assigned there today. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees were not asked for documents as they crossed into the former 
lakeside resort of Gisenyi. Once home to Rwanda's president and several 
ministers, its elegant villas are empty, and the broad palm-lined streets are 
filled with burned-out vehicles and other debris of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Refugees don't have papers," said Lt. Peter Karake, 39, the RPF commander at 
the border. He added that like many Tutsis, he had grown up as a refugee in 
Uganda and Kenya. "Personally, I don't have papers either." 
</P>
<P>
 The new government has compiled a list of alleged Hutu war criminals, and 
Karake said they will be tried when they are caught. But he said there was no 
urgency. "To hunt people involved in genocide is not overnight," he said. "The 
Nazis are still hunted after half a century. So we are in no hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The border at Goma is still lined with stacks of grenades, assault rifles, 
ammunition belts, machetes and spears -- all confiscated from Rwandans when 
they began crossing into Zaire in an unprecedented exodus about 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Everts, head of the World Food Program operation on the border, said the 
agency hopes to begin truck convoys across Rwanda within days to bring food 
faster to the refugees. He said the returning, empty trucks could then be used 
to carry the old, sick and children home. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, head of U.N. forces in Rwanda, told reporters at the 
border that fighting had ceased inside Rwanda and the situation was "relatively 
calm." He urged people to return to help rebuild their shattered land. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the refugees headed home said they had lost family members in 
the maelstrom of confusion and death at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking alone, Bridgette Uwera, 16, cried as she recalled losing her father 
when she went to fetch water at one of the sprawling camps. "When I came back, 
he wasn't there," she said, tears streaming down her face. She doesn't know if 
he, or her two brothers, their wives and children, are alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home because if I go home, maybe I will find them," she said. She 
said other refugees had given her potatoes and cassava to eat, her first meal 
in days. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, Moise Ngorati sat on the ground with three children, sharing 
millet and potatoes given to them by RPF soldiers. The girls were 8 and 11; 
their brother was 10. Dressed in filthy, cast-off clothes, they stared 
reverently at Ngorati as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met them in Goma," he explained. "They were alone and had nothing to eat. I 
had some sugar and shared it with them. So now we are all together." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would take them to Ruhengeri, a provincial town nearby, then 
continue home to Kigali, hoping to find his own family. "I'm not expecting to 
find them alive," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, hope was hard to find among the survivors. Cleopace Mugabo, a 
barefoot, 38-year-old farmer from Karago, simply shrugged when asked his plans. 
"If I must die, I prefer to die in my own country," he said without emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached up to readjust the bulky sack on his head, patted the boy on his 
back and marched on, silently headed home.

500,000 AFFECTED BY MTA STRIKE; LABOR: WALKOUT BY MECHANICS IS HONORED BY 
DRIVERS AND CLERKS, TAKING 85% OF BUSES OFF STREETS. NO FURTHER TALKS ARE 
SCHEDULED.

 Los Angeles staggered to work Monday, car-pooling, hailing cabs, hitchhiking 
and even walking on the first day of a bus and train strike that left more than 
half a million riders desperately searching for other modes of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout by the Metropolitan Transit Authority's 1,900 mechanics -- honored 
by 5,000 bus and rail drivers and transit clerks -- came after talks on a new 
contract broke down between the MTA and the mechanics union late Sunday night. 
Although unions representing the drivers and clerks reached tentative 
last-minute contract agreements, they decided to support the mechanics' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first shutdown of the nation's second-largest transit system since 
1982, when drivers walked off the job for five days. It was a day of 
aggravation, uncertainty, sore feet and occasional violence by striking workers 
who viewed themselves as pawns in the MTA's desperate effort to balance its 
annual budget of nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, three striking drivers attempted to hijack an MTA bus driven 
by a temporary driver about noon, police said. The suspects boarded the bus and 
threatened the driver with violence while the sole passenger aboard fled, said 
Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. Two were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike's full effect on traffic was not expected to be felt until today, 
when more bus and train riders, having more time to plan, turn to cars. "A lot 
of people just didn't go to work; some people just got scared off," said Jerry 
Baxter, director of the local Caltrans office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 1: 
</P>
<P>
 * Riders waited for hours in vain as only about 15% of the buses hit the 
streets. Because the strike was not called until after midnight, many riders 
were unaware of it until they showed up at their bus stops. Only about 310 
buses -- compared to the normal 1,200 -- rolled on the 30 busiest routes, and 
service was limited to between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Substitute buses included 
yellow school buses driven by private drivers hired by the transit agency at a 
total cost of $160,000 a day. White paper covered the word school and the MTA's 
"circle M" symbol was added to the front, sides and rear of the buses. As the 
news sunk in, some called taxicabs, which reported booming business. Some 
raised their thumbs and hitchhiked, drawing occasional cooperation from 
commuters. Others called friends, and many simply gave up and went home. Moaned 
one San Fernando Valley rider: "I have to pray for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 * No further negotiations were scheduled. There were signs that the strike 
could be prolonged because the main sticking point -- the transit agency's 
desire to contract out some work done by unionized mechanics -- is a 
life-or-death issue to organized labor in many sectors of the economy. 
Complained Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an MTA board member: "The 
mechanics, representing less than a third of the (striking) work force, have 
disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Angelenos -- all in order to 
preserve archaic work rules that reward inefficiency and cost taxpayers 
millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Joe Drouin, a shop steward for the Amalgamated Transit Union, who 
was walking on a picket line outside a bus yard in Downtown Los Angeles: "We're 
fighting for our livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
 * The lack of buses caused unusually high absenteeism in schools across the 
city. At Crenshaw High School, about 500 students out of 1,600 were absent 
Monday. "Our attendance is down significantly due to the bus strike," said 
Jacqueline Wyse, the summer school principal. "I hope it's not going to go 
long-term. We have a lot of kids who want to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * The alleged hijacking attempt by striking drivers was the harshest action of 
the day. It was foiled when police officers noticed the bus pulled over in an 
odd spot near Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards and boarded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year MTA driver Benjamin Leyva and seven-year driver Ace Brawner, both of 
Los Angeles, were arrested and booked on suspicion of robbery. Police were 
seeking a third suspect, who fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't advocate this; we don't condone it. We certainly regret it," said 
Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United Transportation Union. "Sometimes people 
just do things they shouldn't do. We think it's absolutely the wrong thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA reported 40 acts of vandalism against buses and property Monday. The 
city's Department of Transportation reported that eggs and rocks were thrown at 
city DASH buses and that a rock broke the windshield of a Commuter Express bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA pledged to go to court Wednesday to seek a temporary restraining order 
to limit union picketing at its properties. On the Streets 
</P>
<P>
 At street corners throughout town, despair set in early among the 
transit-dependent who make the vast majority of the 1.2 million daily boardings 
of MTA buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Alexander, who lives in Hollywood and works Downtown as a secretary, was 
fuming as she sat in a friend's house, waiting for a car ride that would get 
her to work hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a regular MTA bus rider on a line that runs on Sunset Boulevard, 
said she watched the 11 p.m. news Sunday to see whether there was a strike, saw 
that it was still up in the air, then went to bed and rose to get to her 
regular bus stop at 6:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 She waited 20 minutes. Then another rider, listening to the news on 
headphones, found out about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said she was mad that MTA had not provided any alternate bus service 
on Sunset, a main artery toward Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood out there with a woman with a walker who was trying to get to a 
doctor. I don't understand what people think we're going to do -- jump in our 
Mercedes? Call a friend at 5:30 (a.m.) and say, 'Pick me up?' 
</P>
<P>
 "People who ride the buses, we're already challenged -- disabled people, 
elderly people, handicapped people, hard-working people who get up at 5 a.m. to 
get a 6 a.m. bus. To stand out and get treated like this because we don't own a 
car -- in a city where no one should own a car -- is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 In West Los Angeles, Santa Monica office manager Joyce Cohan waited 20 minutes 
at a bus stop before she learned of the work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a problem," she said. "I have no other way to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting an hour in Wilmington for a bus that never arrived, Holson Chang 
Lee walked 4 1/2 hours before he reached his Crenshaw home. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, who got off work at midnight, reached home at 5:30 a.m. At 
8 a.m., he again waited for a ride, this time to take him to the bank so he 
could withdraw $1,600 to purchase a car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, riders waited patiently and impatiently for buses 
to appear. By 7:45 a.m. more than 50 people crowded three stops at Van Nuys and 
Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks, a major transfer point. 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of Van Nuys and Roscoe boulevards in Panorama City, a man 
waiting at a stop shouted to a friend in a passing car: "Come on, man, I've 
been waiting three hours!" 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Rios, 20, of Van Nuys, kept checking her watch, now edging up on 9:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be at work at 10," said Rios, who was waiting with others at the 
bus stop at Sepulveda and Roscoe boulevards in Van Nuys. She works at a 
McDonald's restaurant in North Hollywood, on Coldwater Canyon Avenue and 
Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hadn't heard about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "No wonder there's no bus," she said in Spanish. "I've been waiting here since 
before 9." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of the strike, she said, "I'm going home." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Cline and his wife finally gave up waiting and started to walk home from 
the stop on Sepulveda and Vose Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we take two buses to the senior center at Victory and Coldwater," 
said Cline, 85. "We have our friends there, have a little fun, a little 
entertainment. Thank God I feel good enough to want to go to the center." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the couple must stay home until the buses begin running again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Ocampo was at the pay phones at Saticoy Street and Sepulveda telling his 
boss he was not going to be able to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in San Fernando, and I don't have a way to get there," said the 
37-year-old gardener. "I'll just have to see about getting a ride there 
tomorrow." Searching for Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters left stranded by the strike were desperately calling taxicab 
companies in unprecedented numbers, often from bus stops and street corners. 
Some taxi dispatchers reported their business was double that of a normal 
workday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, (the strike) might be bad news to the bus riders, but not to the taxi 
drivers," said Belinda Esnayra, a public service agent for Checker Cab Co., 
whose business shot up 40% during the morning commute. "It's amazing how many 
people depend on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the wait for a taxi was often more than an hour during rush hour, and 
cab fares were a far cry from $1.10 bus rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very busy," explained Mae Caringal, a secretary at United 
Independent Taxi who was helping out with dispatching Monday morning because of 
the extra workload. All 231 drivers were on the road Monday instead of the 
usual 100 at a time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People on street corners even tried to flag down the Skycar service, which 
mainly drives travelers to LAX, said dispatcher Tylee James.

 "There are a lot of very desperate-sounding people who've got to get to work, 
got to get somewhere and don't have buses to do that," James said, adding that 
his drivers are trying to help out as much as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board member John Fasana asked employers to be tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're urging all employers to cut a little extra slack for their employees 
today. It may be a little difficult for them to get to work," he said. "We're 
asking everybody to try to help each other out over these next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders on the regular MTA buses were charged 50 cents Monday. Passengers on 
school buses rode for free because the buses have no fare collection equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus system will operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m in the initial days of 
the strike. Service on the Metro Red and Blue Lines will be virtually 
unaffected, but the trains will operate only on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Line trains that ran from Downtown Los Angeles stopped at the Willow 
Street station in Long Beach instead of continuing to the southern terminus in 
Long Beach. Long Beach buses ferried train riders to the end of the line. The 
Negotiating Stalemate 
</P>
<P>
 Contracts between the MTA and its three major unions expired June 30. The 
transit agency reached a tentative agreement at 3:15 p.m. Sunday with the 
United Transportation Union representing drivers and at 2 a.m. Monday with the 
Transportation Communications Union representing clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Amalgamated Transit Union and the transit agency remained at 
loggerheads over the issue of subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials want to contract out some work now performed by union mechanics, 
such as making parts. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at MTA headquarters Monday, officials said it costs the 
agency more to have union workers make dustpans and mop buckets than to buy 
them at a store. 
</P>
<P>
 Union mechanics are skeptical of the transit agency's assurances that no 
employees will be laid off. They regard subcontracting as a union-busting 
tactic and say it could reduce their wages and result in poorer quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put subcontracting on the table, which is definitely something we are 
not going to agree to -- that's taking away our work and giving it to other 
people," said Mike Bujosa, president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated 
Transit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA chief negotiator Gordon Krischer said, "There are items that we can 
purchase for less outside than it costs to make inside." He said that under the 
proposal on the table, union mechanics would be given an opportunity to bid on 
the work. "Let our own employees bid on this work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also opposes the MTA's desire to reduce the hourly wage for newly 
hired mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike drew attention in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for governor, said 
she would have used the governor's power to order a 60-day cooling-off period 
-- a move Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has refused to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got thousands of people who are inconvenienced, who are not able to 
get to their work," she said. "That causes a ripple effect in the whole 
Southern California economy. . . . A cooling-off period would be most 
appropriate. That's what you have those laws for." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Democrats and Republicans on the MTA board had asked him not to 
intercede. Mayor Richard Riordan had said he was concerned that delaying the 
strike until September would give the unions more leverage because the walkout 
would occur as more students were to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the strike appeared to be affecting the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's summer program, in which about 65,000 students are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Idelle Thaler, assistant principal of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, said 
she was advising students "to call up all their friends and neighbors and 
family members -- cousins, aunts and uncles -- to try to get a ride here. The 
vast majority of these kids are here for very specific reasons and this is very 
difficult on them." 
</P>

Shuster, Amy Wallace and Timothy Williams and community correspondent Simon 
Romero. The MTA Strike: Day 1 
</P>
<P>
 The region's first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. 
Here's a look at Day One: 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ISSUE: Dispute between the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing 1,900 
mechanics and service attendants, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks honored the picket 
line. The major sticking point is the MTA's demand to contract out work. Union 
members say they believe that subcontracting will eliminate jobs and result in 
poorer quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE STATUS: No negotiations are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT'S OPERATING: About 300 buses on the 30 busiest routes, out of the usual 
1,900 buses on 200 routes. Some routes will use school buses, operated by 
private drivers, identified by "M" logos in the front and back. Service on the 
Blue Line and the Red Line subway is continuing, as will the Metrolink commuter 
rail and municipal or private operators. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ROUTES: Among the routes on which MTA is offering service: 1/217 
Hollywood Blvd.-Fairfax Ave.; 16 West 3rd St.; 18 E. Whittier Blvd.-West 6th 
St.; 21 Wilshire Blvd.; 30 Pico Blvd.-East 1st St.; 33 Venice Blvd.; 45 
Broadway; 76 Valley Blvd.; 81 Figueroa St.; 92 Glenoaks Blvd.-Brand Blvd.; 105 
Vernon Ave.; 108 Slauson Ave.; 115 Manchester Blvd.-Firestone Ave.; 117 Century 
Blvd.; 125 Rosecrans Ave.; 152 Roscoe Blvd.; 163 Sherman Way; 180 
Hollywood-Glendale-Pasadena; 204 Vermont Ave.; 207 Western Ave.; 210 Crenshaw 
Blvd.; 212 La Brea-S.F. Valley; 240 Reseda Blvd.; 251 Soto St.; 260 Atlantic 
Ave.; 420 S.F. Valley-Hollywood-L.A.; 424 Ventura Blvd.-L.A.; 442 
Hawthorne-Manchester-Express; 470 Whittier-Montebello-L.A.; 560 Van Nuys 
Blvd.-Westwood. Blue Line route runs between Willow station in Long Beach and 
7th/Metro station only. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOURS: Bus and train service from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays only. 
</P>
<P>
 * FARES: 50 cents on MTA buses and the Blue Line, with no transfers. Elderly 
and disabled pay 25 cents. No fee on the emergency school buses. 
</P>

AFTER 46 YEARS, ISRAEL, JORDAN VOW END TO 'BLOODSHED, SORROW'; MIDEAST: 
HISTORIC DECLARATION CLOSES OFFICIAL STATE OF WAR. BOTH SIDES PLEDGE TO MOVE 
TOWARD FULL PEACE TREATY, BUT KEY DETAILS REMAIN UNRESOLVED. 
</P>

<P>
 Israel and Jordan drew 46 years of suspicion and hostility to a close Monday 
as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein, in a declaration signed on 
the White House lawn, pledged to "bring an end to bloodshed and sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony that President Clinton said marks "a new chapter in the march of 
hope over despair," the Israeli and Jordanian leaders promised to resolve 
disputes peacefully and vowed not to "threaten the other by use of force, 
weapons or any other means." 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of all the days of my life, I do not believe there is one such as this," 
said Hussein, a once-dashing young monarch who has grown bald and gray in four 
decades on the Hashemite throne -- all of them under the shadow of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. He said the ceremony would bring both nations "security 
from fear, which I must admit has prevailed over all the years of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, Israel's army chief of staff in the last shooting war between Israel 
and Jordan in 1967, said the agreement shows the neighboring countries can 
"accelerate our efforts towards peace, overcome obstacles (and) achieve a 
breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the soaring rhetoric, their declaration merely ended the technical 
state of belligerency between the two countries, falling short of an official 
peace treaty because key details -- which neither side has disclosed -- remain 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and Hussein promised intensive negotiations aimed at completing the 
second formal treaty between Israel and an Arab state following the 1979 
Israel-Egypt peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone here a long way toward a full treaty of peace and, even though 
our work has not yet ended, it is my hope and belief that not long from today 
we shall return to signing a final and a permanent treaty of peace," Rabin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hussein, Monday's ceremony marked a dramatic break with Jordan's 
traditional determination to keep its foreign policy firmly within an Arab 
consensus. For years, Hussein made it clear he was interested only in a 
comprehensive peace agreement that would cover all Arab countries, especially 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Hussein has not yet signed a peace treaty. But his declaration 
Monday puts Jordan far ahead of Syria and threatens to isolate Syrian President 
Hafez Assad. In the past, Syria has responded angrily to any suggestion of a 
separate peace between Israel and any Arab state. Relations between Damascus 
and Cairo were frosty for years after Egypt made peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sought to smooth Assad's reaction to the Israel-Jordan declaration. In 
a telephone call just before the signing ceremony, Clinton assured him the 
United States considers Syria a major factor in the Middle East and that 
Washington will continue to try to mediate a peace between Syria and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who plans to resume his 
Jerusalem-Damascus shuttle diplomacy before the middle of next month, said he 
hopes Syria will be swept up in the momentum created by Hussein and Rabin. 
"Each one of these historic breakthroughs that happens makes it slightly easier 
for the next one to happen," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony -- conducted at the same table used for the Israel-Egypt 
agreement and for the pact Israel signed last year with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization -- marked a welcome foreign policy success for the 
Clinton Administration, which has been buffeted by crises in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States served as go-between to set up Monday's meeting. In his 
speech, Clinton paid tribute to predecessors Jimmy Carter and George Bush for 
earlier Arab-Israeli peacemaking that helped make the current talks possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made the most of the latest Middle East accord, presiding over the 
ceremony and signing the document himself to demonstrate his government's 
support. "History is made when brave leaders find the power to escape the past 
and create a new future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first publicly acknowledged meeting between Hussein and an Israeli 
prime minister. But, unlike other Arab leaders, Hussein met regularly in 
private with a succession of Israeli prime ministers and foreign ministers in 
what became the Middle East's most widely known secret. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rabin-Hussein meeting was announced 10 days ago, it appeared that the 
most significant outcome would be to take the relationship into the sunlight. 
But Israel-Jordan talks in the last week produced an impressive list of 
substantive agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides better relations with Israel, Jordan is looking for economic 
assistance from the United States, especially some relief from its $700-million 
debt. Although he made no promises, Christopher said the U.S. government "is 
committed to supporting those that take risks for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Israel, carved out of the old British mandate of Palestine, have 
been blocked by almost half a century of hostility from developing cooperative 
economic projects that their similar geography seems to demand. Hussein and 
Rabin pledged to heal that breach, outlining a series of steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct telephone links will be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 * The countries will link their electricity grids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two new border crossings will be opened, one between the twin southern 
cities of Aqaba, Jordan, and Eilat, Israel, and one in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third-country tourists will be given "free access" in traveling between the 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli and Jordanian police will cooperate against crime, especially 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Negotiations will be accelerated toward opening international airline routes 
across both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan also promised to prevent their territory from being used as 
a base for acts of terrorism against the other. And Jordan promised to urge the 
Arab League to end its boycott of Israel, although the kingdom did not 
unilaterally end its own participation in this practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In one provision that is potentially divisive for the Arab world, Israel 
agreed to respect Jordan's role "in the Muslim holy shrines" of Jerusalem. 
Rabin also promised that Israel "will give high priority to the Jordanian 
historic role in these shrines" when negotiations over the final status of 
Jerusalem begin between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 By favoring Jordan's claim to supervise Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the 
Rock on Jerusalem's Temple Mount -- one of the holiest places in Islam -- 
Israel delivered a rebuff to the PLO and its chairman, Yasser Arafat. Arafat 
told Christopher last week the Palestinians were proper guardians of Muslim and 
Christian shrines in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as progress toward peace was being recorded in Washington, Iranian-backed 
guerrillas ambushed an Israeli army convoy in south Lebanon on Monday, killing 
an Israeli officer and wounding 10 soldiers, security sources said. 
</P>
<P>

Break the Legacy of War 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's White House ceremony marked another historic settlement of ancient 
enmities that have plagued the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PLEDGES 
</P>
<P>
 PEACE: The leaders declare, "with the world as their witness," that Israel and 
Jordan have ended their long state of belligerency. Negotiations will continue 
toward a full-fledged peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
 ECONOMIC COOPERATION: The two nations will attempt to abolish all economic 
boycotts and to establish bilateral economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 TELEPHONE LINKS: Direct service between the two countries will be established. 
</P>
<P>
 WATER-POWER: Negotiations will seek the proper allocation of the waters of the 
Jordan and Yarmuk rivers. The two countries' power grids will be linked. 
</P>
<P>
 BORDER: Two new border crossing posts will be established and a survey will be 
made of the common border. 
</P>
<P>
 TOURISTS: Visitors from other nations will be allowed to travel easily between 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 AIR TRAFFIC: Negotiations on an international air corridor between the two 
countries will be speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
 UNRESOLVED 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, Syria and Lebanon have made little progress toward peace since Middle 
East peace talks began nearly three years ago. U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher called the talks between Israel and Syria over the future of the 
Golan Heights "a very intertwined set of negotiations, probably the toughest 
negotiations of all."

D.A. CAN BEGIN DNA TESTS IN SIMPSON CASE; COURTS: GENETIC FINGERPRINTING MAY 
START THURSDAY. RULING ON DEFENSE USE OF BLOOD SAMPLES IS DELAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a contentious three-hour session before a new judge, prosecutors in the 
O.J. Simpson murder case won the right Monday to begin subjecting blood samples 
to DNA tests that may be able to show whether Simpson was at the murder scene 
and whether any of the victims' blood ended up at his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, presiding over the case for the first time, 
attempted to broker a compromise allowing prosecutors to conduct the tests but 
forcing the government lawyers to give Simpson's attorneys as many samples as 
possible so their experts can independently conduct tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side is trying to establish the source of bloodstains found near the 
bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman on June 13, as well as 
other stains discovered in and around Simpson's Brentwood mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito's proposed compromise met with resistance from both sides -- Simpson's 
lawyers would not pledge to share the results of their tests with the district 
attorney's office, and prosecutors would not agree to turn over a portion of 
their samples without that promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Scheck, a New York lawyer who is working with the defense team on DNA 
issues, said Simpson's lawyers could not ethically promise to share any of 
their test results with the prosecution -- especially without knowing what the 
tests would reveal. But without such a promise, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
said the judge would be "taking away prosecution evidence and giving it to the 
defense to be hidden if it doesn't like the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with those sharply divergent views, Ito said government experts could 
begin conducting their tests Thursday. Ito also ruled that a defense expert can 
attend the testing and can cut off 10% of each sample, which will be preserved 
for possible further testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Before deciding how those slivers should be handled, Ito said he wanted to 
hear expert testimony on how much blood is needed to conduct various kinds of 
DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I sense that this is the critical physical evidence," Ito said, "I need 
to be clear on what we're doing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts echoed Ito's view of the importance of the DNA evidence and 
predicted that Monday's hearing presages more sharp disputes about the tests as 
the case moves forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's session, said Southwestern University law professor Myrna Raeder, was 
"an initial skirmish in a much larger DNA war." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also was the first since Ito was assigned last week to preside, 
and the judge appeared calm and relaxed as he oversaw a sometimes highly 
technical debate. He joked that even a political science major such as himself 
could see the implications of certain DNA testing issues. He gently chided 
lawyers for failing to give him the information he needed to craft a ruling on 
how to split samples in a way fair to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither side is helping me very much," Ito complained to the battery of 
attorneys seated at the defense and prosecution tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, the defense has the right to conduct its own tests if 
there is enough material left over after the prosecution has completed its 
analysis. But Clark said government experts would not know how much material 
was needed until after they had begun testing. By that time, it might be too 
late to split up some samples for the defense, Simpson's lawyers countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito struggled with that quandary, ruling in favor of the defense, only to 
reverse field after Clark complained that he was "taking evidence out of our 
hands forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck with complex questions and the shortage of information to decide them, 
Ito wondered aloud at one point whether the issue wasn't a "Yossarian 
situation." Lawyers looked at him quizzically until he added, "You know, 'Catch 
22,' " referring to the Joseph Heller novel and its principal character, a 
military pilot who wants to avoid flying bombing missions but who can only 
avoid them by claiming that he is insane. That claim makes so much sense it 
validates his sanity, forcing him to keep flying. 
</P>
<P>
 As with previous hearings, Monday's was testy and hotly contested, with Clark 
and lead Simpson lawyer Robert L. Shapiro trading barbs early and often. 
Simpson, who took notes on a yellow legal pad and chatted with his lawyers 
during the breaks, nodded as Shapiro accused prosecutors of hypocrisy when 
Clark asserted that they were engaged in a "search for the truth," not merely 
an effort to convict the football superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their presentation is hypocritical at best," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark retorted that Simpson attorneys were misrepresenting the testing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's false," she said in response to one claim by Shapiro. "I don't know 
what Mr. Shapiro is talking about. That is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp exchanges in part reflect the paramount importance that both sides 
attach to the DNA tests. Results from those tests can establish with great 
precision the source of blood or tissue samples, and the results in this case 
could form a major bulwark of either the prosecution or defense cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Under study are a number of blood samples -- droplets found leading away from 
the murder scene, stains on a glove found outside Simpson's Brentwood estate, 
and more stains found on his car, in his driveway and inside his home. 
Conventional blood testing on a droplet discovered at the murder scene ruled 
out 99.57% of the population as possible sources, but left Simpson in the 0.43% 
of the population that could have left it, a police expert testified during the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But even such a small percentage still means that tens of thousands of 
Southern California residents could be in the group whose blood would match 
that sample, so prosecutors are ordering more precise DNA tests. If the DNA 
tests continue to point to Simpson, they would provide powerful evidence 
against him, but if they show that his blood does not match the droplets, a 
crucial component of the prosecution case would disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, investigators are eager to determine whether any blood on a glove 
found outside Simpson's home matches that of either victim or whether other 
bloodstains at his home or in his car could have come from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing was televised live, and legal experts said both sides 
appeared to be playing to the public as well as the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has in previous hearings, Shapiro insisted that Simpson's team wanted 
nothing more than "equal access to all the evidence," while Clark repeatedly 
stressed the prosecution's desire to share as much evidence as possible with 
the defense. Clark described a "very generous offer" to allow Simpson's experts 
to test samples themselves, a gambit that forced the defense attorneys to 
decline because the offer came with strings attached -- namely that prosecutors 
demanded access to any test results performed by the defense experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark put the defense in a bad position" with that offer, said Los Angeles 
defense attorney Andrew Stein. "That was a very good tactical move. . . . The 
public may be asking: Why won't the defense share their results?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, according to Stein and other experienced lawyers, is that defense 
attorneys cannot promise to provide information that may prove harmful to their 
client: To do so would violate their ethical responsibilities. But that issue 
is a subtle one and may be lost on much of the public, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers, by contrast, won the right to have their own expert cut up 
blood samples so that a portion can be preserved for them. In a rare move, 
prosecutors said the defense expert, Dr. Edward Blake, was so well respected 
that he could be trusted to perform the procedure himself, rather than merely 
observing while a government-hired expert carried it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and the attorneys are expected to be back in court Friday, when the 
judge will consider a motion by Shapiro to force the government to turn over 
information that he says will help establish his client's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito still has not set a trial date for the case, but Shapiro reiterated Monday 
that he was unwilling to waive time so that pretrial issues could be discussed. 
If Shapiro and Simpson's other lawyers insist on having the trial at the 
earliest possible opportunity, it could begin Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has attended all the hearings in the case thus far. Although he did 
not speak during Monday's session, he huddled frequently with Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., a well-known attorney who is the latest addition to Simpson's 
legal team. 
</P>
<P>
 As the session ended, a spectator yelled out: "Good luck, O.J!" 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson smiled and quietly responded: "Thank you."

STRANDED BUS RIDERS FORCED TO IMPROVISE; TRANSIT: GOOD SAMARITANS HELP SOME. 
OTHERS HOOF IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 If he had wanted to capitalize on a bad situation, Carlos Lucero could have 
employed his red pickup truck as a bandit cab, turning a quick dollar by 
catering to the anxious hordes of bus riders stranded on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the 57-year-old security guard spent Monday morning dispensing random 
acts of kindness along the famed thoroughfare, giving free rides to a Hollywood 
hair stylist, a movie usher at the Beverly Connection, a cook at an Italian 
restaurant, and an Echo Park woman on her way to a parenting class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought that if you did a favor, God would pay you back -- many 
times over," said Lucero, a Guatemala native, who cruised the boulevard while a 
tape of Spanish-language Christian music thumped inside his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuters who piled into Lucero's truck were among the thousands of 
car-less Angelenos forced to improvise their way along Sunset -- one of the 
city's most culturally diverse arteries, a route where the much-maligned mass 
transit system serves as a vital link in daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those stuck were immigrants, the foot soldiers in Los Angeles' 
low-income work force, for whom the lumbering, graffiti-scarred buses are the 
only way to a housecleaning job in Pacific Palisades or a construction site 
Downtown. In a city whose history, image and fate have long been tied to the 
automobile, they saw Monday's strike as just another indignity for an already 
beleaguered commuting public. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're telling us we're worse than garbage," said Leyla Amin, a 24-year-old 
native of Costa Rica, who waited vainly at a Hollywood corner for a ride to her 
Westside secretarial job. "They wouldn't leave the garbage out without picking 
it up, would they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, they have been known to do that, but it came as little comfort to 
Amin. Two hours after leaving her Glendale home, she finally gave up and called 
a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commuters, surprised by the mechanics' strike that crippled the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus system, telephoned friends or 
co-workers. Hospital manager Sandy Carter, stranded at a bus stop near Sunset 
and La Brea Avenue, was told that a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center van would pick 
her up. She didn't even want to think about her trip home, destined to be a 
hellish journey back to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited bus service left many stuck at the same corner, including Daniela 
Adamcova, a 31-year-old Czechoslovakian immigrant, who was late for her job as 
a salesclerk Downtown. Agustin Carrillo, a 24-year-old house painter from 
Hawthorne, had been waiting for two hours. Idalia Garcia, three hours after 
leaving South-Central Los Angeles, was resigned to losing the $45 that she 
expected to earn cleaning a Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not fair to us," said Garcia shortly before she boarded a yellow 
school bus put into emergency service by the MTA that took her down La Brea, 
back to South-Central. "Not everyone can afford a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Others simply decided to hoof it, trekking along Sunset in the searing midday 
sun. Needing to get to Hollywood, 43-year-old Shirley McKenzie had ridden on a 
Culver City bus from her home in Marina del Rey to Westwood, only to learn that 
the MTA bus she was counting on wouldn't be along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, but what are you going to do?" she said, as she rounded a 
noisy, dangerous stretch of the boulevard with no sidewalks at the western edge 
of Beverly Hills. No sooner had she spoken than an MTA bus approached from 
behind, slowing briefly and then barreling forward, leaving her in a swirl of 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign on top said, "Not In Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the ocean, bus stops usually crammed with nannies and housekeepers 
coming and going from pricey homes were largely deserted. Miriam Hernandez, 23, 
a live-in maid from North Hollywood, had a friend drop her off at the main 
commercial strip in Pacific Palisades, then walked the remaining mile to her 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go home until Saturday," she said. "I'll be OK as long as they settle 
it by then." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could take the bounce out of DJ Slice's stride, even though the first 
bus strike in more than a decade had coincided with his first day as a bus 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
 As he strolled east on Sunset, from Vermont Avenue toward Downtown, the 
21-year-old music producer said he had grown weary of the long drive from his 
home in Pomona to the Motown studios in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you drive every single day, all day every day, like me, it'll kill you," 
said Slice, breezing through Silver Lake, then Echo Park, on stylish leather 
sandals. "I figured that on the bus at least I could sleep and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he decided to switch to mass transit at the urging of his father, a 
veteran Los Angeles County safety officer and devoted bus commuter. Monday was 
the first day of the experiment. Slice had spent the weekend at his 
girlfriend's house in Hollywood and was planning to take the bus Downtown to 
visit his father, who had gone to work in Slice's '84 Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I loaned my dad the truck -- to start getting used to this," said 
Slice, who eventually picked up his car keys at the county Department of Public 
Social Services on East 4th Street, where his father works as a guard. "Today 
may be screwed up. But I'm getting on that bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Lucero had not planned to spend his morning bailing out the stranded. 
He had taken his mother-in-law to County-USC Medical Center, where she was 
scheduled to have a cast removed from her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back, however, Lucero saw the crowd gathered at Sunset and Echo 
Park Avenue, where more than a dozen people were milling anxiously, craning 
their necks in search of a bus that would never come. Figuring he would offer a 
quick ride, maybe as far as Vermont, Lucero pulled to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me nervous to see people with problems," Lucero said later. "If I 
can help, I give a hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Chavez, trying to make it to a parenting class in the Mid-Wilshire 
area before 10 a.m., hopped in the front of his Mitsubishi pickup, right next 
to the "Jesus Te Ama" sticker on the dashboard. Roberto Ramirez, 25, who works 
for a Hollywood paralegal, piled into the camper shell, alongside Reyna 
Castillo, a 31-year-old cook anxious to make it to her Italian restaurant to 
prepare for the lunch shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll buy a car one of these days," Castillo said. "When I hit the 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next hour and a half, Lucero carted them through Hollywood, along the 
way picking up Susana Alcazar, 34, a stylist at Irma's Beauty Salon, and 
Mordechai Raphael, 27, an usher at the Beverly Connection, who was wearing a 
red vest with a button advertising "It Could Happen to You," a new movie about 
a winning lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of like a lifeboat situation," said Raphael, as he crouched in 
the back of the truck on a soiled piece of green carpet, next to a gallon jug 
of antifreeze. When he hopped out, he handed Lucero a dollar for his trouble.

BUDGET REPORT MAY BACK LESSER HEALTH REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development that could alter the balance of the health care debate, the 
Congressional Budget Office has tentatively determined that a modest approach 
to revamping the health care system would be significantly less expensive and 
more workable than initially believed, congressional sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the conclusion in the CBO's final report, it could add fuel to a 
movement among moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats toward more 
conservative reforms that would fall short of President Clinton's goal of 
universal coverage. The report may be released as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 A more modest measure, such as one approved earlier this month by the Senate 
Finance Committee, would contain no mandate that employers pay for any part of 
their workers' health benefits and would contain no government-imposed price 
controls on insurance premiums -- giving it strong appeal among lawmakers who 
see those elements of Clinton's plan as too drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee bill, which is the only health care alternative 
to have significant support among members of both parties, is one of several 
that Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) must consider as he 
prepares legislation to take to the Senate floor this week or next. Mitchell 
has insisted, however, that he will not back away from universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his allies in Congress have warned that an incremental approach 
would be unworkable because it would lack the necessary funding, particularly 
to provide subsidies to help poor and moderate-income people buy health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bill lacked the controversial employer mandate, the subsidies were 
its chief means of assuring coverage to those who could not otherwise afford 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's backers feared the budget office would find that the measure would 
fall short by as much as $100 billion over five years. Instead the CBO has 
tentatively determined that the gap is far more bridgeable -- well under $20 
billion, according to sources familiar with the early draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've heard is too good to be true," said Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), one 
of the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), the chief GOP architect of the 
legislation: "It just shows that our figures are good. It says that the figures 
show it can work. I just hope they're right." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sources said, the Finance Committee bill also falls several 
percentage points short of its target of expanding coverage to 95% of the 
population. It would get to about 92%, up from the current level of about 85% 
but well short of Clinton's goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's allies, taken off guard when reports of the CBO draft swept Capitol 
Hill, strove to put the best face on them. "In many respects, it's good news 
that we can do so much for so little," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). However, 
he added, "93% is not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes us a little over halfway to where we want to go. In a sense, the 
first half is less costly," Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) met with other 
members of the Democratic leadership to brief them on the bill that he is 
putting together to take to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be based on legislation approved earlier by the House Ways and Means 
Committee, a measure that achieves universal coverage through a combination of 
an employer mandate and a vast expansion of the Medicare program. However, he 
said, "a lot of issues" remain to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
 One leadership aide said that Gephardt is under pressure from House Democrats 
to fashion a bill that would take effect more gradually and include more 
financial aid for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's hearing from members is 'We need more time and we need more 
subsidies,' " the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt told reporters that he expects to make a draft of his measure public 
by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * A new study on the unprecedented advertising blitz by all sides in the 
controversy found that 59% of broadcast ads and 28% of print ads were "unfair, 
misleading or false" and designed mostly to play on public fears of change. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst ads were direct-mail campaigns that targeted the elderly, according 
to the study directed by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University of 
Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center. The study was released here. 
</P>
<P>
 "A high percentage of the ads impugn the goodwill and integrity of those on 
the other side of the issue," the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-Clinton-plan ads tended to overstate the extent of the problem or asserted 
that the Republican alternatives will do nothing to help individuals, Jamieson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Clinton-plan ads tended to exaggerate the effect of the President's 
proposals on potential job loss and consumer choice of health care providers, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Jamieson reported that special-interest groups appear 
likely to spend more money on advertising linked to health care reform (more 
than $60 million) than was spent on ads by both the Clinton and George Bush 
campaigns during the 1992 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was announced that several Cabinet secretaries will participate in the 
"Health Security Express" bus caravans, which are to bring "reform riders" to 
Washington in early August. The caravans are being organized by several groups 
that back comprehensive health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal judge in Washington ordered a trial to determine whether the 
records of the White House's health care task force should be made public. The 
panel spent much of 1993 developing the President's massive reform agenda 
behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said there are too many factual disputes 
that can only be resolved in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The case grew out of a lawsuit filed by the Assn. of American Physicians and 
Surgeons, the American Council for Health Care Reform and the National Legal 
Policy Center, seeking hundreds of thousands of transcripts, drafts, minutes 
and other documents generated by the 500-member-plus task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The three groups argue that the Federal Advisory Committee Act requires any 
such group to meet in public if it includes non-government members, citing the 
participation of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

ALTMAN DENIES HE MISLED CONGRESS IN WHITEWATER PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, resisting Republican demands for his 
resignation, Monday strongly defended himself against allegations that he 
misled Congress about contacts between the White House and Treasury officials 
who were overseeing the government's Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman took the offensive on the eve of congressional hearings into 
allegations that he and other top officials responsible for the investigation 
by the Resolution Trust Corp. had improperly transmitted information about the 
inquiry to President Clinton's advisers at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a recent statement by Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., 
who chose not to prosecute officials involved in the Treasury Department's 
contacts with the White House, Altman declared that he did nothing illegal or 
unethical. He also received a vote of confidence from Clinton and Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Roger Altman has been an excellent deputy Treasury secretary 
and we want him to continue in that capacity," Clinton and Bentsen said in 
their joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 24, Altman -- a personal friend of the President -- acknowledged under 
questioning by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he 
had discussed the RTC investigation with White House officials on one occasion 
earlier that month. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Altman was acting head of the RTC, which was looking into 
possible links between Clinton's investment in the Whitewater resort 
development in the 1970s and a failed Arkansas savings and loan owned by 
Clinton's investment partner, James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 When he testified, Altman said Monday, he was unaware of similar discussions 
that Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson had had with the White House. Hanson 
is expected to tell House and Senate committees conducting the Whitewater 
hearings that she discussed the matter with White House officials the previous 
fall at Altman's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson's story has caused Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and other 
Republicans to conclude that Altman intentionally misled the Senate Banking 
Committee. As a result, GOP members are demanding Altman's resignation from his 
job as the No. 2 official at the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman made it clear that he will not give up easily. "As far as taking 
the fall is concerned, I don't expect to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman told reporters that he had no recollection of asking Hanson to brief 
White House officials about the Whitewater-related investigation but he stopped 
short of accusing her of lying. He said he was unaware of Hanson's claim until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "My testimony was correct," Altman said. "I have no recollection of asking Ms. 
Hanson to brief the White House. There is nothing unusual for recollections to 
differ. The events in question occurred five months before my testimony. I know 
that she has a different recollection. I just disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 As acting RTC head until last March 31, Altman was technically responsible for 
the agency's investigation into allegations that money from the failed Madison 
Guaranty Savings and Loan was diverted by McDougal to his joint Whitewater 
investment with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman insisted that he never knew anything about the substance of the 
investigation and that he did not discuss it in detail with White House 
officials. Instead, he said, he simply briefed then-White House Counsel Bernard 
Nussbaum on the publicly acknowledged procedures that the RTC would be using to 
investigate Clinton's controversial investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a more significant level," he added, "I made no decisions and never 
influenced the direction or the substance of the Madison case at any time 
during my tenure at the RTC. And I never imparted any non-public information 
about the case to the White House or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman also denied a number of other recent news reports about his knowledge 
of the Whitewater inquiry and his role in advising the White House about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he disputed a statement that Joshua L. Steiner, Bentsen's 
chief of staff, reportedly wrote in a personal diary. According to those who 
have read the diary, Steiner wrote that White House officials had put heavy 
pressure on Altman not to recuse himself from playing a role in the Whitewater 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 25, one day after testifying before the Senate Banking Committee about 
his discussions of the Whitewater investigation with White House officials, 
Altman announced that he was removing himself from any further official 
involvement in the case. The announcement apparently took the White House by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Altman insisted that his recusal was only a perfunctory step 
because he had already told RTC officials that he wanted to play no part in the 
Whitewater case. As a result, he said, he was never privy to any inside 
information about the substance of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After he recused himself, Altman said, he received a call from White House 
aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold M. Ickes, who told him that the 
President was angry that he had not been notified in advance. As a result, he 
said, he regretted his failure to warn the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman also denied reports that a former RTC official told him in March, 1993, 
that the RTC had referred the Whitewater case to the Justice Department for 
possible criminal prosecution. "I firmly believe that he did not do so. That is 
my recollection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Altman did acknowledge reports that he has surrendered to 
congressional investigators several pages of his so-called "scrapbook," in 
which he is said to have written that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
strongly opposed the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 
Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to some reports, Altman said, he does not keep a diary. He said that 
the scrapbook, which includes newspaper clippings, documents and occasional 
handwritten comments, contained no more than a few sentences pertaining to 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman declined to say exactly what he had written in the scrapbook about the 
First Lady, but he noted that he had already apologized to her for any 
embarrassment his remarks might cause her when -- and if -- they are made 
public during the congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told reporters that both the President and Mrs. Clinton have told him 
on separate occasions that he should not be concerned about the political 
ruckus that his Whitewater-related activities have caused on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings into the matter begin today with the testimony of White House Counsel 
Lloyd N. Cutler before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
Another session is scheduled for Thursday, with three more next week. The 
Senate Banking Committee starts its Whitewater hearings Friday. Preview of

500,000 AFFECTED BY MTA STRIKE; LABOR: WALKOUT BY MECHANICS IS HONORED BY 
DRIVERS AND CLERKS, TAKING 85% OF BUSES OFF STREETS. NO FURTHER TALKS ARE 
SCHEDULED.

<P>
 Los Angeles staggered to work Monday, car-pooling, hailing cabs, hitchhiking 
and even walking on the first day of a bus and train strike that left more than 
half a million riders desperately searching for other modes of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout by the Metropolitan Transit Authority's 1,900 mechanics -- honored 
by 5,000 bus and rail drivers and transit clerks -- came after talks on a new 
contract broke down between the MTA and the mechanics union late Sunday night. 
Although unions representing the drivers and clerks reached tentative 
last-minute contract agreements, they decided to support the mechanics' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first shutdown of the nation's second-largest transit system since 
1982, when drivers walked off the job for five days. It was a day of 
aggravation, uncertainty, sore feet and occasional violence by striking workers 
who viewed themselves as pawns in the MTA's desperate effort to balance its 
annual budget of nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, three striking drivers attempted to hijack an MTA bus driven 
by a temporary driver about noon, police said. The suspects boarded the bus and 
threatened the driver with violence while the sole passenger aboard fled, said 
Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. Two were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike's full effect on traffic was not expected to be felt until today, 
when more bus and train riders, having more time to plan, turn to cars. "A lot 
of people just didn't go to work; some people just got scared off," said Jerry 
Baxter, director of the local Caltrans office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the MTA yard in Sun Valley, about 30 strikers -- some with children and 
dogs in tow -- showed up to heckle supervisors and the others who drove the few 
MTA buses on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirits were high as they hoisted homemade signs and booed the drivers, 
reserving special venom for service inspectors, who normally board buses at 
random to check on whether the regular drivers are observing all regulations. 
But when a popular supervisor was at the wheel, the taunts were more in fun 
than anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Some strikers apparently wondered whether the tone was too lighthearted, 
lacking the usual militant union touches. "Maybe we should all be yelling 
'scab' or something like that when the buses go by," a striker suggested at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 1:  
</P>
<P>
 * Riders waited for hours in vain as only about 15% of the buses hit the 
streets. Because the strike was not called until after midnight, many riders 
were unaware of it until they showed up at their bus stops. Only about 313 
buses -- compared to the normal 1,200 -- rolled on the 30 busiest routes and 
service was limited to between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Substitute buses included 
yellow school buses driven by private drivers hired by the transit agency at a 
total cost of $160,000 a day. White paper covered the word school and the MTA's 
"circle M" symbol was added to the front, sides and rear of the buses. As the 
news sunk in, some called taxicabs, which reported booming business. Some 
raised their thumbs and tried to hitchhike, drawing occasional cooperation from 
commuters. Others called friends, and many simply gave up and went home. Moaned 
one San Fernando Valley rider: "I have to pray for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders waited, both patiently and impatiently, for buses to appear at San 
Fernando Valley stops. By 7:45 a.m., more than 50 people crowded three stops at 
Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks, a major transfer point. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Nuys and Roscoe boulevards in Panorama City, a man waiting at a stop 
shouted to a friend in a passing car: "Come on, man, I've been waiting three 
hours!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Cline and his wife finally gave up waiting and started to walk home from 
the stop on Sepulveda Boulevard and Vose Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we take two buses to the senior center at Victory and Coldwater," 
said Cline, 85. "We have our friends there, have a little fun, a little 
entertainment." Now, they said, they must stay home until the buses begin 
running again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Ocampo was at the pay phones at Saticoy Street and Sepulveda telling his 
boss he was not going to be able to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in San Fernando, and I don't have a way to get there," said the 
37-year-old gardener. "I'll just have to see about getting a ride there 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 * No further negotiations were scheduled. There were signs that the strike 
could be prolonged because the main sticking point -- the transit agency's 
desire to contract out some work now done by unionized mechanics -- is a 
life-or-death issue to organized labor in many sectors of the economy. 
Complained Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an MTA board member: "The 
mechanics, representing less than a third of the (striking) work force, have 
disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Angelenos -- all in order to 
preserve archaic work rules that reward inefficiency and cost taxpayers 
millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Joe Drouin, a shop steward for the Amalgamated Transit Union, who 
was walking on a picket line outside a bus yard in Downtown Los Angeles: "We're 
fighting for our livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
 * The lack of buses caused unusually high absenteeism in schools across the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monroe High in North Hills, there were 160 pupils absent out of 1,300. Just 
13 students showed up in one class of about 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "A day in summer school -- because of the focus and concentration -- is like 
the equivalent of five (regular) school days," said Thane Opfell, Monroe 
assistant principal. "If we have kids out five days, that would be very hard to 
get caught up." 
</P>
<P>
 * The attempted hijacking by striking drivers was the harshest action of the 
day. It was foiled when police officers noticed the bus pulled over in an odd 
spot near Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards and boarded it. Five-year MTA 
driver Benjamin Leyva and seven-year driver Ace Brawner, both of Los Angeles, 
were arrested and booked on suspicion of robbery. Police are seeking the third 
suspect, who fled. "We don't advocate this; we don't condone it. We certainly 
regret it," said Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United Transportation Union. 
"Sometimes people just do things they shouldn't do. We think it's absolutely 
the wrong thing to do." The MTA reported 40 acts of vandalism against buses and 
property Monday. The city's Department of Transportation reported that eggs and 
rocks were also thrown at DASH buses and that a rock broke the windshield of a 
Commuter Express bus. On the Streets 
</P>
<P>
 At street corners throughout town, despair set in early among the 
transit-dependent who make the vast majority of the 1.2 million daily boardings 
of MTA buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Alexander, who lives in Hollywood and works Downtown as a secretary, was 
fuming as she sat in a friend's house, waiting for a car ride that would get 
her to work hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a regular MTA bus rider on a line that runs on Sunset Boulevard, 
said she watched the 11 p.m. news Sunday night to see whether there was a 
strike, saw that it was still up in the air, then went to bed and rose to get 
to her regular bus stop at 6:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 She waited 20 minutes. Then another rider, listening to the news on a radio 
with headphones, found out about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said she was mad that MTA had not provided any alternate bus service 
on Sunset, a main artery toward Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood out there with a woman with a walker who was trying to get to a 
doctor. I don't understand what people think we're going to do -- jump in our 
Mercedes? Call a friend at 5:30 (a.m.) and say, 'Pick me up?' 
</P>
<P>
 "People who ride the buses, we're already challenged -- disabled people, 
elderly people, handicapped people, hard-working people who get up at 5 a.m. to 
get a 6 a.m. bus. To stand out and get treated like this because we don't own a 
car -- in a city where no one should own a car -- is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 In West Los Angeles, Santa Monica office manager Joyce Cohan waited 20 minutes 
at a bus stop before she learned of the work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a problem," she said. "I have no other way to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting an hour in Wilmington for a bus that never arrived, Holson Chang 
Lee walked 4 1/2 hours before he reached his Crenshaw home. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, who got off work at midnight, reached home at 5:30 a.m. At 
8 a.m., he once again waited for a ride, this time to take him to the bank so 
he could withdraw $1,600 to purchase a car. Groping for Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters left stranded by the strike were desperately calling taxicab 
companies in unprecedented numbers, often from bus stops and street corners. 
Some taxi dispatchers reported their business was double that of a normal 
workday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, (the strike) might be bad news to the bus riders, but not to the taxi 
drivers," said Belinda Esnayra, a public service agent for Checker Cab Co., 
whose business shot up 40% during the morning commute. "It's amazing how many 
people depend on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the wait for a taxi was often more than an hour during rush hour, and 
cab fares were a far cry from $1.10 bus rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very busy," explained Mae Caringal, a secretary at United 
Independent Taxi who was helping out with dispatching Monday morning because of 
the extra workload. All 231 drivers were on the road Monday instead of the 
usual 100 at a time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People on street corners even tried to flag down the Skycar service, which 
mainly drives travelers to LAX, said dispatcher Tylee James. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of very desperate-sounding people who've got to get to work, 
got to get somewhere, and don't have buses to do that," James explained, adding 
that his drivers are trying to help out as much as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board member John Fasana asked employers to be tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're urging all employers to cut a little extra slack for their employees 
today. It may be a little difficult for them to get to work," he said. "We're 
asking everybody to try to help each other out over these next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders on the regular MTA buses were charged 50 cents. Passengers on school 
buses rode for free because the buses have no fare collection equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus system will operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m in the initial days of 
the strike. Service on the Metro Red and Blue Lines will be virtually 
unaffected, but the trains will operate only on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Line trains that ran from Downtown Los Angeles stopped at the Willow 
Street station in Long Beach instead of continuing to the southern terminus in 
Long Beach. Long Beach buses ferried train riders to the end of the line. The 
Negotiating Stalemate 
</P>
<P>
 Contracts between the MTA and its three major unions expired June 30. The 
transit agency reached a tentative agreement at 3:15 p.m. Sunday with the 
United Transportation Union representing drivers and at 2 a.m. Monday with the 
Transportation Communications Union representing clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Amalgamated Transit Union and the transit agency remained at 
loggerheads over the issue of subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials want to contract out work now performed by union mechanics, such 
as making parts. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at MTA headquarters Monday, officials said it costs the 
agency more to have union workers make dustpans and mop buckets than to buy 
them at a store. 
</P>
<P>
 Union mechanics are skeptical of the transit agency's assurances that no 
employees will be laid off. They regard subcontracting as a union-busting 
tactic and say it could reduce their wages and result in poorer quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put subcontracting on the table, which is definitely something we are 
not going to agree to -- that's taking away our work and giving it to other 
people," said Mike Bujosa, president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated 
Transit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA chief negotiator Gordon Krischer said, "There are items that we can 
purchase for less outside than it costs to make inside." He said that under the 
proposal on the table, union mechanics would be given an opportunity to bid on 
the work. "Let our own employees bid on this work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also opposes the MTA's desire to reduce the hourly wage for newly 
hired mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the strike appeared to be affecting the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's summer program, in which about 65,000 students are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Idelle Thaler, assistant principal of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, said 
she was advising students "to call up all their friends and neighbors and 
family members -- cousins, aunts and uncles -- to try to get a ride here. "The 
vast majority of these kids are here for very specific reasons and this is very 
difficult on them."

WORKERS ADJUST IN LEANER, EVOLVING MARKET FOR JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wylen Won has a good job as director of a blood-bank medical laboratory, a 
career for which he studied hard in a field expected to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 He supervises a staff of 15, holds a position that can pay as much as $70,000 
a year, has health insurance and thoroughly enjoys his work at HemaCare in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Won's good fortune is tempered by caution. The 42-year-old medical 
technologist recently began selling Amway housecleaning products on the side 
and keeps a plastic tray of samples on his desk. He figures it will supplement 
his income for now and offer an alternative if he falls victim to corporate 
downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's just not safe these days to put all your eggs into one basket," 
said Won, the son of a retired aerospace engineer and a married father of two. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of wariness is common among workers today, even those with the sorts 
of jobs expected to proliferate into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, studies show that smaller firms such as HemaCare 
are thriving. The healthiest fields include not only the biomedical industry, 
but entertainment, computer hardware and software, general industrial 
machinery, and even aerospace subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 But employees are keenly aware that they are the most vulnerable in a time of 
leaner operating budgets and changing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more low-paying jobs and a small supply of high-paying positions are 
forecast into the 21st Century. Of the 50 occupations expected to grow the 
fastest in the next six years, 29 will pay minimum wage, according to the state 
Employment Development Department. And economists predict that more employers 
will rely on part-time workers and independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of interviews with Valley workers from both ends of the wage 
spectrum in a variety of growing business sectors, younger employees generally 
seemed happier and more optimistic. That was also true for unskilled 
immigrants, or the children of working-class immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But for baby boomers raised in middle- and upper-middle-class American homes, 
there was an underlying anxiety, and several questioned whether they will ever 
match their parents' standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy books anymore, or CDs. I don't go out to eat very much; I don't 
go to concerts like I used to," said Paula Berinstein, a former librarian and 
computer programmer who became a self-employed researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now my money is going to things like health care, insurance, taxes, 
earthquake repairs, keeping up the house, plumbing, all that kind of stuff," 
said the owner of Berinstein Research in Woodland Hills. "And I don't travel 
very much and I don't buy a lot of clothes and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Berinstein, 44 and single, relishes her independence and 
considers herself lucky to be her own boss. She gave up secure, corporate jobs 
to do so, joining a growing legion of home-based consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 She works mainly from her two-bedroom house, dressing in jeans, setting her 
own schedule, and telecommuting via phone, fax and e-mail. A couple times a 
week, she might drive down to her alma mater, UCLA, and use one of its 
well-stocked libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she becomes an instant expert on subjects ranging from political 
campaigns to citrus distribution, she'll write up the information for clients 
including screenwriters, attorneys and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find now when I work, I really work," Berinstein said. "I don't fool 
around, whereas when I worked for somebody else, I had a whole other 
perspective on it. Now, I have a reputation to uphold." 
</P>
<P>
 She has yet to get rich and supplements her $35,000 in annual revenues by 
working part-time for her father's investment firm. She hopes "all this hoopla 
about the information superhighway will help." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent filmmaker Bill Morgan also hopes to capitalize on technology's 
rapidly expanding ways of storing and conveying information. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Berinstein, Morgan has a liberal arts background but has become 
increasingly immersed in computers. Now he is throwing himself into the realm 
of CD-ROMs, the compact discs that can project images, text and sound through 
the user's stereo and computer, and which have been touted as the future of 
information and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 For Morgan, they offer a perfect marriage of technology with the art of 
storytelling. He cited an example from a CD-ROM/laser-disc project called 
"Columbus: Encounter, Discovery and Beyond," which recounts Columbus' arrival 
in America from several perspectives. A window on Renaissance art draws fine 
parallels between Da Vinci's studies of perspective and the navigation advances 
that enabled Columbus to cross the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really exciting. It's like we really are in a new era," said 
Morgan, who clearly seems enthusiastic about what he does. "A lot of people are 
fearful of the Brave New World. This is actually a very inviting, human 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 But while his Burbank-based company, Mass Productions, grosses in the "low six 
figures," Morgan says overhead eats away at the money he would like to spend on 
a home. He and his wife, recently married with no children, are renting a house 
in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I'm doing well relative to what I've done in the past, I would 
say just in general, the whole American dream of buying a house and all that is 
almost impossible in Los Angeles," said Morgan, 41, the son of a highly 
successful, self-made businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I make fairly good money I still can't afford to buy a house in 
the part of L. A. I want to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally enthralled with his work, and not particularly concerned about 
financial security, is software engineer Moshe Kirsh, who believes his 
employer, Perceptronics of Woodland Hills, is on the cutting edge of its field. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contractor specializes in virtual reality-style simulations that 
have been used for weapons training and military exercises, or war games. Now 
it is planning to convert its technology to commercial uses and one of Kirsh's 
missions is to create a simulation framework applicable in a variety of 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can simulate any decision," said Kirsh, 34. "Like with medical decisions, 
you can simulate a surgery in advance," to see how it might turn out without 
jeopardizing a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 He is among a six software engineers -- the brains behind computer programs -- 
at his company, was culled from hundreds of applicants, and earns between 
$60,000 and $70,000 a year plus benefits. He, his software-designer wife, and 
their two young children live in Encino in a house they own. Kirsh, a native of 
Israel and a veteran of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, exudes confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a reflection of my optimism about Perceptronics and companies 
like it. I think we're in the right direction," said Kirsh, who joined the firm 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he is working on a way to expand existing simulations' networking 
capabilities -- such as enabling thousands of soldiers in different locations 
to participate in a simulated battle instead of 200, the current capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 His is a highly abstract world involving line after line of Roman numerals and 
Greek symbols, of knowing where he wants to go with his scribbles and then 
unraveling the mathematical obstacles along the way. Ideas often come to him as 
he commutes home and, unable to wait until morning, he'll log onto his PC and 
bounce them off similarly driven colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to wait until the next day or even Monday to find out if it 
works," Kirsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Far less absorbing but not unpleasant is the job of Hoang Vuong, who works for 
the Chatsworth-based Zinnanti Surgical, a maker of gynecological and 
obstetrical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong, 22, is paid roughly $7 an hour to assemble cervical dilators and 
endometrial tissue-samplers that are disposable. Sitting on a crate in 
Zinnanti's cavernous warehouse and assembly room, he prints numbers on the 
instruments' needle-like, plastic tubes, drills the holes needed to connect the 
various parts, then packages them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the job is dull, the atmosphere is relaxed, and while he works Vuong 
can chat with co-workers -- virtually all of them Southeast Asian or Central 
American immigrants in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 For Vuong, a native of Vietnam who grew up in Hawaii, it's a way to save money 
for Pierce College, where he hopes to enroll next year after he officially 
gains his California residency. He wants to study radiology technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong meets his expenses by sharing a rented Reseda house with four other 
Vietnamese immigrants -- his aunt, his friend, his friend's father, and another 
man. Four of the five house mates work at Zinnanti, so they all car-pool 
together in Vuong's aunt's car. He gives her $250 each month for room and board 
and still has money left over for coffeehouses and Arnold Schwarzenegger 
movies, his favorite pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to the mainland United States from Hawaii was a youthful adventure as 
much as anything else. "If you're Vietnamese and living in Hawaii's Vietnamese 
community, you know everybody," Vuong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dene Mathews says she is also content, despite the fact that she holds a 
degree in electrical engineering but is working primarily as a customer-service 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find an engineering job after she graduated two years ago from 
Howard University in Washington, D. C., Mathews settled for a foot in the door 
at Voice Powered Technology. The small, consumer-electronics firm in Canoga 
Park is known for voice-activated VCR programmers and a gadget called the 
Organizer, a pocket-sized, voice-programmed alarm that reminds users of 
personal tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 She is an administrative assistant and also handles what are euphemistically 
called "customer inquiries." Blunter colleagues say that means fielding calls 
from irate customers who can't figure out how to make their VCR programmers and 
Organizers work, even though they are designed for easy operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's her first job out of college and Mathews, 25 and newly wed to an 
aspiring minister, focuses on the positive. And she is not the most 
overqualified of her co-workers, who include a 60-year-old, unemployed 
aerospace engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting good experience dealing with customers," she said, briefly 
removing her headphones to talk. "It's challenging accommodating difficult 
personalities, whether it's in shipping-and-billing or about the device 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She makes between $18,000 and $20,000 a year plus benefits at the full-time 
position, commuting from her Hollywood apartment each day in the Volkswagen Bug 
she has owned since she learned to drive. Nonetheless, she said she has enjoyed 
more opportunities than her parents, two government workers, and is satisfied 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we're doing very well," she said of herself and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room of upholstered gray work stations sits the department's oldest 
customer-service rep, George Lee, an unemployed aerospace engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 60, used to make $100,000 a year as a consultant who specialized in 
making sure that rocket components worked. He has failed to find comparable 
work since his contracts dried up two years ago amid defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 So he became a customer-service rep at Voice Powered Technology, accepting a 
salary similar to Mathews' because of the medical benefits. "Until I'm 62 I 
can't draw Social Security, so I need the income," he said. "But my biggest 
problem is not only no income but a lack of health insurance. I couldn't afford 
the $8,000 a year it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he commutes from La Crescenta instead of working from his office at home. 
Many of the frustrated customers he helps haven't bothered to skim the users' 
guide or even watch an instructional videotape included for those unwilling to 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their attitude is, 'We bought the product so we won't have to,' " Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is people work more than anything else," he added. "But you need a good 
technical understanding of what happens so you can respond." 
</P>
<P>
 If Mathews and Lee have temporarily set aside technical training to deal with 
the public, then the nurses at HemaCare have gone the opposite route -- leaving 
behind the grueling job of healing the sick for the task of extracting blood 
platelets from healthy donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we kid our colleagues, 'Just remember not only the worst days at 
the hospital, but the best ones,' " said Mari Kurzhals, who screens the paid 
donors, hooks them up to computerized platelet-harvesters, and periodically 
checks for negative reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kurzhals, a former critical-care RN, between one-third and one-half of 
the blood bank's medical staff works part-time and receives no benefits. For 
now, that arrangement suits Kurzhals, 38, who has a 3-year-old son whom she and 
her husband, a police detective, prefer not to leave with a sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 She works one or two nights a week for $23 an hour, more to keep her hand in 
her profession than for the money. Sometimes she misses the satisfaction of 
comforting a patient but said she nonetheless enjoys friendly, even personal, 
conversations with HemaCare regulars, whose photos are posted on a bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," she said. "Maybe part of it is that I don't have to do it." The

TEST SUGGESTS HUBER BLOOD MATCH IN O.C.; INVESTIGATION: MORE DEFINITIVE DNA 
ANALYSES OF SAMPLES FROM THE LAGUNA HILLS SITE ARE NOW UNDERWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preliminary tests show that blood from a suspected murder site in Orange 
County could match samples taken from the victim, Denise Huber, and authorities 
said Monday that they have begun sophisticated DNA tests to establish more 
definitive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking the blood found in a Laguna Hills storage facility to Huber is crucial 
in determining whether the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman was killed there. A 
match would almost surely mean transfering the prosecution of suspect John J. 
Famalaro from Arizona to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's nude and handcuffed body was found two weeks ago in a freezer inside a 
stolen moving truck at Famalaro's home here. Since the grim discovery, 
authorities have been building a case against the former Orange County man and 
trying to decide where he will be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the evidence indicates that the truck came from California. The 
freezer was purchased in California and brought from California to Arizona," 
Yavapai County Atty. Thomas B. Lindberg said. "The freezer was kept plugged in 
while it was in the truck. Is that enough to push the case back to California? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. A blood match would make a stronger case for California 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
 An official familiar with the investigation said preliminary tests of the 
Orange County storage locker blood sample are "within a range" that is 
compatible with Huber's blood type. 
</P>
<P>
 More definitive testing, including DNA analysis, is expected to be completed 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the blood testing is being done in Orange County, where samples 
obtained from the storage facility are being compared with others taken from 
Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the blood from the storage facility be positively identified as 
Huber's, the findings would support the long-held theory of law enforcement 
officials that Huber most likely died shortly after her disappearance June 3, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro rented a storage locker in Laguna Hills, where authorities suspect 
Huber was bludgeoned to death, possibly with a crowbar. Famalaro apparently 
lived in the storage locker at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic technicians found the bloodstains in the storage facility last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense that she died (in Orange County), as much as I would like to 
have jurisdiction over there," said Denise Huber's father, Dennis. The Hubers 
believe that Famalaro is more likely to receive a death sentence in Arizona 
courts if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona and Orange County authorities were expected to meet today to further 
discuss jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Costa Mesa investigators were to return to 
Famalaro's home on the Prescott Country Club in Dewey to search for additional 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said jurisdiction might be 
decided "by the end of the week at the earliest." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lindberg and defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly have said a blood match 
would almost surely send the case to California for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Berra, spokeswoman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department, said 
local officials are unconcerned with where Famalaro should be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to see justice for the (Huber) family," Berra said. "I don't 
want to see Denise get lost in all of this. I don't want the victim to be 
forgotten, as happens so many times." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Yavapai County Superior Court Judge Raymond W. Weaver was advised 
by the defense that Dr. Heinz Karnitschnig will perform his medical examination 
of Huber's body today. The defense pathologist will require at least two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's parents have agreed to the arrangement, Lindberg told the court, 
because "they did not want to hinder any judicial process, harm any potential 
aspects of the case or prevent the judicial system from acting properly." The 
family is planning to bury Denise Huber's body next Tuesday in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is expected to be arraigned Monday, but Kelly said his client would 
not appear at the hearing "because I do not want to subject him to the stress 
of media coverage." Kelly will enter the plea. 
</P>
<P>
 The arraignment, however, could be moot if law enforcement officials determine 
through DNA testing that Huber's blood was splattered in the storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, by the end of the week we will know the whole genetic printing (of 
the blood samples)," said Yavapai Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, DNA testing is a lengthy and time-consuming process, however, Mascher 
said Orange County investigators are hustling the testing through their 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "DNA takes some time, but they want to put it out as quickly as they can," 
Mascher said. "We're not rushing things. There's still a lot things we have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher said he spent all of Monday itemizing evidence seized in three 
searches of Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've itemized evidence . . . what has to go to the lab for analysis and what 
has to be retained (at sheriff's headquarters)," Mascher said. "On this end, we 
have a lot of evidentiary items in the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher, the lead investigator in the case, said it did not matter to him 
where Famalaro is tried. If necessary, he said he could appear in a California 
courtroom to testify just as easily as in Yavapai County.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON TALKS TOUGH ON CRIME TO D.A.S; BROWN 
RAPS PAROLE POLICY; DEMOCRAT SAYS PAROLE VIOLATORS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY 
BECAUSE OF A RELAXATION OF REVOCATION STANDARDS. GOVERNOR AIDES SAY IT IS 
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PAROLEES IN THE SYSTEM.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson preached his tough-on-crime sermon to a largely faithful 
choir of prosecutors Monday while Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown hammered 
away at an apparent chink in his law enforcement shield -- the parole system. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Monday, the Wilson campaign announced that it would begin airing a new 
television commercial today "specifically refuting" Brown's allegations that 
dangerous parole violators continue to walk the streets because of a relaxation 
by the Wilson Administration of parole revocation policies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most of the newspaper articles quoted by the Wilson ad referred to 
just one case that was the subject of a Brown attack on Wilson last March. The 
Wilson ad goes on to attack Brown for her personal opposition to the death 
penalty without saying that she also has pledged to enforce it if elected 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, Wilson appeared officially as governor in addressing the 
California District Attorneys Assn. at a hotel ballroom in Newport Beach on the 
need to get tougher on "career criminals" to make California streets safe 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson announced that he will join law enforcement officials, crime victims 
and others in a rally on the state Capitol steps in Sacramento on Aug. 8, the 
day the Legislature returns from its summer recess. The idea is to put pressure 
on lawmakers to pass additional anti-crime legislation such as extending the 
death penalty to fatal drive-by shootings and carjacking slayings, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as a campaigner for reelection, Wilson went to a third-floor meeting 
room to receive the endorsement of 33 of the state's 58 criminal prosecutors, 
including association President Edward Hunt of Fresno County. Hunt called 
Wilson "a true friend to law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsements were made individually because the association does not 
support or oppose candidates as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, candidate Brown held a news conference in Downtown Los 
Angeles to assail Wilson's parole policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of a state building that houses offices of the state 
Department of Corrections, the state treasurer said that since Wilson became 
governor, the number of parolees "at large" in California has grown from about 
9,000 to about 14,000. So-called at-large parolees are former convicts who are 
violating parole by failing to maintain contact with their parole officers and 
are, Brown argued, "lost on the streets of California." 
</P>
<P>
 They are "lost," she said, because of Wilson's cuts in the parole division 
budget, resulting in a 60% increase in each parole officer's caseload. In Los 
Angeles County, Brown said, the budget cuts led to a reduction of 200 parole 
officers who had been tracking felons. 
</P>
<P>
 "No wonder Californians don't feel safer today than they did four years ago," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown added: "When I'm governor, I'm gonna trail 'em. We're gonna nail 'em, 
and then, we're gonna jail 'em. . . . We can't allow 14,000 dangerous fugitives 
to roam free in our neighborhoods, near our schools and in our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign aides did not dispute the 14,000 figure, other than to note 
that there are far more parolees in the system now than before he became 
governor: nearly 80,000 compared to 38,515 on average during the eight years 
Republican George Deukmejian was chief executive. This is largely the result of 
overall growth in the prison population. 
</P>
<P>
 On a percentage basis, the number of parolees at large has declined from an 
average annual figure of 14% of the total to 12.1%, the Wilson campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average sounds good, Brown responded, but she said a more telling 
statistic is the fact that the number of parolees at large jumped 56% from 1992 
to June, 1994, after the $32-million budget cut in the parole division. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had a different view in his speech to the district attorneys, telling 
them: "With your help, we've made great progress in Sacramento to make our 
state safer. We've won a lot of victories this past year." 
</P>
<P>
 They include passage of the "three strikes and you're out" law that mandates a 
life prison term for people convicted of three felonies, he said. Wilson said 
the law was part of his drive to make "career criminals career inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I fought for the toughest 'three strikes' law possible and signed 
it into law in March," Wilson said. "I know that you and I are agreed on the 
fact that career criminals should be put away for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the district attorneys organization did not support the same "three 
strikes" bill backed by Wilson, but favored another measure that would have 
limited the automatic life terms to cases involving violent or serious 
felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson television commercial going on the air today says that a recent 
Brown ad "reaches a new low, with the press calling it 'misleading' and 'a bum 
rap.' " Those words were used by the Sacramento Bee and the San Jose Mercury 
News in editorials defending Wilson's parole program. 
</P>
<P>
 The full quote from the San Jose editorial: "It's a bum rap, although Wilson 
doesn't deserve much sympathy. He's fanned the hysteria about getting tough on 
crime as much as any elected leader." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson ad continues with a quote that seemingly has nothing to do with the 
crime issue: "Brown cynically once said: 'Running for office in California is 
like designer jeans -- just find the style with media appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Her quote came from a 1985 Los Angeles Times Magazine article headlined 
"Letters Home" and consisting of comments from former Los Angeles residents 
then living in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Brown's letter said: "Moving here was an opportunity for me to take my 
life in a new direction. Had I stayed in Los Angeles, I probably would have 
left the school board and sought higher public office. Running for office in 
California is like designer jeans -- just find a style that has media appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, said: "That quote underscores the 
cynicism with which Kathleen Brown is running her campaign by running away from 
her positions on the issues."

FOR THE LAND'S SAKE; RANCHER IS AT FOREFRONT OF MOVEMENT KNOWN AS HOLISTIC 
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 On the surface, there is nothing out of the ordinary about George Work's 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawled along the hills of the southern tip of Monterey County, at the end of 
an old oil road, the 12,000-acre property could be any of the cattle-grazing, 
oak tree-growing, grain-producing lands common to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, that is, for the corral made of truck tires, or the barn wall 
constructed of bales of straw and adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the wild pigs that, by rooting up the less desirable annual grasses, help 
the oaks and other native plants flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the cattle that trample the dead grass back into the 
ground, thereby helping to rejuvenate the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the characteristics of Holistic Resource Management (HRM), a 
philosophy of environmentally minded land management that is slowly gaining 
adherents here and in other states. Work and his ranch are at the forefront of 
this quiet movement in California. 
</P>
<P>
 HRM was developed about 30 years ago by wildlife biologist Allan Savory of 
Zimbabwe as a way to halt the degradation of the range caused by traditional 
ranching and agricultural methods. Practitioners aim to restore the balance of 
nature, revitalize soils and grasses, and strengthen communities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach, Work said, results in "more ecologically sound, economically 
viable and socially just" decision-making than traditional ranching methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Butterfield, Savory's wife, estimates that about 600 Californians have 
had some HRM training through Savory's 10-year-old Center for Holistic 
Management in Albuquerque, N.M. In all, about 7,000 people from all 50 states 
and 28 countries have gone through the center's training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 HRM is taking some time to catch on in large numbers. And Work is hardly 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that we have a nucleus here attempting to practice it. But it's kind 
of slow," he said. ". . . The ranching community here is overloaded. We can't 
deal with all the regulations, let alone a change in our management program. 
Most people are afraid to change, because they can't take the risk. They've 
taken a lot of risks and they are afraid this is the one that will break the 
camel's back." 
</P>
<P>
 A third-generation rancher, Work, 57, planted his first crop in 1959. He said 
his recent land-use decisions have little in common with those made before his 
exposure to HRM nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do now is, before we say, 'Chop five acres of trees down,' there are 
five or six guidelines we have to follow," he said, such as "how is it going to 
affect the ecosystem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Work was introduced to HRM when a friend told him of a talk Savory was giving 
up in Redding. "He had attended Savory's school and was very excited about this 
new concept," said Work. "I had a lot of respect for this person -- he was a 
very progressive rancher -- and I thought I may as well go see what it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Work was impressed with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Savory said if you don't manage your finances, along with your family, along 
with the environment, you're going down the tubes," said Work. "It was common 
sense. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Work soon attended a full workshop at Savory's New Mexico center, and has been 
immersed in HRM practices since. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we practice HRM as it is intended to be practiced, we can grow the 
perennial grasses to feed the cows, and improve the water use and the soil, 
have oak trees -- and make more profit to stay in business," Work said. "When 
it all begins to work, one doesn't have to suffer because of the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Kupper, executive director of the Environmental Center of San Luis 
Obispo, likes what he sees in HRM, but wonders if it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the HRM philosophy calls for topsoil to be left untilled. Tilling, say 
HRM practitioners, kills off organisms and increases the chance of soil 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartening that (HRM) is catching on," Kupper said. "But I don't know if 
we have time for it to catch on. We've lost half of all the topsoil in the 
world over the last 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Work said HRM gives him hope for the future of agriculture, and he is 
trying to share that with others. In May, he led a workshop at his ranch for 
about 120 ranchers, environmentalists, conservationists and others interested 
in HRM. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who attended was Jack Varian, owner of a 20,000-acre ranch in 
Parkfield, 10 miles north of Work's spread. Varian's particular interest lies 
in the HRM rotational cattle-grazing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a rancher 35 years on my own and I've just recently begun to 
understand grazing," said Varian, who considers Work an HRM guru of sorts. 
"Previously, I had done it like everybody else. I purposely spread the cattle 
out" throughout the fields. What resulted, he said, was a decline in the highly 
nutritional "good" grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cows are like people. They are gourmets. They like to eat the best and leave 
the worst," Varian said. "They will selectively graze the best and keep going 
back and back and back." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Varian rotates the cattle in and out of grazing areas. After the cattle 
have eaten the better grasses, they are moved to another area, allowing the 
grasses to grow back. It costs more, Varian said, because he has had to set up 
more water wells and storage tanks, and provide larger supplies of water. But 
he has come up with ways to offset the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year for the first time I've opened the ranch to the public for a fee," 
he said, explaining how he leads cattle drives for city slickers. "It's 
necessary for us to survive. HRM makes you ask questions of yourself. If I'm 
going to stay on this land and make a living, what am I going to have to do 
here?"

2 FIRMS URGE STATE TO CANCEL LOTTERY PACT; FINANCES: BOTH CITE AUDITOR'S 
FINDING THAT THE AGENCY STIFLED COMPETITION FOR THE $600-MILLION COMPUTER 
CONTRACT. OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL NOT BREACH THE AGREEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 One week after an auditor's report found that the lottery stifled competition 
for a $600-million computer contract, two Georgia companies formally demanded 
Monday that the state cancel its contract with the winning bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Automated Wagering International argued that the lottery's contract with GTECH 
Corp. of Rhode Island to install and run a central computer system to take bets 
was invalid, contending that the transaction last year violated California law 
by squeezing out competing bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the state auditor's finding . . . the existing (computer) contract 
is void and payments made under it illegal," Automated Wagering attorney 
Richard Martland wrote acting lottery Director Del Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Stefanis, chairman and chief executive officer of High Integrity 
Systems made a similar demand in a statement, saying that the lack of 
competition had "prevented the state of California from assuring that it 
received the best system at the best price." 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the two companies were using faulty logic, the lottery's chief 
counsel, Catherine Van Aken, said the audit report had no legal standing and 
the appropriate way for competitors to have challenged the contract would have 
been through a lawsuit filed at the time the contract was awarded to GTECH. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking for the lottery to rebid and basically breach the contract 
with GTECH, which is now in its second year, and we're not going to do that," 
she said. "If they are so concerned about this, why didn't they go to court 
back in April, 1993, (when the contract was awarded)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martland said he believed that the auditor's findings were such that the 
lottery had an obligation to "rectify the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the state auditor determines that there are fatal flaws in the bidding 
process, it's certainly incumbent upon the agency to address the issue," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg found that the lottery had effectively eliminated 
competition for one of the biggest contracts in state history by writing bid 
specifications that were so restrictive that only one company could meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said then-lottery Director Sharon Sharp had discouraged prospective bidders 
from competing for the contract by setting an extremely short deadline for 
delivering a highly complex new computer system. He said the incumbent 
contractor, GTECH, was the only company that could realistically be expected to 
meet the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Automated Wagering and High Integrity Systems said they had 
intended to bid for the contract to operate the state's computerized games -- 
Super Lotto, Decco, Daily 3, Fantasy Five and Keno -- but decided to drop out 
of the competition when Sharp refused to change a 175-day deadline for 
delivering the system. As a result, GTECH was the only company that submitted a 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor did not recommend that the lottery take any specific action on the 
contract as a result of his findings and neither Automated Wagering nor High 
Integrity Systems is expected to take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 GTECH spokesman Robert J. Rendine called the demands by his company's two 
competitors "a by-the-numbers publicity stunt . . . (that) really doesn't merit 
any kind of response." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the expected response for a bidder who had a chance to bid and chose 
not to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that there were no legal grounds for canceling the contract and 
charged that the two companies were simply trying to take advantage of an 
election year to put pressure on the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson had asked for the audit last year, after Sharp resigned amid 
criticism from lawmakers and GTECH's competitors that she had favored GTECH in 
the bidding process.

 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the Security Council should 
consider withdrawing U.N. forces in the Balkans whether or not a peace 
agreement is signed. In a letter to the council, he said there are not enough 
U.N. forces to keep peace in the former Yugoslav federation. Boutros-Ghali did 
not say when the United Nations should pull out the 36,000 troops, police and 
observers from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Macedonia.

DEATH TOLL IN ARGENTINE BLAST RISES TO 96; BOMBING: RESCUERS GIVE UP HOPE OF 
FINDING SURVIVORS. JEWISH LEADERS INTENSIFY DEMANDS FOR A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after a powerful bomb ripped through the center of the largest Jewish 
community in Latin America, rescuers Monday gave up hope of finding more 
survivors as the official death toll climbed to 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine and Israeli military personnel recovered 27 bodies and said 11 of 
the dead remained in the rubble after the devastating blast that some officials 
blame on Islamic extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 18 explosion flattened a seven-story building that housed Jewish 
community services and 100-year-old archives. The incident is being described 
by some as the deadliest attack on Jews outside Israel since the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-known Islamic group calling itself Ansarollah, or Partisans of God, 
has claimed responsibility for the bombing and the crash a day later of an 
airplane in Panama, in which most of the 21 people killed were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 The authenticity of the claim has not been verified, but the 1992 bombing of 
the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was attributed to Hezbollah, the 
Lebanon-based umbrella organization for Islamic radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to overcome the staggering trauma to their community, Jewish 
leaders here are becoming increasingly vocal in demanding that authorities 
exhaust all possibilities to investigate the blast and prevent future acts of 
terrorism. The 1992 bombing was never solved, and security in this country is 
woefully lax. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Jewish people who are truly terrified," said Ramon Beraja, 
president of the Delegation of Argentine-Israelite Assns., whose office was 
destroyed in the blast. Security precautions "have not been sufficient because 
it never entered the Argentine mind that an Argentine target could be attacked 
this way, with such ferocity." 
</P>
<P>
 Jews began migrating to Argentina in the last half of the 19th Century, and 
the community today numbers between 250,000 and 300,000, second only to the 
United States in this hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine and Israeli authorities said Monday there is mounting evidence that 
the blast was caused by a car bomb, possibly a van packed with explosives that 
was driven to the front doors of the crowded building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the motor of a truck in the crater" carved out by the explosion, 
said Meir Livne, an Israeli army general who traveled to Argentina to direct 
rescue operations by Israeli troops. He spoke through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign the investigation will widen, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella said Monday the government has ordered its ambassador in 
Lebanon to report home for consultations. The government also has asked for 
information from Iran regarding terrorist activities of Iranian nationals in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Jose Galeano, the judge in charge of investigating the case, traveled 
secretly to Venezuela over the weekend, reportedly to interview Iranian 
refugees who may have information on the Buenos Aires bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venezuelan government expelled four Iranian diplomats and declared the 
Iranian ambassador persona non grata on Thursday after the refugees were 
allegedly kidnaped and tortured by diplomatic personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentines of all faiths were shocked and unnerved by last week's attack. 
Newspaper headlines warn of the "The Lebanon-ization of Argentina" while 
television programs are giving uninterrupted coverage to recovery operations, 
with psychologists offering advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of bomb threats have been reported since the explosion, including one 
Monday that forced the evacuation of Congress. The Hebraic-Argentine Society 
said it is closing temporarily because of the number of threats it has 
received. Police with metal detectors were posted at Jewish schools Monday, the 
first day back to school for children following the Southern Hemisphere's 
winter vacation.

S. KOREA PUNISHES PUBLISHER FOR ATTENDING KIM FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To punish him for visiting Pyongyang to express condolences on the death of 
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, the South Korean government Monday revoked the 
license of Bo Hi Pak to serve as publisher of the Seoul-based Segye Times 
newspaper and six magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time a South Korean government has ordered a publisher ousted 
for political reasons since former President Roh Tae Woo pledged to end 
authoritarian rule in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors earlier said they would charge Pak with violating South Korea's 
National Security Law for expressing condolences and for attending Kim's 
funeral last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pak, who also serves as chairman of the Washington Times Co. and is a leading 
figure in the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, left Beijing on Sunday 
to fly to the United States after visiting North Korea for 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Unification Church-owned publications fail to replace Pak, each could 
be suspended from publishing for three months, a spokesman for the Information 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Segye Times reported earlier that Pak had gone to Pyongyang for an 
exclusive interview with Kim Jong Il, 52, son of the late dictator and North 
Korea's new leader. Pak met Kim on Wednesday but so far has written no story 
for the Segye Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A Segye Times editor said in a telephone interview that "we editors cannot 
comment. The board of directors will have to decide what to do." The editor 
also refused to say if Pak eventually would return to Seoul, from where he 
departed to visit North Korea via Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean prosecutors cited North Korean television footage that showed Pak 
bowing in front of Kim Il Sung's casket to prove Pak paid homage to the North 
Korean leader who launched the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Korean Central News Agency reported that Pak paid respects to Kim's 
coffin, presented a wreath, attended the funeral and a memorial ceremony and 
expressed condolences to Kim Jong Il. It quoted Pak as insisting that his visit 
was "completely humanitarian -- not political." 
</P>
<P>
 The Information Ministry said Pak's unauthorized trip to the North led them to 
reinspect documents that the Segye Times had submitted for a license to publish 
and ruled that Pak's South Korean residence registration was no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Korean law, publishers must be Korean citizens residing in the country. 
Although Pak's residence in the United States was widely known at application 
time, ministry officials did not question the documents originally, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the government is punishing dissidents and student activists who 
expressed condolences over Kim Il Sung's death, certainly, Pak cannot be an 
exception," said Park Bom Jin, spokesman of the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party.

SOCIAL ISSUES; MIAMI NAILING TOGETHER AMBITIOUS HOMELESS PLAN; WITH THOUSANDS

 In Bobby Bradley's neighborhood, a booming shantytown of plywood and plastic 
that has popped up under a downtown freeway, the visit by a top government 
official with a $15-million grant to support a model homeless initiative went 
pretty much unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen million?" repeated Bradley a few days and just two blocks away from 
the courthouse steps where Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros last week addressed business and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about that. I do know that I'm getting tired of being here. But 
I guess it's OK for now." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bradley, a 35-year-old former truck driver who said his problems with 
alcohol put him on the street six years ago, plans are hard to hold on to and 
the future looks fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts say that there are between 6,000 and 10,000 chronically homeless 
people in the Greater Miami area, including people displaced by 1992's 
Hurricane Andrew in the Homestead area and the hard-core drug abusers and 
mentally ill who roam the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's where Cisneros, the $15 million and an ambitious plan come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Miami officials approved construction of the first of 
three 350-bed homeless shelters, to be funded in part by a one-cent restaurant 
tax that is expected to produce $20 million for homeless programs over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the nonprofit Community Partnership for Homeless is more than 
halfway toward its goal of raising $8.5 million in private funds for related 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dade County (Miami) is one of four U.S. communities to be awarded an 
"innovative cities" federal grant, which must be matched by local funds and 
will be doled out only as performance goals are met. The other cities are Los 
Angeles, Denver and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But only Miami has a dedicated meals tax to pay for homeless programs. "I 
don't know of any other city in the country that has shown the kind of 
initiative that Miami and Dade County have shown," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Menendez Jr., director of homeless programs for Dade County, said that 
the first new shelter -- along with residential drug treatment and mental 
health counseling programs -- could be in place by December. But he also knows 
that bureaucratic delays are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see people in crisis out there in those encampments, and we want to move 
them, but there are just not enough beds," he said. "It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Greater Miami's homeless encampments are caldrons of crisis, unplanned 
communities of dashed hopes and volatility. In the last few months, the 
shantytown under Interstate 95 has taken over three city parking lots. And 
while some of the makeshift dwellings show touches of engineering genius, there 
is little sense of permanence here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous," said Bradley, who lives in a small hut furnished with a cot 
and a candle. "Things don't settle down till 3, 4 in the morning. But it's hard 
to sleep any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, Roberta Brown and fellow parishioners from New Way Baptist 
Church show up with day-old pastries and rolls donated by a grocery chain. 
"Some of these people would like to work, but some just can't do any better," 
Brown says. "They have drug problems, and when you get so far down, it's hard 
to get back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's infamous Mud Flats, a squalid homeless encampment under a freeway a 
few blocks away, has been cleaned out, and that area fenced off. But an 
estimated 300 to 400 people now live in the parking lot shantytown, while 
hundreds more spend their days in nightmarish conditions in Overtown, on Watson 
Island next to Biscayne Bay and under overpasses and in vacant lots all over 
the county. Health problems are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a marked increase in HIV and tuberculosis," says Dr. Pedro Jose 
Greer Jr., a nationally known gastroenterologist who in 1993 won a MacArthur 
Fellowship grant for his work as a street doctor to Miami's homeless. "And in 
the clinic, we're just seeing more people: 30,000 office visits through June, 
which is as many as we saw all of last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Gonzalez, director of the Homeless Trust, says that with money, 
housing, treatment programs and community involvement, Miami has a chance to 
become the model for other cities faced with daunting problems caring for the 
homeless. "I don't think we'll ever eradicate homelessness altogether," 
Gonzalez said. "But if we can provide alternatives and treatment for those who 
want them, we don't have to have these encampments."

PUBLIC SAFETY; U.S. PANEL'S MOVE TO UPGRADE A-PLANT SECURITY DRAWS FIRE 
</P>

 Two hundred feet farther and Pennsylvania might still be glowing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant last year, a discharged mental 
patient barreled his station wagon into a turbine building, stopping just 200 
feet short of ramming a vital area of the facility and possibly triggering a 
deadly release of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was so light that he was able to race past a guard post, break 
through a chain-link fence and crash through the building's steel door. He 
drove 60 feet into the building, got out of his car and evaded guards at the 
plant near Harrisburg, Pa., for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, security forces at most nuclear weapons factories are equipped 
with SWAT teams, helicopters and enough military hardware to stop a tank, not 
to mention a station wagon. After resisting 10 years of lobbying efforts by 
safety groups, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is starting to notice the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with anticipating terrorist threats to the nation's high-energy 
nuclear facilities, the commission last month adopted a policy that would 
require most power plants to stiffen protections against truck bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the World Trade Center bombing last year, an army of safety groups has 
intensified efforts to persuade the commission to issue more stringent rules 
demanding that plant owners build stronger fences or beef up security forces. 
Recent U.S.-North Korean tensions also have spotlighted the apparent weakness 
of reactor security, because most South Korean power plants are U.S.-designed. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the commission stood poised to announce the new policy, many plant 
owners sought to loosen the proposed requirements, hoping to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety advocates say no amount of penny-pinching would offset the huge 
monetary and human costs of nuclear sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see nuclear power plants better protected," said Paul Leventhal, 
president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit group that has sought 
tougher security for reactors since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Some terrorism experts say bombers are more likely to strike at power plants 
because they are "soft targets." Commission rules say plants should be ready 
for attacks by small bands of well-armed soldiers. Nonetheless, they allow the 
facilities to keep only five-member security forces on a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy, which is classified, requires reactor operators to prepare for 
an attack by armed terrorists who might use a truck to break through outer 
defenses or detonate a bomb outside the plant's perimeter. But the new rules 
are less stringent than safety advocates had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Fences built under the commission's existing specifications are so weak that 
they can only detect breaches, not block would-be intruders, said Bruce 
Hoffman, a nuclear terrorism specialist at the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some plant operators wonder whether the new policy is needed. Phillip 
Clark, president of GPU Nuclear Corp., which runs the Three Mile Island 
facility, said that "the radioactive safety of the public does not require a 
new rule and increased security." 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrades in plant security should be left to reactor operators, said Clark, 
who erected stronger fences at the Three Mile Island site after the intruder 
crashed through the barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts accuse the reactor operators of caring more for their wallets than 
for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Three Mile Island incident alone suggests that instead of bean-counting 
up and down over the cost of a fence, they should be thinking in terms of 
deterring the next adversary," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next adversary may not even attack on U.S. soil. Intelligence experts are 
concerned about the vulnerability of civil research centers and nuclear 
reactors in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- from which terrorists 
could extract plutonium and weapons-grade fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI terrorism experts say the threat of nuclear sabotage at U.S. plants is 
very low. "We are talking about a minuscule threat," Hoffman acknowledged. "But 
in the nuclear domain, one is one too many."

MOVING TOWARD PEACE; ISRAELI ARABS, JEWS CALMLY GREET PACT; NEGOTIATIONS: 
BREAKTHROUGH WELCOMED WITH NEITHER THE EXULTATION NOR CONFLICTING EMOTIONS OF 
PREVIOUS DEALS.

 In Mahane Yehuda, this city's open-air market, David Shweka and Adel 
Awadtallah agreed on one thing Monday as they watched Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin and King Hussein shake hands at the White House -- they are ready for 
Israel and Jordan to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is peace, and they open the border, I am going to visit 
immediately," said Awadtallah, 24, an Israeli Arab living in mostly Arab East 
Jerusalem and working in a West Jerusalem restaurant. "It must be a real peace; 
we need a real peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Shweka, 44, an Israeli army veteran who owns the electrical shop where the two 
watched the White House ceremonies, observed: "There has been a quiet peace 
between Israel and Jordan for years already. But this is good. When there is 
formal peace, for sure I will drive to Amman to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis, usually divided on almost every issue, found themselves unusually 
unanimous in welcoming the breakthrough between Israel and Jordan that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said could yield a formal peace 
treaty within months. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the political spectrum, Hussein's first public get-together with Rabin 
was welcomed for bringing into the open relations that have long been conducted 
in secret between the two nations, nominal enemies for 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was none of the sense of exultation that gripped the nation when 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat flew here in 1977 to offer peace. Neither was 
there the powerful conflict of emotions Israelis experienced as they watched 
Rabin shake hands on the White House lawn in September with Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman who has been reviled here for 
decades as a bloodthirsty terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, in the Gulf of Aqaba -- split down the middle between Israel and 
Jordan -- 17 yachts and other sailboats staged a peace sail from the Israeli 
port of Eilat. Some of the Israeli boats even sailed past the mid-water 
demarcation line into Jordanian waters before turning back. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israelis, the open meeting between Hussein and Rabin in Washington was 
another milestone on Israel's road to acceptance by its neighbors, a move met 
largely with expressions of satisfaction and of restrained respect for Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot forget Hussein's last mistake, siding with Iraq in the Gulf War," 
Shweka said. "But still, there is something to be said for someone who has 
survived in power for more than 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have shown broad support for peace with Jordan, although Israelis have 
expressed reservations about making territorial concessions to Jordan or 
sharing water with it. Jordanians claim more than 140 square miles of desert in 
the Jordan Valley and say Israel must allow them a larger share of waters from 
the Yarmuk and Jordan rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poll published Friday by the respected Dahaf organization, 52% of 
Israelis said they favor making territorial concessions to Jordan; 43% said 
they opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the opposition Likud bloc, which vehemently opposed the government 
agreement with the PLO on limited self-rule for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank town of Jericho, endorsed the talks with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the ruling Labor Party acknowledge that the White House 
ceremonies were probably the most popular move this center-left government has 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, people told Labor: You can't make peace, only the Likud can," said 
Avraham Burg, a Labor Party Parliament member. "We love this. The situation now 
looks wonderful. The Syrians are around the corner, the Palestinians are in the 
pocket and now the Jordanians are out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 Boaz Tzidkiyahu, 33, a pickle salesman at Jerusalem's central market, said 
Israel's agreement with the PLO worries him deeply. But peace with Jordan is a 
different matter, the Likud supporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This meeting between Hussein and Rabin is less exciting than the whole peace 
process and less frightening," Tzidkiyahu said. "I think that it will succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Uzi Narkiss, Hussein and Rabin's handshake was particularly sweet. 
Narkiss, 69, led Israel's army to capture East Jerusalem from the Jordanian 
army in the June, 1967, Middle East War. He has waited ever since for Jordan 
and Israel to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought against the Arab Legion in 1948 and the Jordanian Army in 1967," he 
said in an interview Monday in his Jerusalem apartment. "The Jordanians, in my 
opinion, were the best army in the Middle East. The fact that now they are 
signing an agreement with Israel means a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, Narkiss commanded Israeli forces at Gush Etzion that fell to what was 
then the Arab Legion -- Jordan's British-led army. He speaks respectfully of 
the discipline Jordanian soldiers showed as they overran the Israelis' last 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "An agreement with Jordan is much more reliable than an agreement with the 
Palestinians," he said. "The Jordanians are an establishment, and the 
Palestinians are not. You can count on the Jordanians, that they will keep 
their promise."

MOVING TOWARD PEACE; POTHOLES MARK ROAD TO MADRID II; DIPLOMACY: GOAL OF ENDING 
ALL CONFLICTS, AS 1991 SUMMIT ENVISIONED, IS STILL DAUNTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands 
for peace on the White House lawn Monday, American officials already were 
dreaming of a summit of all leaders of the volatile Middle East to end decades 
of war among nations, generations of tensions among peoples and millennia of 
conflict among religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The site: Madrid, where the peace process opened in 1991 and where American 
officials now hope it will formally close. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was launched in Madrid. This may well be the place to have everyone come 
back at the end for closure, for sanctification and for talks about what the 
future represents," said a senior Administration official deeply involved in 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road to Madrid II is full of potholes. The stunning breakthroughs over 
the last year -- beginning with the Palestinian-Israeli declaration in 
September -- look easy in contrast to what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The next six to 12 months will be the most critical in what is likely to be a 
process of three to five years, American, Israeli and Arab officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The best and worst cases are already visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everything goes according to schedule over the next year, then you'll see 
expanded autonomy for the Palestinians in the West Bank, a peace treaty with 
Jordan and a breakthrough with Syria" that includes senior officials talking to 
each other about terms for full peace, said Ehud Sprinzak, a political 
scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst case," Sprinzak added, "would be lots of distractions, violence and 
assassinations. The Palestinians could be in trouble because they don't have a 
good administration or enough money to make (autonomy in the) Gaza (Strip) and 
Jericho work. Israeli settlers could become more militant. The Syrian track 
could stall. And fighting along the Lebanon border could get hotter." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall goal is maintaining momentum as the various efforts by Israel and 
its immediate neighbors are woven together into a complete tapestry that will 
not easily unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace that is not comprehensive will be vulnerable to all sorts of disruptive 
forces," said Yair Hirschfeld, a Haifa University political scientist who was 
pivotal last year in establishing secret Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo. "In 
a way, it would be a dangerous peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, both the United States and Israel face elections in 1996. As the 
election draws closer, Rabin particularly will lose his ability to maneuver on 
an already controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The next steps toward peace fall into five categories. 
</P>
<P>
 JORDAN: After the signing here Monday, prospects for a full-fledged peace 
treaty with this nation appear the most promising. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the signing, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres predicted in identical language that a treaty is 
"a matter of months." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials expect Monday's nonbelligerency treaty to result in greater 
contact between Israelis and Jordanians: tourists mixing in the resort cities 
of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the Jordanian and Israeli foreign ministers met at the Dead Sea 
last week, an Israeli company was advertising tours of Jordan in the Jerusalem 
Post. Most cross-border travel is initially expected to be by Israelis, the 
senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 PALESTINIANS: Despite the famous handshake 10 months ago between Rabin and 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, the Israelis and 
Palestinians must still work out daunting issues. Among them: terms for 
expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank; redeploying Israeli forces 
from Arab towns and Jewish settlements, and determining the timing and terms of 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "In less than a year, we went from almost zero contacts to . . . negotiations 
that are continual. . . ," said Nabil Shaath, chief negotiator and planning 
minister of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this track also holds the potential for slowing the peace process. Azmi 
Shuaibi, Palestinian minister of youth and sport, said Monday that Palestinian 
elections, originally expected in October, now seem unlikely this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential is also growing for an Israeli backlash against Palestinian 
autonomy, particularly in places such as the West Bank town of Hebron, also 
home to the most militant Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 SYRIA: This remains the biggest prize but also the biggest problem in the 
peace process and the most controversial step for Israel. All issues -- notably 
how much peace for how much land and over what timetable -- remain unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 The most optimistic American scenario envisions Christopher's shuttle 
diplomacy resulting in a breakthrough with Syria over the next six months, with 
a peace treaty sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Israeli support for returning the Golan Heights, which Israel captured 
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War, does not exceed 5%, according to a 
recent survey. Support for limited or partial withdrawal has risen from 35% to 
45% in the past year, but the only deal Syrian President Hafez Assad says he 
will accept is total withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 After using the need to confront Israel as justification for his rule, Assad 
must also transform public opinion to accept full relations with the Jewish 
state.

 LEBANON: Peace efforts have become largely a function of progress with Syria, 
which has a 35,000-man garrison in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Lebanon is Israel's most volatile neighbor, Israel wants a treaty that 
includes an end to attacks by Hezbollah and other extremist groups -- six 
months after which it will withdraw from the southern Lebanese enclave it has 
dominated since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragile state of Lebanon's government will make enforcement of any 
agreement difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHERS: Over the past three months, Israel and most other Arab states have 
made substantive progress. Negotiators are now developing projects to address 
threats to peace: regional arms proliferation, radical groups, population 
growth and socioeconomic instability. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are also optimistic because the five-part process has an 
indirect but critical component: an infrastructure for peace.

CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN CHIAPAS INJURED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The top opposition candidate for Chiapas governor was critically injured in a 
mysterious highway collision Monday, stoking political tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Amado Avendano Figueroa, a 60-year-old lawyer who has represented Indian 
peasants in land disputes, was injured and three others were killed when a 
truck struck their campaign car in a remote area of the state, police 
said.Avendano was reported in critical but stable condition. The candidate's 
son was also injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office said the crash occurred after the truck, 
which was traveling too fast, moved onto the wrong side of the highway. The 
truck had no license plate and was not carrying cargo. Its driver fled after 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano is a co-owner of the San Cristobal newspaper Tiempo, and he won 
international attention for obtaining the first interview with the masked 
guerrilla leader Subcommander Marcos, who led a Jan. 1 rebellion in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate of the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party, Avendano was 
waging a feisty campaign against Eduardo Robledo Rincon, 47, of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, a federal senator considered the favorite to 
win the Aug. 21 gubernatorial election.

U.N. TO BURN BODIES AS CHOLERA SPREADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The still-worsening cholera epidemic that has ravaged Rwandan refugees here 
has killed up to 14,000 people in less than a week, officials said Monday, and 
mass graves are now so full that the United Nations plans to start burning the 
bodies this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees, said that long burial trenches dug by French army troops are 
virtually full. He said the Zairian government has given approval for 
incineration of the hundreds of corpses of men, women and children that appear 
by the roads and in the refugee camps each day. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the French -- who buried about 2,000 bodies on Monday alone -- have 
agreed to provide fuel to burn the dead, but no agency or government had yet 
agreed to take on the grisly job. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, six relatively small mass graves will be dug in a Zairian national 
park near the Kabumba refugee camp, where hundreds of uncollected corpses 
surround a field hospital and have been stacked on a small hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Burying the highly contagious corpses has been a major problem for relief 
agencies struggling to cope with the demands of an estimated 1.2 million 
refugees who began flooding across the border nearly two weeks ago. The ground 
is mostly solid, volcanic rock that is impossible to dig by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Georges D'Alemagne of Doctors Without Borders told reporters that the 
6-day-old epidemic "is still worsening," and each day brings more deaths than 
the day before. He said about 80,000 to 100,000 refugees are now expected to 
contract the bacterial disease; up to half may die. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that doctors now fear the deadly epidemic of Ogawa cholera, the most 
common strain of the disease, may spread into eastern Zaire, putting about 6 
million people at risk. "This is a cholera-endemic area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabelle Pardieu, another physician with Doctors Without Borders, said the 
"relative death toll" had fallen from 50% to 21% over the last three days. In 
other words, although far more people have now been stricken by the disease, a 
greater percentage are surviving as more medical aid and clean water supplies 
reach the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 30 humanitarian flights arrived at Goma on Monday, including two U.S. 
Air Force C-141s carrying 42 tons of oral rehydration salts for cholera 
victims. Another U.S. relief flight, carrying two water purification units, was 
postponed until today because of mechanical problems. Each unit can provide 600 
gallons of clean water an hour, said Maj. Guy Shields, U.S. military spokesman 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aid that arrived Monday included eight planes from Israel carrying a 
120-bed emergency hospital and operating theater.

EXTRADITION COULD TAKE MONTHS; LAW: TO HAVE JOHN J. FAMALARO STAND TRIAL IN 
ORANGE COUNTY, PROSECUTORS MUST FOLLOW A SERIES OF LEGAL PROCEDURES THAT WOULD 
BE DELAYED IF HE OBJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Blood tests may settle a debate over jurisdiction by week's end, but officials 
said Monday that it could take months to extradite John J. Famalaro if he is to 
stand trial in Orange County in the killing of Denise Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly has said he believes it would be 
"advantageous" for his client to be tried in California, where he said 
prosecutors would have a tougher time seeking the death penalty against 
Famalaro. But the attorney has declined to say whether he would waive or fight 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Famalaro) doesn't waive extradition, then we will need a governor's 
warrant from California to send him back to Orange County," said Yavapai County 
Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Laurie Berra. "That's normally a 90-day 
process. If he waives extradition, we'll just give him to the Costa Mesa 
detectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials and Costa Mesa police would be in charge of arranging 
transportation for Famalaro, who would likely be handcuffed or shackled during 
the trip back by air or car. 
</P>
<P>
 Berra said Yavapai County uses a small, propeller-driven plane to transport 
prisoners and said it could be made available to Orange County officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Orange County district attorney's office are expected here 
today to discuss the jurisdictional question with Yavapai County authorities. 
Berra said she expected the issue to be settled by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County authorities were to seek Famalaro's extradition, they would 
file a criminal complaint in Orange County Municipal Court and ask a judge to 
issue an arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities would then be notified of the warrant and would place a 
"hold" on Famalaro that would prevent him from being released, Orange County 
Assistant Dist. Atty. John L. Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Famalaro would be brought into court in Arizona and asked whether he 
wanted to waive or fight the extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 If he chose to fight it, Orange County prosecutors would have to bring the 
complaint to Gov. Pete Wilson, who would then forward an extradition complaint 
to Arizona Gov. Fife Symington. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro would then be arraigned in Arizona on a "governor's warrant." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing would be held before an Arizona judge on the merits of the 
extradition request. Legal authorities said there are only a few grounds, such 
as mistaken identity, on which a judge could deny extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge approves the extradition request, Famalaro would be transferred 
to Orange County, where he would be arraigned in municipal court on a murder 
charge. "It starts as if it were Day One and he was just arrested," Conley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Either a preliminary hearing or grand jury indictment would have to occur 
before Famalaro could be bound over to superior court to face trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practically speaking, it's very rare that we have a problem with 
extradition," Conley said. He added that a person who fights extradition is 
generally "putting off the inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Most states routinely abide by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, but in 
rare instances a state refuses to comply, said Jack Luellen, adjunct professor 
of law at Western State University College of Law in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, for example, has been embroiled in controversy in instances where it 
has refused to extradite an individual who faces the death penalty in another 
state. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is a staunch death penalty foe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it depends on the parties involved," Luellen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there is no reason to believe Arizona would object to efforts 
to bring Famalaro back to California to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona officials could either dismiss the indictment against Famalaro or stay 
the proceedings, the latter a precautionary measure in the event the case were 
later returned to Arizona, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's case has highlighted differences between Arizona and California 
laws regarding the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly has said he believes it will be more difficult for Orange County 
prosecutors to secure a death penalty conviction against Famalaro, but even if 
they were to do so, it is unlikely he would ever be put to death in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 396 men and women on death row in California, but only two men have 
been put to death in the gas chamber since the death penalty was reinstated in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's death penalty guidelines are seen as more lenient than California's. 
Arizona prosecutors must only prove a defendant committed a "depraved, heinous" 
killing before seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, California prosecutors must prove the slaying took place during 
one or more so-called special circumstances, such as rape or kidnaping. Orange 
County prosecutors admit that they do not have enough evidence yet to proceed 
with a death penalty case against Famalaro.

18 TEST POSITIVE FOR TB AFTER DISEASE IS DIAGNOSED IN JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen people have tested positive for tuberculosis after the disease was 
diagnosed in the judge presiding over a bizarre murder-for-hire trial, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Stiles is charged with paying a teen-age neighbor $1,500 to kill her 
husband, Grady Stiles, a carnival performer known as Lobster Boy because of 
birth defects that left him with claw-like hands and stub legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer is using a battered-spouse defense, claiming Stiles' brutality, 
brought on by excessive drinking, caused her to hire a killer. The murder 
occurred in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was interrupted at its mid-point last week by presiding Judge M. 
William Graybill, who had thought he was battling a cold. During a recess, he 
yelled into the courtroom from his chambers: "Y'all stay away from me. TB is 
contagious. I must go to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point the trial was adjourned and the defendant, jury, reporters, 
lawyers, courtroom spectators and scores of county workers lined up for 
tuberculosis skin tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Luis Miranda, director of the Hillsborough Public Health Unit, said Monday 
that 18 of the 522 people tested positive for exposure to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be X-rayed," he said, explaining that skin tests are not a definite 
measure of whether one has the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge William Fuente has taken over the case, including allowing the 
battered-spouse defense that Graybill had denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a videotape of Stiles wrenching his similarly deformed son in a 
headlock was played for a second time Monday for the jury -- only this time, 
with a soundtrack in which laughter can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a wimp," a woman's voice says teasingly as the boy's face reddens and 
he flails about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a wimp," the boy says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give up too easy," another woman yells off camera. "Grab him by the seat 
of the pants and give him a wedgy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the clip ends, the boy shouts "let me up . . . air." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, which played the video clip without sound for the jury last week, 
claims it portrays the same kind of abuse that drove Mary Stiles to order her 
husband killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But 17-year-old Grady Stiles III, seen wrestling with his father on the tape, 
testified that the laughing voices in the background are those of his mother 
and sister, Donna Miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is expected to go to the jury today.

COURT'S LACK-OF-RESISTANCE RULING CITED IN DISMISSAL OF RAPE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge dismissed a rape charge against a Salvation Army official Monday after 
the prosecutor said a recent state Supreme Court ruling invalidated the case 
because the woman did not fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 McKean County Dist. Atty.Charles J. Duke also said a state law that defines 
rape as involving the use of physical or psychological force must be changed so 
other cases are not dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tragic thing to do, to require physical resistance in a rape 
case," Duke said. "What police say . . . is that if you are in the situation of 
being raped, don't resist. That can only cause greater injury to oneself." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke said the woman told Salvation Army Capt. Dana Bentley "No," "Don't do 
that" and "We can't do this" when Bentley allegedly pinned her to a bed and 
ordered her to perform oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley's attorney said the defense had wanted to go to trial and was 
confident of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent Supreme Court ruling, the woman and man involved both said she 
repeatedly told him no. The man, Robert A. Berkowitz, said he did not take her 
seriously. The woman said she had been taught in college not to fight back 
because doing so could get a rape victim killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices ruled, 7 to 0, that there was no evidence of force.

THE MTA STRIKE; RIDE-SHARING HELPS AVERT MAJOR WORKPLACE DISRUPTIONS; IMPACT: 
FEW BUSINESSES REPORT MAJOR PROBLEMS, IN PART BECAUSE OF PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO 
GET EMPLOYEES TO WORK IN A DISASTER. HOWEVER, MANY BUS RIDERS WORRY ABOUT 
HARDSHIPS FROM A LONG WALKOUT.

 Some employees arrived late or not at all and customers were scarce at some 
establishments, but most Los Angeles area workers and businesses made it 
through Monday's first day of a regional bus strike with only minor disruptions 
or lost revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ride-sharing programs -- set up to get employees to work in the event of an 
earthquake or other disaster -- went a long way toward alleviating potential 
disruptions as a strike crippled much of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority and its fleet of 1,900 buses. In addition, Monday is a relatively 
slow day for retailers, minimizing any potential drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But the walkout by MTA mechanics, which was honored by drivers and clerks, 
struck a quick and costly blow at some businesses. The strike could also prove 
a financial burden to many bus riders because many companies will not pay them 
for lost hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downtown Los Angeles at Clifton's Cafeteria on Broadway, where the 
predominantly Latino clientele is heavily dependent on mass transit, only 450 
of the normal 700 customers showed up for breakfast, said manager Jose Morales. 
The lunch crowd at the three-level restaurant was reduced by more than 30%, and 
Morales said Monday afternoon that he might close early if evening traffic 
remained light. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hurting," Morales said, adding that he might have to reduce 
workers' hours substantially if business does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping traffic at the Glendale Galleria, however, seemed on target to match 
the usual Monday average of 35,000 to 50,000 shoppers, said Nicolette 
Abernathy, marketing director for the mall. Although she had no statistics 
about the number of Galleria shoppers that rely on public transportation, 
Abernathy said the strike could have a more serious impact on retailers if it 
continues through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter of a million people in Los Angeles County rely on mass 
transit to get to work, and countless more use MTA buses for shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every business with transit-dependent employees will feel some 
impact from the strike, but we don't anticipate a severe economic impact," said 
Shannon Jones of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at Southern California Gas Co. reported "no major problems" getting 
to work Monday, said company spokesman George McQuade. The company made 
arrangements for those stranded by the strike to drive to work and park free at 
a garage near the company's Downtown offices and catch a shuttle bus. With 42 
van pools and 170 car pools, it was easy for workers to bum a ride from fellow 
employees, McQuade said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a little inconvenient," McQuade said. "A lot of people 
complained that buses were overcrowded. One guy hitched a ride when he was 
stranded at his bus stop on Wilshire." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hart, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman in Century City, said he hadn't 
noticed any difference in employee attendance Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of ride-share people, and we are providing match lists for bus 
riders to latch onto car pools and van pools," Hart said. "A few people have 
asked about it, but the numbers aren't that big." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the 690 workers at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott failed to 
show up for work on Monday because of the strike, said Marriott spokeswoman 
Catherine Boire. Employees who cannot find a way to their job will be given the 
day off -- but without pay, Boire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mattis, an operator at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los 
Angeles, has been taking the bus to work for 27 years. She arrived at work two 
hours late on Monday, but she said her supervisor was "very understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfair that those of us who are working poor are going to suffer," 
she said.

BLOOD AMOUNT FOR TESTS IS CRUCIAL; SIMPSON CASE: MOST OF THE SPECIMENS ON WHICH 
THE PROSECUTION IS BUILDING ITS CASE BARELY MEET MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR 
ACCURATE DNA RESULTS. A SECOND TEST REQUIRES A SMALLER SAMPLE, BUT THE RESULTS 
ARE FAR LESS DEFINITIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Drops of blood smaller than a grain of rice may be the ultimate arbiters of 
guilt or innocence in the O.J. Simpson murder case, experts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And as pretrial arguments swirled around the use of genetic blood testing, it 
was clear that the amount of blood available for such tests will be crucial, 
according to scientists in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 One small drop, which would be about the size of a dime if smeared onto 
clothing, is the minimum amount necessary to obtain viable genetic 
fingerprinting using the most accurate DNA test, called RFLP. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Marcia Clark is relying on the esoteric technology to try to prove 
that blood drops on a sidewalk at the townhouse where Simpson's ex-wife and her 
friend were killed belong to Simpson, and that bloodstains in his Ford Bronco 
and on a glove found at his Brentwood estate belong to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's defense team wants to obtain a portion of each blood sample to 
conduct its own testing, but most of the blood specimens on which Clark is 
building her case barely meet the minimum size requirement. Some are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be possible to obtain results with the smaller samples, according to 
geneticist George F. Sensabaugh Jr. of UC Berkeley, but the chances are poor 
that the results would be useful. In Monday's hearing, Clark said it is 
unlikely there will be enough left over for independent testing by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 For those blood specimens not large enough for RFLP fingerprinting, the 
prosecution will fall back on a second, less specific type of fingerprinting 
called PCR. It requires a far smaller sample and is performed much more 
quickly, but its results are not nearly as definitive. Clark may also find it 
harder to have PCR results admitted into court because the technique is newer 
than RFLP and has not been used in court nearly as often. 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP, an acronym for Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism testing, is a 
well-studied, time-consuming test that can show with a very high degree of 
certainty -- at least 999,999 chances in 1 million -- that two samples are from 
the same person. The test, first developed in 1985, looks at four to six 
segments of DNA that have a unique length in each individual. 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP requires 50 nanograms of DNA. That is not very much blood, according to 
Dr. Paul R. Billings of the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. 
One milliliter of blood, an amount about the size of the eraser on a pencil, 
contains 20,000 nanograms. 
</P>
<P>
 PCR testing requires a stain only about the size of the head of a pin, 
according to Mark Stolorow of Cellmark Ltd. in Gaithersburg, Md., which is 
performing DNA testing for the LAPD in the Simpson case. In this technique, a 
biochemical process called Polymerase Chain Reaction is used to replicate 
segments of DNA, increasing the quantity a million times or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But PCR does not provide as much information as RFLP. The most commonly used 
form involves a series of six markers called, collectively, DQ-alpha. PCR tests 
using DQ-alpha have been admitted in court in more than 80 court cases in 23 
states, according to Kristin Garvin of Perkin-Elmer Corp., the test's 
manufacturer. But even under the best of circumstances, DQ-alpha provides odds 
of no better than 93 in 100 that two samples are from the same individual. 
</P>
<P>
 PCR is better for showing somebody did not commit a crime than for showing 
guilt, according to criminalist Jack Mertens of the FBI's Forensic Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Reported PCR results for the glove found on Simpson's estate, for example, 
show that the blood on it could have come from either Simpson or his ex-wife. 
But the results were so poor that the blood could have come from 50% of the 
entire population, said forensics expert William Thompson of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably because of this, Clark said that the prosecution wants to do a 
different type of PCR testing on the same samples, using a set of probes called 
"polymarkers." These probes are more definitive than DQ-alpha, but are much 
newer and have not been accepted in as many court cases, Sensabaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the high reliability of RFLP testing, perhaps the best hope of the 
defense lies in finding errors in Cellmark's testing. Shapiro's co-counsel, 
Barry Scheck, said Monday that the company had made a mistake in a 1989 
proficiency test -- in which Cellmark was asked to match standardized blood 
samples whose identities were unknown to its scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Stolorow conceded that error, but noted that 
the company had tightened its procedures substantially since then. "We are now 
involved in every available externally offered proficiency test for forensic 
DNA analysis, and we have made no errors in the last 300 to 400 test samples 
over the last five years," he said. Sleuthing With DNA 
</P>
<P>
 DNA analysis, or genetic fingerprinting, will be a key aspect in the O.J. 
Simpson murder case as prosecutors hope to show that blood samples will link 
him to the crime. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genetic 
information that is unique to each individual. It can be extracted from blood, 
hair, skin or other body fluids or tissues. Two types of DNA tests are being 
performed on samples in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LONG TEST 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at how RFLP testing, the conventional process, works: 
</P>
<P>
 1) DNA is extracted from body tissue or fluids, such as blood, collected from 
suspects and evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The DNA is chemically cut into fragments using restriction enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The resulting DNA fragments are placed in a gel and separated into bands by 
running an electric current through it, a process called electrophoresis. 
</P>
<P>
 4) The pattern, invisible at this point, is transferred to a nylon membrane. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Radioactive DNA probes are applied to the membrane and bind to matching DNA 
sequences. Excess, unattached, DNA probes are washed away. 
</P>
<P>
 6) X-ray film is placed next to the membrane. The film is developed, revealing 
a pattern of bands where the radioactive probe has bound to the DNA fragments. 
This DNA profile is the genetic fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
 7) The final DNA fingerprint is a pattern of light and dark bands that looks 
like a supermarket bar code. The DNA fingerprint is compared to DNA from other 
samples, such as blood found at a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 THE QUICK TEST 
</P>
<P>
 A new type of DNA testing, called PCR typing, can be used on much smaller 
samples of DNA and takes much less time than RFLP typing, but it is less 
definitive. LAPD forensic scientists have used PCR typing on samples obtained 
from the Simpson crime scene, but are not introducing them in the preliminary 
hearing. PCR test results have not been accepted into evidence by courts in 
California. Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. DNA is extracted from body tissue or fluids and purified. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The intact DNA is combined with short fragments of known DNA, called 
primers, and other chemicals that cause the DNA to be replicated. The primers 
cause only certain short segments of DNA to replicate. Within 30 cycles of 
replication, the amount of DNA increases 1 million times. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Small quantities of the replicated DNA are applied to eight to 10 spots on 
a reagent strip. Each spot contains a different segment of known DNA. If the 
replicated DNA contains a segment matching the known segment, a blue color 
appears on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The pattern of spots from a sample obtained at a crime scene is compared to 
that from a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 PCR vs. RFLP 
</P>
<P>
 Time required for results: 
</P>
<P>
 PCR: One week or less 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP: Four to six weeks 
</P>
<P>
 Chances of identical results from two different people: 
</P>
<P>
 PCR: 1 to 500 to 1 in 2,000 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP: 1 in 1 million 
</P>
<P>
 Admissibility in California courts: 
</P>
<P>
 PCR: No precedent 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP: Precedent for admission

USE OF DNA TESTS OKD BY FEDERAL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DNA evidence can be used in federal courts under a flexible new Supreme Court 
standard as long as the trial judge guards against abuses, a federal appeals 
court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticisms by some scientists of claims of numerical probability based on 
analysis of genetic material do not bar its use as evidence because the high 
court no longer requires approval by a consensus of the scientific community, 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said there is enough scientific support for DNA analysis that a 
judge can properly conclude that it would help a jury determine whether the 
defendant was at a crime scene or committed a crime. The court said the trial 
judge must guard against exaggerated prosecutorial claims that might lead the 
jury to give "undue weight" to DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling upheld the sexual assault and murder convictions and life prison 
sentence of Daniel Chischilly in the death of a woman on the Navajo reservation 
near Sanders in Arizona on New Year's Day, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA decision, the latest of several similar rulings by federal appeals 
courts nationwide, is binding on federal courts in nine Western states. It is 
not binding on state courts in California, where DNA evidence is being studied 
in the double-murder case against O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 California courts have required a scientific consensus before allowing 
evidence based on new scientific techniques and have been divided over 
admissibility of DNA evidence under that standard. In the last major ruling, a 
state appeals court said in 1992 that a study criticizing claims of high 
probabilities for DNA identification showed that DNA statistical analysis 
lacked a scientific consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the California Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Aug. 30 
over whether to require state courts to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's new 
test for scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 That test, established in a 1993 ruling, says general scientific acceptance is 
not an absolute requirement but is one factor a judge can consider in deciding 
whether the evidence would help a jury.

BOBBITT SAYS HE'S '100% NOT GUILTY' OF BATTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt borrowed a line from O.J. Simpson on Monday, pleading 
"absolutely, positively, 100% not guilty" to a misdemeanor charge of battering 
his former fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice of the Peace Bill Jansen set a Sept. 28 trial for Bobbitt, who also 
faces a Municipal Court appearance Wednesday, where he is charged with domestic 
battery in connection with an incident May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent case, Bobbitt and his former fiancee, Kristina Elliott, 
were arrested July 2 along with a friend, Todd Biro, after a fracas in which 
Elliott claims she was beaten by the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt told police he was struck and bitten on the chest by Elliott, 21, a 
former topless dancer he met in Las Vegas in February while on a personal 
appearance tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Abbi Logue said she would seek jail time for Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt's plea echoed that of Simpson, whose plea Friday said he was 
"absolutely 100% not guilty" to charges of killing his ex-wife and a companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt gained international attention in June, 1993, when his wife, Lorena 
Bobbitt, severed his penis while he slept in their Virginia home. She told 
police she did it because Bobbitt sexually assaulted her. The penis was 
reattached surgically. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt was acquitted of marital sexual abuse in November. A jury in January 
found Lorena Bobbitt innocent by reason of insanity of mutilating her husband.

OPPOSING VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The major party candidates for U.S. Senate -- Democrat Dianne Feinstein and 
Republican Michael Huffington -- began airing new statewide television 
commercials last week about immigration. Both commercials respond to attacks by 
the opponent's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE FEINSTEIN AD: It opens by showing a San Francisco Chronicle editorial 
while an off-camera narrator explains: "The Chronicle says: 'The Huffington ad 
blatantly distorts Feinstein's record on the issue of illegal immigration' and 
calls it 'a plain and simple lie.' " The ad then features a graphic of a Senate 
immigration vote by Feinstein followed by a picture of a letter to President 
Clinton. The narration continues: "The truth: Feinstein's leading the fight 
against illegal immigration. Her leadership secured funding for 600 new border 
guards -- funding that Congressman Huffington voted against, three times. And 
Huffington is the only California Congress member who refused to sign this 
letter to the President to repay Californians the cost of illegal immigration." 
It ends: "Congressman Huffington. He'll say anything to get elected." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Feinstein's ad responds to a charge Huffington made in a 
commercial that attacked the Democrat's claim she is tough on illegal 
immigration. The Huffington ad contended that a 1985 resolution Feinstein 
signed while mayor of San Francisco ordered police to violate federal law by 
not reporting illegal immigrants. Feinstein supporters said the non-binding 
resolution recommended that police and other city officials should not initiate 
the deportation of refugees fleeing a particularly violent period in El 
Salvador and Guatemala. An editorial in the Chronicle recently called 
Huffington's claim a "lie" because the resolution's language addressed the 
relationship with federal law. The ad's claim that Feinstein helped secure 600 
new border guards refers to the senator's support for a recent appropriations 
bill. Huffington said he favors more border guards, but he opposed the 
appropriations bill because he said it included other wasteful spending. 
Huffington also said he did not sign the letter to the President because he 
sent a separate one that called for even more funding reimbursement to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE HUFFINGTON AD: It begins with Harold W. Ezell, former western regional 
commissioner of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, speaking to 
the camera. "I know a lot about immigration," Ezell says. "I was regional 
commissioner. You've seen ads about San Francisco's sanctuary policy. Mike 
Huffington is right." The ad then shows a picture of a 1985 San Francisco 
Chronicle story, highlighting a headline about the sanctuary vote and a phrase 
in the story that says "in defiance of federal law." Ezell continues: "When 
Dianne Feinstein declared San Francisco a sanctuary, a safe haven for illegal 
aliens, it was in defiance of federal law." Picturing Ezell again, he 
continues: "Feinstein's hometown newspaper would have you believe something 
different, but I know the truth, I was there. Feinstein's policy encouraged the 
invasion of illegals into California." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The ad is Huffington's second attempt to persuade voters that 
Feinstein and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors violated federal law by 
passing the 1985 sanctuary resolution. Huffington bases his claim on two 
sources: a 1985 San Francisco Chronicle news story that used the phrase "in 
defiance of federal law" and Ezell, a former federal immigration official under 
President Ronald Reagan and a prominent Republican activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronicle Editor Bill German said recently that the newspaper's 1985 news 
story that contained the phrase "in defiance of federal law" was incorrect. In 
fact, the resolution addresses the issue of federal law. It refers to a federal 
court decision that said a local government is not required to provide an 
individual's immigration status to federal authorities. It also added: "The 
city and county of San Francisco is not, in adopting this resolution, 
encouraging its employees and citizens to violate any local, state or federal 
laws."

DNA TESTS BEGIN IN ORANGE COUNTY MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophisticated DNA tests have begun in an effort to show whether blood from a 
suspected murder site in Orange County is consistent with samples taken from 
the body of Denise Huber, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking the blood found in the Laguna Hills storage facility to Huber is a 
crucial element in determining whether the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman was 
killed there.A match would almost surely transfer the prosecution of suspect 
John J. Famalaro from Arizona to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's nude and handcuffed body was found two weeks ago in a freezer in a 
moving truck outside Famalaro's home in Dewey, near Prescott. Since the grim 
discovery, authorities have been building a case against the former Orange 
County man and trying to determine where he will be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the blood testing is being done in Orange County. Should the blood from 
the storage facility be identified as Huber's, the findings would support the 
long-held theory of law enforcement officials that Huber died shortly after her 
disappearance June 3, 1991.

SCOTT HARRIS: O.J. CASE CALLS PRIORITIES INTO QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joyce Kline of Lancaster writes: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm with you! When I watch the news on TV, it's with the channel changer in my 
hand and the second O.J. Simpson's name is mentioned, I change channels. I've 
also listened to a lot of cassette music tapes these past few weeks!  
</P>
<P>
 He's a hero? How many lives has he saved? A hero is someone who has saved a 
life or lives at the risk of his own, such as servicemen in wars . . . . He's 
nothing but an ex-football player who has made a lot of money hawking 
products!!  
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kline was, I'm pleased to say, one of several readers who wrote recently 
to express their agreement with a recent column describing my disgust with the 
pervasive media coverage of the O.J. Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's disappointing that nobody wrote in with an opposing viewpoint. How 
nice it would have been if someone had written: "Harris, you're full of it as 
usual. Too much O.J.? Nonsense! If anything, we need more O.J.! Why aren't we 
getting a daily reading on O.J.'s horoscope? How will biorhythms affect the 
attorneys for both prosecution and defense? Really, now. O.J. is so much more 
entertaining than that health care stuff. Would you rather read about Rwanda? 
And you call yourself a newsman. For shame." 
</P>
<P>
 The O.J. junkies must be too busy to write. A colleague sadly told me this 
story: On a recent day off, he decided to take his wife out for lunch. She 
agreed to come -- but only if it was OK for her to wear her radio Walkman to 
follow the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of behavior promises to worsen once the trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with all this, of course, is the distortion of priorities. There's 
no question that the Simpson case is an extraordinary and fascinating story. 
Media lords have decided that the public can't get enough O.J., so we'll shovel 
out as much as we can, as fast as we can. The Simpson coverage is a model of 
the maxim that nothing succeeds like excess. The errors that various news 
organizations have been forced to retract are but one price of the rush for the 
latest scoop. The bigger price may be that the hype of "sensational" crime 
stories will continue. The result isn't only that more significant stories will 
be underplayed, but that other important stories may be missed entirely, simply 
because the reporters are too busy chasing down minutiae of the sensational 
story of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least there are signs of media guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider ABC's special "Nightline" broadcast last Friday concerning Simpson 
coverage. When Fred Barnes of The New Republic suggested that this homicide 
case had gotten more air time than the Persian Gulf War, Ted Koppel said that 
ABC News was curious about that, too. Koppel said a check (of ABC News' own 
coverage, presumably) found that the war had edged O.J. by a "close" margin. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems safe to assume, then, that the TV hours devoted to the Simpson case 
will surpass that of the Persian Gulf War not long after the trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about that for a moment. The fact that U.S. casualties were so low has, 
for better or worse, enabled many Americans to devalue memories of a war. But 
try to think back. Think of the fear we all felt as so much of the world 
decided to march off to war. Think of the fears of chemical warfare. Think of 
the anti-war demonstrations and the candlelight vigils. Think back to the 
moment when you learned that U.S. warplanes had bombed Baghdad. Think of the 
faces of the American POWs. Think of the dead women and children. Think of the 
carnage that was left in the retreat of Iraqi troops. Think of the solitary 
Scud missile that managed to hit a U.S. Army barracks, killing 28 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 My assignment then was the home front. One memorable story required that I 
visit Frank and Sammie Mitchell of Moreno Valley two days after they learned 
that their daughter, 20-year-old Adrienne, had been killed in that Scud attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchells graciously met one reporter after another, speaking of their 
pride and their sadness. Frank Mitchell told a remarkable story of how, a day 
before the official notification arrived that his daughter had died, he had 
sensed the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 All they had known was that their daughter was in Saudi Arabia. Yet when Frank 
Mitchell saw the TV images of the burning barracks, he turned to his wife and 
said, "Adrienne's in there." He then turned off the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he couldn't sleep. "My mind," he explained to me, "was telling me 
something I didn't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Sammie received the terrible news first, coming home to find 
three Army officers waiting at her door. She called Frank at work and suggested 
he sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't need to sit down," Sammie said. "He said, 'It's Adrienne, 
isn't it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not really sure why I decided to tell this story a second time. I'm not 
sure what got me off on this tangent. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that, when I think back to the Persian Gulf War, and then I think of 
the Simpson media carnival, it offends me all over again.

GETTING INVOLVED / MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY: GROUP LOOKING FOR 
VOLUNTEER 'GRANDPARENTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, the parents who need the most help from the Family Friends project 
are recent immigrants who know little English and less about American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everyone gets understood," said Susie Forer-Dehrey, director of the 
organization, which finds volunteer grandparents for families with chronically 
ill or disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Friends project started in 1986, matching senior citizens with 
families. The volunteers, who often delight in being called "grandpa" or 
"auntie," may take the kids to a baseball game or other activity to either give 
parents a break from caring for sick children or a chance to spend more time 
with well children. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the parents don't speak English, their children usually do. And 
starting with the children is the beginning of the common bond that transforms 
the volunteers from strangers to family. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, these are the only grandparents these children have known," 
Forer-Dehrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children have left behind older relatives in their native 
countries, or their own grandparents have died. Family Friends' volunteer 
grandparents also act as advocates for the family, which may still be 
unfamiliar with American ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our grandparent represents someone that is well into the American culture," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a simpler level, just by taking the kids to the grandparent often brings a 
sense of a normal life into a home where visits by therapists, social workers 
and other strangers are commonplace. The children have a variety of conditions, 
including leukemia, cystic fibrosis or Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer grandparents may help the children with homework. They may take 
families on trips to the zoo, the beach, a park or to the movies. And they may 
often become so much a part of the family that they often go away on weekend 
trips together. 
</P>
<P>
 One volunteer grandmother used to go with a mother and her two sick children 
when they had doctors appointments. Since the volunteer's stroke after the 
Northridge earthquake, the family is caring for her and visiting her in a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caring goes both ways," Forer-Dehrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are encouraged to become mentors, passing on their knowledge 
and traditions to the younger generations. 
</P>

'3 STRIKES' INMATE IS ACCUSED IN RAPE AT JAIL; CRIME: OFFICIALS ARE 
INVESTIGATING THE ALLEGED ASSAULT BY AN OXNARD MAN WHO FACES LIFE IN PRISON FOR 
PETTY THEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Oxnard man facing life in prison for petty theft under the 
"three-strikes-you're-out" law is accused of raping his cellmate in Ventura 
County Jail last weekend, jail officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt C. McCowan, 52, who was convicted last week of stealing 18 bottles 
of cologne, has been switched to a different area of the lockup after his 
cellmate reported being forcibly sodomized, said Sheriff's Lt. Geoff Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an allegation that one inmate was sexually molested by another 
inmate," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, which the victim said occurred sometime after 10 p.m. Saturday, 
is being investigated by the Major Crimes Unit. Allegations of rape inside the 
jail are rare, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember the last time I had one (a reported rape)," Dean said. "And 
talking to the other people, they can't remember the last time they had one, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time McCowan has been investigated for forcibly 
sodomizing a cellmate, according to court records. In 1972, he and two other 
men stripped an inmate, pinned the man on a bunk and raped him, the records 
say. No charges were brought in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current case, McCowan's alleged victim received medical care from the 
jail's physician, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives will present a report of the incident to the district attorney's 
office today for review, a spokesman said. If warranted, charges in the case 
could be filed against McCowan as early as this week, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kevin J. McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was promptly reported and we believe we will be able to review it in very 
short order," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan was convicted under the state's new three-strikes law on Thursday for 
stealing the cologne from an Oxnard Sav-on store. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily, could not be 
reached for comment. After publicity of McCowan's prosecution for stealing 
cologne surfaced last week, some critics of the three-strikes measure said his 
case exposed weaknesses in the law because it allowed nonviolent third 
offenders to face unreasonable sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury insisted that McCowan was indeed a violent 
felon and posed a danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that he chose to do this to his cellmate," Bradbury said 
Monday. "But now he will be behind bars for the rest of his life, and his 
victims will have to continue to be other inmates and not law-abiding 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, McCowan criticized prosecutors for charging 
him under the new law, which mandates a sentence of 25 years to life in prison 
for felony offenders who have two prior serious or violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1964, McCowan has been charged in 26 criminal cases and sentenced to 37 
years in state prison on various convictions, ranging from burglary and robbery 
to assault with the intent to commit murder. He has spent only about five years 
outside prison walls in the past 30 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan maintained that he is not a violent offender and vigorously defended 
himself for any violent crime in which he has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he stole the cologne, valued at $340, because he is a drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said somewhat grudgingly during the interview that his cellmate was in 
custody for the same crimes as himself -- petty theft -- but was only given 130 
days behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many facts Mr. McCowan had about his cellmate," Lt. Dean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said inmates are housed at the county jail based on a 
classification system that takes into account the charges they face and their 
criminal history.

SHERIFF, DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFER BUDGET PROPOSAL; COUNTY: LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS WOULD ADMINISTER $2.5 MILLION MORE IN SERVICES, EXPANDING AREAS OF 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County sheriff and district attorney promised Monday to administer 
$2.5 million more in county services, expanding their own domain and sparing 
other departments from crippling budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 After blasting the Board of Supervisors in news reports this weekend, the law 
enforcement officials offered a conciliatory note at a budget hearing as they 
unveiled plans to broaden the services their departments pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, for instance, the sheriff would assume responsibility for 
the coroner's office and its $920,000 budget. The district attorney would be 
responsible for representing children in court, a savings of $300,000 to the 
fund that pays for most county services. Both departments would do their own 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have attempted to be innovative, while at the same time recognizing the 
fiscal dilemma your board is facing," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury told the 
supervisors Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, appearing on a KADY-TV broadcast, he compared the board to 
an organized crime family laundering money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supervisors said they were pleased with the prosecutor's change of tone, 
but irritated that it was so long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have done this morning is what we need to do," said Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee, stifling her anger. "We should have had this a month ago. I 
don't know why we had to go through two weeks of being bullied and badgered." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost-cutting proposal is not without its problems, other county department 
heads maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner, who said he learned about the consolidation plan when Sheriff 
Larry Carpenter announced it Monday, feared the move would damage his 
department's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do independent investigations of suspicious deaths," said Ronald L. 
O'Halloran, the county's medical examiner-coroner. "If the sheriff takes over 
control, we will try our best to be independent. But that doesn't help the 
perception with the public and the defense attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the county's personnel chief and social services director disputed cost 
savings that the sheriff and district attorney are predicting. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal came as the board prepares to vote on its budget for the fiscal 
year that began July 1. State cuts and a growing county deficit have forced 
supervisors to consider reductions in all county agencies, including the 
criminal justice departments they had promised to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, the board will make final decisions on such politically 
volatile issues as how much to contribute to county libraries, whether to 
eliminate a Veterans Services office and whether to cut up to 124 jobs from the 
county payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday they received some good news about the budget. The latest figures show 
the county's deficit at $14.7 million, down from the $17 million to $19 million 
predicted earlier, out of an $880-million total spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the library system has more money than anticipated. That means the 
county could contribute less than last year's $1.6-million subsidy and still 
maintain the same level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bradbury-Carpenter initiative, if it works, would spare supervisors 
the political fallout likely to come with cuts in public safety budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 After voters agreed to the special half-cent sales tax under Proposition 172 
last fall, supervisors pledged to use all the money for law enforcement. In 
March, they backed up that promise with a plan to give $24 million to the 
sheriff, district attorney, public defender and corrections services. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they learned about $10 million in unexpected state cuts in June, the 
board began contemplating police-agency reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 That provoked a rebuke from Carpenter. And Bradbury threatened a lawsuit or 
political retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Independently elected, the sheriff and district attorney must nonetheless 
depend on the supervisors for funding. The Proposition 172 money is designated 
for public safety, but the supervisors still dole it out. The $24 million makes 
up only about one-sixth of the total budget for the four law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than allow some of that money to filter out to other county agencies, 
Bradbury and Carpenter are offering to cover those services with their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 That essentially would free up more county dollars for other agencies facing 
deep cuts. The medical examiner-coroner, for instance, could lose four of his 
nine employees under proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 If absorbed by the sheriff, the office would remain intact. But, O'Halloran 
argued, his independence would be compromised. He recommended that the board 
simply give his agency Proposition 172 money and allow it to remain separate 
from the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter has also proposed taking over personnel and purchasing 
responsibilities for his department, a plan that would move six county workers 
to the Sheriff's Department. He would also pay the $239,000 contract for mental 
health counseling at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Carpenter's proposals add up to $2.1 million. Bradbury's 
initiatives would save the county general fund $410,000 to $465,000 by taking 
over not only the court representation of children, but welfare fraud and code 
enforcement cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said that assuming the new responsibilities would be the equivalent 
of cutting 4% from his budget. Carpenter's proposal would be about a 3.6% 
reduction.

JOBLESS RATE GROWS, BUT COUNTY IS 'HOLDING UP'; UNEMPLOYMENT: STATISTIC 
INCREASES FROM 6.5% TO 7.3%, BUT EXPERTS ARE NOT PESSIMISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After falling steadily for several months, Ventura County's unemployment rate 
climbed from 6.5% in May to 7.3% in June, according to a report released Monday 
by the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increase, economists and unemployment officials said they are 
encouraged by signs that the county's economy is at least holding even. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report shows no tremendous losses, but no victories either," said Mark 
Schniepp, director of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project. "It's 
stagnant. But we should probably be happy with the report in that the county is 
holding up as well as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as June of last year, Ventura County's unemployment rate had 
soared to 8.9%. But by May of this year, the unemployment rate reached its 
lowest point in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction industry, which had dropped into virtual dormancy during the 
worst part of the recession, showed growth of 400 jobs from May to June, thanks 
in large part to the need to repair and remodel buildings damaged by the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people in construction who hadn't worked in two years before the 
earthquake," said Larry Kennedy, manager of the unemployment office in Simi 
Valley, which serves the entire east county. "Now we have a lot of 
reconstruction going on within the school districts and the big businesses that 
took the hits from the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents whose homes required minor repairs are also remodeling, Kennedy 
said. He said he expects the flurry of post-quake construction in the east 
county to last at least six more months. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said residential building permits were up 39% during the first five 
months of the year compared to the same period last year. He said he was not 
surprised to see the jump in unemployment from May to June, saying much of it 
could be attributed to the loss of 3,200 agricultural jobs since May. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the May employment is in strawberry harvesting and processing," he 
said. "So you tend to get a decline in agricultural jobs when the strawberry 
season ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he does not put much stock in the jobless statistic. He measures 
the health of the job market by the activity in his Simi Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the indirect signals to me of how well we're doing are the numbers of 
unsolicited job orders we get here," he said. "Last week 65 employers called in 
with jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has about 250 jobs to fill right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, I would have had half that," Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of unemployment claims in the east county went down from May to 
June, he said, despite the increase in unemployment. In May 1,660 people 
applied for unemployment; in June 1,636 made claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of people, but it's not as much as it has been," Kennedy said. 
"I definitely see a bottom to the recession." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schniepp was more cautious, saying the continuing loss of jobs in key 
growth areas such as the manufacturing sector -- down 1,100 jobs since June 
1993 -- indicates the county's economic future is still tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole report tends to suggest that Ventura is not really going anywhere 
right now in terms of labor gain," he said. "Of course, that is just indicative 
of the rest of Southern California. Ventura is not the lonely child here. It is 
simply part of the team."

2 MEN HELD IN LAS VEGAS IN SLAYING OF LOCAL MAN; CRIME: TIPS LEAD TO CAPTURE OF 
SUSPECTS AT MOTEL. TWO OTHER MEN ARE ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO AVENGE 
VICTIM'S DEATH. 
</P>

<P>
 Tips from unidentified sources led four local homicide investigators to Las 
Vegas over the weekend, where they helped local police arrest two men suspected 
in a Ventura slaying last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Corral and Ruben A. Viveros were arrested late Sunday at a motel 
just off the Las Vegas Strip for the killing of 23-year-old Roger Rowland, who 
died Thursday morning after being shot in the abdomen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to several people, who gave us bits and pieces (of information) 
that led us to that location," said Ventura Police Lt. Brad Talbot. "Corral was 
arrested, and then they had to wait awhile before they found the other guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas police also arrested Shawn L. Johnson, 21, of Ventura and Edward 
Englehart, 22, of Las Vegas late Saturday on charges of conspiracy to commit 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Johnson and Englehart were planning to kill Corral to avenge 
Rowland's death. Several weapons, including a shotgun and an assault rifle, 
along with masks, gloves and bulletproof vests, were recovered at the scene of 
their arrest, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Corral, 23, and Viveros, 19, are known to local authorities as Ventura 
Avenue Gangsters and are being held without bail in Clark County Jail on 
suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 They could waive extradition and return to Ventura within days or fight the 
proceedings and force the governors of both states to agree to transport the 
suspects back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral also is wanted in connection with the 1991 Los Angeles kidnaping of a 
3-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional charges of providing false information to a police officer and 
illegal possession of alcohol were filed against Viveros, according to jail 
officials. At the time of his arrest, he lied about his identity and was in 
possession of alcohol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police drove to Las Vegas on Saturday and enlisted the help of the Las 
Vegas Metro Police gang unit in making the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, a group of Ventura and Las Vegas police officers staked out 
the apartment building of other suspected gang members when they spotted five 
men in a small, green car with California plates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vehicle fled, and a short pursuit occurred," Talbot said. "When they left 
the vehicle, a shot or shots were fired, but no one was hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot said Englehart and Johnson, who was Rowland's friend, were arrested for 
trying to kill Corral in revenge for his alleged killing of Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went to Las Vegas looking for Corral," Talbot said. "These people all 
know each other. They're all Avenue gangsters, so there's some sort of 
intra-gang problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Corral and Viveros are accused of breaking into the Ventura apartment of 
Melinda Corona, the mother of Corral's 1-year-old child, early Thursday and 
shooting Rowland, who was staying with Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 No one answered the front door Monday at Corona's Kirk Street apartment, where 
a sliding glass door nearby had been pierced by a bullet and the doorknob 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they had not see Corona or the infant since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral has been a fugitive since 1991, when he and a group of friends 
allegedly kidnaped the 3-year-old son of a woman who claimed one of Corral's 
friends had raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 The former boyfriend "orchestrated the whole kidnap from L.A. County Jail" in 
an attempt to dissuade the woman from testifying, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Larry Hedwall. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral and his friends "kidnaped him down here in South-Central L.A., and one 
of the main players was from Ventura," Hedwall said Monday. "The boy was kept 
in a Ventura motel room for two days (before he was found by police)." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedwall said all of the other suspects in the kidnaping except Corral were 
arrested and convicted in the case.

 Media coverage of the murder case against Mark Scott Thornton, accused of 
killing Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, has often been one-sided, portraying 
the defendant negatively and the victim sympathetically, a defense expert 
witness said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Bronson, a political-science professor at Cal State Chico, made the 
statement during a hearing in which defense attorneys are asking to have the 
trial moved outside Ventura County because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's testimony came as Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath also 
announced he would not unseal court documents, including the transcript of the 
grand-jury proceedings that led to the indictment of Thornton on charges of 
kidnaping and murder. Prosecutors have asked that the documents be kept secret 
to limit pretrial publicity and keep the trial in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's decision came three months after he said he was inclined to unseal 
the transcript and other court documents at the time of a change of venue 
hearing. The request to unseal the documents was made by The Times, which was 
joined by Ventura County Newspapers. The papers later asked the 2nd District 
Court of Appeal to intercede in the case, but the appellate court last week 
refused to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath did not specifically provide a basis for his ruling Monday, other than 
to say his conclusion was reached after having read the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Glen A. Smith, representing The Times, said the newspaper has not 
decided if it will appeal the judge's ruling. But he added that Ventura County 
court officials have not shown a good cause for sealing the documents in 
question, as is required under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been any showing so far that any of the materials that have been 
sealed would affect his right to a fair trial one way or another, and that has 
been the whole point to our motion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton, 19, kidnaped and fatally shot O'Sullivan, 34, mother of a 
young son. The grand jury indictment against him includes a special 
circumstance that could send Thornton to the gas chamber, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the change-of-venue hearing, Bronson discussed the results of a poll he 
designed that showed that two-thirds of the county's registered voters believe 
Thornton is guilty of killing O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 During nearly three hours of testimony, Bronson did not talk about the 
ultimate conclusion of his survey: that Thornton cannot get a fair trial in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to testify about that result today, when direct examination 
continues, said Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher, Thornton's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronson, who has published articles on pretrial publicity, said he reviewed 
179 stories on the case from local newspapers, as well as listened to tapes of 
television and radio broadcasts on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The professor said he used a system called "hierarchy of prejudice," which 
considers whether news stories are inflammatory or prejudicial, or contain 
information that is either inaccurate or inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the public seemed shocked by the O'Sullivan murder because she was 
"well-liked, middle class, white and not a drug dealer." 
</P>
<P>
 She was kidnaped after leaving a friend's office in Westlake while running 
errands, police said. Bronson said the apparent circumstances surrounding her 
disappearance are what made the case big news. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of Bronson's testimony is what he said were the contrasting 
treatments afforded the victim and the defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have reported Thornton's criminal record and even some alleged 
crimes for which he was never charged, Bronson said. In 25 different stories, 
he said, news accounts inaccurately reported O'Sullivan was shot three times in 
the back. Actually, he said, she was shot twice in the back and once in the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a lot of significance to being shot in the back," said 
Bronson. "That makes it cowardly, almost an assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 While most media reported that Thornton denied murdering O'Sullivan, Bronson 
said reporters often couched the defendant's version of what occurred in terms 
of it being his "story," as if to suggest he was fabricating the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Media reports also quoted sources calling Thornton "unemployed," "a drifter," 
"not to be trusted," "just wild," "dangerous" and "an escape risk." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dangerous coupled with escape risk is particularly troubling to jurors," 
Bronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the status of the victim was much more exalted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was sort of the universal victim in the way that she could be a surrogate 
for our sisters, our mothers or our wives," said Bronson. "She was white, 
attractive, well-liked . . . so that people in the community could relate."

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER NEW FEES; THOUSAND OAKS: THE ONE-TIME TAX WOULD FORCE 
DEVELOPERS TO PAY PART OF THE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR NEW RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hunting for funds to keep the city running well into the next century, 
Thousand Oaks council members tonight will consider imposing a new layer of 
city fees amounting to a once-only tax on future residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan say it would force developers to pay part of the costs 
of providing services for new residents. The added fees would probably get 
folded into home prices and thereby passed on to newcomers, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 It's either that, Councilman Frank Schillo quipped, or "new residents would 
have to promise never to use our library." 
</P>
<P>
 Developers already fork over considerable cash every time they build a home in 
Thousand Oaks, according to city documents. 
</P>
<P>
 They pay into a fund to build police facilities -- $84 for each single-family 
home. Another $150 per home goes for library improvements. Plus, they ante up 
money for parks, schools, flood control and fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But those fees are designed to pay for capital construction -- not ongoing 
services, Finance Director Bob Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as residents move into a freshly built tract, the city assumes the 
full burden of supplying those new citizens with clean streets, tidy public 
landscaping, a well-stocked library and safe neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' hefty sales-tax income once covered most of these costs. 
Recently, however, the state has successfully swiped money from city coffers. 
In the past four years, state raids have grabbed more than $1 million from the 
general fund, Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thousand Oaks' population predicted to swell by at least 25,000 in the 
next two decades, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski fears a crisis. That's why she 
has led the drive to impose more fees on new development. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a model developed by the city of Lancaster, Zukowski has urged her 
fellow council members to consider adding fees for police protection, library 
operations, road repairs and a host of other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we have much choice," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers, however, strongly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, development fees for capital improvements tack an extra $2,500 to 
$3,500 to the price of the average single-family home in Ventura County, 
according to Dee Zinke, executive director of the regional Building Industry 
Assn. New levies could push home prices up further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous that the city would make the statement that we don't 
pay our fair share," Zinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all, as citizens, have invested in the future of our community," she said. 
"When you talk about fixing potholes, that's a community responsibility. We see 
this (proposal) as one last stab at getting a small number of new residents to 
pay for a heck of a lot, and that seems unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of new fees have also argued that developers will be unable to serve 
low-income residents if their up-front costs soar. And they have suggested that 
big companies might be reluctant to build in Thousand Oaks if their workers 
cannot afford homes nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mayor Alex Fiore offers one simple reason to oppose new fees. "I 
don't think it's workable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-time tax on development could never cover the cost of providing ongoing 
services to new residents, Fiore said, "unless you charge some astronomical fee 
and form an (endowment) that can earn a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has balanced budgets for 30 years based on sales and gas taxes and a 
few other assessments, and Fiore said he feels certain that those revenues will 
keep coming. A development fee, he said, might provide a quick shot in the arm, 
but would not help much in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the (recently approved) Dos Vientos tract," he said. "There's 220 homes. 
If you charged them $1,000 per home, you'd end up with $220,000. That would get 
you three police officers for one year. Then what would you do the next year?" 
</P>
<P>
 But several department heads said they would welcome any budgetary boost, even 
a one-time development fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to increase response capability and manpower as our city continues to 
grow," Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp said. "The increase in calls for service is 
beginning to create some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Before levying a law-enforcement fee, city officials would have to determine 
an appropriate, sustainable level of police service. That exercise alone could 
help, Kemp said, because it would "set a structure for continuing expansion of 
the Police Department as the city grows." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, cities that impose development fees can charge only enough to 
cover the direct cost of serving each new unit. 
</P>
<P>
 To help calculate that formula, City Manager Grant Brimhall has proposed 
establishing a task force and hiring a consultant. The council will vote on 
that recommendation at today's 5 p.m. meeting.

SCHOOL MURAL TO HONOR BOY WHO DIED IN FIRE; SIMI VALLEY: STUDENTS AND PARENTS 
HAVE BEGUN WORK ON PAINTING PROJECT AT MADERA ELEMENTARY WHERE BRANDON BOOKER 
WAS A SECOND-GRADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seven-year-old Brandon Booker will not be forgotten when the classroom bells 
ring on the first day of school this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew of Simi Valley students and parents made certain of that Monday by 
beginning to paint a mural at Madera Elementary School to honor the 
second-grader, who was killed in a house fire in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy died alongside his mother May 17 while both were trying to escape 
their burning Simi Valley home. His father was critically burned while 
attempting to rescue his wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something good has to come out of something tragic," said Brandon's 
godmother, Robin Torreso, one of about a dozen Simi Valley residents painting 
at Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will spend about a week painting a giant blue mustang and blue 
stripes on the campus' four main buildings. Below the mustang, which is the 
school's mascot, will be an inscription dedicating the mural to Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it happened, it was a real shock," said Edee Nimmons, a Simi Valley 
artist and part-time art teacher who designed the mural. "The teachers got 
together and thought it would be nice to do something in memory of the boy." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents solicited financial support from local business owners, who 
have donated paint, supplies, food and drinks for the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 About $600 have also been donated. "We've had really enthusiastic responses," 
Nimmons said. The money will pay for paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, a crew of about 20 volunteers scrubbed campus buildings in 
preparation for the new blue trim near the murals and a blue paint job on 
classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been painted in years," Nimmons said. "It just needed a face-lift." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who knew Brandon lent their muscle to the project Monday, painting 
stripes on whitewashed walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool that everybody would do this for one person," said Tommy 
Brockert, 12, who attended Madera last year and will start the seventh grade at 
nearby Sinaloa Junior High School in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old Zack Marchinsky knew Brandon through the school's "study 
buddy" program, where older students are paired with younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of my good friends," he said. "We used to call him 'fuzz' because 
he had fuzzy hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Zack said when he first found out about the boy's death, he was shocked. "Some 
kids in my class cried," he said. "I almost did too." 
</P>
<P>
 Zack said the students working Monday were thinking about Brandon's death 
while trimming the campus with blue paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about it a lot -- how we miss Brandon," he said. "And we 
wish he could be here. He would have liked it a lot."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BACKERS RALLY TO GET PRINCIPAL REHIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a principal who was fired after challenging his boss for the 
county schools' top job urged county education officials Monday to reconsider 
the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 backers of former Principal Dan Flynn showed up at a county Board of 
Education meeting in Camarillo, with five of them publicly addressing the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to a raucous board meeting last Tuesday, the speakers kept 
their voices low and refrained from personal attacks on county schools Supt. 
Charles Weis. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis has come under fire since abruptly dismissing Flynn, who challenged the 
superintendent for his job in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Thousand Oaks businessman Marty Bates told the board he is 
concerned about how Flynn's contract was terminated on June 22. "My objection 
is the way in which it was handled," Bates said. "I don't believe it was 
handled professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 County school board members thanked Flynn's backers for their comments, but 
took no action Monday night. Previously, they have said the board has no 
authority over the superintendent's personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who worked under Weis for three years, garnered 48% of the vote 
compared to Weis' 51% in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after Weis' victory, the superintendent told Flynn he 
was not renewing his contract, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn has since taken a job with the Los Angeles County Office of Education, 
where he worked before getting the position in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis has defended the firing, saying it was based solely on Flynn's poor job 
performance. But Flynn said he had years of good performance evaluations until 
the last one issued after the June election. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OIL INDUSTRY GROUP GIVES 10 SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A professional organization for the local oil industry has awarded 10 
scholarships worth $1,000 apiece to high school graduates from around Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Petroleum Institute's California Coastal Chapter, which covers 
Ventura County and southern Santa Barbara County, gave the $10,000 in 
scholarships to students to spend at colleges of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 When the institute began its scholarships program in 1985, it targeted 
students who expressed interest in becoming petroleum engineers or taking other 
oil industry jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past several years, the organization has broadened its 
eligibility requirements, said Freddy Daniel, a sales engineer at H&H Oil Tool 
Co. in Santa Paula and vice chairman of the local institute chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the group awards scholarships based on grade-point averages and scholastic 
achievements outside the classroom -- such as at science fairs. "They don't 
have to say I want to grow up to work for Shell Oil Co.," Daniel said. "We 
understand they could take it and turn out to be a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Daniel said, the institute will also make scholarships available to 
students who opt against college in favor of vocational training in welding, 
machine work and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local members of the petroleum institute are not engineers, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that turn the wrenches and turn the valves and flick the switches 
are not engineers," he said. "They're technicians and operators." 
</P>
<P>
 The year's scholarship winners are: Rebecca Crews and Benjamin Cordell of St. 
Bonaventure High School in Ventura; Caleb Coggins of Buena High in Ventura; 
Ryan Firestone of Camarillo High; Daniel Geis of Santa Paula High; Tim Allen of 
Hueneme High in Oxnard; Kristina Spraggins of Nordhoff High in Ojai; and Jordan 
Sickman, Joshua Uretsky and Ryan Gorecki of Moorpark High. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WIGGLY CRITTERS GIVE A LESSON KIDS DIG INTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Third-grader Crystal Sanchez learned last week how to make her own back-yard 
garbage disposal, using squirming red wigglers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know they could eat banana peels," said Crystal, as she picked up a 
red worm from a pile of dirt and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an ongoing countywide program, Crystal and about 20 other children 
from Saticoy Elementary School learned how to do home composting from Toni 
Moran, recycling representative from the Ventura County Solid Waste Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran said county waste officials hope to convert children to recycling their 
kitchen scraps because it saves water and generates topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a 12-gallon box filled with old newspapers, horse manure, kitchen scraps 
and red wigglers, Moran showed students how to use the worms for composting. 
</P>
<P>
 First she laid down a bed of dirt and dampened newspapers, mixed with straw 
and leaves. Then Crystal volunteered to grab a fistful of horse manure to add 
to the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kinda gross, are you sure you want to do it?" Moran asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Crystal scooped up the handful of manure and threw it into the box. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran, who has done about a dozen demonstrations since the program started in 
April, said children are rarely squeamish when it comes to handling manure and 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, when she asked for volunteers to put in worms, a bunch of hands 
shot into the air. Five children grabbed fistfuls of crawling red wigglers and 
put them into the box. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time to feed the worms. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran got out her stash of leftovers -- apple cores, watermelon rinds, coffee 
grinds and eggshells. Then she pulled out a decomposing banana peel. Some of 
the children screwed up their faces and said, "Yeech!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moran waved around the limp banana peel and said reasonably: "Well, we're not 
going to eat it, right? We might as well give it to the worms. Remember, worms 
can eat anything humans eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Moran explained to the group that if they continued to feed the worms 
periodically, the critters would produce waste that would make for good 
topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of your parents have gardens or grow vegetables?" she asked. "This 
will make them grow really big." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 40-minute demonstration, children were given the opportunity 
again to handle the red wigglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Hernandez, 7, of Saticoy, picked up a few red worms and lovingly 
caressed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel weird," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The little boy said he really wants to go home and try some composting, but 
added: "I don't know if my mom will let me. I don't think she likes worms that 
much." PEGGY Y. LEE

 The Civic Arts Plaza will not open for another three months, but already 300 
volunteers have signed up to work as ushers, tour guides and all-around 
helpers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they need reinforcements.The Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza group is 
seeking more volunteers. Members must pay $10 in annual dues and devote their 
time to helping the cultural center run smoothly. For all that work, they do 
get some perks -- ushers can slip into the theater and see shows for free, as 
long as seats are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great opportunity to get involved with the arts in Thousand Oaks," 
said JoAnn Arguelles, who serves as secretary for the group. "We're pretty 
excited that we have so many people -- and we'll use them all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends will hold an introductory meeting 7 p.m. Aug. 4 at City Hall. For 
more information, call Marianne Corney at 496-8688. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Ventura County prosecutors filed felony drug charges Monday against two El 
Monte men in connection with the largest seizure of methamphetamine in the 
county's history, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators seized 14 pounds of the illegal drug, worth an estimated $77,000 
wholesale and $620,000 on the street, said John Marcello, a spokesman for the 
Drug Enforcement Administration.

 The two men, Moises Lepe-Ortiz, 30, and Juan Carlos Llamas, 24, were arrested 
on Thursday after Llamas allegedly tried to sell the methamphetamine to an 
unnamed man outside an apartment complex in the 6200 block of Telegraph Road. 
Lepe-Ortiz was arrested later that night after police served a search warrant 
at his home in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are scheduled to appear Aug. 4 for a preliminary hearing in Ventura 
County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 LLamas was being held in Ventura County jail on $250,000 bail on suspicion of 
possessing and selling methamphetamine. Lepe-Ortiz is being held without bail 
on suspicion of selling methamphetamine and conspiracy to sell methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted the two-month 
investigation along with officers from Ventura, West Covina and Montebello.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; NEW TRASH BINS, HIGHER FEES OKD

 Ventura residents will get a third garbage bin for yard clippings and a bill 
for about $2.18 more per month from their trash collector under a proposal 
approved by the City Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the proposal by a 4-1 vote, with Councilmen Jack 
Tingstrom and Gregory L. Carson abstaining.Councilman Jim Monahan cast the lone 
opposing vote. "I think rates have gone up too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's refuse haulers, E. J. Harrison and Sons, now pick up recyclables 
and non-recyclables every week. But under the new schedule, only 
landfill-destined trash would be picked up every seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 The garbage trucks would rotate collection of the two recyclable waste bins, 
picking up yard clippings one week and other recyclables the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash bills would go up an average of $2.18 per household, city officials say, 
although about a quarter of the residents would actually see a decrease in 
their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is designed to help the city comply with state law requiring 
dramatic decreases in waste sent to landfills. CONSTANCE SOMMER

BUILDERS AND RESIDENTS DEBATE PLANNED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS; GROWTH: CONCERNS 
ABOUT CROWDING, ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE MEET ECONOMIC BENEFITS HEAD-ON.

 Ventura home builders and their potential neighbors packed Ventura City Hall 
on Monday as the City Council prepared to debate late into the night how many 
houses should be built next year and where. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 49 speakers lined up to testify at the council's wooden podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers were there to push the merits of 11 separate construction proposals 
competing for a limited number of housing allocations to be awarded by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Avenue needs is a major catalyst for redevelopment," said Bill Neel 
in a written speech urging council members to give him permission to build 
homes as part of his redevelopment plan for northern Ventura Avenue. "We are 
the catalyst. All we need are allocations and approvals from the city." 
</P>
<P>
 While Neel's neighbors prepared to spar with him over the suitability of his 
plans, east Ventura residents were ready to debate the merits of a 
controversial land-swap proposal that seeks permission to build 437 houses on 
farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaina Fletcher, who lives in a house that would abut the proposed 
development, argued that builder Ron Hertel's project would make dangerous 
inroads into the city's carefully preserved agricultural greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel has proposed to build on land that the city has designated as farmland 
until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll set a precedent," Fletcher said. "It'll open a door to any developer 
from anywhere. Guess what? You open a door, and you can't close it." 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, developers have asked for permission to build 2,600 dwellings. 
But the city's General Plan limits the council to hand out 1,018 housing 
allocations through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members say they would like to dole out far less than that, 
giving perhaps 200 allocations this year and leaving the rest for later. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Hertel's proposal, he has offered to give Ventura $2 million to build a 
regional park on his 94 acres, at the corner of Telephone and Kimball roads, in 
exchange for permission to construct 437 homes on the city's 87-acre lemon 
grove, at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sites are designated by the city to remain as farmland until the year 
2010, and the council would have to amend the city's General Plan before Hertel 
could build a single house. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has captured the imagination of community sports enthusiasts. 
Team organizers held hearings at City Hall on the park concept and are now 
trying to organize a nonprofit corporation that could run a park which would 
include ball fields and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it has also attracted numerous opponents, many of whom are homeowners near 
the proposed development. They are so outraged that they started a ballot 
initiative designed to stop the Hertel development or any others proposed for 
the city's designated greenbelt. The measure would require any project proposed 
in the greenbelt to first receive approval by a majority of city voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council must also grapple with a high-profile proposal to construct 120 
homes on Ventura Avenue, between Stanley Avenue and Seneca Street. Backed by 
Kinko's Service Corp., the development includes plans for an expanded corporate 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is approved, local business owners may sue the city over potential 
environmental problems on the property. If not approved, Kinko's has hinted it 
may leave Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal originally was called the Neel-Huntsinger-Kinko's project. But 
the Huntsinger family dropped out of the deal last week under intensive 
pressure from the owners of neighboring industries who fear a zoning change 
would eventually put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, 14 of these business owners hired environmental attorney 
Glen Reiser, who soon came up with allegations of possible chemical 
contamination on pieces of the Huntsinger property. Days after Reiser 
threatened a lawsuit, the Huntsingers dropped out of the project, saying they 
did not want to anger their longtime neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel family and Kinko's officials, however, vow to press forward with the 
project.

VETERANS FIGHT TO KEEP LOCAL SERVICES OFFICE OPEN

 They filled the front rows of the Ventura County board room Monday night, 
their caps gleaming with medals won in wars past. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to the county supervisors' budget hearing with a simple message: Do 
not close down the county's Veterans Services office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your decisions are not just a matter of dollars and cents, but what is 
morally right," said Daryl G. Johnson, of Camarillo, a veteran of World War II 
and the Korean War. "In times gone by, there was a saying, 'Nothing is too good 
for our boys.' Now it appears that is what they may be getting -- nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 American Legion District Cmdr. Roy Lee Nichols of Camarillo said veterans had 
recovered $1.5 million in claims last year with the help of the county agency. 
"That's money that's used in Ventura County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, county supervisors have considered cutting the Veterans Services 
office when the budget gets tight. 
</P>
<P>
 But in past years, Public Social Services Agency chief James Isom has stood up 
and defended the tiny agency, which helps veterans navigate the bureaucratic 
maze of benefits and services. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's public hearing, Isom delivered a different message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm suggesting that you cut it," he told the board. But he added, "If you cut 
Veterans Services this year, give us time to work with a community-based 
service to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Isom said he believes the program would actually be more stable if a nonprofit 
group took it over. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could save the $116,000 it expects to spend next year. And with 
proper planning, another group, possibly a veterans organization, could take 
over the county's cases and assume the $54,000 in state funding that comes to 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Veterans won't like that," Isom acknowledged. "But if they get the services, 
it won't make any difference where they get the services." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is a perennial target for budget cuts because it is not mandated by 
the state or federal government, as most social service programs are. 
</P>
<P>
 The board cut the agency's staff from six to four employees in 1992. The 
agency was forced to reduce its hours at its Oxnard office and shut down 
satellite services in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Susan Lacey and Maggie Kildee said they attended a meeting with 
United Way officials last week and were hopeful that a nonprofit group, 
bolstered by volunteers, could assume the county's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a $14.7-million deficit, county supervisors are scouring their 
proposed $880-million budget for possible cuts. They begin chopping today.

U.S. MARSHALS SEARCHING FOR MURDER SUSPECT IN OXNARD 
</P>

<P>
 Federal investigators are combing the Oxnard area looking for the third of 
three brothers wanted in connection with the killing of seven people in Mexico 
three years ago, the U.S. Marshal's Service in Los Angeles said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshals already have two of the men in custody on warrants issued in Oaxaca, 
Mexico, last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three provisional arrest warrants were issued July 21 on behalf of Mexico," 
said supervising Deputy Marshal Tom Figmik. "One was already in (Immigration 
Naturalization Service) custody and one we arrested at the Mexican consulate on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we believe the third guy is still in Oxnard," said Figmik, whose office 
is responsible for executing international arrest warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The three brothers, Rigoberto, Eutiquio and Heriberto Gomez-Galicia, are 
accused of killing seven people on Oct. 9, 1991, in the small village of San 
Francisco Higos in the state of Oaxaca, Figmik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a family feud between them and another family," Figmik said. "Most 
of (the victims) were women and children." 
</P>
<P>
 Heriberto Gomez-Galicia is at large, Figmik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two brothers are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles until extradition paperwork is completed, he said. JEFF McDONALD

CAMARILLO MAN GETS FISCAL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime Camarillo resident and waste consultant James M. Jevens has been 
named the city's new economic development director, a post vacated last May 
when Thomas Flavin resigned to accept a similar job with the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Jevens, 56, a former Weldon Canyon project manager for Waste Management Inc. 
would assume his new duties Aug. 1, if the City Council approves his hiring as 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be paid $1,875 for 25 hours of work a month on an 11-month contract, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about this city's prospects," said Jevens, a 30-year city 
resident. "I think we have a lot to offer the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jevens no longer works for Waste Management, he acts as consultant for 
Taconic Resources of San Diego County, a partnership backing a controversial 
ballot measure to change Weldon Canyon's zoning to allow a landfill to be built 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no conflict of interest whatsoever," Jevens said Monday."Once the 
election is over, so will be my consulting relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, who sat on the committee that 
recommended Jevens' appointment, said she and Councilman David Smith questioned 
Jevens at length about his consulting for Taconic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, initially, there was a lot of concern and that concern was centered on 
whether or not he would become a full-time employee of Taconic if the ballot 
measure was passed," Craven said. "But he said his job is to introduce 
(Taconic) officials to people in Ventura County, and once the election is over 
that would be it. We have no reason to doubt his word." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said she and Smith are also recommending Jevens because of his long 
residency and civic leadership. She pointed to Jevens' role as a former 
Camarillo Chamber of Commerce president and to his continuing role as a member 
of the Camarillo Boys & Girls Club board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the city and he can sell it," Craven said. "He knows what kind of 
industries we're hoping to attract and which ones we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the appointment at its meeting Wednesday. The 
meeting will start at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

PRESERVING WETLANDS

 Recently I took my three children on a field trip to the Ormond Beach 
wetlands. The children are learning about California least terns, snowy 
plovers, red-necked stilts, black-ring necks, brown pelicans and the many other 
varieties of wildlife that inhabit the Ormond/Hueneme Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to ensure that this will be here for my children to show their 
children. It is a quiet spot in a hectic world, where one can slow down, learn 
and seek to live alongside nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't this area be developed into a children's park and nature 
area/educational center? I can envision a boardwalk with benches and railings, 
informational panels to educate and perhaps binoculars to allow close-up 
viewing of the wildlife. I think there is a wonderful opportunity being missed 
here.

SCHOOL PARCEL FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-acre parcel of land that Oxnard officials are looking to purchase for a 
school and a park has been found to be contaminated with DDT and other 
agricultural pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 A consulting firm hired by the Rio School District, which plans to lease part 
of the land from the city for a school, discovered residue from pesticides used 
to grow strawberries -- including DDT -- on the property three weeks ago, said 
Gary Mortimer, director of school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district plans to have the consultant, Earth Systems of Ventura, 
examine the land more thoroughly to determine the extent of contamination, 
Mortimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis is expected to take 30 to 40 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel is part of the city project that includes swapping 20 acres for 
adjacent land to build a low-cost housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said city officials had been unaware of the 
contamination because they had not received an environmental report from owner 
Donald T. Kojima as required by their contract of sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig said he was not surprised or concerned by the discovery because 
pesticide use was very common in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This to me is routine," he said. "If the property has been farmed, I would be 
surprised if it wasn't there. The cleanup in my opinion of that substance is 
very feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig added that he doesn't expect the finding of pesticides to further delay 
the already protracted negotiations. Kojima will be required to pay for any 
possible cleanup before the sale is completed, Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima, who Mortimer said is aware of the contamination, could not be reached 
for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 His property has been the center of a bitter dispute since city officials 
pledged to move farm workers out of a slum and into city-subsidized housing two 
years ago. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

LIBRARY FUNDING CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are seeing a great institution -- the public library -- wither away for 
lack of public funds. Politicians heeding the cry for more police, jails, etc. 
are neglecting to cherish and support this institution that offers lifelong 
education and opportunity for people of all ages and that can be a positive 
preventive force in keeping children away from criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors debating how to allot dwindling funds must be urged to 
continue and even to increase funding for the County Library System. And cities 
should be urged to accept a greater share of the real costs of running and 
providing background support for the branches that benefit the cities in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years money that traditionally funded our libraries has been 
pulled away by the state. Without this base and without the contribution from 
the General Fund that county supervisors made last year, we would have 
practically no library service in the county jurisdictions. As it is, staffing 
is meager, hours open are pitiful, particularly for the best resource library 
in the system -- Foster Library -- and money for the purchase of new materials 
is practically nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts at private fund-raising have helped augment the collections but can't 
begin to meet the ongoing costs of providing library service and materials. A 
statewide attempt to pass a bill (SB 1448-Roberti), which would allow 
localities to propose benefit assessment financing for libraries and which 
would require notification before assessments are imposed, may offer some 
future hope. But those of us who love libraries should let our supervisors and 
city councils know we want them to adequately fund our financially strapped 
county libraries now.

 During June we attended three graduations of grandchildren, one in Austin, 
Tex., one in Dallas, and one in Ojai.The two in Texas started with prayer and 
the one in California gave a poem about a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a complete shock to us. Then we read the article about prayer at 
Buena High in Ventura and all the problems it caused. People today need to read 
the U. S. Constitution. It guarantees freedom of religion not freedom from

COUNCIL POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Week by week voting by the Thousand Oaks City Council frames the election of 
Nov. 7. We who watch, in person, on Channel 10, or in the press are both 
fascinated and exasperated by the rigid majority/minority interplay and 
standoff.The majority of Fiore, Schillo and Lazar proudly supports, for 
example, the financially insecure Civic Arts Plaza, the Dos Vientos 
development, and the push to sell municipal bonds to support upgrading of 
private real estate developments -- the Janss Mall and Sears. This last device 
resembles the linking of public and private financing -- and risks -- in the 
Civic Arts Plaza machinations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Civic Arts Plaza enterprise we see the rising shadow of a giant white 
elephant. Any present reasonable prediction indicates that this heavy feeder 
can require a yearly nurturing of $10 million or more of public funding to stay 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 While we deal with this threat as a united city, overlooking for the time 
being who or what caused the problem, we must use more common sense in 
protecting our financial health as well as our admired lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 With these items, the three-person majority on the council is sticking to its 
guns. The more cautious stand of the constant minority of Zeanah and Zukowsky 
is more wary of risking public money and credit. They are additionally dubious 
about encouraging rapid development in the Conejo Valley. And this division is 
far more than mere style. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 7 will give Thousand Oaks voters opportunity to back the rigid pattern of 
council voting and perhaps unfreeze the thinking. We have a responsibility to 
study with care the voting patterns of council members. This responsibility 
cannot be ducked by voters.

STUDENT IS MOURNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a librarian at Conejo Valley High School where Jackie Reay was one of my 
favorite students.She liked to read and was smart, funny, temperamental, 
outgoing and even ambitious. She had a future. 
</P>
<P>
 This is addressed to every person who saw her boyfriend with a gun and said or 
did nothing: You are equally responsible for Jackie's death; you kept silent 
and she is dead. If you see someone showing off a gun, tell someone. Until you 
and your peers decide that it is not cool to dress, talk and act like gang 
members, this B.S. will never stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Reay deserved more. What are you going to do about it?

'SEX RESPECT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We so appreciate the article about the County Women's Commission study on teen 
pregnancy and their encouraging recommendation of sexual abstinence education. 
</P>
<P>
 Of further encouragement was the finding of a federally funded study of an 
abstinence program called "Sex Respect," under a grant from Title XX and funded 
by the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, a division of the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services. The study again proved that abstinence 
education does work. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow-up studies of 3,500 students who took the Sex Respect course and a 
comparison group showed considerably lower pregnancy rates one and two years 
after participation as compared to the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
 We shouldn't be surprised. Kids want to know that not everyone is doing it. 
Unfortunately, too many of our youth learn their values from TV sitcoms and 
have come to believe that promiscuity is normal and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Glad for the hope that this may change, despite Hollywood. 
</P>

<P>
 We were so pleased to read about the Teen Pregnancy Committee's report to the 
Ventura County supervisors. It was especially encouraging to read that 
abstinence education is to be promoted. But will it really? 
</P>
<P>
 Too often the abstinence message from "safe-sex" professionals is: "Abstinence 
is best, but teen sex is inevitable: Use a condom." Not very persuasive, we'd 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully there are some excellent programs that actually teach abstinence. 
"Teen-Aid," "Choices," "Reasonable Reasons to Wait" and "Sex Respect" are just 
a few that help kids make good sexual decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Bennett started a curriculum in Washington, D.C., no less, to help 
inner-city youth remain abstinent until graduation from high school. In seven 
years, only one girl has become pregnant following the "Best Friends" program. 
This shows what can be accomplished when children have the right kind of 
support from their elders and peers.

VETERAN DECRIES PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They spat at me when I returned from Vietnam in 1967. I fought for my country 
and they called me a baby killer.Excuse the deja vu, but I feel like it's 1967 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors propose to tell the county's 72,000 
veterans and their dependents "we don't need you now. We got what we wanted, 
but it's the budget, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors plan to close the Veteran's Service Office and eliminate 
the four staff positions there. The Veteran's Office had its staff cut 33% two 
years ago and again the supervisors are trying to make veterans carry an unfair 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 By attempting to save pennies by closing services to veterans, the Board of 
Supervisors could put the nail in the coffin at Point Mugu and force its 
transfer to China Lake. Would the base at Port Hueneme close? Are four 
positions at the county Veteran's Office worth the risk of this slap in the 
face to the military and the loss of thousands of jobs? I think not.

BUS RIDERS SCRAMBLE TO FIND TRANSIT; STRIKE: THOUSANDS ARE CAUGHT OFF GUARD ON 
THE FIRST DAY OF THE JOB ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All day long, people waited for buses that never came. Expectant riders peered 
longingly down the San Fernando Valley's long, straight streets, biding their 
time by reading books, taking naps, pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they realized that their bus was not merely late again -- but wasn't 
coming at all -- some swore off public transportation for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean it's not coming?" said Andy Ridgely with a scowl. The 
34-year-old plumber from Reseda was trying to make his way home after a long 
night of wrestling bathroom pipes in other people's houses. "Jeez, no warning 
or nothing. That's the last bus I'll ever take. Bet on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgely is one of the 60,000 Valley residents who depend on MTA buses for 
transportation each day and were forced to change their transit plans with 
little or no notice Monday morning after bus drivers agreed late Sunday night 
to honor a strike by bus mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Along some of the Valley's busiest thoroughfares -- including Reseda, Roscoe 
and Ventura boulevards -- the transit agency ferried passengers in yellow 
school buses for free because the vehicles lacked fare collection boxes. On its 
Van Nuys Boulevard route, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority used their 
own buses -- and charged 50 cents, instead of the normal $1.10. 
</P>
<P>
 On the strike's first day, there was no outbreak of panic, and when people 
realized there would be no buses, most simply went back home and made other 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did seem as if everyone was running a little late: Moms walked their 
kids to day care; business meetings were put on hold; people dusted off rarely 
used bicycles, and school was skipped altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 9 a.m., a small cluster of prospective passengers stood at the 
corner of Vanowen Street and Reseda Boulevard, waiting for a bus to take them 
through Reseda and into Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Valencia, 28, was already an hour late to his job at the El Indio 
restaurant, several miles away. Soledad Rodriguez, on the other hand, needed to 
go just two miles to a post office. But, said the 65-year-old, "for me, that 
might as well be 10 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance away, in Van Nuys, Maria Flores, 33, and her 5-year-old son, 
Phillip, were running two hours late for an appointment at a job training 
center, where Maria hoped to find a secretarial or clerical job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to call the (MTA) number to find out what buses were running, but it 
was busy all morning," said Flores. "Now, I'll have to see if any friends will 
give me a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky enough to get a ride on one of the Valley's seven emergency bus 
lines did not complain about the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding in one of the yellow school buses the MTA had pressed into service for 
the strike, a group of passengers quietly looked out at Sherman Way as they 
headed east toward Van Nuys. The consensus was that even though the bus had no 
air conditioning, and precious little leg room, it was still a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 People smiled at the driver. He smiled back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not been on one of these buses since grade school," free-lance 
photographer Donald Sausen told the driver, stepping off the bus at Van Nuys 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safest thing on the road," answered the driver, who declined to give his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, passenger Jimmy Lamb, 32, was one of a minority of riders who 
didn't even mind the leisurely pace of the substitute buses: He had a court 
date with a judge, and because he was already late, he was not in a great hurry 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to tell the judge?" asked Lamb, who said he had been trying 
to get to the Van Nuys Courthouse from his Canoga Park home since 8 a.m. -- two 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say it was because of the strike," suggested Michael Bammerlan, 25, 
sitting nearby. "They've got to know people would have problems getting 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever been to court, man?" Lamb asked. "The judge don't care nothing about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bammerlan watched as Lamb walked down the aisle and exited the bus, 
complaining every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," Bammerlan joked, "this is definitely an E-ticket ride." On the routes 
where buses weren't running, people would have paid plenty for such a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, you know, maybe the bus was late, so I dozed off for awhile," said 
Emory Morris, who by 9 a.m. had waited for a bus on busless Victory Boulevard 
in Van Nuys for nearly two hours. "I guess this means I missed my doctor's 
appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, a few miles away at Sepulveda and Roscoe boulevards, 
Laura Rios, 20, of Van Nuys, was checking her watch, now edging toward half 
past 9. "I have to be at work at 10," said Rios, who works at a McDonald's 
restaurant in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Morris, Rios hadn't dozed. But like him, she said she hadn't heard 
about the strike either. "No wonder there's no bus," she said, in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, she made up her mind. "Ya me voy," she said. "I'm going home." 
And she did. 
</P>
<P>
 But a bad day for bus commuters was a good day for taxi cab drivers. Some even 
circled the block at particularly busy bus stops, not minding that they were 
the bearers of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, (the strike) might be bad news to the bus riders, but not to the taxi 
drivers," said Belinda Esnayra, a public service agent for Checker Cab Co., 
whose business shot up 40% during Monday morning's commute. "It's amazing how 
many people depend on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a cab did not ensure punctuality. During morning rush hour, the wait 
for a taxi was often more than an hour. And cab rates were in a different 
league from bus fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerardo Mendez, a security guard at the Van Nuys Metrolink train station, who 
usually rides the bus to work from Echo Park, instead took a cab, setting him 
back $35. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mendez was plenty busy once he arrived at the station, finding the station 
platform crowded with dozens of strike-stranded riders. The 7:23 a.m. train, 
for instance, usually draws 60 to 70 passengers. On Monday, he said, more than 
150 people waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had almost 300 people on four trains," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking full advantage of the strike to try to lure Valley bus riders -- 
perhaps permanently -- Metrolink added three round-trip trains between Los 
Angeles and Chatsworth on its Ventura County Line. The additions also mark the 
first time that trains are running from Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley 
during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Dan Masiello of Panorama City caught one of the special reverse 
trains headed to Chatsworth. Masiello, a broker who works in Warner Center, 
usually catches two buses in the morning. But he decided not to risk trying to 
catch a substitute bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't feeling lucky," he said as he fed $2.25 into the ticket machine. 
"This is my first time. For all I know, it may be more convenient for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Aaron Curtiss, Sam Enriquez and Beth Shuster also 
contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 * MAIN STORY: A1 Valley Emergency Bus Routes 
</P>
<P>
 For the duration of the strike, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has 
established emergency service on seven of the San Fernando Valley's busiest 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer buses on those lines, however, and MTA officials cautioned 
passengers to expect to wait twice as long as usual between buses. For example, 
they said, if a bus normally reaches a particular stop every 20 minutes, buses 
on the emergency lines will probably arrive up to 40 minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses also run shorter hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. only. All buses on the 
Valley routes are free except those on the Van Nuys Boulevard line, which cost 
50 cents.

DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY; EDUCATORS GRAPPLE WITH BEST WAY TO PREPARE KIDS FOR 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the experts are correct, half of the children in Karen Schain's sixth-grade 
class at Valerio Street Elementary School in Van Nuys are on their way to 
careers as well-paid technicians and managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest -- now eager, curious 11- and 12-year-olds -- face a life of work as 
minimum-wage clerks when they graduate from high school in the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 As jobs change, warn economists and educators, so must job training. Public 
schools, once seen as the uniquely American way to instill uniform culture and 
academic training, are increasingly being judged on their ability to train 
large numbers of kids for a future that may not include college. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present, we are not preparing our kids for the kind of society we are 
going to live in," said elementary school principal Carole Kennedy, a board 
member of the National Assn. of Elementary School Principals. "In most school 
districts, that's not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his own study, James Catterall, a professor of education at UCLA, 
predicts that in six years more than half of the jobs will be in areas 
typically requiring only a high school education. And although only 25% of 
available jobs are likely to require a college degree, about 35% of students 
will have a diploma from a four-year institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics fuel a growing debate over college preparation, vocational 
education and how schools can best prepare students for a future workplace that 
is uncertain and changing, particularly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing in the world is you could have a child who decides not to go 
to college, but who has no knowledge and no skill in any other area," Schain 
said. She added that "99.9% of the teachers in this district are trying 
desperately hard to get these kids ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Schain's sixth-graders sat in their portable classroom, 
surrounded by brightly colored placards with aphorisms such as, "In his dreams, 
even the smallest kitten can be a tiger!" and thought aloud about what they 
want to be when they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Karo, 11, wants to be an engineer because he likes working on his family's 
computer. Amalia, 10, wants to be a teacher. Georgiana, 11, wants to be the 
first female President. And Luis, 12, wants to be an astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to study the planets," Luis said. "They have a lot of moons and some 
of the moons have radiation and craters." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they wait for their few minutes on the classroom's one 
computer (which is more than some classes have, Schain said) and talk about 
careers in terms of choosing academic paths and exploring the prerequisites of 
various jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to keep kids on track, the Los Angeles Unified School District is 
pushing more work-based learning programs, according to Jim Konantz, the 
director of career development for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 One model used is a federal Department of Labor report that concluded three 
years ago that schools need to do a better job. "More than half our young 
people leave school without the knowledge or foundation required to find and 
hold a good job," according to the report by the Commission on Achieving 
Necessary Skills titled "What Work Requires of Schools." According to the 
report, "young people will pay a very high price. They face the bleak prospects 
of dead-end work interrupted only by periods of unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 To become competent workers, the study concluded, students need the ability to 
identify, organize, plan and allocate resources; the ability to work with 
others; to be able to acquire and use information; to understand, monitor, 
improve and correct social, organizational and technological systems, and the 
ability to work with different kinds of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Translating those goals into the classroom involves more work-based learning 
programs, according to Konantz. The idea is that in addition to learning good 
work habits and interpersonal skills, students can learn practical applications 
of their classroom work and then bring their real-world experience back to the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the Youth Service Academy, in which 600 of LAUSD's most at-risk 
students participated, Konantz said. The school day was lengthened, curriculum 
was changed to reflect work skills, and students got real jobs in city 
departments after class. 
</P>
<P>
 After one semester at work, students improved their grades, Konantz said, from 
225 grades of A to 400. Failing marks fell from 200 to 100, then virtually 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example, according to Konantz, is the creation at 25 high schools of 
career-cluster programs, or high school majors, such as math, business, 
engineering, languages, child development, travel-tourism and humanities. Each 
career cluster offers revamped vocational-type training in which students learn 
basic skills like writing and math in the context of learning about the chosen 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 All students need reading and writing skills, Konantz maintained. But if they 
can learn those skills by reading technical manuals and writing data summaries, 
all the better. Sometime around the turn of the century, he said, all Los 
Angeles students will choose a career cluster by the time they enter ninth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a system that tends to push people along to higher and higher degree 
levels," Catterall said. "What's happened over the last 30 or 40 years is that 
we've raised the credentials required for given jobs -- a sort of credential 
inflation. At the same time, anyone looking at the meaning of a high school 
diploma or a college degree has expressed dissatisfaction with what those 
levels tend to produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all are convinced that practical education is the definitive answer. 
Programs like the career-cluster major, already in place in Oregon high 
schools, have been criticized as a return to tracking, forcing students to make 
early decisions that will affect the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians point to the turn of the century, when tracking was first 
introduced largely in response to growing numbers of immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 But as industry changed and technology bounded beyond the reach of the 
schools' ability to keep up, vocational training increasingly fell into 
disfavor, according to Catterall. By the 1970s and 1980s, policy-makers 
targeted the vocational/technical track as one in which undertrained teachers 
taught low-achieving students on out-of-date equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But as an increasingly intolerant economy gives newcomers little breathing 
room and the level of students' interest in their education continues to 
plummet, experts from the federal government on down to teachers say that 
well-tuned vocational training ought to be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't you teach reading by technological books?" asked Kennedy of the 
National Assn. of Elementary School Principals and the principal of the New 
Haven Accelerated School in Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools are more worried about next year's achievement tests than about 
the next century's work force, said John Hall, an elementary school counselor 
and the former district coordinator for elementary school counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Being charged with such a responsibility, he said, is simply overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valerio, Schain schedules each student for a 15- to 20-minute turn each 
week on the classroom's old-model Apple computer, in lieu of computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 She borrows microscopes to show them. She takes them on field trips to area 
businesses. She asks guest speakers to come in and talk about how they got 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She has faith, she said, that she sends her children off knowing she did the 
best she could. 
</P>
<P>
 Catterall, however, said he is worried that the best the schools can do might 
not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not particularly optimistic that our educational system will change 
significantly in the directions that we say and believe are necessary," he 
said. "If we do achieve significant change, it will be somewhat unprecedented 
and a wonderful surprise."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT PLANS WILL BE DISCUSSED AT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Burbank Airport Authority will hold a public hearing about the effects of 
proposed expansion plans on surrounding neighborhoods at 6 p.m. Wednesday at 
the Burbank Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the authority announced plans to expand facilities from 
168,000 square feet to approximately 360,000 square feet by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 An Environmental Impact Report was prepared and certified in 1993. But since 
that time, the expansion plan has proceeded far from smoothly, and its future 
is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 After the authority certified the environmental report, Burbank homeowners and 
the city of Los Angeles filed suit against the authority, claiming the report 
did not accurately describe the possible traffic and noise problems that could 
result from expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, the court ordered the Airport Authority to prepare a 
Subsequent Environmental Impact Report, taking into account possible traffic 
and noise effects of expansion. The new report was released to the public in 
June, but some homeowners still are unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the airport is an asset at the size that it is," said Carolyn 
Berlin, president of the Verdugo-Magnolia Park Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people protesting the expansion, she said, "feel that at some point, the 
airport will become a liability." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see quiet residential neighborhoods infested by hordes of 
people," said Ted McConkey, president of Burbank Rancho Homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem with the expansion, say homeowners, is increased noise. "The 
airport has consistently taken the position that they don't have the money to 
soundproof schools and residences," McConkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Authority said expansion plans include the soundproofing of four 
schools. One school already has been soundproofed, said Tom Greer, the 
authority's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer said the homeowners' concerns about increased noise and traffic will not 
occur because of airport expansion, but because of increased use of the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion plan anticipates a projected passenger total of 5.5 million by 
1998. "Quite frankly," Greer said, "we're probably hitting 5 million passengers 
this year." In 1993, 4.3 million people used the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's hearing, the Airport Authority must decide whether to study 
the matter further or to certify both the environmental reports together. A 
final decision on the expansion plan is expected by mid-August. JAMES ELMENDORF

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; EVENT TARGETS PROSTITUTION PROBLEM

<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you make a prostitute see the light? 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask Romana Catton, she may well tell you to throw a party. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what members of Catton's Chisholm Estates neighborhood watch did 
Sunday, holding a community block party that raised $318 for the group's 
prostitution prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by a raffle, the funds will allow homeowners to buy 10 floodlights 
to discourage prostitutes from plying their trade in front of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lights go on at dark and stay on until dusk, and the girls don't park 
where there are lights," Catton said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a bluegrass band and international food creating a jubilant atmosphere 
along Hart and Firmament avenues, the event lured about 150 residents. But 
Catton credited the Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch with much of the 
raffle's success. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 merchants along Sepulveda Boulevard donated $10 to $30 gift 
certificates for groceries, dinners for two, printing and automotive repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we were very surprised and very pleased to see how the businesses 
are willing to work with us because they feel like a part of the community," 
Catton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catton received a plaque from neighborhood block captains for her work 
bringing security patrols and other crime-fighting tools to her neighborhood, 
which is situated just off Sepulveda Boulevard, a major thoroughfare for drug 
dealers and prostitutes. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; TALKS PLANNED TO AID YOUNG BLACK MEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A program to bring together teen-age African Americans with adult male role 
models will be launched Thursday night at Pacoima United Methodist Church with 
a six-week series of talks on black men in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get into the lives of young men who have no positive male model in 
their lives, then maybe we can divert them from the negative role models they 
see, the drug dealer or the bank robber," said Garth Gilliam, a former 
aerospace engineer now studying for a degree in urban ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam is a newly named community developer in the United Methodist Church's 
San Fernando Valley Shalom Zone Project, an effort to aid blacks and Latinos in 
the Valley in acquiring tutorial assistance, job training and skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmen Rah, professor of black history at Compton College, will talk on "The 
Black Man in Antiquity" at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Pacoima church at 12550 Van 
Nuys Blvd. Other topics include the black man in the Bible and in recent 
history. Food will be served each of the six Thursday nights. There is no 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program itself will be uplifting for anyone who wants to come," Gilliam 
said, "but we are especially welcoming young black men who don't have positive 
male role models in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam said the male mentoring program calls for linkups between adults and 
teens for fishing trips, career development and eventually a recreational 
program. JOHN DART

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; GRANTS TO HELP NEW BUYERS FIX UP HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has approved a new program in 
North Hollywood that provides grants of up to $7,500 to first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite objections from its public advisory panel, the agency also 
approved $20,000 for refurbishing the landmark El Portal Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending approval by the Los Angeles City Council, the agency's Residential 
Incentive Grant Program will help boost the appearance of the 740-acre North 
Hollywood Redevelopment Project area by allowing first-time buyers in that area 
to receive up to $7,500 to upgrade their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a difference in preserving the neighborhood and stabilizing it," 
said Lillian Burkenheim, project manager for the North Hollywood-area CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA is a city agency created in 1979 to remove blight and spur investment. 
Since its inception, the agency has spent or pledged more than $61 million to 
bring in about 900 new housing units, a $12-million shopping center and the 
$45-million private/public Academy Entertainment and Business Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkenheim said the grant program has been in South-Central Los Angeles for 
two years. Those interested in the program are required to attend a free 
home-buying seminar, and can call (800) 925-CRA2 for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the agency's board of directors last Thursday approved a $20,000 
loan to Actors Alley, which is refurbishing the El Portal, a 1926 vaudeville 
theater on Lankershim Boulevard. The agency has already loaned $250,000 for the 
theater's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional $20,000 is part of $72,500 needed to provide new cement-based 
footings and improve access for people with disabilities, Burkenheim said. 
Actors Alley has already raised $52,500 of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came over the objections of the agency's community advisory 
panel, which voted against the idea because representatives felt the agency 
needed to allocate more funds to other repertory groups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a compromise, Burkenheim said CRA officials decided to make the additional 
$20,000 a short-term loan payable within three years, beginning three months 
after the El Portal Theatre reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening could take another year because of earthquake damage. The Small 
Business Administration has agreed to loan Actors Alley $1.47 million to repair 
the damage. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; A HUMBLE WIN IN MARTIAL ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with their many victories at the Taekwondo U.S. Junior Olympic 
Championships in Chicago, David Howell, head instructor at Twin Dragon Martial 
Arts in West Hills, was just as proud at the humility they showed in winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our kids to be gracious winners as well as gracious losers," said 
Howell. But with the way they won, Howell's kids needed a lot of humility. 
</P>
<P>
 The club came home from the championship a week ago with 13 gold medals, seven 
silver and four bronze. Two of the students were double gold medal winners, and 
all but three of the students in the national competition came home with a 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
 They did better than any other school at the championships, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwon Sung Choi, president of the California Taekwondo Assn., is master of the 
Palos Verdes Taekwondo club, where his students won just as many gold and 
silver medals, and two fewer bronze. Only by combining that medal count with 
his students from his other club in Torrance had they done better in a medal 
count, said Choi, whose students also included a national black belt champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetest taste of victory for the Twin Dragon students came when they were 
allowed to dig into soda, ice cream, and candy -- all of which had been banned 
for the past five months under a strict training regimen. Such artificial 
treats give an unnatural rush of energy during a workout and eliminating sweets 
gave the kids a better chance at building endurance, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed Snickers," said Lauren Radel, 11, a Twin Dragon silver medal winner, 
who headed for the candy machine as soon as the competition was over. "I had to 
have my Snickers bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Larsen, 10, who won two gold medals in the competition, did not miss 
the soda because she likes drinking juices anyway. "I celebrated with a big, 
king-sized Hershey's bar right after I won," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt pretty good," Larsen said of her win. "Actually, it was really 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Pushed for further superlatives, Larsen described her first national win as 
"fun . . . good . . . cool." Although she and Radel said they were just trying 
to do their best and not worry about winning or losing. Larsen said she wants 
to compete in the Olympics someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were humble in their reactions to people," Howell said. "But inside you 
could tell they were very proud. You could see the impact it had on these 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Tae kwon do, a form of martial arts started in Korea 2,500 years ago, has been 
in the Junior Olympics for 14 years and recently became an Olympic sport. In 
the Junior Olympics, kids age 7 to 16 compete within their age, weight and 
experience categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twin Dragon students were among 450 competitors from California, which, as 
a state, had the largest number of gold medal winners at the championships, 
Junior Olympic officials said. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CENTERS OFFER TIPS TO LIMIT QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free workshops on practical ways to reduce damage to homes from future 
earthquakes will be held at Earthquake Service Centers throughout the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Four workshops, including one in Spanish, will be held at each of the 10 
centers operated jointly throughout the Los Angeles Basin by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workshops will demonstrate practical and effective ways that people can 
strengthen their homes against the next earthquake," Jack Eldridge, deputy 
federal coordinating officer for mitigation, said in a written statement. "We 
want to help people take action now to reduce or prevent future losses." 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions will be divided into three areas: renters, non-structural 
mitigation such as securing water heaters and overhead fixtures, and structural 
mitigation such as methods to strengthen walls and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the non-structural sessions will be held in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions will be held Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information is available by calling the Disaster Hotline, (800)

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SENIORS FOR ACTION PUSH HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the debate over a national health care plan enters the final stretch, one 
of the San Fernando Valley's most influential senior citizen lobbying groups 
has set its sights instead on a statewide proposition to provide Medicare-type 
coverage to all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably support a national health plan," said Belle Palmer, past 
president of the Sherman Oaks-based Seniors For Action. "But we're not so 
enthusiastic about any of them, because they don't do away with health 
insurance companies. Until that happens, there's not going to be any reform in 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors For Action, which has drawn visits from U.S. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala, consumer activist Ralph Nader and other big-name 
speakers, supports a single-payer system, in which health care for Californians 
would be covered mostly outside the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the clamor over competing national plans, the California Health Security 
Act has received relatively little attention despite a successful drive to 
collect more than 1 million signatures to place it on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others begin a cross-country bus 
tour to stir support for a national health plan, Palmer and other members of 
Seniors For Action are writing letters and organizing seminars in support of 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan would give every citizen a card for guaranteed health care. 
Although the costs have not been determined, the proposal has been criticized 
by the insurance industry and opponents of government-run health care. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the act would boost the state's income tax by 2.5% for most 
Californians, add $1 to the price of a pack of cigarettes and require payroll 
taxes of 4.4% to 8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would eliminate costly premiums in employer, auto, home and other types 
of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that California will set a trend for the rest of the country," Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially if there no national plan is approved, we feel that other states 
will follow suit." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; CHILD-CARE CENTER AT TRAIN DEPOT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city zoning administrator granted final approval to the Los Angeles 
Department of Transportation on Monday to construct a child-care center and 
historic depot at the Chatsworth Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good project," said associate zoning administrator Horace 
Tramel at a public hearing at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club. "I think it will 
encourage the use of rapid transit." The 12,700-square-foot center will provide 
day care for up to 90 children, giving priority to parents who ride Metrolink 
and other mass transit. In addition, the zoning administrator approved a 
variance for construction of a 4,000-square-foot office space in the train 
station depot. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of its kind in Los Angeles County, the project faced no community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real community project," said Francine Oschin, legislative deputy to 
Councilman Hal Bernson. "Even the most vocal opponents of everything in 
Chatsworth are behind this." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to indoor and outdoor space for children age 6 months to 5 years, 
the center will house office and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner it can be up and running, the happier we will be," Oschin said at 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The design of the depot recalls Chatsworth's original Southern Pacific 
Station, which was torn down in the early part of this century. The depot will 
replace a platform and canopy which opened at the station on 21510 Devonshire 
St. in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 400 commuters who use the Chatsworth station each day, the majority 
park at the station and take the train to Simi Valley, department of 
transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The others arrive at the station from locations outside the San Fernando 
Valley and take taxis to their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care center will operate from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday through 
Friday. Project planners expect to break ground on the center before summer's 
end and predict that the day-care center could be in operation as early as the 
spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar project for the Sylmar Metrolink station is in the planning stages.

 The New Age is coming to the old schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles middle school and high school students will be taught relaxation 
techniques to reduce stress and increase their motivation, as part of a 
five-year, $850,000 grant announced this month by the Woodland Hills-based 
Wellness Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details -- such as which schools will be involved -- have not been 
set, the pilot program may involve a scenario such as the following: 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher takes a break from her regular math or English class and arranges 
the desks in a semicircle. She sits with her students for five minutes of 
"quiet time." She then asks them to imagine being in a quiet, familiar place in 
which they feel safe and comfortable. As a group, the teacher and students 
breathe deeply. They visualize relaxing scenes. They practice concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is to get kids to slow down a little," said Erin Martin, a 
spokeswoman for the Boston-based Mind/Body Medical Institute, which developed 
the program. "It helps them feel at ease with each other and with their 
teachers. It also helps the teacher relax." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as this fall, about 80 teachers will be trained to conduct the 10- to 
15-minute relaxation periods, which have been used on a trial basis in 
Massachusetts and New York. More details are expected to be announced within 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers of the program hope that teaching such relaxation techniques will 
make students more attentive and help decrease fights, outbursts in class and 
other behavioral problems at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Foundation -- one of the nation's largest -- also announced a 
grant of $345,000 to Students Run L.A., a program to help "at-risk" students 
train for the Los Angeles Marathon. KURT PITZER

LOTTO WINNER PLANS TO STAY ON THE JOB

 With many of the trappings of the rich life his for the taking, from 
penthouses to Rolls Royces to round-the-world cruises, Tony Mastello on Monday 
redeemed the state lottery ticket that won him $7.6 million and headed back to 
work at his print shop. 
</P>
<P>
 He will go on working because he likes to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to do anything, but I like what I'm doing," said Mastellos, 61, 
owner of Tony's Graphics and Printing. "It's a comfortable, easy business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my feeling is if I go traveling, playing golf, I can't do this 
every day. I need something to do. I enjoy what I do. I can't see giving it up. 
Old habits are hard to break. It's actually hard to comprehend that I don't 
have to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mastellos said he tossed and turned for most of Sunday night after he learned 
he held the winning number, pondering whether to close the shop he has owned 
since 1965. Along with his satisfaction with his work, "I still have a 
responsibility to my clients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A regular lottery player who bought $5 worth of tickets every Friday, 
Mastellos said he plans to use his winnings to fund the college educations of 
his nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 20 years, he will receive annual payments of $389,000, reduced 
to $280,080 by withholding to cover part of his federal income tax. There is no 
state income tax on lottery winnings, and at the current top federal income-tax 
rate of more than 39%, he will clear about $233,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastellos bought his winning Quick Pick Super Lotto ticket at a 7-Eleven store 
at 1133 E. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning numbers -- 25, 29, 32, 33, 36 and 39 -- were announced Saturday 
night, but Mastellos did not know the results of the drawing until he saw the 
winning number in The Times the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether buying Super Lotto tickets was the most fortuitous move of 
his life, Mastellos paused and responded, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having five daughters was the luckiest thing I ever did."

MAN HELD IN SHOOTING OF CHILD PLEADS NOT GUILTY

 A man accused of wounding a 3-year-old girl while shooting at her mother 
pleaded not guilty Monday to attempted murder charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manolo Cienfuegos, 24, of Tujunga faces a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court on Aug. 3.He is being held in County Jail on $2.1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries received by the child, Vanessa Barcenas, were not life-threatening, 
and she is recovering, police said. She was shot Thursday afternoon outside the 
Saticoy Plaza apartment complex in Reseda. Police said the apparent motive was 
an ongoing dispute between the child's mother, Eileen Cortez, 21, and 
Cienfuegos' former girlfriend, Christina Stevens, also 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Cienfuegos apparently was helping Stevens move furniture out of her former 
apartment when the dispute escalated. Police said Ciefuegos fired five or six 
shots into a group of people outside the complex in the 17800 block of Saticoy 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Cienfuegos has been charged with four counts of attempted murder and a single 
charge of causing great bodily injury. ANN W. O'NEILL

VALLEY INTERVIEW; ONE OF THESE DAYS, SMOG IN L.A. COULD BE A THING OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Finally, some good news about a perennial Los Angeles problem. The smog is 
going away. 
</P>
<P>
 Not rapidly and not entirely, but there has been steady improvement in the air 
quality of the Los Angeles Basin, according to meteorologists from the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. Indeed, they are confident that within 
two decades, smog will cease to be a serious health hazard in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, AQMD officials said that the alarming Stage 2 smog 
episodes, which used to be a regular part of San Fernando Valley summers, have 
been virtually eliminated. The less serious Stage 1 episodes, during which 
people are advised to avoid vigorous outdoor activity, are still with us but in 
ever decreasing numbers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mild-mannered Joe Cassmassi, an AQMD senior meteorologist, does not seem the 
kind of person who makes wildly optimistic predictions without solid 
foundation. But in an interview with Times staff writer David Colker, Cassmassi 
envisioned a smogless future. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: If the smog situation is so improved, why do we still see all that 
brown yuck in the sky at this time of year? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We have come a long way, but you have to keep in mind that weather 
conditions in the Los Angeles Basin make the problem a difficult one. We have 
what we call photochemical smog, which is created by the emissions in the air 
that come from motor vehicles and industrial emissions. In the presence of 
sunshine, there is a chain reaction that turns these gaseous emissions into 
ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And that's the bad stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's the smog, when ozone hovers near the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather is a primary factor. When you get a strong inversion that traps a 
lot of these emissions and no strong winds to blow them away, the sunshine can 
drive the smog formation process at a very rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was a very good year for us because the El Nino conditions that gave 
us rains lasted a lot longer than anyone expected. That led to unsettled 
weather, giving us more cloudy days than normal, more wind and a weaker 
inversion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If weather is such an important factor, how do you know the smog situation 
is actually getting better from year to year? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We can measure over a year the contribution weather has made and by 
factoring that out, we can look at the overlying trends in air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988 the peak concentration of ozone was .35 parts per million. In 1989 it 
was .34, in 1990 it was .33 and so on. Last year it was .28. So, what we are 
seeing is that the capacity to create severe smog episodes is being reduced 
with each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't factor out the weather, you can see the progress. To give 
you a point of reference, if you go back to 1980, we had roughly 100 Stage 1 
episode days in the Los Angeles Basin, which includes the Valley. By 1992 there 
we only 41. And in 1993 we jumped down to 24, with the assist in the weather. 
This year we expect on the order of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about Stage 2 alerts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The last time we had a Stage 2 episode was in 1988. It would be highly 
unusual for us to ever have one again. I don't expect it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are we now to the point where other cities in the U. S. actually have more 
smog? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, in terms of our report card, we're still the smoggiest city in the 
country. In fact, the only other city that truly rivals L. A. is Mexico City. 
It's in about the same league. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We are still worse off than Tokyo, where traffic police have to take oxygen 
breaks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's a different kind of smog, actually. Instead of the photochemical 
smog that we have, they have what we used to call a London type of smog. It's a 
smokestack-type smog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which type is worse? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It depends on the contributing factors. Both types have fine particles that 
get into your lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are other cities doing at controlling emissions that cause smog? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There again you have to figure in the weather conditions. If you take the 
greater Chicago area or the Boston-to-Washington corridor, these areas have 
almost comparable emissions as we do. But their weather conditions are not 
nearly as restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, given the way our weather helps cook the smog, our conditions are 
getting better because of a cutback in emissions in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. We have a very significant program to try and clean up the air 
and it has been working. We certainly have the best rate of improvement of any 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And you are confident that the situation will keep improving? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, there are several laws and regulations already in place to keep things 
going in the right direction. The state now has rules that say that by 1998, 2% 
of all the new cars sold should be electric. The state has already set new 
standards for emissions from cars and in 1996 it will further emissions 
reductions through requiring reformulated fuels. That will make for a 
significant cutback in pollution from what we had just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With all the anti-pollution devices now on cars and the cleaner fuels now 
mandatory, have automobiles ceased to be the biggest contributors to pollution? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, automobiles are still the primary contributors to air pollution in this 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have specific goals for how clean the air will be in the near 
future? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have set a timetable -- actually, the EPA (Environmental Protection 
Agency) has set a timetable -- giving specific dates by which they want us to 
achieve certain air quality standards. This breaks down to four basic areas 
where we are in violation of federal standards: fine particulates, carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How close are you to meeting these standards? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We anticipate we will probably meet the nitrogen dioxide standard within 
the next year or two. We have not been in violation of this standard for the 
last two years, but we have to wait a time frame of three years before applying 
for re-designation. 
</P>
<P>
 We will achieve the carbon monoxide standard by the year 2000 and the fine 
particulates by the year 2006. We believe we'll have the ozone down to the 
standard by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At that point, is the pollution problem over? Will we have clear skies and 
no more health hazards? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If we attain the standards, the health hazards will be significantly 
minimalized, although no one can say at this point they will be completely 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the number of days you will be able to look outside your window in the 
San Fernando Valley and see the San Gabriel Mountains -- almost every day. The 
exceptions would be the days when you have a lot of coastal marine moisture, 
fog and marine haze, coming inland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That would be an astonishing improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 A: There should be benchmarks along the way. By the year 2000 we might not be 
seeing any more Stage 1 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements will be a benefit not to just our area. The smog that 
originates in L. A. has been clearly traced to the Grand Canyon and (other) 
places in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are we doing so far this year? 
</P>
<P>
 A: As of today, we have had 15 Stage 1 episodes. That's a little higher than 
last year, as predicted.

 Once upon a time, a college degree was the key that opened the door when 
opportunity knocked. For today's graduates, sometimes the door is closed. And 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
 After competing for fewer and fewer job openings against a growing pool of 
experienced workers displaced by layoffs, many graduates admit that their 
starry-eyed dreams of becoming an engineer or an artist are being shelved in 
favor of more practical career objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the uncertainty produced by California's stalled economy, students 
are generally urged to select careers based on their interests, while at the 
same time they are reminded to be flexible in their goals. 
</P>

Q & A WITH ROBERT D. BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people, the thought of filing for bankruptcy conjures feelings of 
shame and Dickensian images of decrepit debtor prisons. Robert D. Bass, an 
Encino bankruptcy attorney who has been practicing for 20 years, says that 
while such thoughts are understandable, bankruptcy in fact represents a 
solution to financial situations that have gotten out of control -- less a 
cruel punishment than a chance to start over. He notes that in the past few 
years San Fernando Valley bankruptcy filings have been on the rise, an 
unfortunate side effect of California's economic downturn. Bass discussed the 
fundamentals of bankruptcy filings with Times correspondent David E. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What traps can draw people into bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you go through periods of time where credit is easy, where credit cards 
are available, you can get lulled into a sense of well-being if you make enough 
to make minimum payments. You end up not ever making a dent in what you really 
borrowed and what you really charged. And people often find that they get to a 
point where they have no way at all of repaying what's owed on credit cards. . 
. . If there's a lesson to be learned from the '80s, it's not overextend 
yourself, live within your means, worry about tomorrow, maintain savings and be 
concerned and be prepared for the rainy day that's going to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does a person know when to file for bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's when the fixed obligations, the credit card obligations, the car 
leases and the level of monthly payments are something that just can't be met 
or maintained by the borrower any longer. When all you're doing is paying the 
minimum payments on your credit card, which is basically an interest payment 
and not making a dent, it may be time to consider filing at that point. . . . 
People file when they can no longer take collection agencies calling them, the 
wage garnishments, the lawyers' letters, the lawsuits and those kinds of 
things. Bankruptcy gives the honest debtor a fresh start and allows them to 
take what they earn and use it to go forward and support their family and 
themselves as opposed to paying for past sins that have been imposed through 
overborrowing or overextension of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you allowed to keep after filing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When you file bankruptcy, the federal bankruptcy laws as well as the laws 
of the state of California provide for certain exemptions. By and large, the 
typical individual or consumer who files a bankruptcy will be entitled to keep 
their personal effects, their furniture, their clothes, some nominal equity in 
a car. They will be able to maintain their house. . . . For the typical person 
or family who's going to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, their life will go 
on with little interruption and very little loss of assets. And one of the 
things a bankruptcy lawyer tries to do when somebody comes to them talking of 
filing is exemption planning, to ensure that the maximum possible exemptions 
are taken advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Once you've filed, how does it affect your future income and purchases? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think your ability to obtain credit in the future will be largely 
dependent on your earning capacity and your ability to establish to a lender 
that you'll be able to repay what you borrow, whether it's buying a car, 
consumer credit or buying a house. A bankruptcy's really a last resort because 
it's a hard concept for many people to come to grips with. Most people have led 
their lives never thinking or imagining that they'd have to file a bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can someone file for bankruptcy without a lawyer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In the simplest of cases, it probably can be done without a lawyer. Without 
the benefit of the legal advice, people may file and find that it really wasn't 
necessary and then when they really do need the benefits of a bankruptcy they 
won't be able to file because there's a prohibition on filing again for a 
substantial period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your most important right after filing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It stops creditors from harassing you, from continuing collection efforts, 
from continuing foreclosures. I think your most important right is to be left 
alone and to go forward and look toward the future with some sense of hope and 
a feeling that you'll make it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long does a bankruptcy filing affect your credit rating? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In terms of actually affecting your credit, I would suspect that probably 
for a year to two years it is difficult to get credit. After that period of 
time it is probably much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What advice would you give someone thinking of starting a business in the 
Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Be cautious. Make sure the business is adequately capitalized so that 
during down times or during a start-up period you have sufficient capital to 
cover you and pay your operating expenses. I would strongly urge anybody who's 
running a business to be sure that all taxes are paid and obligations to the 
government are kept current. And anybody's who going to open a business ought 
to have a heck of a lot of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What causes most businesses to fail? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The failure to face problems when they first start surfacing is probably 
one of the major contributors to businesses ultimately failing. When people 
finally realize it's time to do something, either to seek out consultants or 
other professionals to look at their business, many of those businesses are 
already so far under water that there is nothing that can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the most common misconception about bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is the realization that it is not an admission of failure. It is a 
remedy that has been provided by Congress, recognizing that people get into 
situations, not dishonestly, but just out of circumstances beyond their 
control. There is a remedy available that lets one get rid of that. The 
misconception is that bankruptcy is something that ought to be avoided or 
something terrible like the plague.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finding a job can be a difficult, frustrating experience that takes a 
considerable amount of time and dedication. Here are some helpful hints from 
employment counselors and job seekers alike.  
</P>
<P>
 * Join trade groups representing the industry you're interested in and 
subscribe to their newsletter, which may include job listings and networking 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out job listings on computer networks like CompuServe and Prodigy. 
Computer networks offer excellent networking opportunities by using their 
specialized bulletin boards. Keep in mind that users may be communicating with 
someone in another part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order personal business cards, including your address and phone number(s). 
</P>
<P>
 * Attend job fairs, with resume and business cards in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the services of college placement offices and career centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read newspaper classified ads regularly and watch for news stories that may 
provide tips on expanding companies and industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enroll in courses to meet others with similar interests and improve your 
skills, but don't immediately go back to school just to get an advanced degree 
in some specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volunteer at a nonprofit organization to gain more experience with people, 
office procedures and organizational skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a positive attitude and never quit.

DATABASE OF RESUMES

<P>
 Tired of squinting over the classifieds, searching for those few companies 
with job openings? Well, at one local career center, the companies come looking 
for you -- your resume, to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cal State Northridge's Career Center began collecting resumes from 
graduating seniors and alumni and making them available to local employers with 
jobs to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was started because the recession had made many companies less 
willing to devote time and resources to campus interviews and job fairs, center 
Director Leland C. Gassert said. In response, the center created a database of 
resumes categorized by career field, becoming a sort of job broker in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this as a way for employers to target their recruiting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to have their resumes on file complete a biographical form and 
select three fields of interest from a list of nine, including engineering, 
science, health and recreation, accounting and finance. Resumes are then 
forwarded to local firms that request job candidates in a particular field. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are required to sign a release allowing the center to make their 
resumes available, although they are not notified when resumes are sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gassert explained that companies are charged a flat fee for their use of the 
service but added that the center will work with each employer to determine 
whether qualified applicants are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see if we have enough candidates to make it worth their while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's Career Center is located in the Village Square of the 
University Student Union, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. Services include 
workshops, career counseling, job fairs, aptitude testing as well as 
specialized programs for minorities, the deaf and disabled. Services are free 
to students and $50 per year to college graduates. Office hours are 9 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Mondays through Fridays. Information: (818) 885-2878. DAVID E. BRADY

SCHOOL MURAL TO HONOR YOUTH; SIMI VALLEY: VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEGUN WORK ON THE 
PROJECT IN MEMORY OF BRANDON BOOKER, WHO DIED IN HOUSE FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seven-year-old Brandon Booker will not be forgotten when the classroom bells 
ring on the first day of school this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew of Simi Valley students and parents made certain of that Monday by 
beginning to paint a mural at Madera Elementary School to honor the 
second-grader, who was killed in a house fire in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy died alongside his mother May 17 while both were trying to escape 
their burning Simi Valley home. His father was critically burned while 
attempting to rescue his wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something good has to come out of something tragic," said Brandon's 
godmother, Robin Torreso, one of about a dozen Simi Valley residents painting 
at Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will spend about a week painting a giant blue mustang and blue 
stripes on the campus' four main buildings. Below the mustang, which is the 
school's mascot, will be an inscription dedicating the mural to Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it happened, it was a real shock," said Edee Nimmons, a Simi Valley 
artist and part-time art teacher who designed the mural. "The teachers got 
together and thought it would be nice to do something in memory of the boy." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents solicited financial support from local business owners, who 
have donated paint, supplies, food and drinks for the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 About $600 have also been donated. "We've had really enthusiastic responses," 
Nimmons said. The money will pay for paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, a crew of about 20 volunteers scrubbed campus buildings in 
preparation for the new blue trim near the murals and a blue paint job on 
classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been painted in years," Nimmons said. "It just needed a face-lift." 
Students who knew Brandon lent their muscle to the project Monday, painting 
stripes on whitewashed walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool that everybody would do this for one person," said Tommy 
Brockert, 12, who attended Madera last year and will start the seventh grade at 
nearby Sinaloa Junior High School in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old Zack Marchinsky knew Brandon through the school's "study 
buddy" program, where older students are paired with younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of my good friends," he said. "We used to call him 'fuzz' because 
he had fuzzy hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Zack said the students working Monday were thinking about Brandon's death 
while trimming the campus with blue paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about it a lot -- how we miss Brandon," he said. "And we 
wish he could be here. He would have liked it a lot."

FOUR-VEHICLE COLLISION KILLS WOMAN, 33, AND DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Investigators were trying Monday to determine the cause of a four-car 
collision on California 126 that claimed the lives of a Palmdale mother and her 
daughter and injured as many as nine others. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the 5:18 p.m. crash Sunday were Carmen Maria Ortega, 33, and her 
daughter, Jessica Lorraine Ortega. N. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence of drugs or alcohol-use were found and the driver of a Nissan 
sport truck that slammed into three oncoming cars has not been cited, a 
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know at this point what caused him to cross over the center 
divider," said CHP spokeswoman Staci Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred when the sport truck, crossed the center divider near 
Timber Canyon Road between Fillmore and Santa Paula and collided with three 
eastbound cars, causing the Ford van in which the Ortega family was traveling 
to flip, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the Ortega family, Peter A. Ortega, and daughters Veronica, 
8, and Erica, 10, were treated and released from Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsies on the mother and daughter were being completed Monday, said Deputy 
Coroner Mitch Breese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is about that highway," Breese said. "This was a bad 
one. (The accident) was probably one the worst ones I've seen in several 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport truck's driver, James Johnson, 18, and passenger Michelle Moreno, 
19, both of Oxnard, were listed in stable condition at Ventura County hospitals 
Monday.

TRANSIT BOARD TO CONSIDER WAYS TO RESTART BUS SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offering some hope for a group of frustrated commuters, the Antelope Valley 
Transit Authority agreed Monday to look for ways to re-establish bus service 
from Lancaster to Century City and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hearing Monday morning, the authority's board of directors initially 
voted to formally terminate the bus service, discontinued when federal 
emergency funding ran out July 15. But then the board decided to give its staff 
two weeks to come up with alternatives that may resurrect the commuter line. 
</P>
<P>
 A major issue was whether the service -- started after the Northridge 
earthquake, using mostly Federal Emergency Management Agency funds -- could be 
justified because of its low ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Galbraith, the transit authority's grants director, said the line had 
averaged 12 riders a day, meaning that two full-size coaches with 45 seats each 
had been going mostly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 However, during the hearing, six riders on the now-defunct bus line offered 
several suggestions to make it more feasible, such as dropping one of the 
buses, improving advertising or changing the route so the bus would also go 
past the UCLA campus in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all very encouraged by the reception we received," said Billie Dickey 
of Pearblossom, one of the commuters who was at the hearing to offer support 
for the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has scheduled a special meeting for 10 a.m. Aug. 8 to go over the 
possibilities of restoring the bus line. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of work to be done between now and Aug. 8," Galbraith said. 
"There's a lot of pencils that need to be sharpened, a lot of phone calls to be 
made and rocks to be turned over so we can come up with a plan to present to 
the board of directors." 
</P>
<P>
 A commute by bus to Century City cost $130 a month, but that fare was 
subsidized by the FEMA money, Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority's board on Monday also approved fare hikes for local and other 
commuter lines. Effective Monday, the fare on the local routes will go up from 
75 cents to 80 cents. Fares for the punch pass on routes to Downtown Los 
Angeles and the western San Fernando Valley will go up $5 each -- to $105 and 
$125, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The punch pass gives 20 rides to Downtown or 44 rides to the western San 
Fernando Valley, Galbraith said. The charge for the monthly pass to each of 
those destinations will not change. However, the fare for the monthly pass on 
the local route will go up from $20 to $21.

EX-DEPUTY ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN RAPE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former elementary school teacher and sheriff's deputy was ordered Monday to 
stand trial on suspicion of raping one woman and sexually assaulting two others 
over a 3 1/2-year time span. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Keith Culhane, 35, of Santa Clarita is accused of raping a then 
17-year-old girl in June, 1990, when he was a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy. Prosecutors contend that Culhane gained the girl's trust by befriending 
her after a traffic stop and offering to help her write a college paper. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is charged with sexually assaulting his 19-year-old baby-sitter in 
early 1992 -- shortly after he left the Sheriff's Department -- and a 
44-year-old co-worker at Santa Clarita Elementary School in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony during a preliminary hearing Monday in Newhall Municipal Court 
portrayed Culhane as a sexual predator who gained the trust of his alleged 
victims but was ruthless afterward. Police said both teen-age victims refused 
to report their encounters with Culhane at first because of his experience as a 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old was too frightened to fight him off during the alleged rape, 
Detective Jerry Johnson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, she was shaking and crying so bad he stopped and said, 'What's 
the matter with you? Don't act like a foolish schoolgirl. Loosen up,' " Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane, free on $50,000 bail, declined to comment about the case after the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a sheriff's deputy from January, 1982, until August, 1991, retiring 
from the department after several complaints against him of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints, including the alleged rape of the college student, were 
investigated by the department's Internal Affairs Bureau. Officials said the 
retirement was part of an agreement to allow Culhane to leave the department 
without criminal charges being filed. The agreement paid him a settlement at 
the same time for a work-related injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations against Culhane became public this spring when a teacher accused 
him of sexually assaulting her in a classroom where he taught fifth-grade 
students. The woman testified Monday that she was on friendly terms with 
Culhane until the alleged incident on Nov. 5, 1993, during his first semester 
as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she went to his classroom to get a map and talked with him for about 
30 minutes before she tried to leave and was unexpectedly grabbed, fondled and 
sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher said she reported the incident to Sulphur Springs Union School 
District officials a few days afterward, and to the Sheriff's Department in 
January when she felt the district had not taken suitable action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they took disciplinary action after the teacher's 
initial complaint and terminated Culhane following his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was unaware of the previous allegations against Culhane when they 
hired him, and the Sheriff's Department was forbidden from disclosing them, 
according to officials with both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives testified that they learned about Culhane's previous 
alleged assaults from other department officials while investigating the 
teacher's claims.

DEPUTIES SEEK INFORMATION IN STABBING DEATH OF MAN, 36

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities still had no clues Monday in the stabbing death of a Lancaster man 
on a local street early Saturday, a detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any witnesses," said Detective Judy Gibson, a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department investigator working on the slaying of John Brown 
Avila, 36.No motive has been uncovered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities Monday began circulating his picture on flyers, asking anyone with 
information to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila was last seen early Saturday leaving the Buffalo Club on Division Street 
in Lancaster. He was later spotted by a passing motorist after 2 a.m., lying in 
a gutter in the 4400 block of 3rd Street, stabbed several times in the upper 
torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said deputies are distributing flyers at the Buffalo Club, a restaurant 
with a bar, and at the Circle K in Lancaster, where Avila was a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call Gibson or Detective Robert Taylor at 
(213) 890-5500. ED BOND

RULING EXEMPTS RECOVERY PLAN; COURTS: JUDGE DISMISSES WATER AGENCY SUIT, SAYS 
SANTA CLARITA PLAN CAN INCLUDE PROJECTS OTHER THAN QUAKE REPAIRS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that Santa Clarita's $1.1-billion 
redevelopment plan qualifies for a disaster-related exemption to the California 
Environmental Quality Act, despite its inclusion of projects that aren't for 
disaster recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien's decision dismissed the 
first of two lawsuits the Castaic Lake Water Agency has filed against Santa 
Clarita's Community Recovery Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply repairing earthquake damage is not the purpose of the disaster 
exemption," O'Brien said in the three-page ruling issued last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is within the scope and purpose of the law that an entire area of a 
potential redevelopment plan or urban renewal project may be included in a 
proper exemption." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council adopted the recovery plan in February to help 
the city recuperate from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, improve its 
infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita and the Castaic Lake Water Agency are battling over the use of 
millions of dollars in future property tax increases. The city wants the 
funding to create the 30-year redevelopment plan and the water agency wants it 
to pay for bond debts, including $132 million for its new Rio Vista Water 
Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 CLWA officials say the plan goes far beyond fixing Northridge earthquake 
damage and that the city shouldn't avoid California Environmental Quality Act 
requirements by using waivers allowed for disaster-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed with the court's decision and will recommend to the board 
of directors that an appeal be filed," said Robert Sagehorn, the water agency's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan had about 7% of funds committed to earthquake repairs and the 
remainder was for public works projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Water agency directors will discuss whether or not to appeal the O'Brien's 
decision at their Aug. 10 meeting, Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the agency unsuccessfully argued Santa Clarita's redevelopment 
plan should be subject to public hearings and an environmental impact report, a 
process city officials say would slow down creation of the plan by an 
additional year. 
</P>
<P>
 Water agency attorneys noted that Santa Clarita wanted to fix $211 million in 
estimated earthquake damages with a $1.1-billion plan, but O'Brien said the 
monetary damage projections shouldn't limit the scope of a redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A second CLWA lawsuit, filed in April but with no hearing date set, objects to 
the wide range of projects that are listed as disaster recovery. It is still 
pending and continues to block city action on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will vigorously continue to pursue our main legal action which challenges 
the creation of the redevelopment (plan) as it is structured . . .," Sagehorn 
said.

IRS LOOKS CLOSELY AT HOBBY LINKED TO CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thinking of going into a money-making pastime like, say, organic farming or 
selling bait for fishing? Fine, but be careful not to open up a big can of 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
 In any venture of this sort, you can get all tangled up with tax rules on the 
question of what is a business and what is merely a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction, hazy as it is at times, can mean big differences in the way 
you should conduct your enterprise and how much you ultimately make from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you engage in an activity for profit, losses from that activity may be 
used to offset other income," notes H&R Block Tax Services Inc. in its 1994 
Income Tax Guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, if the activity is not engaged in for profit, it is a 
hobby, and expenses may only be deducted to the extent of earnings -- and even 
then only as itemized deductions subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as the accounting firm Price Waterhouse points out, "You aren't allowed to 
create a tax loss from your hobby to slash your overall tax bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest way to qualify your activity as a business with a moneymaking 
mission is to show a profit regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A profit motive is assumed if an activity results in a profit in three out of 
five consecutive years (two out of seven for horse farms)," says the accounting 
firm Ernst & Young in its Financial Planning Reporter newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you have met the three-year requirement, it becomes the burden of the 
Internal Revenue Service to prove that the activity is not for profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the bottom line is not always so easy to control. What if your 
good-faith efforts keep winding up in the red, and you still want to claim tax 
write-offs to which you feel legitimately entitled? 
</P>
<P>
 "The IRS generally will make determinations on a case-by-case basis," Ernst & 
Young says. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence Uncle Sam often considers, which has come up in numerous court 
cases, falls into several categories. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the questions focus on whether you operate in a businesslike 
fashion, keeping formal records of your finances and making earnest attempts to 
maximize revenue and limit costs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have expertise in your chosen field of endeavor and spend a lot of time 
working at it, your case may be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the IRS often looks at people's past records of success or failure in 
other business ventures and at their current finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the taxpayer could ill afford to carry on the activity as a hobby, he or 
she will have an easier time demonstrating a profit motive," says H&R Block. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, substantial income from outside sources may detract from a 
claim of profit motive, especially if the activity has considerable 
recreational value." 
</P>
<P>
 That last issue -- how much fun is it? -- can also carry a lot of weight. "The 
mere fact that a person enjoys an activity does not make it a hobby," H&R Block 
observes.

COUNTERFEIT CHIC EXACTS HIGH TOLL ON ORIGINALS; MARKETING: KNOCKOFFS OF BRAND 
NAMES SUCH AS ROLEX, CHANEL AND GUCCI ARE BELIEVED TO BE A $70 BILLION -- 
THAT'S WITH A B -- INDUSTRY OF FRAUD. 
</P>

 Tony Layne adjusted the strap on his newly purchased $10 "Rolex" watch as he 
strolled away from a Chinatown storefront stocked with fake watches, shirts and 
handbags. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows it's phony and says he's no fool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always buy on the street. It's a bargain," Layne said. "I figure the 
battery alone must be worth $10 so if it lasts a month, two months, I've gotten 
my 10 bucks worth." 
</P>
<P>
 But anti-counterfeit experts say Layne still got fleeced because his $10 watch 
likely cost no more than $2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing but pure junk," said Dempster Leech, a private investigator who 
specializes in copyright and trademark investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also big business, organized and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterfeit goods -- knockoffs of well-known prestige products like Rolexes, 
Gucci bags, Chanel scarves and T-shirts with licensed logos -- is a $60 billion 
to $70 billion industry, according to a 1988 government report, the most recent 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies trying to stop the illegal flow of counterfeits say 
that number is vastly low. Knockoff T-shirts worth an estimated $4 million on 
the street were seized in a single Manhattan raid last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fakes are everywhere. In Chinatown, Times Square, Rockefeller Center and 
the downtown financial district, teams of peddlers sell watches out of cheap 
briefcases; handbags out of trash bags; and T-shirts from blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 Knockoffs on name brands are bountiful. The general rule is, if it's hot in 
the stores, it's even hotter on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from ridiculously cheap -- $8 for a "Chanel" scarf -- to a high 
of $75 for some watches. That compares with as much as $300 for a real Chanel 
scarf, and $4,500 for a genuine Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the fake goes up outside New York, as transportation and 
middle-man costs are figured in. Flea markets in middle America have been known 
to sell imitation Rolexes for as much as $200, said attorney Heather McDonald, 
who coordinates Rolex's nationwide anti-counterfeiting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know for a fact that people believe they're buying the genuine thing at 
that price point because when the watches stop working they bring them in to 
Rolex and say, 'Why isn't this working?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people receive counterfeits as gifts and when something goes wrong -- the 
shirt shrinks, the logo's dye bleeds, the handbag falls apart -- they often try 
to return them to stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like Layne and his "Rolex," consumers continue to believe they're 
getting, if not an original, a good imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Leech and other counterfeiting fighters see nothing good about the fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is organized crime at work," Leech said. "It's a way for criminal 
fraternities to support themselves and raise money for other illegal 
endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Sporn, of Polo-Ralph Lauren and former head of the International 
Anti-counterfeiting Coalition, a Washington-based trade group that lobbies for 
tougher laws, said there's a simpler reason: "It's stealing."

HOW TO SEPARATE A PHONY FROM THE REAL MCCOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most popular knockoffs in each category and how to spot a fake: 
</P>
<P>
 Watches: Rolex, Tag Huer, Gucci, Cartier, Movado and Seiko. Second-tiered 
knockoffs popular with younger people are Guess, Nautica and Timberland. 
</P>
<P>
 Real vs. Fake Rolex: If the second hand makes a "tick, tick, tick" motion, 
it's fake. The real thing's second hand moves in a fluid motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The genuine is also heavier because it's made of high-grade steel, has an 
18-carat gold band and a synthetic sapphire crystal. The fake is made of hollow 
metal, is gold-plated and the crystal is made of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Handbags: Chanel, Dooney & Burke, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci, Coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Real vs. Fake: A real Chanel handbag is made of soft lambskin. The fakes are 
made of everything from cheap leather to vinyl. The Chanel label with its 
registered trademark is sewn onto the bag if it's genuine. The fakes are glued 
on and can be easily peeled off. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarves: Chanel, Paloma Picasso, Yves St. Laurent. 
</P>
<P>
 Real vs. Fake: The real thing is 100% silk, smooth and light to the touch. The 
fakes are polyester. On genuine designer scarves, the edges are hand rolled and 
hand stitched to prevent fraying; fakes are machine-stitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer shirts: Ralph Lauren Polo, Tommy Hilfiger, Guess, Timberland. Also, 
Power Rangers, Disney Lion King, Flintstones and World Cup soccer T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Real vs. Fake: Perhaps the hardest category to detect because computer 
advancements have made it possible to match the real embroidery stitch for 
stitch. Labels and tags are also near perfect thanks to computer copying. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest giveaway is quality and weight of material. Fakes are done on 
cheap seconds. Look beneath the "designer" label to see if the original label 
has been cut out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fake T-shirts are also printed on cheap material and do not have the 
licensee's label stitched in the neck.

 Most of the counterfeit goods sold in the United States are made in the Far 
East and shipped to several main points of entry. The top countries of origin 
include China, Korea, Taiwan and the colony of Hong Kong, with New York, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Miami as the usual destinations for 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Importers ship goods to assembly places -- sweatshops and makeshift plants in 
garages -- where many counterfeit items are given designer labels, logos and 
tags. 
</P>
<P>
 When finished, the goods are delivered to wholesalers, who in turn sell them 
to individual street vendors and flea market operators. 
</P>
<P>
 More facts about fake goods: 
</P>
<P>
 * New York is considered the largest center for retail sales of counterfeit 
goods in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police estimate there are 10,000 unlicensed merchandise vendors in the city, 
compared to 850 licensed vendors. Of the unlicensed sellers, nearly half deal 
in designer knockoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Largest busts: A counterfeit T-shirt factory in Manhattan where 1 million 
shirts valued at $4 each were seized and a Queens, N.Y., factory that churned 
out $3 million a year in knockoff shirts, sweat shirts and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nationwide, U.S. Customs officials seized a total of $45.8 million in 
counterfeit goods in 1993. Of that, $19.7 million came from the No. 1 exporter, 
China.

WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS; TOMORROW'S GLOBAL 
NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Work is under way to set up a satellite-based mobile communications system 
that would allow a person to reach virtually anywhere in the world -- even a 
remote tropical island -- simply by using a cellular telephone. Several 
competing companies are currently testing plans and seeking necessary approval 
to begin launching satellites. Plans vary -- and three are outlined at right -- 
but the basic principle behind most of them is outlined below. Problems with 
such a global system include the cost and how to regulate it since calls will 
cross many international borders. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Call originates from within a cell. Entire globe is divided into a network 
of cells, or calling areas. 
</P>
<P>
 2. When a call is placed in the system, it seeks the most efficient available 
route. Sometimes calls may go to a switching station, or gateway, on the ground 
and then through a satellite dish to be uplinked into space. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Among a network of orbiting satellites, the one that is in position nearest 
to the caller (the one "responsible" for that cell area), picks up the 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Since the call is overseas, it is passed on through the network of 
satellites until it reaches the one nearest to its destination and then is 
retransmitted earthward to the proper cell and to the receiver. Satellite 
Systems 
</P>
<P>
 Each system would have a number of satellites employed in different orbits and 
at varying altitudes so that every point on Earth is in contact with the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun-synchronous, low-altitude orbits:

through various tax incentives will probably save his 50-employee company, 
Southern California Plastics, at least $25,000 this year in state income tax -- 
and much more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty good chunk of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is one of about 90 business owners who have signed on with the 
enterprise zone, helping make the program highly successful in its first full 
year of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city received the special economic designation in June, 1993, Santa 
Ana officials say the program has helped create or save 540 jobs, has filled up 
much of the city's vacant industrial space and is expected to reduce the state 
tax burden to participating companies by at least $3.4 million -- enabling them 
to pump those dollars back into their businesses and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say that those 540 jobs -- most of them in manufacturing and 
some paying annual salaries as high as $71,000 -- are the most in a single year 
for any of the state's 34 enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana is one of the top performers in the program right now," said Sam 
Paredes, director of California's enterprise zone agency in Sacramento, which 
over the years has taken some heat for not being more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's enterprise zone program, which started in 1986, is intended to 
give economically depressed areas a boost by offering state income tax breaks 
to businesses. Santa Ana, with Orange County's highest jobless rate -- 10.2% 
for June -- is the county's only city to be designated an enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most businesses in California must pay a state income tax of 9.3% of their 
revenue. But companies in enterprise zones can reduce the tax by as much as 
$1.3 million a year if they buy machinery and other equipment. Also, companies 
can earn as much as $19,000 for each employee over a five-year period by hiring 
certain personnel, such as displaced workers. The program also includes 
incentives for lowering business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1986 to 1993, the program statewide helped create or save almost 39,000 
jobs. But some zones, especially those in the inner city of Los Angeles, have 
been criticized for failing to create much interest, let alone jobs. "They just 
weren't high priority," Jack Kyser, economist for the Economic Development 
Corp. of Los Angeles, said of the enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 State and city officials, as well as local business owners, attribute the 
early success of Santa Ana's zone partly to aggressive marketing by the city. 
Sandi Gottlieb and Bonnie Birch, the city's two full-time officials working on 
the program, say they have mailed out tens of thousands of brochures, spent 
$30,000 in advertising and held so many workshops at banks, libraries and 
public grounds that even the local fire inspectors know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The city "took the program very seriously," said Hal Duensing, who runs Long 
Beach's highly rated enterprise zone, which helped create or keep 350 jobs in 
1992, its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage was that Santa Ana started out with an ample supply of 
available industrial space. The enterprise zone in Altadena-Pasadena, for 
example, has had a tough time attracting new businesses or helping existing 
ones expand because its industrial real estate is pretty much built out, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Santa Ana's zone is huge, encompassing about 6,200 acres, or 98% of the 
industrial space available for lease in the city. Most of the zone is in 
southeast and southwest Santa Ana, the largest stretch along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the zone was formed, Santa Ana had about 4 million square feet of 
vacant industrial space, according to CB Commercial in Anaheim. That has since 
dropped to 2.6 million square feet, a decline brokers attribute to firms like 
GT Bicycles, which left Santa Ana years ago but came back after the zone was 
created; and California Connection, an apparel maker that moved much of its Los 
Angeles operation to Santa Ana to take advantage of the enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 For those and other companies, city officials estimate the total tax credits 
for hiring qualified workers to be $3.4 million in the first year. Those 
businesses are also expected to reap millions of dollars more in tax credits 
for the purchase of machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Press, owner of Gold Coast Baking Co. in Santa Ana, was skeptical when he 
filled out the paperwork for the program last year. "At the beginning, I was an 
agnostic," said Press, who started his business five years ago with one small 
oven and one employee. "I said, 'Yeah, right, the government's going to help 
someone grow a business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, he has moved to a bigger site in the enterprise zone, bought 
two tunnel ovens at a total cost of $450,000 and hired 50 employees -- 23 of 
them through the enterprise zone program in positions that include maintenance 
and production. 
</P>
<P>
 Press said that for its fiscal year ended April 30, his company paid just $800 
in state income tax -- the minimum amount. How much did he save? While 
declining to be specific, Press said that without the zone benefits, his state 
tax bill would have been in the "high five digits." 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast Baking now has 93 workers, and Press expects his company's revenue 
to reach $10 million in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's allowed me to take those dollars and put it into new equipment," Press 
said of the enterprise zone. "I think this program goes further for the state 
of California in turning around its negative business climate image than 
anything else I've seen." Enterprise Zone Thrives 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses within the Santa Ana enterprise zone receive state and local tax 
advantages as well as other economic incentives. The year-old zone, the only 
one of its kind in Orange County, is one of the most successful in California. 
</P>

FRAUD CHARGES FILED IN O.C. PENSION SCAM; CRIME: THREE TO PLEAD GUILTY IN 
ALLEGED $121.5-MILLION MORTGAGE POOL SCHEME OPERATED BY IRVINE-BASED FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors filed mail fraud charges Monday against the three 
operators of First Pension Corp., the failed Irvine pension management company 
accused of running a $121.5-million Ponzi scheme. The three, who have already 
agreed to plead guilty, face maximum prison terms of 10 years and fines of up 
to $500,000 each. They will be arraigned Monday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles on two counts of mail fraud each. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were filed against against businessman William E. Cooper, 50, of 
Villa Park and his two long-term associates: Robert E. Lindley, 51, of Laguna 
Niguel and Valerie Jensen, 47, of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the longest-running and most elaborate schemes I have ever 
seen," Assistant U.S. Atty. John Libby said. "To a certain extent they had to 
fool their own employees as well as investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked the court to 
appoint Donald W. Henry, a Woodland Hills attorney, as receiver for the 
mortgage pools operated by First Pension and other related companies. The 
receiver would refund any recovered money to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the three said their clients are cooperating with authorities 
and will plead guilty at next week's arraignment. Cooper is represented by Los 
Angeles lawyer Robert C. Bonner, former chief of the federal Drug Enforcement 
Agency and onetime federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials allege that, beginning in 1982, the three operated an elaborate 
pyramid scheme that misled clients into investing in mortgages that did not 
exist. An unknown number of First Pension's 8,000 clients lost $66.7 million 
they had invested and another $54.8 million in interest lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The two counts of mail fraud relate to quarterly account statements mailed to 
First Pension clients on Dec. 31, 1993, and March 31, 1994, U.S. attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the level of deceit, prosecutors allege that in 1990 Cooper 
hired an actress to portray an auditor for the state Department of Corporations 
after an employee confronted Cooper with charges that no trust deeds existed in 
the mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress was given a phony Corporations Department business card and then 
sat in the offices of Vestcorp Securities, the brokerage arm of First Pension, 
where she pretended to review files for three weeks, U.S. attorneys said. A 
letter was then drafted on bogus Corporations Department stationery stating 
that the files were in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry investors said Monday that 10 years in prison is not enough for the 
three First Pension principals, with several expressing doubt that the three 
would get the maximum term anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Reiter, 55, of Torrance, who lost $180,000 with First Pension, called 
the mail fraud charges "wimpy in view of the spectacular crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin Starr of Hercules in Northern California said he put $80,000 in 
retirement funds in the allegedly phony mortgage pools. He, too, was critical 
of the U.S. attorney Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "To knowingly defraud people . . . is bad enough, but to defraud elderly 
people, who can least afford to lose money, is a despicable crime," Starr said. 
"They'll end up serving five years for a $120-million crime. It makes it seem 
like crime pays." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors said that they are pleased, however, that a receiver may soon be 
looking for assets in the mortgage pools and several affiliated companies, 
among them Outpatient Surgery Center of California, Euclid-Ball Ltd., Vestcorp, 
Amerispec Inc. and First Diversified Financial Services Inc., the parent 
company of First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the charges, the First Pension case is not closed, signaling that U.S. 
attorneys are still investigating other people associated with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension, with an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 
million, declared bankruptcy April 22, one day after Colorado state banking 
authorities seized Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based firm established by 
Cooper to manage clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents filed by the U.S. attorney's office Monday charge that the three 
principals engaged in an elaborate scheme designed to hide mounting losses at 
First Pension by diverting clients' money to pay their own salaries, make 
payroll for employees, meet operating expenses and cover losses. Diverted money 
was also used to invest in new businesses, the U.S. attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated $121.5-million loss breaks down in four ways, the federal agency 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 First, starting in 1982, Cooper, Lindley and Jensen agreed to pool trust deeds 
into Bank Mortgage Fund One, known as BMF1, in order to hide from clients the 
fact that some of the trust deeds were nonperforming or had defaulted, U.S. 
attorneys said. This resulted in a $26.6-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, an estimated $68.9 million in clients' principal and interest was lost 
in the "mini-funds" -- limited partnerships that invested in trust deeds 
secured by California real estate -- because after 1986, the principals stopped 
buying trust deeds, U.S. attorneys said. Instead, the money was used to pay 
operating expenses and earlier investors, they said. Third, an estimated $23 
million was diverted from First Pension's custodial cash accounts, with at 
least $7 million going to start a sham Nevada corporation called Ernest Edwards 
& Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, $3 million in investments and interest was diverted from Summit Trust 
by Cooper and Lindley by using stolen and forged checks, U.S. attorneys said. 
Early in April, they alleged, Cooper opened a bank account under his control in 
the name of Summit Trust at Guardian Bank in Irvine, where he deposited 
clients' checks totaling about $920,000. He then took $700,000 out for personal 
use, U.S. attorneys said.  
</P>
<P>
 Between March 25 and April 12, Cooper allegedly took clients' checks from the 
mail room and deposited about 176 checks totaling $510,000 at Home Bank in 
Irvine, attorneys said.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UP SLIGHTLY TO 5.8%; ECONOMY: EXPERTS SAY THE JUNE INCREASE 
IS DUE TO SEASONAL FACTORS AND THAT THE LOCAL ECONOMY IS STILL MAKING A 
RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate inched up to 5.8% in June. Observers linked 
the slight rise to temporary job losses when many workers, including school 
system employees, are off for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of unemployed people in the county rose to 76,200 last month, 
compared to 71,200 in May, according to figures released Monday by the state 
Employment Development Department's Anaheim office. The county's unemployment 
rate stood at 5.4% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's jobless rate of 5.8% last month compared favorably with a rate of 
6.2% nationwide and an 8.7% rate for California. Los Angeles County's 
unemployment rate was 10.1% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the slight month-to-month increase in Orange County doesn't 
necessarily signal problems for the local economy, which is recovering from a 
recession that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still on an upward part of the curve, but the slope isn't that 
dramatic," said Anil Puri, head of the economics department at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri said the June report confirms that the county's tourism industry is at 
last overcoming the stifling effects of last year's fires and the 1992 riots in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see improvements in the underlying figures in the service sector and 
especially the tourism industry," Puri said. "It appears that this summer is 
finally bringing tourism back." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report showed a net loss of 3,900 non-agriculture jobs, however, from 
June, 1993, to June, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Services, government, transportation and public utilities each registered 
overall gains. But the manufacturing, finance, insurance, real estate, retail, 
wholesale and construction sectors registered net losses. The Summer Slump 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate increased slightly in June, but the upswing is 
typical during the summer. The current rate is still below the 1993 annual 
average of 6.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 June 1993: 7.1%

 June 1994: 5.8%

LAWSUIT DIMS FIRM'S RISING PROFIT REPORT; LITIGATION: PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC IS 
NAMED AS CO-DEFENDANT IN A CLAIM SEEKING $77 MILLION. THE COMPANY SAYS THE 
MATTER IS WITHOUT MERIT. 
</P>

<P>
 News of surging sales and profits at Pacific Scientific Co. was dimmed a bit 
Monday as company officials said the electrical equipment maker has been named 
co-defendant in a $77 million lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in a federal district court in Texas, alleges breach of 
contract in connection with the 1990 sale of a product line. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit stemmed from the sale of $200,000 in spare inventory to a small Texas 
company. The complaint seeks $7 million in actual damages and $70 million in 
punitive damages. In 1991, Pacific Scientific sold the unit that had produced 
the line of measuring equipment. The new owner also is named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific executives said that the suit is without merit and that 
they've asked the court to dismiss the litigation. "The company will vigorously 
defend itself against this action," spokesman Richard V. Plat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Pacific Scientific reported strong sales and earnings 
increases for its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly profit rose 37% to $2.2 million, up from $1.6 million, on revenue 
that rose 15% to $57.2 million, up from $49.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half, Pacific Scientific said its profit increased 39% to $3.9 
million from $2.8 million. Six-month sales of $108.8 million were up 19% from 
$91.3 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar S. Brower, Pacific Scientific's chairman and chief executive, said 
additional strong quarters are anticipated because "orders continued to outpace 
shipments." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Newport Beach, designs, manufactures and markets 
electrical equipment and safety equipment.

 Expansion Planned: Here's some good news from the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce: About 41% of the members polled recently plan to increase their work 
force this year, while only 13% foresee cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a problem: About half of those surveyed also said it will be 
substantially or moderately difficult for them to hire qualified 
applicants.Only 13% of the respondents said they expect no difficulty in 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Buckles, the Chapman University marketing professor who conducted the 
mail-in survey for the chamber, says those two findings obviously pose a "kind 
of paradox." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Burnham, president of ProActive Institute, a job-training firm in 
Costa Mesa, believes there are enough talented workers in the county to fill 
these expected openings. Burnham said he infers from the survey that employers 
"are looking for something different from before. They want people who are 
willing to take more initiative and willing to take less job security." 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings from the chamber's poll of its 1,200 members, of whom 387 
responded: 71% expect their company's financial performance to be much better 
or somewhat better this year. Only 9% expect it to be worse.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MICROPOLIS REPORTS A LOSS OF $14.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Losses continued to mount last quarter for Micropolis Corp., a Chatsworth 
company that makes computer disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported a $14.7-million loss for the second quarter ended July 1, 
almost six times larger than the $2.52-million loss the company reported for 
the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the latest quarter were $75.8 million, down 30% from sales of $108 
million for the same three-month period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For its six-month period, Micropolis had a loss of $24.5 million on sales of 
$159 million, compared to a loss of $1.06 million on sales of $202 million in 
the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a relatively small player in the disk-drive industry, has been 
battered by price wars that favor larger producers such as IBM and 
Hewlett-Packard Corp. The company attributed the recent losses to price erosion 
and a decrease in shipments of its drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it expects to report a loss in the third quarter of 
1994, the size of which will depend partly on the success of new products, 
including video and audio disk systems.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HAMBURGER HAMLET HAS SHARP QUARTERLY DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet Restaurants Inc., a Sherman Oaks-based owner and operator of 
restaurants, reported a sharp decline in its second-quarter earnings after 
taking a $550,000 onetime charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ended June 26, the company earned $13,000, down 93% from its 
$198,000 in net income a year earlier.Revenue was up slightly, to $17.3 million 
from $17.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime charge was for the write-down of a note receivable and reserves 
for possible future lease obligations, both related to the sale of a restaurant 
in 1989, the company said. It also said that second-quarter results were 
impacted by lower sales in Chicago and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, Hamburger Hamlet lost $314,000, while its revenue edged up 
to $34.8 million. A year earlier, it earned $663,000 on $34.5 million in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet also said it named A. Shawn Holder as its president and chief 
executive, succeeding Jack A. Lavine , who held those positions on an interim 
basis. Holder most recently was senior vice president and chief operating 
officer at Chart House Enterprises Inc. in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavine remains with the company as executive vice president and chief 
financial officer.

PUMPING UP THE VOLUME; DTS NEARS SETTLEMENT WITH RIVAL IN DIGITAL MOVIE SOUND, 
BUT NOW FACES CHALLENGE FROM SONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Digital Theater Systems is close to resolving its legal dispute with French 
rival L.C. Concept, thus freeing the company to turn its attention to Sony 
Corp., its latest major rival in the competitive digital soundtrack movie 
theater wars. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS, which is based in Westlake Village, will purchase worldwide rights to the 
digital sound patent of L.C. Concept of Paris, through an agreement expected to 
be signed within a week. Sources place the settlement in the $2.6-million 
range. But Bill Neighbors, DTS vice president and general manager, said the 
figure was off target. L.C. attorney David Makous wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, DTS, and its part-owner Universal Studios, will 
agree to drop several lawsuits they filed against L.C. in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital movie sound quality is similar to compact discs used in home stereo 
systems. Through computer technology, it offers crystal-clear tones, free of 
the hisses and pops that sometimes plague traditional movie soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS' hardware is now in more than 2,000 theaters worldwide, giving it a leg up 
in a race for sound systems with Dolby Laboratories of San Francisco. But after 
several delays, Sony Corp. will introduce its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound system 
in 150 of its 900 Sony Theatres (formerly Loews Theatres) by the end of the 
year, said Jim Fiedler, SDDS president. Fiedler said the company has firm 
commitments from other exhibitors, but he wouldn't disclose which ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has had "lengthy discussions" with all of the major motion picture 
studios, said spokeswoman Gemma Richardson. The company expects to see its 
sound format on non-Sony Pictures Entertainment movies soon, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile at DTS, Neighbors said the company isn't fazed by Sony's entry. 
"We're just selling units and making movies," Neighbors said. But he added, "I 
take them (Sony) very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony is arriving late in a business that received its first big push last 
summer with Universal's release of Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" in DTS. 
Spielberg, along with Universal, is an investor in DTS. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS is used in several key summer films, such as Universal's and Spielberg's 
"The Flintstones," MGM's "Blown Away" and New Line Cinema's "The Mask," which 
opens July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 But the studios are splitting their bets on digital sound formats. Paramount 
Pictures and 20th Century Fox are releasing some key summer films in both DTS 
and Dolby digital sound formats. Fox's "Speed" and the Arnold Schwarzenegger 
hit "True Lies" carry both formats, as does Paramount's "Forrest Gump," with 
Tom Hanks, and the upcoming "Clear and Present Danger," the third film based on 
Tom Clancy's novels. That way, the movies can play in digital sound on whatever 
system an exhibitor has. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Disney's blockbuster "The Lion King" is a top box office draw 
featuring the Dolby digital sound format. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sony's delay in getting its system to market, most acknowledge that 
Sony, with its vast resources, will be a significant force. The company's pitch 
to exhibitors is that its system offers better sound quality and durability 
than its rivals. It's also the only system to offer a digital track backup, 
should the principal digital track fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sony is the 800-pound gorilla in this thing," said Bill Mead, vice president 
of film marketing at Dolby in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All motion pictures from Sony Pictures Entertainment -- Columbia Pictures, 
TriStar, Sony Pictures Classics and Triumph Releasing -- will feature SDDS. 
Columbia's "The Next Karate Kid," the latest installment in the popular series 
starring Pat Morita, will be the first film in major release featuring SDDS. It 
opens Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Sony has been testing SDDS on Sony pictures in a handful of 
theaters, including General Cinema's Galaxy in Hollywood, AMC's multiplex in 
Century City and the United Artists theater in Westwood. "We've made this 
equipment foolproof," said Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony officials say they're not concerned about the competition. "Sony is one 
of the fathers of digital sound," said Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
 At $13,800 per theater, Sony's hardware is the most expensive of the three 
alternatives for theater operators. DTS' hardware has a list price of $5,950 
per screen; Dolby's cost one-half to one-third more than DTS' rate, but that 
doesn't include the extra costs of buying the DTS sound discs, which go for 
$100 a set for each film print. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors have been reluctant to commit to one format over another, convinced 
that eventually the industry will embrace one standard. They prefer not to buy 
multiple pieces of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment, some cinemas are investing in more than one digital sound 
system. For example, the independent Edwards Theatre Circuit Inc., based in 
Newport Beach, has installed both DTS and Dolby equipment in 65 to 70 of the 
chain's 410 total screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel both systems will coexist," said chairman James Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt the public is sold on digital movie sound, said Tim Warner, 
president of the National Assn. of Theater Owners trade association of 
California and Nevada. But with the absence of a clear standard, exhibitors are 
investing in multiple formats, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS has an exclusive deal with Universal that all of that studios' films will 
be on DTS. In addition, DTS has an exclusive deal with Spielberg's production 
firm Amblin Entertainment and with MGM/UA Distribution Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The DTS format has also been used on films from several other studios. So far, 
DTS has been on 39 movies; 2,368 theaters worldwide are equipped with DTS 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolby reports that Dolby Stereo Digital Sound has been on 50 to 60 movies. Its 
hardware is installed at 700 to 850 theaters worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 As for DTS's likely settlement with small French rival L.C. Concept, the 
firm's head, Elisabeth Lochen, may become a consultant at DTS, said DTS 
President Terry Beard. Lochen's involvement with DTS isn't part of the 
agreement, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the purchase of L.C.'s patent, DTS has eliminated one competitor, albeit 
a tiny one. 
</P>
<P>
 L.C. wasn't successful in Hollywood, but its digital sound format had been 
used in an estimated 30 pictures in France, Belgium and Switzerland since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 With the L.C. dispute behind it, DTS will renew its push in Europe. It's 
setting up a European headquarters in Brussels and it has put DTS recording 
equipment installations in five major European sound studios in four countries, 
said DTS' Neighbors.

MALLS STILL PUTTING THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER; RECOVERY: STORES SEVERELY HIT BY 
QUAKE FIGHT TIME, COMPETITION TO REOPEN. SOME PITCH AMBITIOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO 
WIN BACK CUSTOMERS.

<P>
 Resurrecting the Northridge Fashion Center from the rubble of the Jan. 17 
earthquake is turning out to be an even tougher challenge than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found more damage from the earthquake than we originally anticipated, 
so the renovation process is going to take longer," said Chan Chandler, 
spokeswoman for the mall's owner, MEPC American Properties of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier estimates had the 1.5-million-square-foot mall partially reopening in 
November. Mall officials now say two of their anchor stores, The Broadway and 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., will meet that deadline. But shoppers will now have to 
wait until spring -- more than a year after the quake -- for smaller stores to 
open along the corridors of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shooting for that deadline," said the Lloyd Miller, Northridge Fashion 
Center's general manager. "We want to make sure it's done right from the 
aesthetic, safety and leasing standpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 When it does return, Fashion Center is likely to face even more fierce 
competition than usual. While it has been closed, mall rivals such as Topanga 
Plaza and The Promenade in Woodland Hills have enjoyed 15% to 20% sales 
increases by attracting some of the 50,000 shoppers a day that used to 
patronize the Northridge mall. And they intend to hang on to as many of them as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, some are going to return to their old shopping habits," predicted 
Clyde Ahl, general manager at Topanga Plaza. "But we feel we're going to retain 
a number of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's Miller, however, is ready for battle. "The people I talk to can't 
wait to come back to Northridge," he said. "They're very excited to see what 
the renovation is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a survey of how hard-hit Valley malls are faring six months 
after the Northridge quake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge Fashion Center: The infamous images of devastation -- a crushed 
Bullock's store and pancaked parking garages -- are gone, but from the outside 
the mall still seems a long way from recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The only businesses currently operating are those located in the mall's 
ground-level parking lots, including restaurants, auto service centers, banks 
and The Broadway's temporary "Home Dome" store, which sells home furnishings in 
a giant, bubble-like tent. Some tenants admit it's been hard to convince 
customers that they are open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been kind of erratic," said Tom Boulanger, manager of the 
Pizzeria Uno restaurant. "But it's increasing steadily as people become more 
aware that we're open." MEPC, which purchased the 24-year-old Northridge mall 
one month before the earthquake, has ambitious renovation plans that include 
replacing carpet with multicolored granite tiles and installing elaborate 
skylights to illuminate indoor palm trees and fountains. For the first time, 
the center will also feature a food court. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say construction workers cannot start remodeling the mall 
interior until they have more places to park -- and completion of the four new 
parking structures is still months away. While the structure sites have been 
graded, only one of them has so far received a permit for foundations to be 
laid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway and Sears stores, which expect to reopen in November, in time for 
the holiday shopping season, can be served by ground-level parking with 
separate entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Robinson's-May stores aren't scheduled to reopen until spring, and 
the Bullock's might not reopen until September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway says its remodeled store will be the first in Southern California 
featuring a new design that has already been implemented in the company's 
Walnut Creek, Calif., and Las Vegas stores. "It will have a very different 
look, feel and architecture," said Bob Menar, executive vice-president of 
operations for Broadway Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The design features a circular configuration of merchandise displays and 
upgraded lighting. The store will also offer automated teller machines and 
customer service centers where shoppers can make free local telephone calls. 
"We want to provide a friendly, interactive shopping experience," Menar said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Topanga Plaza: Topanga Plaza, which avoided more serious quake damage thanks 
to a seismic upgrading in 1992, may only be three months away from complete 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Of its anchor stores, Nordstrom reopened in February and The Broadway followed 
last month. Mall officials say Montgomery Ward will be back by the end of 
August. That leaves Robinson's-May, scheduled to reopen Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the Robinson's-May store is an ugly skeleton of concrete 
columns and metal girders. "I bet people in the community think the store 
doesn't look like it will be ready," said company spokesman Jim Watterson. 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicted everything would be ready by Nov. 10. "This is a company 
where we don't miss deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Topanga Plaza's specialty stores, general manager Ahl reports that the 
quake has been something of a tonic. Store remodeling and the Northridge mall's 
closure have boosted traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales during the first six months of the year were up 20% on a same-store 
basis and up 48% overall compared with the same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become stronger," Ahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Promenade: Officials at The Promenade mall, which has struggled at times 
in the Valley's competitive retail market, also report a sales surge, fueled in 
part by customers replacing quake-damaged household items. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Same-store sales for the year to date have been up an average of 15% 
same-store with home furnishing categories up 70%, said general manager Kim 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were reluctant to replace their china when all the aftershocks were 
happening," she added. "Now things are more normal, they feel more comfortable 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential boost for the mall: The former site of the Saks Fifth Avenue 
store, which was ravaged by the quake, has been sold to AMC Theaters and will 
become a multiscreen cinema complex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fashion Square, Sherman Oaks: At Fashion Square, where water from sprinkler 
systems caused much of the quake-related damage, 94 specialty stores have 
reopened and another 23 should have completed remodeling by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing director Sandy Turner said renovation had helped many stores to 
upgrade their image and enhance their appeal to the affluent clientele the mall 
hopes to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes tenants come in, and they do cookie-cutter stores, they don't 
really look at what their market is," she said. "Now they have remodeled, they 
have seen an increase in shoppers with more upscale demographics." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mall's Bullock's and Broadway anchor stores still have one 
floor closed but expect to be fully open in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction began this month on a new parking structure behind The Broadway 
and is expected to take three months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sherman Oaks Galleria: At the Galleria, the twin Robinson's-May anchor 
stores are preparing for a grand reopening this weekend. That could be a mixed 
blessing for the mall's specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller stores appear to have benefited from the absence of competition 
with the anchors. According to a mall spokeswoman, same-store sales have been 
up a monthly average of 10% to 15% since February. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other hand, Galleria officials hope the return of Robinson's-May, 
with its relatively heavy promotional programs, will stimulate traffic 
mall-wide.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HUNTWAY PARTNERS TOLD TO STOP SEC VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntway Partners L.P., a Valencia-based processor of crude oils into liquid 
asphalt, said the Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered the company to 
"cease and desist" from any future violations of certain securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntway said it consented to the order without admitting to or denying any of 
the order's allegations, which stemmed from the SEC's investigation into 
alleged irregularities in the partnership's financial reporting in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began after Huntway disclosed in December, 1992, that it had 
discovered the reporting irregularities, which were allegedly made by a former 
officer of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC did not order Huntway to pay a monetary penalty, Huntway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntway President and Chief Executive Juan Forster said he was satisfied with 
the result of the SEC investigation.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SPECIAL DEVICES INC. TO BUY SCOT INC. FOR $5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special Devices Inc., a Newhall-based maker of pyrotechnic devices used in 
automotive air bags and tactical missile systems, has agreed to acquire all the 
assets and operations of a Chicago-area manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Devices said the purchase price for Scot Inc. will be about $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Scot designs and manufactures aircraft crew escape components and life support 
equipment that are activated with pyrotechnic mechanisms, including an 
automatic parachute release used by the U.S. Air Force. In 1993, Scot had sales 
of $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas F. Treinen, Special Devices' chairman and chief executive, said the 
acquisition of Scot would give his company a larger customer base for its 
aerospace operations, which historically have had higher profit margins than 
its automotive business. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, subject to certain conditions, is scheduled to be completed 
in mid-August.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SURVIVAL NO PROBLEM FOR DISASTER-BASED FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The past year's floods, hurricanes and earthquakes have helped double the 
sales of Survivor Industries Inc., reports Howard Wallace, the Newbury Park 
firm's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivor produces emergency kits containing blankets, water and its own 
high-nutritional food bars.The company's annual revenues are running at an 
$8-million pace for '94, which would be up from $4 million last year and $2 
million in 1992, Wallace reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, we sold mostly to the armed forces and multinational companies. 
Now, the majority of our business is retail. People are becoming 
emergency-conscious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately-held Survivor has 40 employees at its plant on Azurite Circle. "We'd 
love to supply our kits to the people who are starving in Africa and other 
parts of the world," Wallace noted. "But dealing with the bureaucracies 
involved can be difficult, to say the least."

<P>
 Cambrian Systems Inc., based in Simi Valley, has acquired the flying 
height-testing equipment unit of Chatsworth's Pacific Precision Laboratories. 
If you think that has anything to do with aerospace, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying height testing is computer-industry talk for measuring the performance 
of hard disk drives, says Joe Wallace, a Cambrian vice president who will 
become president of Cambrian Pacific Technologies. That will be a new company 
to combine the height-testing capabilities of Cambrian and its newly acquired 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambrian Pacific will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Cambrian Systems and 
will use its parent's plant. The new concern will have an initial payroll of 
14, 10 of whom will be transferred from Chatsworth to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Cambrian Systems nor JMAR Industries, a San Diego company that owns 
Pacific Precision, would disclose terms of the purchase.

COMPANIES REAPING SAVINGS WITH TEMPORARY WORKERS; BUSINESSES SHIFT EMPLOYMENT 
COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY TO OUTSIDE AGENCIES; EMPLOYEES FACE LIFE WITHOUT 
BENEFITS, SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Finkelman has sifted through the economic rubble left by the recession in 
Southern California, and thinks he has found a model for the future of 
employer-employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
 A former professor of industrial psychology who is now director of the Kelly 
Services temporary employment agency for Los Angeles County, Finkelman 
envisions that companies will keep cutting their staffs until they consist of 
little more than core groups of employees performing essential tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the work force, he says, will then belong to vast employee 
clearinghouses -- such as Kelly -- who will pay their salaries and benefits, 
and dispatch them to factories, plants and offices that need them . . . 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, Finkelman's vision may be a blueprint for success in the global 
economy. To others, it's a chilling undoing of the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But before you dismiss Finkelman's vision as self-serving, take a look at your 
workplace: from banking to biotechnology, temporary workers are playing an 
increasingly important role. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net, the big health maintenance organization in Woodland Hills, has 100 
temporary workers now, up one-third from a year ago and still rising. Health 
Net figures it saves up to half the total cost for each position by relying on 
temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell Electronics, a personal computer maker in Westlake Village, 
employs 800 to 1,000 temporary workers, up from just 50 in 1989. Most of the 
temps, who are one-third the work force at Packard Bell, do packing or loading 
jobs, or other light industrial tasks. Debbie A. Blum, human resources manager 
at the company, said temp agencies can better handle the recruitment of vast 
numbers of employees, and Packard Bell does not want to be stuck with a massive 
permanent staff if business ever falters. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the San Fernando Valley, and across the country, other companies are 
making similar moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Data from the state Employment Development Department shows that in Los 
Angeles County, employment at temporary help services jumped 14% between 1991 
and 1993, while total non-agricultural employment in the county fell 7%. 
Nationwide, about 15% of all jobs created during the economic recovery have 
been at temp services. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders have tripled over the past two years at the Glendale office of Manpower 
Inc., where manager Cheryl Storms said about 30 applicants a week file through 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manpower applicants go through a gantlet of tests that often take up to two 
hours. In a corner room, secretarial applicants type away at computers to 
demonstrate typing speed and familiarity with word processing programs. Behind 
a large window in the back of the office, laborers are given 10 minutes to 
complete "coordinated rapid movement tests" that include filing tiny cards into 
mailboxes with corresponding seven-digit codes, and plugging transistors, 
diodes and capacitors into mock computer circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One applicant in Manpower's office Monday was Suki Ewers. She does temp work 
to support her "regular" job as a keyboardist with a local band called Mazzy 
Star. Her rock group often takes off for monthlong tours, and next week she 
says her band will appear on the Conan O'Brien late-night TV show. But "there 
are big blocks of time when nothing's happening," Ewers said, and temporary 
secretarial work for $10 an hour can help pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly in Southern California, temp agencies are being inundated with 
applicants who lost well-paying, "permanent" jobs during the recession, or are 
looking for career changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caliber of temps has changed because a lot of people with great skills 
lost jobs," Manpower's Storms said. "Once it was people looking for . . . a 
flexible schedule. But now 85% of the people coming in are looking for 
40-hour-a-week work." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend can be seen as part of the overall squeeze felt by the middle class. 
Pay for temporary jobs ranges from minimum wage to as much as $20 an hour for 
technical positions, but even higher-salaried temps typically have little job 
security, rarely receive health insurance, get little or no paid vacation, and 
often are paid less than full-time workers who might otherwise be hired to do 
the same jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides relying on temporary workers, companies contract with outside firms 
for payroll, security and others services once handled by in-house employees. 
Businesses are also farming out more of their work to independent contractors 
who work on specific tasks. Some companies, including Health Net, are even 
experimenting with "employee leasing," in which whole groups of employees are 
transferred, on paper, to an outside firm. For a fee, that outside firm takes 
over administrative tasks including paying them and providing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Mitchell, a labor economist at UCLA, says it's all part of the most 
dramatic labor market shift since World War II, and that many workers will 
suffer during the transition. "There is a reluctance to make commitments to 
employees," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This transformation has meant booming business for many temporary employment 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been a bonanza," said Hank M. Hinse, regional manager for 
Manpower Inc. With 640,000 employees nationwide, Milwaukee-based Manpower now 
ranks as the largest private employer in the United States. Sales have jumped 
35% this year at its local offices in Glendale, Van Nuys and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not surprisingly, Kelly Services says the number of job applications 
they've received in the Valley area has tripled over the past five years. 
AppleOne CQsaid sales at the temp division of its Glendale office has 
quadrupled in four years. Select Temporary Services, a Santa Barbara-based 
company with offices in the Valley area, said to manage its growth its own 
staff has shot from three employees in 1985 to 125 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At On Assignment, a Calabasas-based temp agency that specializes in providing 
laboratory technicians and other highly skilled temps, profit zoomed from 
$166,000 in 1989 to $2.5 million last year, while its revenue rose from $7 
million to $38 million. And the company's roster of temps at its 32 offices 
nationwide has grown from 180 to 1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 On Assignment recruits heavily at local colleges, trying to line up science 
majors who have the education, but perhaps not enough experience, to land a 
permanent job. David Foerstner, 32, took science courses while pursuing a fine 
arts degree, and turned to On Assignment when he lost his production manager 
job at a clothing company in Los Angeles last year. Foerstner was placed almost 
immediately as an assistant in the test kitchen at a Van Nuys laboratory owned 
by Nestle, the Switzerland-based food conglomerate. Foerstner has been at the 
lab more than a year now, earning $12 an hour alongside temps from other 
agencies who are earning $7.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle saves 30% of the cost of each position by using a temp and not paying 
for health or retirement benefits, vacation, insurance and other payroll costs, 
said Lloyd Miller, manager of the Van Nuys lab.

 American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks uses temporary agencies to cut 
through the red tape of hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 When local college students apply for summer jobs at American Pacific, "We 
refer them to our temp agency," said Frank J. Ures, chief executive of the 
bank. "Unless we plan on hiring them permanently, it's a lot less hassle to run 
them through the temp agency." 
</P>
<P>
 With five temps working at the bank as tellers and secretaries, Ures estimates 
the bank saved 10% of the cost of each position by letting the temp agency file 
tax forms, take employee fingerprints and write paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bank converted to a temporary and part-time work force it could trim 
20% from its $6-million annual payroll, mostly through lower wages and reduced 
benefits, said Tamara Gurney, the bank's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bank won't switch because it worries customer service would suffer 
without full-time workers who know the business and the customers, Gurney said.

 Local temp agencies also benefit from Southern California employers' 
reluctance to make permanent hires after undergoing painful downsizing during 
the recession. Even when business picks up, some companies feel safer making 
temporary hires. 
</P>
<P>
 To capitalize on this, Kelly has a new program selecting its most experienced 
and talented workers and putting them into jobs -- mostly secretarial or 
clerical -- that are expected to become permanent positions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employer gets nervous, or is unhappy with the Kelly nominee, the worker 
can be returned any time within the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Temp agency sales pitches also play on employers' anxieties over the future of 
health care reform, the rise in fraudulent worker's compensation claims and 
fears of wrongful termination or discrimination lawsuits. Because temps are 
employees of their agencies, the burden of liability falls to the temp service. 
</P>
<P>
 For most employers, however, the bottom line is still the most compelling 
reason to use temps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temp option presents the perfect solution to holding down the overhead 
costs while acquiring talent on an as-needed basis," said James J. Wilk, vice 
president of human resources at Health Net, an HMO with 1,300 permanent 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net's use of temps during the summer has quadrupled in the past four 
years, Wilk said, mostly because it can find enough temps for high-skill 
positions. Almost half of Health Net's temps work as graphic artists, technical 
writers and in other skilled positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net saves money, Wilk said, not because the temps earn less that a 
permanent worker would, but because the company can unload the temps when the 
peak season passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in temporary employment has been, at best, a mixed blessing for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Temp agencies are quick to point out that the service they provide helps 
employers to make temporary hires when they might have made none, and that they 
continue to provide an important service for students and others looking for 
part-time work or extra income. Further, temp agencies say one-third of their 
employees find permanent work at their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Rosas, a receptionist at CareAmerica, an HMO in Woodland Hills, hopes 
her job will soon be converted from temporary to permanent status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At CareAmerica for six weeks now, Rosas earns $3 less an hour than she did as 
a secretary at an accounting firm in Brentwood. But she doesn't have to worry 
about health care because she's covered by her husband's policy, and she no 
longer spends 10 hours in her car each week commuting from her Woodland Hills 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for generations of Americans who were raised on the middle-class 
promises of secure jobs and good benefits in exchange for hard work and 
loyalty, the temporary employment trend points to an unsettling future. 
</P>
<P>
 Foerstner, the lab technician placed at Nestle by On Assignment, considers 
himself among the luckier temps in Southern California because he's worked 
steadily and been paid well for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 But life without benefits, vacation and job security has begun to wear on 
Foerstner. And he's learned that full-time technicians who do the same thing he 
does, at Nestle and other labs, are earning 40% more. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Nestle has announced plans to shut down its Van Nuys lab in the 
fall, and Foerstner will be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again I'm back in the same position," Foerstner said. "I feel helpless. 
It's like it's this big Monopoly game and the big companies are winning and 
we're the little pieces that get bought and sold."

 Restraining order -- A story in The Times on July 23 incorrectly reported that 
a judge had rejected a request for an injunction by county prosecutors and 
Norwalk officials to limit the activities of a gang that authorities say is 
terrorizing residents. The judge actually denied a request for a restraining 
order and set a hearing on the request for an injunction for Aug. 25.
