ROBIN ABCARIAN: HAND-IN-HAND SPIRIT IS LOSING ITS GRIP

 The intersection of Devonshire and Sepulveda was a sight to behold on the 
morning of the quake. Cars were lined up in four directions, three, even four 
across. Drivers sat patiently, gripping the wheels a bit tighter than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the kind of traffic jam that would normally make you want to scream, 
or maybe lay on the horn just to work out a few psychic kinks. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one disturbed the fragile peace, not even the drivers behind the guy 
whose camper-topped truck had stalled. His hood was up, but no one behind him 
could see that, thanks to the camper shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pardon me," I said as I drove around him. "Might you put your emergency 
blinkers on so people know to go around?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," he said, in grease to his elbows. "If I had the power for that, I 
wouldn't be in the middle of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh. In that case, I'm terribly sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went at the beginning of last week, at intersections all over town: 
"You go first." "No, you." "I insist." 
</P>
<P>
 We were a city of Chips 'n' Dales, so sweet it almost made your teeth hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, how long could it last? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some people came undone fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Pharmacy is as venerable a landmark as you can find in that 
community, and one of the busiest independent pharmacies in the country. It's 
been in business for 65 years; for 30 of those at the northwest corner of 
Reseda and Nordhoff. More than a pharmacy, the store has a large gift shop and 
the best cosmetics counter this side of a department store. It is known for its 
personal service and loyal customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmacist Barry Pascal, 50, has owned Northridge Pharmacy for two decades. 
Last Thursday, with virtually no sleep or food since the quake, he was 
supervising an immense clean up, filling prescriptions, and mourning for 
customers who had perished in the Northridge Meadows apartments a few blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was conducted out of a small corner of the store -- most of the place 
was awash in broken shelving, porcelain, crystal and sundries. Pascal estimated 
the loss at anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers were being allowed in one at a time, which led to some frayed 
tempers, particularly among some of the older people. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, in fact, a minor psychodrama had played itself out, one from 
which Pascal was still recovering when we met. A longtime customer, maybe 60, 
had lost it over a minor problem with a prescription. She screamed at Pascal 
that she would never shop there again. 
</P>
<P>
 The pharmacist blew up: "Don't you say that! We just lost everything here!" 
</P>
<P>
 As he told me the story, Pascal was unrepentant but philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I had to take a stand on was taking over the power," he explained. 
"Complainers are in control. So the issue is not that I lost control, but that 
I was taking it back. When someone loses control you have to slap them in the 
face -- metaphorically, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 The customer, he said, was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just give me a hug," she said finally, "that's all I need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a Valley police officer said, the phone lines are beginning to light 
up with calls about domestic disturbances, neighbor disputes and traffic 
altercations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot yet," said Sgt. J.J. Thompson of the Devonshire Division, which 
covers the northwest Valley, "but those are the kinds of things we are starting 
to see. We have been surprised that there has been domestic stuff right in the 
middle of all this. You think people would forget the problems they have and 
hold hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who screamed at their kids or spouse -- or pharmacist -- for no reason 
last week could tell him otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this surprises Jamie Lee Hoffer, a Brentwood graphics designer who 
lost her Marina District apartment in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, then endured 
months of nightmarish commutes over the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first," she said, "people got very hand in hand, stranger with stranger. 
Everyone opened up their house, people cooked for each other. It was very 
similar to what we experienced here. Then you found that people retreated 
inward. Everybody became a bit reclusive. There was a quiet period. Then it got 
bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 The city known for its civility went feral. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just lost it," Hoffer said. "I saw people get out of their cars on the 
bridge and have fistfights," she said. "I saw them pull people out of their 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Please Angelenos, let us not turn into a mob of unruly San Franciscans!  
</P>
<P>
 We are all running late for work. We are all running late for dinner. We are 
all running low on patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Damn lucky, too. 
</P>
<P>
 After all . . . we're alive.

BOOK REVIEW: NONFICTION; A POWERFUL STORY OF SELF-DISCOVERY, SURVIVAL IN THE 
WILD; BACK FROM TUICHI: THE HARROWING LIFE-AND-DEATH STORY OF SURVIVAL IN THE 
AMAZON RAINFOREST, BY YOSSI GHINSBERG ; RANDOM HOUSE, $22, 239 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All great stories of survival start out as something else -- an airplane fight 
over the Andes, a cruise around the world by sailboat, or, in the case of Yossi 
Ghinsberg's "Back From Tuichi," an expedition into the Amazon rain forest in 
search of gold, wild animals and natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many young Israelis, Ghinsberg set off in search of adventure after 
completing his military service, and he joined the other young vagabonds -- or 
mochileros -- who wandered the byways and backwaters of South America. The 
symbol of their freedom, as Ghinsberg explains, was the backpack, or mochila . 
</P>
<P>
 "Every nomad knows the feeling," writes Ghinsberg. "The idea is to carry 
everything on your back, forget your troubles, let tomorrow take care of 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghinsberg's journey into the rain forest, as we learn, was the idea of an 
Austrian expatriate named Karl, a colorful but faintly sinister character who 
attached himself to Yossi and his friends in La Paz, and offered to serve as 
their guide on what he promised would be a particularly memorable trip by raft 
down the Tuichi River. Karl was right, as we learn in "Back From Tuichi," but 
for the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Karl is the central figure in the mystery that unfolds in 
Ghinsberg's book. Was Karl a geologist, as he sometimes claimed to be? A gold 
and uranium prospector? Or an international fugitive with a price on his head? 
Did he really have an uncle who was a Nazi war criminal in hiding on a distant 
rancho? And exactly why did Karl tantalize Ghinsberg and his friends with 
half-truths and outright lies about what they would find in the rain forest? 
</P>
<P>
 Ghinsberg's account of the expedition is as enchanting to us as Karl's stories 
must have been to Yossi and his traveling companions, an American named Kevin 
and a Swiss named Marcus. He shows himself to be a gifted storyteller as he 
describes the treacherous rapids of the Tuichi River, the snake-infested 
thickets of the rain forest, the forbidding cliffs that lay between the young 
adventurers and the village where they intended to catch a bush flight back to 
La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, the expedition goes wrong in subtle ways. Karl's lies 
begin to reveal themselves; the young men fall out with each other; the rain 
forest exacts a far harsher price than they had expected to pay. In its darkest 
passages, "Back From Tuichi" is a Conradian tale of men at odds with themselves 
and each other in the very heart of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment of greatest crisis, Ghinsberg finds himself utterly alone in the 
mal paso of the Tuichi River, an impassable canyon where white water crushes 
the improvised raft that was to carry the young men to safety. And now the real 
adventure begins: Can Ghinsberg survive -- alone, unarmed, untrained and poorly 
provisioned -- in the Amazon rain forest? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a man of action," Ghinsberg tells himself in a phrase that becomes his 
mantra during his long, lonely ordeal in the rain forest. "Don't cry. Don't 
break now." 
</P>
<P>
 What allowed Ghinsberg to survive alone in the wilderness? As in other 
classics of the literature of survival, Ghinsberg describes the blend of 
physical courage, practical knowledge and quiet spirituality that allows him to 
survive the deadliest threats of the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most fascinating passages in "Back From Tuichi" describe the 
improvised jungle craft that allowed the intrepid Ghinsberg to prevail against 
hunger and injury, leeches and fire ants, jaguars and wild boars, high water 
and thunderstorms. And yet Ghinsberg's bravery and ingenuity are not the only 
secrets of his survival. Ghinsberg placed his faith in a little book that a 
beloved uncle has bestowed upon him, a talisman that saves his life and his 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun shone over me," he writes of a sublime moment of respite during the 
lonely jungle trek. "Every now and then I put another ripe tamarind in my mouth 
and greedily sucked the sweet flesh from the pits. Wild beauty surrounded me . 
. . alone in the heart of the wilderness along with whoever was watching over 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 I will not reveal exactly how Ghinsberg's ordeal turned out, but the end of 
his sojourn in the rain forest is not the end of the adventure -- or of the 
mystery. We learn Kevin's fate, but Ghinsberg leaves us only with an intriguing 
bit of speculation about what became of Karl and Marcus -- an explanation that 
only deepens the ominous shadows behind Ghinsberg's story of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm doing here in South America is looking for the extraordinary," 
Ghinsberg wrote his brother before his journey. "Mystical religious ceremonies, 
pagan rites. . . . Unusual people, places that have their special atmosphere, 
new friends, all those things." 
</P>
<P>
 As we discover in "Back From Tuichi," Ghinsberg found all of the exotic 
experiences in the rain forest of South America. But, at the end of his 
remarkable book, we understand that he happened upon something even more 
extraordinary -- and he found it in himself.

<P>
 The Movie: "Intersection." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) can't decide whether to remain in a 
non-working marriage with his business-partner wife Sally (Sharon Stone, 
pictured) or to leave her for a better relationship with Olivia (Lolita 
Davidovich). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Ellen Mirojnick, whose credits include "Wall Street," 
"Fatal Attraction," "Chaplin" and "Basic Instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Wrapped in their soft, fuzzy lives, Vincent, a successful architect, 
and Sally, his icy wife, show us how much fun getting up and getting dressed 
for work can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you can't afford to swath yourself in cashmere sweaters from dawn to 
dusk, as these two do, you'll get tips on looking thoroughly professional 
without standard offices staples. There's not a suit in sight, for him or for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Palette: Non colors. They're just more chic, you know. For Sally, it's 
pleated trousers in taupe, light brown and sand; short fitted skirts, and one 
great-looking unconstructed cardigan-jacket. They're worn with same-colored 
sweaters and the most tasteful accessories possible: printed silk scarves 
(ditto for colors), diamond stud earrings, diamond wedding band, crocodile 
belts and a large pigskin handbag. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent wears charcoal-gray everything: overcoat, sport jacket, rayon challis 
shirts, pleated slacks and ties with barely perceptible patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia, the free-spirited Every Girl, wears free-spirited textured hand-knits 
in vibrant colors. Get it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Mirojnick focused on the "internal makeup" of the principal 
characters. Because Sally's not meant to be all bad, her cool, calculated 
clothing is done in the softest fibers. Vincent's ambivalence is signaled by 
his unrelenting palette of grays. Olivia is loose, her clothes are loose, her 
colors are loose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hemline Watch: Sally's are high (lower thigh), Olivia's are low (just above 
the ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Sally's high glamour moment. At a cocktail party, she wears a short, 
simple sheath and a giant diamond brooch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Hair Day: Grace Kelly must be the inspiration for Sally's fancy twists and 
knots; they're of another time and place -- like 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Sally's cashmere sweaters are from N. Peal and Calvin Klein; her 
scarves and handbag, Hermes; her cardigan jacket, Dries Van Noten; her jewelry, 
Martin Precious Jewels of Beverly Hills. Mirojnick designed the sheath dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's overcoat and sport jackets were designed by Armani; his cashmere 
sweaters, N. Peal and Paul Stuart; ties, Calvin Klein. Nat Wise in Beverly 
Hills made his shirts.

INTO THE NIGHT / JEANNINE STEIN: GREAT SHOW, BUT THAT QUAKE . . . 
</P>

 The Scene: The postponed opening of "Fool Moon" on Monday night at the 
Doolittle Theatre. The Bill Irwin/David Shiner show that features the Red Clay 
Ramblers was scheduled to have its L.A. premiere last week, but . . . well, we 
all know what happened. Although part of the Doolittle's balcony was still 
closed for repairs (it's supposed to be finished this week), the show went off 
without a hitch and rain didn't keep away a gaggle of celebs, some of whom 
dashed over to the Columbia Bar & Grill afterward for a party. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: The earthquake. The show. Damage from the earthquake. How great the 
show was. Will we have another earthquake? The show was wonderful. How about 
that earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Showing up for "Fool Moon" were Richard Thomas (with son 
Richard Jr.), John Ritter, Rene Auberjonois, David Steinberg, John Glover, 
Blythe Danner and Helen Slater; spotted also at the party were Garry Marshall, 
Joanne Worley, Bruce Davison and Lisa Pelikan, Michael Feinstein and Jack 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Several men decided to sport the professorial schlump look (worn, 
droopy houndstooth jacket with ill-fitting brown pants and scuffed bucks), 
while others opted for the total black-out ensemble. Some women were still 
riding the velvet-frock-coat wave, and one young woman wore a cropped top that 
displayed her navel. A man at the party was spotted in a red jacket, which 
guaranteed that at some point someone would mistake him for the parking valet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Knowing that the masses would be hungry, the restaurant set out pizzas, 
stuffed mushrooms, beef on skewers and egg rolls. Desserts included fruit and 
fudge. Some guests ate as if they were preparing for the next quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Show Must Go On, Part I: "The first (preview) show we did last week, I've 
never done a show like that in my life," Shiner said. "Everybody was just on 
edge -- the actors, the musicians, the audience. To think about doing a 
premiere after a major earthquake is unthinkable. I never thought in my career 
that that would be something to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Show Must Go On, Part II: "I had an incident like this once before," 
co-producer Jim Freydberg said. "We lost a show, 'Burn This,' to the San 
Francisco earthquake (in 1989). But my initial feeling was, when it all 
happened, that this is the perfect show for people who have just been through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "You'd better move your car if you're parked in Gower Gulch," 
someone warned Irwin, who had parked his car in the shopping center across the 
street. "They will tow you. Once they even towed (producer) Jimmy Doolittle's 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parting Shot: A woman on her way out of the party stopped at the maitre d's 
station, grabbed a fistful of mints and jammed them into her purse.

MUSIC REVIEW; ELLIOTT CARTER UNDER GREEN UMBRELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elliott Carter, who turned 85 last month, is a master. Everyone knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 His music isn't particularly accessible. Everyone knows that too. 
</P>
<P>
 He even knows it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who spend a lot of effort on my music find it very rewarding," he 
said in a Times interview a few days ago. "I've always thought, to tell the 
truth, that I was really not writing for an audience, but writing for 
performers playing the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders were not surprised when Carter was awarded the National Medal of Arts 
in 1985. They were a bit amused, however, when they realized that the honor 
would be bestowed by a liberal, dauntlessly supportive connoisseur of creative 
esoterica named Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan? Ronald Reagan! Chacun a son degout , and all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night -- despite dissonance, rain, aftershocks and crumbled freeways -- 
Carter drew a reasonably large audience to the Japan America Theatre, where the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic offered a belated birthday concert as part of its 
endangered Green Umbrella series. Our former president was not spotted in the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. The audience was discerning, respectful and receptive. It mustered 
a standing ovation at the end, when the composer took the stage to congratulate 
his canny interpreters and take a reticent bow. The performances were 
appreciative.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one left the hall whistling. Elliott Carter never wrote tunes in the 
obvious, conventional sense. He never courted the masses. He was content to 
fascinate the loyal cognoscenti, and occasionally to mystify them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a cliche -- and not a particularly useful one -- to claim that Carter 
created his own definition of melody, fractured it and then used it as a linear 
means toward a non-linear end. His music changed its accents and its 
ingredients, along with its structural philosophies, over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He never made the listening easy. He never offered a direct appeal to the gut. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, Carter remains a thinking man's composer. That also makes 
him a composer's composer. It was none less than Igor Stravinsky who judged 
Carter's Double Concerto, which brought the Green Umbrella program to its 
climactic close, as the first true American masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 This composer never compromised, never allowed concessions. He dealt in 
compression where others opted for expansion. He focused on tiny details, and 
the juxtaposition of vastly disparate tiny details, where others toyed with the 
grandiose line and the whomping cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His music, cerebral to a fault, has always revealed its complex secrets, 
gradually, to anyone able to analyze it, and to anyone patient enough to return 
for repeated hearings. Carter's music is the sort that can give academia a good 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 The three difficult pieces presented under the shade of the Green Umbrella 
represented Carter in three different phases of his career. The evolutionary 
contrasts proved instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonata for cello and piano, written in 1948, documents the decline, if not 
the decay, of neoclassicism. It is taut and compact, more forbidding at the 
outset than in the movements that follow. Essentially, it is an inspired duet 
for two stressful virtuosos who speak at the same time, refuse to listen to 
each other, yet follow expressive courses that turn out to be oddly compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Lum, the cellist, and Gloria Cheng, the pianist, unraveled its knots 
brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sleep, in Thunder," written in 1981, finds Carter responding crisply, even 
wildly, to the manic mood swings of late poems by Robert Lowell. The jagged 
vocal lines defy the laws of conventional lyricism; they also ignore the 
stresses of conventional drama. They do provide a central force, however, to 
offset the contrapuntal comments of Carter's frantic little orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Young was the bravely accurate if somewhat monochromatic tenor soloist. 
Oliver Knussen, making his last appearance of the season as conductor, enforced 
clarity and momentum amid the crafty chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Double Concerto for harpsichord, piano and two chamber orchestras, written 
in 1961, still makes a mighty noise in many, marvelous ways. The keyboard 
sounds are delicately balanced and subtly contrasted. The orchestral output -- 
don't call it accompaniment -- lends new layers of meaning to the concept of 
purposeful busyness. The percussive interplay provides heroically assertive 
punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Knussen functioned as artful referee among the friendly antagonists: Grant 
Gershon at the discreetly amplified harpsichord, Gloria Chen at the piano, and 
some obviously inspired members of the Philharmonic New Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good night for rugged individualism.

THEATER REVIEW; SHAKING WITH LAUGHTER; 'FOOL MOON' SHINES WITH SPIRITED LUNACY 
</P>

<P>
 There's a "Fool Moon" over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not "full" -- fool . As in "hoot." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a crying shame. Don't clowns Bill Irwin and David Shiner know this is 
a city in mourning? 
</P>
<P>
 But lunacy is no excuse to change the James A. Doolittle Theatre into a fool's 
paradise. These are goofs who at the funeral turn sniffles to giggles just by 
walking in. Their idea of formal attire is a pointed hat, plaid vest and baggy 
pants. It hurts to laugh, but we can't help it. They console the survivors 
while adjusting their toupees. They twitch, stumble, drop canes or open 
umbrellas in the hearse. They apologize, but then lose control of a leg, twirl 
in a St. Vitus dance and fall into the grave. Or sneeze into the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 They're human aftershocks causing seismic laughter. We had a 6.6 on the 
Richter scale of earthquakes. Now we have a 10.3 in laughter cracking us up. 
The city can't take it. Floods, fires, riots, earthquake and now Irwin and 
Shiner, the two clowns of the apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the National Guard when we need 'em? Forget looters. These evil twins 
ain't PC. Politically correct is a hat held over the heart, not a pointed cap 
that flies around like Tweety Bird fleeing Sylvester. Arrest these maniacs. 
They belong on "America's Most Wanted," not in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick look at their mug sheets should provide all the evidence needed. 
Shiner's a fugitive from some gypsy circus called Cirque du Soleil, who's been 
videotaped conducting tape-recorded symphonies. Irwin's a New Yorker who's 
lived out of a trunk ever since escaping the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey 
Circus Clown College. They first conspired together in New York during Lincoln 
Center's "Serious Fun!" festival. But do Southern Californians need "serious 
fun"? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics from less troubled cities called Irwin's "The Regard of Flight" 
production "avant-garde vaudeville," and in 1983 when that show played here it 
was welcome. Such humor is dangerous now. Last year, Broadway adored "Fool 
Moon," but Hollywood's Doolittle has cracks in its balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, building inspectors may discover these cracks were caused by 
opening night howls, not by the earthquake. When was the last time that 
dignified building experienced something like a thousand belly-laughs? 
</P>
<P>
 It all began Monday night when Shiner couldn't find his seat. The usher tried 
to protect the innocent citizen in the third row, but with limited success. 
Over the course of the next two hours, Shiner repeatedly returned to humiliate 
the poor victim. He stole money from another guy's wallet. Poured tumblers of 
popcorn from the balcony onto unsuspecting patrons. Stole women's coats. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids in the audience loved it, but what do they know? When Shiner required 
"volunteers" for a variety of stage crimes -- including a slapstick silent 
movie routine that made this critic cry -- the pitiless villain wasted no time 
in dragging audience members onto the stage. Worse, Shiner mocks us in 
pantomime, pointing and whistling like Harpo Marx. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin is no innocent bystander. His deadpan expression conceals a devious 
intent. Irwin's yo-yo body mutates like computer-generated special effects, a 
human terminator. He's not above disguising himself in commedia dell'arte 
costumes while playing both Harlequin and Pantalone. Normal human beings could 
not change costumes so quickly, proof of Irwin's con artistry. But "normal" 
does not apply to a body that can shrink to midget size, or stretch out like a 
mushroom-fed Alice in Wonderland. Freud would understand why Irwin is 
repeatedly dragged helplessly offstage by his own foot into some imaginary 
black hole; Freud would diagnose such grotesque behavior as neurotic guilt 
manifesting unconscious escape impulses.  
</P>
<P>
 Irwin and Shiner won't talk. They'll never confess their crimes because they 
never speak. But they do make noise with co-conspirators, the Red Clay 
Ramblers, a dizzy group somehow resembling the defunct Spike Jones band. They 
play jazz and country and even sing gospel. Is it an accident that these 
musicians punish us with forgotten songs like "I Crept Into the Crypt and 
Cried" or "Hiawatha's Lullaby"? 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Clay Ramblers allow Irwin to perform a wicked tango. Such music 
permits Irwin and Shiner to dance together like Fred Astaire and Mrs. 
Doubtfire. Do we need such irreverence now? 
</P>
<P>
 What the city of the angels needs is disaster relief. When Irwin and Shiner 
ride a silver moon into a starry night, waving goodby, they leave their 
audience in tears, mercifully shaken and on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 So brace yourself, Los Angeles. You're about to get "Fool Moon" struck.

 Will Regis Follow Dave?: All the involved parties are keeping mum, but reports 
are circulating that CBS -- along with talk show host David Letterman -- is 
trying to lure Regis Philbin to fill the long-empty post-"Late Show With David 
Letterman" slot. Like "Late Show," Philbin's program would presumably be a talk 
show with additional "entertainment" elements. Letterman, who effectively 
"owns" the hour following his show as part of his deal with CBS, is a big 
admirer of Philbin, who still has 1 1/2 years remaining on his "Live with Regis 
and Kathie Lee" contract and would likely keep his day job as well. And 
Philbin, a frequent Letterman guest, has been seen around the "Late Show" 
offices a good deal lately. CBS had no comment, Philbin and his agent Jim 
Griffin were unreachable, and Letterman and his staff are away on vacation.

 FCC Boss Issues a Warning: The chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission is keeping the heat on broadcasters to reduce violent programming. 
Speaking to a Florida meeting of the National Assn. of Television Program 
Executives, Reed Hundt said he hoped the industry would reduce TV violence on 
its own, but that he was ready to pursue the issue in Congress and the courts 
if necessary. "I am interested in challenging not your willingness to pay for 
lawyers, but your capability for creative and caring action," the FCC chairman 
said, adding: "If Congress passes legislation concerning TV violence and if the 
FCC has a role in implementing that legislation, we will do whatever we can to 
win . . . for the government. And we would have strong arguments. . . . If a TV 
sitcom can sell soap, salsa and cereal, then who could argue that TV violence 
cannot affect to some degree some viewers, particularly impressionable 
children?"

 Goofed Radio Promo: Talk radio station KABC-AM (790) found itself in a time 
warp Monday night when it mistakenly aired a promo for an Oprah Winfrey 
television movie that aired in November. The promo for "There Are No Children 
Here" aired twice during the evening show of feminist attorney Gloria Allred. 
The film, which aired Nov. 28, was described Monday as "one of the highlights 
of the holiday season." KABC officials couldn't immediately explain how the 
2-month-old spot got on the air. LEGAL FILE

 Marky Mark Sued: A woman who was trampled by fans when pop rapper Marky Mark 
dropped his trousers during a performance in Portland, Me., is suing the 
performer and Calvin Klein underwear model, whose real name is Mark Wahlberg. 
In the suit, Sandra Gessner says she was pushed over her friend's wheelchair 
and knocked to the floor when Wahlberg danced in his underwear and invited the 
crowd to rush the stage at the Portland Expo a year ago. Gessner, a 26-year-old 
with arthritis, can no longer care for herself because of the injuries, her 
attorney said. She is seeking unspecified damages from Wahlberg, concert 
promoters and the city of Portland. In response, Wahlberg's lawyer, Oliver 
Mitchell, said, "It's hard to imagine that the performer would be in any way 
responsible for the reaction of a crowd under those circumstances." STAGE

It will be staged by the playhouse's associate director, Lisa Peterson, and 
will explore the affinity between Brecht's half-Westernized China and the 
Mexican-American cultural traditions of the San Diego area, according to a

DANCE REVIEW; 'RUHR-ORT' A STARK AND POWERFUL WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The structuralist, task-oriented modern dance that evolved in the 1970s meets 
the hyperathletic, object-obsessed movement metaphor of the '90s in "RUHR-ORT" 
("A Place Called the Ruhr"), an ambitious, 70-minute male septet by German 
choreographer Susanne Linke. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented Sunday in the brand-new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts 
Center at Cal State Long Beach -- and perfect for the stadium-style anonymity 
of that 1,162-seat venue -- "RUHR-ORT" aims to fuse impressions of the German 
industrial heartland with a feminist appraisal of the workers from that region. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with the ominous mechanical clatter and rumble of Ludger Brummer's 
soundscore, followed by the dimmest, smokiest glimpses imaginable of a bleak 
workplace designed by Frank Leimbach. Soon, Linke's men are climbing ladders, 
pounding a metal platform with sledgehammers and moving heavy steel ingots to 
the rhythm of quasi-military cadences, with time off for fishing, fistfights 
and a communal shower. 
</P>
<P>
 In one segment, her dancers may portray workers operating a machine; in the 
next, they'll become the machine itself or competitors from the sports world, 
or prison inmates or army recruits in training. Running-in-place becomes a 
central image, with the runner sometimes collapsed forward, holding himself off 
the floor on clenched fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Kreisiment's stark overhead and side lighting enhances the sense of 
weight and the desperate camaraderie of what Linke portrays as a dual 
"Gotterdammerung": both an industrial apocalypse and the last gasp of brute 
masculinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Without seeing her companion "Frauenballett" ("Woman's Ballet") of 1981, it's 
impossible to judge fairly her political stance, although she seems to give men 
points for sheer endurance and certainly includes enough vignettes depicting 
exhaustion and fearful isolation to absolve these men of any complicity in 
creating the living hell on view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also probably unfair to complain that "RUHR-ORT" recapitulates the 
achievements of a whole modernist sub-genre -- with glints of the stagecraft 
and thematic preoccupations of everything from Twyla Tharp's "Fait Accompli" to 
Lin Hixson's Goat Island repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Linke and her collaborators give us not a personal vision of the 
Ruhr so much as the house style of the Frankfurt Ballet under William Forsythe. 
Elsewhere, the workers she wants to evoke vanish and what we see is merely a 
grandiose Teutonic gloss on the great American postmodernists. 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome as this sense of deja vu may be, it in no way diminishes the 
remarkable power and dedication of the cast: Reinhold Behling, Urs Dietrich, 
Ari Fastman, Karsten Itterbeck, Avi Kaiser, Henry Montes and Thomas Stich.

MOVIE REVIEW; TANGLED SCENARIO TURNS THRILLER 'BLINK' INTO A BLUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scenario for "Blink" (citywide) is so convoluted that even Hitchcock might 
have gotten tangled up in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma Brody (Madeleine Stowe) is a country-rock musician, a violinist, who lost 
her sight as a child when her mother rammed her head into a mirror. A corneal 
transplant operation has restored Emma's sight -- sort of. She sees things as a 
blur and, in some cases, she retains images that only become clear a day or two 
later. (Her optometrist calls this phenomenon "ocular flashback.") When she 
responds to a scuffle in her apartment one night, the next day offers up the 
image of the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 But will the cops believe her as an eyewitness? 
</P>
<P>
 Full of severe shadows and jagged shock effects, "Blink" is compelling without 
being very pleasurable. It has an acrid, cruel undercurrent that disguises an 
essential hollowness. (The Faye Dunaway-Tommy Lee Jones shocker "Eyes of Laura 
Mars," which influenced "Blink," was much stronger.) 
</P>
<P>
 Without the visual trickeries of director Michael Apted, "Blink" might just 
seem like a muddled thriller. It sort of seems that way anyway, but it does 
have at least one thing to recommend it: Madeleine Stowe's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Stowe has been cast primarily for her extraordinary beauty in films like 
"Revenge," "Unlawful Entry" and "The Last of the Mohicans" but, as she 
demonstrated in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," she's also an extraordinary 
actress. The shorn lyricism of her beauty in "Blink" gives her a scary frailty; 
she's entirely convincing as a woman whose damaged eyes are her only way into 
the world. Stowe doesn't play Emma as a forlorn helpless maiden though; there's 
a frazzled gutsiness in the way she maneuvers against the serial killer who 
stalks her. 
</P>
<P>
 As the detective in charge of tracking down the killer, Aidan Quinn seems to 
be posturing for another movie altogether -- a more enjoyable one. He's always 
fun to watch but he doesn't connect with Stowe's hyperventilating vim; their 
romance seems scripted rather than felt. He acts like he's prepping to star in 
a TV cop series. ("Columbo's Nephew," maybe?) 
</P>
<P>
 "Blink," which was scripted by Dana Stevens, does keep you guessing about the 
killer's identity. That's not intended as compliment, exactly. The guessing is 
just a way for us to stay in the movie. If you don't bother to sort out the 
clues and red herrings, what reason is there to stay put?

MUSIC REVIEW; CHALLENGING ORCHESTRAL FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra has a new conductor, Lara 
Webber, and their second concert together -- Sunday afternoon at the Japan 
America Theatre -- showed that good things are in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was a challenging one for orchestra and conductor alike: "The 
Unanswered Question" by Ives, the First Cello Concerto by Shostakovich, the 
"Pastoral" Symphony by Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, a master's student of Daniel Lewis at USC, showed confident, even 
authoritative, podium skills, leading performances orderly in design and 
execution, and unlabored in effect. That they didn't reach the peaks of musical 
expression can only be expected from an orchestra and conductor so new to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 What Webber has already achieved, however, is considerable. She has her 
musicians playing well together, listening to one another, in tune and in 
control. They do not force their tones, and they showed a great sensitivity to 
dynamics, producing some especially impressive sounds in the softer levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pastoral" Symphony emerged properly gentle and graceful, securely 
executed, with solid contributions from the solo woodwinds in general, and 
flutist Elizabeth Rowe and oboist Karen Wagner in particular. Webber drew some 
shining playing from her strings in the Ives, and gave its separate strands 
their due disparate characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal cellist Cameron Stone was called to solo in the Shostakovich 
concerto, and at first appeared vanquished by two strings that broke on 
separate occasions. After replacing them, he continued apparently unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone proved a focused, technically accomplished player, and it was -- not 
surprising, considering his age -- the romping, driving outer movements, rather 
than the brooding inner ones, that showed him at his vigorous, intense best. 
The orchestra supported neatly but sometimes a little too politely. TIMOTHY

TV REVIEWS; 'BABYLON 5': NOT STELLAR BUT ENTERTAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is good news and bad news about "Babylon 5," the latest in a burgeoning 
cluster of sci-fi series streaking across your television screen (premiering at 
8 tonight on KCOP-TV Channel 13). 
</P>
<P>
 The show's premise is not exactly original but it's not a copycat "Star Trek" 
either.Imagine a five-mile-long, futuristic, United Nations-style space station 
called Babylon 5 spinning through the galaxies as a port-of-last-call, a 
neutral zone on which humans and alien creatures live peacefully and work out 
their differences. That is, until raiders from a disaffected planet blow up a 
friendly agricultural colony and threaten to divide the galactic's fragile 
political and economic harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, it does sound a little familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nothing in the future, emotionally speaking, has changed. The script by 
writer-creator J. Michael Straczynski, set in the year 2258, wryly mirrors the 
insanity of the world today with several stinging sci-fi analogies, including 
references to a terrorist nuking of San Diego and the destruction of our first 
Mars colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically impressive, and perfectly scaled to TV, the production hardware is 
fashioned by compelling, low-key, desk-top-generated computer effects (designed 
by Ron Thornton), including vrooming "Star Wars"-like spitfire marauders. 
Visually, the opening four-minute action sequence is textbook editing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the negative side: Notwithstanding improvements on the show's year-old 
pilot broadcast, characterization is highly uneven. The weirdos and bad guys 
are flavorful enough, like ghosts from that "Stars Wars" barroom scene (notably 
the lizard-like Andreas Katsulas). But the space station's twin commanders 
(Michael O'Hare and Claudia Christian) are insufferably stiff and seemingly 
incapable of animated expression, and the dialogue is occasionally banal and 
trite. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to paraphrase poet Robert Frost, there's miles to go before this show 
will put you to sleep. RAY LOYND

TV RATINGS; NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME POWERS CBS TO A WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "PrimeTime Live" racked up its biggest ratings ever on ABC last Thursday with 
a report on the Nancy Kerrigan ice-skating story, but CBS still won the network 
race, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "PrimeTime Live," which featured Diane Sawyer interviewing Shawn Eckardt, 
Tonya Harding's bodyguard, was seen in nearly 16.9 million homes and ranked 
11th among the 98 network prime-time programs.It drew 29% of the available 
audience, contrasted with 19% for NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street" and 14% 
for CBS' "Second Chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Outdrawing the ice-skating story, however, was the NFL championship. CBS' 
post-game coverage of the Dallas-San Francisco contest extended into prime time 
in much of the country and ranked second overall, trailing only the venerable 
"60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, meanwhile, was cheering the results of "The George Carlin Show," which in 
its second outing finished second in its 9:30-10 p.m. Sunday time slot and 
delivered the biggest audience for Fox in that period since August, 1992.

TV REVIEWS; PBS' 'MALCOLM X' A COMPLEX PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Spike Lee unveiled "Malcolm X," he said that he expected the critics to 
lambaste him for deifying the black leader. What he didn't expect were the loud 
voices of those who condemned his film for the unflattering sequences of 
Malcolm's early street and criminal life, and its depiction of his battle with 
the religious order that had probably saved his life -- the Nation of Islam. 
That this same order was linked with his assassination only helped make Lee's 
film a richly ironic film biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentarian Orlando Bagwell must be anticipating some of the same knocks for 
his new work for "The American Experience," "Malcolm X: Make It Plain" (tonight 
at 8 on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15; 7 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 
24). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, with the heat about Malcolm that had been ignited by Lee's 
film now dissipated, Bagwell's even more honest 2 1/2-hour account of an 
astoundingly complex life may be taken for what it is: a fairly definitive film 
record of the first post-war voice of black radicalism. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a product through and through of the Blackside film group, which gave 
us, among other works, "Eyes on the Prize" and "The Great Depression." The 
camera peers deeply into the faces of those who knew Malcolm, and we become 
aware that all of these people -- his brothers and sisters, his old Harlem 
buddies, his Muslim friends and rivals, and artists such as actor Ossie Davis 
and filmmaker-photographer Gordon Parks -- knew sides of him, but not the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together with the artfully inserted archival footage, Bagwell's film 
brings together the entire, prismatic complex of Malcolm's identity while it 
eschews Lee's Hollywoodized sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell's inclusion of Malcolm's TV face-offs with white interviewers, news 
camera crews and Martin Luther King Jr. allies such as Kenneth Clarke makes for 
both great documentary reporting and potent images of Malcolm's gutsy desire to 
debate anyone, anywhere. (He even debates at Oxford, doing a line analysis of 
Hamlet's "to be or not to be" speech.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, the filmmaker, clearly revels in the irony that Malcolm, the 
denouncer of "the white devil" and consummate reverse-racist, enjoyed the white 
man's media. It wasn't only that Malcolm was a powerful black nationalist who 
refused to join King's nonviolent movement; it was that he was a telegenic 
black nationalist. This is another, important side of the Malcolm prism. ROBERT

CLIPPERS RISE TO OCCASION, BEAT SUPERSONICS, 111-103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The Clippers played one of their best games of the season against one of the 
NBA's best teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper scored a season-high 37 points and had 10 rebounds as the Clippers 
handed the Seattle SuperSonics their third loss in a row, 111-103, before a 
sellout crowd of 14,348 at the Seattle Center Coliseum on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was absolutely terrific," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said of Harper. "He had 
three go in where he lost the ball. But it was that kind of a night for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who had 24 points in the first half, lost the ball as he drove the 
baseline in front of the Seattle bench, but the ball went into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who had shot only 37.7% in his previous eight games, made 15 of 21 
shots, including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if you say a player felt a (shooting) zone, I probably did find that 
zone tonight," Harper said. "There were some shots that I took that I probably 
usually don't take, but I did tonight. I just felt good tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle guard Nate McMillan said Harper made some lucky shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him to get off like that is ridiculous," McMillan said of Harper. "He hit 
some wild and crazy shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Danny Manning added 27 points as the Clippers won in Seattle for the 
first time in 20 games dating to Dec. 28, 1985. Guard Mark Jackson added 18 
points, six assists and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the best wins we've had since I've been here," said Jackson, 
who was acquired from the New York Knicks last season. "We beat one of the best 
teams in the league on their home floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're struggling, but this could be something we could build on. It would be 
disappointing to go out and lose now to teams we're supposed to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 90, the Clippers outscored Seattle by 14-5 to take a 
104-95 lead on a free throw by Mark Aguirre with 3:34 remaining. Harper, who 
had a team-high seven points in the fourth quarter, had five points during the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning knocked McMillan out of the game with 3:01 remaining when he 
accidentally hit McMillan across the face with his right arm while trying to 
block his shot. McMillan fell into the court-side seats and left the game 
because of a bruised right rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very close to a clean block," Weiss said. "That's why they didn't call 
a flagrant foul on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton, shooting for McMillan, made one of two free throws. However, the 
officials realized that they had made a mistake in telling Weiss that he had to 
select a player who was already in the game to shoot free throws for McMillan 
and asked Weiss to select another player. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss sent reserve center Rich King to the free-throw line. King made one of 
two free throws to make the score 104-96. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first they came to me and said I had to select someone who was already in 
the game to shoot," Weiss said. "Then they realized they made a mistake and 
said I could select somebody on the bench. Had I been able to leave it the way 
it was I would have stayed with (Payton's free throw)." 
</P>
<P>
 King had to stay in the game and the Clippers took advantage when Jackson made 
a lay-in to give the Clippers a 106-96 lead. Sam Perkins answered with a 
three-pointer with two minutes remaining, but Jackson made three of four free 
throws as the Clippers (14-24) held on. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics, who shot 28% in the fourth quarter, got only 14 points from 
Shawn Kemp, who missed nine of 13 shots before fouling out with 24 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Magic Johnson's planned tour of Indonesia was canceled Tuesday after 
immigration officials said they would block his entry because he has HIV, the 
virus that produces AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and an all-star team were scheduled to play exhibitions Feb. 26-27 to 
promote AIDS prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Director-General of Immigration Roni Sikap Sinuraya said 
officials would block Johnson's entry. Johnson's tour was called off to end the 
controversy, said Marcel Maulana, director of Point Promotion, which planned 
the tour with the Indonesian AIDS Foundation.

 Chris Webber, Shawn Bradley and Anfernee Hardaway, the top three picks in the 
1993 NBA draft, also were the first selections as the two opposing coaches 
split up the rosters for the first rookie All-Star game on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Doug Collins made Webber of the Golden State Warriors the first of his 
eight players, and K.C. Jones used the second and third overall picks to select 
the Philadelphia 76ers' Bradley and Hardaway of the Orlando Magic.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT ALWAYS SEEMS AS THOUGH THE 0.6 FAN HOGS ALL THE CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the Super Bowl, male heads of households will largely be in charge of 
the TV remote control, and three-fourths of all viewers will watch the game in 
their own homes amid a gathering of 4.6 fans, according to the results of a 
national survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred Americans who intend to watch the game were asked some of their 
plans for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a lot of snacking going on. Chips and soft drinks top the list 
of what they expect to consume. Nearly seven in 10 say they will probably eat 
chips and finger foods, followed by popcorn, nachos, pretzels and peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the salty stuff, came such novelties as buffalo burgers, venison, beef 
tongue, steak tartar, sushi, frog's legs and escargot. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Super Bowl: If given the opportunity to watch the game with a celebrity, 
those polled favored Joe Montana and Michael Jordan, followed by President 
Clinton, John Elway, Michelle Pfeiffer and Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the record for the biggest largemouth bass caught in 
California waters? 
</P>
<P>
 No respect: Duke rooters poked fun at Charlie Ward, Florida State's Heisman 
Trophy winner who led the Seminoles to the national championship in football, 
when he turned up on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 After Duke took a 48-25 lead, the crowd shouted, "Need three touchdowns!" and 
"Stick to football!" 
</P>
<P>
 The right spot: When Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson guaranteed that the Cowboys 
would defeat the San Francisco 49ers, Dom Amore of the Hartford Courant noted 
that it could not have been been made in a more appropriately named room: The 
Peacock Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Top billing: Headline in New York Daily News on Super Bowl matchup: "Pokes and 
Jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bing's boy: Former U.S. Amateur champion Nathaniel Crosby will play in what 
was once his dad's tournament, now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, as an amateur. 
Crosby regained his amateur status in time for next week's tournament after a 
few years of trying to make it as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing times: In 1969, five of the eight women's quarterfinalists in the 
Australian Open were Australian and six of the last eight men were Aussies. The 
women's championship was won by Margaret Court and the men's by Rod Laver. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, no Australian man or woman made it past the fourth round of the 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Twenty-two pounds, caught, weighed on a certified scale and 
photographed by Bob Crupi, who then released it back into Lake Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Start the bidding: The Southern California Ducks will hold a fund-raising 
dinner Thursday night at the Chino fairgrounds and raffle items include the 
usual, such as duck and goose hunts, a 24-bird pheasant hunt, a trip to a 
hunting ranch in Idaho and framed wildlife prints. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of these items, however, was a Kansas City Chief helmet 
autographed by Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 How did that get in there? 
</P>

A GLIMMER OF LIGHT FOR KINGS' GRANATO; HOCKEY: AFTER TEAM FALLS BEHIND, 3-0, HE 
SCORES TWO GOALS TO HELP KINGS GET A 4-4 TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been ongoing trade rumors sending him to Chicago, severe back 
problems keeping him out of the lineup . . . and very few goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to King forward Tony Granato's unpleasant season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Granato kept working and instigating. If he wasn't scoring, well, he 
might as well try and shut out the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato finally ended his offensive drought with two goals in the Kings' 4-4 
tie against the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday night before 15,006 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been frustrating," said Granato, who scored his first goal in 13 games. 
"I've just got to stick with it. Obviously, it's been a low point for my 
production. But I feel like I've been skating well and making good things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Said King Coach Barry Melrose: "I'm happy for Tony. The second half (of the 
season) is going to be his. He's going to own the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was almost like two games in one. The Kings, tired from Monday night's 
game against Calgary at Phoenix, were sluggish early. But the second half 
featured a wide-open, entertaining game and they outshot Winnipeg, 49-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato awakened his teammates. He had not scored since Nov. 30 against the 
Jets, but he ended his scoring drought at 14:08 of the second period with his 
second goal in 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri, who had two assists, set it up from the left corner. Granato took 
the pass and fired a wrist shot off the goal post, past Winnipeg goaltender Bob 
Essensa, to cut the Jets' lead to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It had taken the Kings until the midpoint of the game to get warmed up. By 
then, the Jets had a 3-0 lead on first-period goals by Tie Domi at 1:39 and 
Thomas Steen on a power play at 11:57 and a second-period goal by Darrin 
Shannon, at 10:23. 
</P>
<P>
 A power play paid off for the Kings, with Luc Robitaille scoring on his own 
rebound at 17:41 of the second period. With the goal, his 27th of the season, 
Robitaille moved past Toronto's Dave Andreychuk to top the league's power-play 
goal list with 18. Granato tied it, 3-3, in the third period, at 2:03, 
deflecting Charlie Huddy's slap shot from the right point. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, the Jets went ahead again on Teemu Selanne's 25th goal of the 
season, at 7:21. But the Kings quickly came back with Tomas Sandstrom's 16th of 
the season at 9:34. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wayne Gretzky, who had two assists: "Tony is such a big part of the team. 
He played hurt with his back when he probably should not have been playing. 
He's the heart and soul of this team. He's feeling good and we feel good for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of a large chunk of the Kings by IDB Communications chief 
executive officer Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joe Cohen probably will not close for 
another two to three weeks, according to an IDB spokesperson. Sudikoff 
confirmed that the investment is $60 million but said, "the amount could 
change." IDB officials have emphasized that this is a private investment by 
Sudikoff, not by the company. . . . Goaltender Rick Knickle, who has spent most 
of the season with the team's minor-league affiliate in Phoenix, was suspended 
indefinitely by King General Manager Nick Beverley when he refused a temporary 
assignment to Ft. Wayne (Ind.) of the International Hockey League. Knickle has 
struggled with the Roadrunners, going 1-6-2 with a goals against average of 
5.36 and an .847 save percentage. "Obviously, he's got a short memory because 
he's forgotten where he came from," said Beverley, looking irritated. ". . . 
He's not stopping the puck -- that's the bottom line. He's totally out to 
lunch." Knickle, 33 and a career minor-leaguer, was given his first NHL chance 
when Beverley signed him last season. Knickle appeared in 10 games with the 
Kings and had a 6-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri, with 544 goals, is tied with Maurice Richard for 10th place on the 
NHL all-time scoring list. Kurri has 20 goals this season and is on track for 
his highest goal output since the 1988-89 season, when he had 44 goals for 
Edmonton. . . . The scratches Tuesday were defenseman Brent Thompson and 
forwards John Druce, Dave Taylor and Shawn McEachern. McEachern seems to be the 
latest occupant of what the players call "Chateau Bow-Wow." He has been 
scratched for three consecutive games and a total of five this season.

 Count me among those who believe the Raiders would be preparing for the Super 
Bowl today if Jeff Hostetler had been allowed to call his own plays against the 
Buffalo Bills during their playoff game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Jim Kelly can run his show, why not Hostetler? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raider quarterback was a Rhodes Scholarship candidate at West Virginia and 
has the football sense to match. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, it was Hostetler and Todd Peat who persuaded Coach Art Shell during 
the two-minute warning of the first half to go for a touchdown instead of a 
field goal from the Buffalo one-yard line. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That play worked, but few did in the second half when the Raiders went into 
their all-too-familiar shell. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 William Perry has been nominated to be secretary of the defense, but, if 
President Clinton had wanted a real kitchen cabinet, he would have nominated 
Nate Newton. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Seven former UCLA Bruins will suit up Sunday in Atlanta -- Troy Aikman, Ken 
Norton, James Washington, and Frank Cornish for the Cowboys and Marvcus Patton, 
Mike Lodish and Matt Darby for the Bills. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Patton and Lodish have reached the Super Bowl every year of their NFL careers. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has had a player in every Super Bowl except the New York Jets' 
upset of the Baltimore Colts in No. III, will be represented by Scott Galbraith 
of the Cowboys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This could be quite a weekend for Jimmy Johnsons -- the former 49er cornerback 
who might be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday; and the Cowboy 
coach who is favored to win a second consecutive Super Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There are many strong candidates this year, but Tom Mack deserves a spot in 
Canton, Ohio. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A running back looking to make a comeback in 1994 is Christian Okoye. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The new NFL salary cap will be such that the New York Giants might choose to 
release veteran center Brad Oates, even though he has made the Pro Bowl again. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two reasons Atlanta elevated June Jones from offensive coordinator to head 
coach -- the Falcons, who aren't loaded at quarterback, had the most touchdown 
passes in the NFL in 1992 and the second most in 1993. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder if Phil Jackson, the heavyweight who will challenge World Boxing 
Council champion Lennox Lewis in May, carries the wallop of the basketball 
coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Forum, which is hoping to break the California gate record of $602,000 set 
by the Don Chargin-promoted Tony Lopez-Jorge Paez fight in Sacramento in 1990, 
reports ticket sales of more than $350,000 for the Michael Carbajal-Humberto 
(Chiquita) Gonzalez, Freddie Pendleton-Rafael Ruelas doubleheader Feb. 19. . .

 The Florida Panthers are on pace to become the first modern expansion NHL team

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: BIG BLUES LINGERING AT CABO SAN LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas is living up to its reputation as the striped marlin capital of 
the world, but the stripers are being upstaged by out-of-season blues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks there have been several catches of blue marlin weighing 
in at more than 500 pounds, and an Alaska angler landed a 700-pounder. He was 
outdone last week by Malibu's Jim Rapf, who brought in a 737-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the fight, Rapf, 48, was hesitant to describe it because there 
wasn't much of one. "It was relatively easy," Rapf said. "I think it was my 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish jumped several times, but came to the boat in about 30 minutes. Once 
gaffed, it took off, straightening the gaff and fighting for another 10 minutes 
before Rapf and crew could subdue it. "It was fun, but short," Rapf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripers are still abundant enough to keep fishermen busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Gamache of Vancouver and a guide on one of Victor's pangas experienced a 
triple-hookup with stripers while trolling eight miles from shore. They fought 
two and handed the third to an angler on a nearby boat. All three were brought 
to the boat and two were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group reported catching 10 stripers in two days, including one that 
weighed 198 pounds. The Pisces fleet reported 79 stripers for the week, 69 
released. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Daniel DeWayne Royse's first mistake was to take the easy way out when trying 
to fill his bear tag. 
</P>
<P>
 But after illegally killing a black bear that had gathered to forage -- as 
several do each day -- in a Northern California landfill, Royse left a bloody 
trail that required only basic detective work on the part of Department of Fish 
and Game warden Ken Taylor and his son Shawn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the bungled getaway attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Royse, 41, of Ferndale, Calif., killed the bear in Happy Camp landfill, but 
had hoped to keep that information secret. 
</P>
<P>
 He somehow moved the bear to the edge of a the forest above Klamath River 
Highway and rolled the 500-pound animal off a cliff, hoping it would land in 
the bed of his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it didn't work and the bear ended up wedged between the base of the cliff 
and the truck," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men stopped on the highway and helped Royse load the bear, but Royse left 
behind a bloody piece of rope with bear hair on it. Taylor found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Royse also left a pile of guts at the scene of the crime. In the pile, there 
was a bear heart "the size of a football" -- with a three-blade head of an 
arrow. Taylor found this, and notified DFG check points. 
</P>
<P>
 When Royse checked his bear with the DFG -- as required by law -- in Eureka 
and proudly proclaimed, "I shot him right through the heart," the jig was up. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor and sheriffs deputies paid Royse a visit. A search turned up shoes 
matching footprints at the site of the kill, a bloody bow and a bloody piece of 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse for Royse, officers found a gray owl mount and feet and 
talons of a great horned owl, an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Royse pleaded guilty earlier this month to illegally killing and possessing 
the bear and killing a bear at a dump site. He was ordered to pay $2,735, spend 
two days in jail, give up his bow and forfeit his hunting rights for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of illegal possession of an endangered species are pending in Humboldt 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 EARTHQUAKE -- The Department of Fish and Game has been in contact with 
CalTrans regarding the possibility of using the rubble from last week's 
earthquake for the construction of artificial reefs off the Southern California 
coast. Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California, 
suggested the idea. CalTrans is still considering the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Bottom fishing remains most productive locally, but there is 
variety available in the form of calico bass at San Clemente Island, bonito at 
Catalina and sand bass and halibut at Santa Monica Bay and near Horseshoe Kelp. 
A 38-pound 8-ounce halibut was caught by Scott Niven of Los Angeles aboard 
Marina del Rey Sportfishing's Spitfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern Channel Islands, primarily Santa Rosa and Santa Barbara islands, 
continue to produce impressive numbers of large lingcod and cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Besides marlin, anglers are hooking up with yellowfin tuna on 
a regular basis, and with an occasional thresher shark. Dorado have for the 
most part moved on. The tuna, ranging from 15 to 45 pounds, are scattered in 
good volume from Cabo San Lucas up the gulf to Gordo Banks and beyond.  
</P>
<P>
 Mazatlan: Sailfish, tuna, dorado and an occasional blue marlin are providing 
most of the action, but the Star Fleet reports five swordfish taken in the past 
week, including a 325-pounder from California angler Mike Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 INSTRUCTION -- Pacific Edge is hosting a seminar on how to find, catch and use 
live squid Thursday from 7-10 p.m. at Seal Beach Church in Seal Beach. Details: 
(714) 840-4262. . . . Eagle Claw Fishing Schools will begin their 1994 schedule 
this weekend with a 2 1/2-day seminar-fishing trip beginning Friday aboard the 
Holiday out of Point Loma Sportfishing in San Diego. Details: (714) 840-6555.

FISHING REPORT: BASS CREATE OWN STORM AT LAKES CASTAIC, CASITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no calm before Monday's storm at Lake Castaic and Lake Casitas, as 
trophy-sized largemouth bass went on a feeding spree in the days leading up to 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 At Casitas in Ventura County, Marlin Spenser of Santa Barbara used a Worm King 
lure to catch a 15-pound 4-ounce bass and Bill Jordan of Santa Paula used 
crawfish to catch a 12-8 and an 8-5 bass. At Castaic in Los Angeles County, 
Eric Stepanek of Newhall and Ray Marrill of Granada Hills used live shad to 
catch, among several others, a nine-pound bass, two 8-0s and a 7-0. All fish 
were released.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN; SAMPRAS, COURIER REACH SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Courier, trying to become the first man to win three straight Australian 
Open titles since the 1960s, joined Pete Sampras and Todd Martin in the 
semifinals on a sweltering, wind-swept Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, seeded third, overcame two set points in the opening set and then 
rolled to a 7-6 (9-7), 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic. Courier 
used sharp groundstrokes to repeatedly pass the Croatian at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory set up a semifinal with top-seeded Sampras, who overcame a 
lethargic start and 17 double-faults to defeat Magnus Gustafsson, 7-6 (7-4), 
2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in a center-court match that seemed as if it were played 
in a wind tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The air temperature was 100 degrees and the baking center-court surface 
registered 126 degrees during the Sampras-Gustafsson match. Combined with wind 
that reached 36 m.p.h., it made for a less than classic match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both had a hard time controlling the ball. It was not the best of tennis. 
I just hung in there," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after Sampras won, No. 9 Martin completed a 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 
(7-5) victory over MaliVai Washington on Court 1, where the wind made serving 
an adventure and where beer cups rattled around the mostly empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin will play the winner of the match between No. 4 Stefan Edberg and No. 6 
Thomas Muster in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the best medicine for No. 4 Gabriela Sabatini was a straight-set 
victory over No. 5 Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini, who awoke Tuesday with severe dizziness and nausea, took advantage 
of Novotna's sloppy play to win 6-3, 6-4 and advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very fortunate that I had to play in the evening because if I had to 
play during the day I don't think I was going to make it," Sabatini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna made 39 unforced errors to only 10 for Sabatini. Her poor serves 
prevented her from coming to the net, forcing her into an uncharacteristic 
baseline game. Sabatini will play No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in one of 
Thursday's semifinals. The other will match Steffi Graf against Kimiko Date.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CHARGING CALL ALLOWS PALMDALE TO ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Littlerock High, the fourth-place team in the Golden League, thought it had 
upset The Times' third-ranked team on its home floor Tuesday night, but a 
charging call with one second left wiped out the would-be winning basket and 
allowed Palmdale to beat the Lobos, 58-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale (16-3, 10-0 in Golden League play) took a 57-56 lead when Maurice 
Wright made a 10-foot baseline jump shot. Littlerock (8-10, 4-6) rushed the 
ball up the floor and John George, who scored 18 points, made a layup with one 
second left. However, James Jefferson was called for an offensive foul after he 
passed to George.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN FALL TO PACIFIC IN INITIAL OUTING SINCE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team, playing its first game since 
the Jan. 17 earthquake, lost to Pacific, 73-52, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Shannon Crouse did not make the trip because of severe damage to her 
dormitory and the Matadors felt her absence.Starting forwards Carrie Dormire 
and Katina Mines combined for 13 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge struggled in the first half, shooting 27% from the field, and 
trailed at halftime, 36-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Esparza led Northridge with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific (9-5) was not an uncharitable host. The Tigers donated shoes to the 
Matadors because several players gave their shoes to victims immediately after 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific has been very supportive in helping us since Sunday, giving us time 
and whatever we need," Northridge Coach Kim Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (2-15) could not stop Paloma Morianna (11 rebounds) on the boards 
and couldn't contain hot-shooting guard Karen Vesecky, who scored 18 points and 
made all eight shots she took. 
</P>
<P>
 With the CSUN campus barricaded, Chandler arranged for the team to fly to 
Stockton a day early to get extra practice time. Players stayed with their 
families for most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations for the Red Cross were taken at the game. The Matadors play at San 
Francisco tonight before returning to Northridge on Thursday.

Spurs built a 30-point lead and coasted past the Kings at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio won for the 13th time in 16 games. Sacramento lost its fifth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has scored 30 or more points in 18 of the Spurs' 42 games this 
season, and San Antonio is 14-4 in those games. Reserve J.R. Reid added 19 
points for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond had 15 points for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Del Negro hurried and sank a running three-pointer as the third-quarter 
buzzer sounded, giving the Spurs an 84-64 lead. The long shot, which followed a 
shot-clock violation by Sacramento with 4.5 seconds to play capped a 7-0 run by 
the Spurs to close the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 119, Charlotte 98 -- Rony Seikaly scored 26 points and led a 
third-quarter run that lifted the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Seikaly had 11 points during a 20-4 burst that put the Heat ahead, 84-57, with 
five minutes left to play in the third period. Seikaly sank 10 of 12 shots and 
had 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith, who had 10 assists, and Glen Rice each scored 25 points for 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat romped after a 33-point rout of Washington in its last game, the 
second-biggest victory margin in team history. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning had 17 points, 15 rebounds and eight blocks for Charlotte. 
Eddie Johnson scored 20 for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 112, Washington 89 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 22 points and, along with 
the rest of Orlando's starters, wasn't needed for most of the fourth quarter as 
the Magic routed the Bullets at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando tied a team record with its fourth consecutive victory. Washington 
managed only 18 fourth-quarter points against the Magic's reserves and lost for 
the fourth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, coming off a 15-for-16 performance against Philadelphia last Saturday, 
was eight for 20 from the field, grabbing 12 rebounds and blocking seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-year center left the game with 10:33 remaining, joining Nick 
Anderson, who had 21 points, and Anfernee Hardaway, who had 16. Neither 
Anderson nor Hardaway played the fourth quarter.

NHL ROUNDUP; BELFOUR SHUTS OUT RED WINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Noonan triggered a three-goal second period with one of his two goals as 
the Chicago Blackhawks beat the host Detroit Red Wings, 5-0, Tuesday night, 
handing them their first shutout in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth shutout of the season for Ed Belfour (20-12-3), who took a 
2.71 goals-against average into the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirk Graham, Jeremy Roenick and Chris Chelios also scored for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings led the NHL with 369 goals last season and are No. 1 again this 
season with 207. The last time they were held scoreless was Jan. 11, 1993, when 
Guy Hebert and the St. Louis Blues blanked them, 1-0, at Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third loss in the last 20 games for the Red Wings (26-14-5), 
who took a 3-0-1 unbeaten string into the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a grinding, penalty-filled game that took over three hours to play. 
Officials handed out a total of 182 penalty minutes. Detroit had 24 for 101 
minutes, Chicago 25 for 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Ottawa 2 -- Martin Straka scored two goals to lead the Penguins 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators, with an NHL-worst 9-36-5 record, dropped to 1-12-2 in their last 
15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Straka's second goal came at 2:44 of the third period and broke a tie. 
Goaltender Darrin Madeley stopped Doug Brown, and Straka was able to beat 
defenseman Darren Rumble to the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Mullen scored on a power play at 13:19, knocking in Ron Francis' pass for 
his 26th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins played without their leading scorer, right wing Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
 He injured a groin muscle participating in the skills competition at last 
weekend's NHL All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 6, Philadelphia 4 -- Mike Ricci broke a tie with a power-play goal at 
5:17 of the third period, lifting the Nordiques at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled Quebec to avert a sweep by the Flyers in regular-season 
meetings between the teams after Philadelphia won the first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricci's winner was scored when he deflected in Joe Sakic's pass from in front 
of the Flyers' net. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 200th career point for Ricci and the 300th career point for Mats 
Sundin, who assisted on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 3, Washington 1 -- Vincent Riendeau, playing his first NHL game in 
three months, stopped 29 shots to lift the Bruins at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Bourque, Bryan Smolinski and Brent Hughes scored for Boston, 3-0-1 in its 
last four games after losing four consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
 Riendeau had not played in the NHL since Oct. 25, when he lost to Dallas as a 
member of the Detroit Red Wings. He spent time in the minors before being 
traded to Boston on Jan. 17, and rode the bench behind Jon Casey and John Blue 
before finally getting a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 8, San Jose 3 -- Mark Messier, Steve Larmer and Tony Amonte had two 
goals apiece to lead the Rangers over the Sharks at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers gained their fifth consecutive victory and improved their 
league-best record to 31-12-3. The Sharks had a four-game unbeaten streak 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 After San Jose's Sandish Ozolinsh scored the first goal of the game at 2:07 of 
the first period, the Rangers scored four consecutive times. Messier scored two 
of those goals in a 2:42 span to give New York a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, St. Louis 3 -- Goaltenders Curtis Joseph of the Blues and Kirk 
McLean of the Canucks shut out the opposing offenses in the third period and 
overtime at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly acquired Steve Duchesne scored his first goal for the Blues on a power 
play in the second period from Craig Janney. Martin Gelinas had a goal and an 
assist for the Canucks.

CRESCENTA VALLEY GIRLS DOGGED BY MUIR'S PRESS IN 62-59 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Crescenta Valley High girls' basketball team suffered its first Pacific 
League defeat of the season when Muir made four of four free throws in the 
final 22 seconds to hang on for a 62-59 victory Tuesday at Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (15-5, 5-1 in league play) trailed the entire game, but drew to 
within 58-57 when guard Sarah Hagman made two of three free throws after being 
fouled while shooting a three-point shot with 1 minute 12 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman scored 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Following two free throws by Mustang forward Kyla Johnson, Crescenta Valley 
center Heather Green made a layup to cut the deficit to 60-59 with 10 seconds 
left.  
</P>
<P>
 But Muir's Wendie Donahue closed the scoring two seconds later with two free 
throws, and Green's three-point attempt at the buzzer bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going in," Falcons' Coach Marc Ward said of Green's shot.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we played really poorly. It's the first time I've ever had a team 
struggle against the press. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were bothered by Muir's full-court pressure defense and committed 
a season-high 26 turnovers. They also missed 10 of 20 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir (13-7, 4-2) was led by Shannon Lee's 18 points. Johnson added 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley's Green had 21 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocked shots.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagman, who set a Southern Section single-game record by making 13 three-point 
shots last Friday against Arcadia, made only three of 11 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athlete for athlete, we're a better team," Muir Coach Corinne DeJong said. 
"In the first game (against Crescenta Valley, a 17-point Falcon victory earlier 
this month), we played man-to-man defense. This time, we went with a rotating 
zone, and we showed up to play."

FIXATIONS: THE SOUL OF A POET; CHAMPION OF VERSE LEE MALLORY OF NEWPORT BEACH 
IS A COLLEGE TEACHER BY DAY AND AN INTENSE CREATIVE SPIRIT BY NIGHT. 
</P>

 "Lee Mallory alert! Lee Mallory alert!" 
</P>
<P>
 These are words that can shoot BBs of dread into the gut of journalists in 
local newsrooms. It means a writer has just had a call from the poet Lee 
Mallory. The poet Lee Mallory is like a relentless insect intent on boring into 
someone's brain. The poet Lee Mallory will keep calling every extension until 
he finds satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi, come to our reading. Hey, I just ran the L.A. Marathon for poetry. Listen, 
here's a poet you should come hear. We're presenting surf poetry -- maybe 
Sports would be interested. Hey, Jim, aren't I fixated on poetry?  
</P>
<P>
 It's reached a point where we have to either write about him or shoot him. I, 
for one, am not willing to do prison time because, should Mallory survive, he'd 
doubtless get around to starting a poetry program there. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here meet the poet, the fixated, Lee Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
 We joined him last Wednesday evening as he addressed a group of 
black-T-shirted poetry club members and other students in the auditorium of 
Brea Junior High School. He had already begun his lecture and seemed to be 
going to extremes to show the teens that he's not an ordinary teacher, but an 
unruly poet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to break all the old rules," he was saying, pantomiming snapping 
yardsticks across his knee. "But the poet does it to heighten his message," he 
continued, illustrating that with awkward Atlas poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory prowled the front of the hall. "When I write I want to adventure . We 
want to get a little crazy . If you have a poem about the earthquake, I want to 
feel this shake " -- he jiggled a blackboard -- "I want to know the sweet taste 
of blood in your mouth. " 
</P>
<P>
 If, during Mickey Rourke's steady career descent, you happened to see him 
playing the Charles Bukowski-like poet in the Bukowski-penned film "Barfly," 
you might recall his affected speech pattern, which seemed heavily based on the 
cartoon cat Snagglepuss, of " Exit , stage righhhht " fame. Mallory's speech is 
a bit like that, making a lingering emphasis on anything resembling a key word. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poet has to be in touch with his world more than any other person . What 
color is the sticker on the license plate of your dad' s car ? What letter is 
not on the telephone dial ? You guys are not paying attention to the world. 
You're not checking details that can make your poem fly , to make your writing 
solid or make a reader soar ." 
</P>
<P>
 One small detail Mallory himself seemed to miss was that when he'd hurl his 
chalk at the blackboard for dramatic effect, it sometimes went ricocheting into 
kids in the front row. Maybe they can write a poem about it. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Mallory asked a student what poetry meant to her. She responded, 
"Death." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, if she says 'death,' " he said, turning to another student, "what word 
does that make you think of?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a restaurant, over light beers, the 48-year-old Mallory was still 
tirelessly promoting poetry. Divorced since 1989, he lives on Newport 
Peninsula's 33rd Street -- "the biggest party street there is." His explanation 
why -- and of why he rides the bus every day to his teaching job at Santa Ana's 
Rancho Santiago College -- had the emphatic tone of Harry Dean Stanton reciting 
the Repo Man Code: 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the action. Poet's gotta be where the action is. Poet's gotta be 
taking the pulse of everything going on around him . Poet's gotta stay in 
touch. You don't wall yourself out." 
</P>
<P>
 (I'll be turning up the "italics filter" from now on, so that only the words 
Mallory really, really emphasized will get through.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory says he teaches 60 hours a week and often stays up all night grading 
papers. Still, he finds time for all those poetry-related phone calls and 
flyers. In the past 25 years he has logged 3,500 pages of journal entries. He 
has had hundreds of his poems published in small magazines and has written four 
volumes of poetry, most recently 1990's "I Write Your Name." It will be joined 
this June by "Full Moon, Empty Hands" from Fullerton's Lightning Publications. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also conducted the county's longest-running poetry night, dubbed the 
Factory Readings, held the first Monday of every month at the Casa Palma 
Restaurant in Santa Ana. More recently, he instituted readings at the Alta 
Coffee House on the Newport Peninsula, held every second Wednesday. He has 
taught poetry at Rancho Santiago since 1989. He says the classes are always 
full, despite school administrators initially telling him it was a "blue 
collar" campus where students only wanted to learn practical, job-related 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory wrote his first poem in 1968 while a student at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in an apartment house in Isla Vista that looked like a tenement, with 
the stucco walls streaked with the dampness of the night and a bike rack with 
various parts of bikes still chained to it, rusting. It was a dreary place.  
</P>
<P>
 "One time I saw an unkempt little boy in the parking lot. The apartment place 
was called Edgewater, and the first poem I ever wrote was called 'Son of 
Edgewater,' about how youth in its innocence and beauty has a seriousness when 
at play. I think I'd read something by Aldous Huxley that said man's most 
important mission in life should be regaining the seriousness he had as a child 
when at play. It was a poem of hope, and hope was needed because just a year 
later the streets were being cruised by dump trucks full of county sheriffs 
firing tear gas." 
</P>
<P>
 In the societal schism that tore at the late '60s and particularly that campus 
-- where banks were burned and students shot -- Mallory found himself 
straddling an uncomfortable fence. Classified 1-A for the draft, he'd enrolled 
in ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was schizophrenic: I'd be drilling on the UCSB campus on Saturday morning 
but hanging out with poets at night in water towers or at (famous dead poet) 
Kenneth Rexroth's house, or sitting with Rexroth on a nude beach in Summerland 
surrounded by attractive young co-eds. I played it straight enough to do the 
military thing but was accepted by this bohemian group of writers, who must 
have thought I had some glimmer of talent. I don't think I've ever gotten out 
of that straddling of lifestyles," Mallory said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Southern California in the early '70s, like many other young poets he 
was drawn to the apartment of poet-iconoclast Bukowski, who would put up with 
them if they'd arrive with a 12-pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a despicable man, but he was a lovable man," Mallory recalled. "His 
house was ant-ridden; there was garbage in the refrigerator, but he'd sit on 
his couch and smile like he was king of the mountain. Then he'd lapse into a 
mood, and say, 'It's almost 3, and the high school girls will be coming by.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What's wrong with that?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nothing, Lee, I can peek out through the shade.' Then he said, 'But when I 
see them I tremble to lift the window shade. Because it hurts so much . Their 
beauty hurts so muuuch .' He was 52 then, with his acne and his terribly 
pock-marked face that he compared to having been bitten by red ants. He'd say, 
'Look at my face , baby. It's all true .'  
</P>
<P>
 "I once asked him, 'What is reality?' and he said, 'Reality is waking up to 
blood in your underwear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One evening behind the Golden Bear, Bukowski threw up on the shoes of a friend 
of mine. I don't think he ever washed them after that. Bukowski's every 
utterance, even the liquid ones, was worshiped by his fans, who regarded such 
gestures as tokens of an artistic soul too tragically sensitive to life. 
Mallory says he parted ways with Bukowski after interceding one evening when 
the elder poet had thrown his Christmas tree through a window and was about to 
follow it with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as Mallory played the rampaging poet to his teen-age audience in Brea, 
he's not especially the hurling type. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a dichotomy in me," he said. "I'm recognized and published as a good 
writer, but just a few of us have a little bit of an organizational sense and 
the feeling that you need to have that. Maybe people think these poetry 
readings just happen , that it's some spontaneous thing, but it takes planning, 
press releases and getting out a mailing list to 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still stretched the way I was in college because my straight job is 
teaching. In the daytime I follow the lesson plan. I go on in a businesslike 
way and teach what I have to teach. But to people who know me, at night my 
demeanor is entirely different. And I have to say this, for me my poems are 
absolutely authentic, because if I write a poem at night I feel it intensely . 
And the proof of that is if a reader feels it too." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a Mallory poem, carefully selected as being the shortest one in his 
most recent book: 
</P>
<P>
 YOUTH  
</P>
<P>
 I sleep  
</P>
<P>
 among flowers  
</P>
<P>
 wake myself  
</P>
<P>
 in tee-shirts of  
</P>
<P>
 girls  
</P>
<P>
 caught in the carpets  
</P>
<P>
 of bloom  
</P>
<P>
 He has better poems than that, and certainly longer ones. Some, though, are 
poems about being a poet, a region I find as wanting in magic as rock songs 
about being a rock musician. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying Mallory is fixated on the stuff. Where others riding the 
bus are just riding the bus, for him it is to experience "the essential beauty 
and oneness in life, that the Lido Isle man going by in his Mercedes is cut off 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 If he runs the L.A. Marathon, as he did last year, it is "to shatter the 
stereotype of the poet as some sort of effete intellectual" and to discover, 
"It's a metaphor for poetry. It's hard and lonely, and the writer is usually 
the hyper-conscious individual, which means when the average guy may just be 
feeling blue, the poet's way down in the depths in the pits, but when he wakes 
and sees a beautiful sunrise, or sees a good-looking lady walking down the 
street, he is so high he's soaring. He tastes the extremes." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess. Where you or I might simply go "yucko," when Mallory confronted a 
stench in the alleyways of Paris, "my nostrils flared like Rimbaud," he 
recollects. 
</P>
<P>
 Were (the significantly dead French poet) Big Art Rimbaud here, he might well 
say "yucko" to that. Poetry schmoetry, he eventually said too, and went off to 
run guns in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laugh at Mallory if you want -- I sort of like to -- but when it comes down to 
it, he's just a man trying to be more alive, and to drag a few people along 
with him.  
</P>
<P>
 I think he's spot-on when he says, "There's a lot of people who feel this 
vague uneasiness and emptiness, who know there must be something more to life," 
and can even buy that "poetry can make you feel the real life sustenance . I 
think it is going to be the salvation for a lot of people who are stuck in the 
estrangement of modern society. It's real people writing about real things that 
matter, not the the color of the vision on Channel 5." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he drives people and the newspapers nuts," says Mallory's former 
student John C. Harrell, a quiet man whose 1992 "Twenty Years" is a moving 
poetic account of his decades in an Army medical unit. "But he doesn't do these 
things for himself, but for other people, like he did for me.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's gone to bat for a lot of people. He's a mentor to most of the poets in 
Orange County. He has a way of reaching people and bringing the talent they're 
afraid to let someone else see. I would never have published my poems without 
his encouragement. He really loves poetry, and he loves for people to hear 
about it. He really lives, eats and breathes it."  
</P>
<P>
 Should you doubt that, Mallory is planning poetry readings on the Newport Pier 
this year, along with assaults on local cable TV, more readings, more. . . 
Well, I imagine he'll be calling us with the news.

 Mexico's capable young President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is struggling

putting it down.

 Salinas took a big step in the right direction Tuesday when he visited that 
impoverished southern state and promised to act to solve the deep social and 
economic problems there. But the impact of his gesture was undermined by a 
report issued the same day by a respected human rights group that documents 
just how harsh the army's repression of the rebels was. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas genuinely wants an end to the crisis in Chiapas, where at least 100 
have died in the violence. He reorganized his Cabinet, fired the state's 
governor, ordered an army cease-fire and offered the rebels amnesty. Last 
weekend, in a show of how widespread sympathy for the rebels is among even 
pro-government Mexicans, that nation's Congress unanimously approved the 
president's amnesty plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas carried the amnesty declaration with him Tuesday, telling an audience 
of indigenous and peasant leaders, "We want peace, but not a return to the 
situation before." He also promised economic aid for war victims and to help 
bring Chiapas' largely rural population closer to the rest of Mexico in terms 
of the nation's rising level of development. But before he delivers long-term 
economic aid to the people of Chiapas, Salinas must respond to their more 
immediate human rights concerns. For despite repeated promises by government 
officials to withdraw troops from Chiapas villages, many places remain occupied 
and subject to often arbitrary repression. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's report on the uprising -- in which 15,000 heavily armed troops put 
down a rebel force of 2,000 Indians -- was issued by Amnesty International. Its 
investigators were told of nine executions of suspected rebels and of dozens of 
men being detained and sometimes tortured simply because they were suspected of 
being rebel sympathizers. The whereabouts of many detainees are still unknown. 
Until Salinas addresses these concerns of the indigenous people of Chiapas, the 
crisis there will not be over.

A $6.6-BILLION PLEA AFTER A 6.6 QUAKE; ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST MERITS QUICK 
APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake is now being called the nation's costliest natural 
disaster ever. Estimates already put damage in Southern California at $30 
billion. Federal aid is crucial to the region's rebuilding and to the nation's 
economic health. President Clinton understands this state's vital role in the 
national economy. In his State of the Union address Tuesday he expressed 
sympathy for victims of last week's temblor, and his Administration will be 
asking Congress for $6.6 billion in additional earthquake aid. Now it's up to 
Congress to act -- quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional effort should be unequivocally bipartisan. But the political 
posturing already has begun, with some Republicans calling the aid package a 
"budget breaker" and demanding offsetting spending cuts in other programs. They 
invoke the 1990 Budget Act, which requires that increased outlays be matched by 
spending cuts. Trouble is, Congress required no such offsets when it helped 
victims of the many natural disasters that have occurred since the 1990 budget 
deal was made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will ask Congress to declare the supplemental request an 
"emergency," a designation that, under budget rules, would allow the federal 
deficit to grow. Congress should comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid would help keep the California economy on track at a point when 
measurements suggest it is starting to emerge from its worst downturn since the 
Great Depression. Clinton repeatedly has said that without a California 
recovery there will be a slow recovery at best for the nation as a whole. He's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is in the nation's interest to keep California going. With nearly $900 
million in federal emergency funds already flowing to California, the 
Administration's request totals $7.5 billion. The additional $6.6 billion, 
which could be increased, is for a wide range of emergency assistance. Leon E. 
Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that the largest 
share of relief -- $3.84 billion -- is for Federal Emergency Management Agency 
programs to provide housing and for repair of schools, other public buildings 
and water systems.  
</P>
<P>
 The money would also be used to rapidly rebuild quake-damaged infrastructure, 
especially vital highways like the Golden State and Santa Monica freeways. The 
Administration generously is proposing that the matching requirement for state 
and local governments be cut to 10% from the normal 25% because of California's 
economic problems. Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature can prod Congress into 
action on this emergency appropriation by moving quickly to raise the funds 
needed under a revised matching rule, preferably through a temporary state 
gasoline tax increase.

SCIENCE WATCH; CALTECH'S CHAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What manner of man was Lee Alvin DuBridge, president emeritus of Caltech, dead 
last Sunday at the age of 92? The brilliance of the scientist and science 
policy adviser is what the country knew best. But Caltech, where DuBridge held 
office from 1946 to 1968, knew him for other qualities as well.When he returned 
to Pasadena after serving as science adviser to President Richard Nixon and was 
spotted for the first time in the dining room of the Athenaeum, Caltech's 
faculty club, the entire room rose in a standing ovation. DuBridge was not only 
admired, he was loved. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the "Los Alamos generation" of physicists. They were the giants who 
developed radar, built the bomb, won the war and then proceeded to fashion, for 
a nation become overnight a superpower, a science policy that left the world in 
awe. DuBridge was a science adviser to three presidents during an era when 
physics was important as never before. 
</P>
<P>
 That era is over. DuBridge, who astutely managed an extraordinary expansion of 
Caltech, is missed with a mixture of mourning for the demeanor of the man and 
nostalgia for the abundance of the era. But DuBridge himself, unassuming, ready 
to chat in the Athenaeum with any and all down to the end of his life, would 
never have claimed a whole era as his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "See you soon," a lunchtime companion said to the nonagenarian not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," DuBridge replied with a wry smile, "we'll have to wait and see about 
that." DuBridge knew both who he was and when he was. No wonder they cheered 
him.

THE ONLY WAY TO FLY; COURT'S DECISION BODES WELL FOR CITY'S HIGHER LANDING FEES 
AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation Monday that local authorities have broad 
power to impose "reasonable" charges on airlines for use of airports offers a 
measure of good news for Los Angeles. But only a measure. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 7 to 1, the court rejected an airline industry request that 
courts review landing charges and then reduce any fees found to be excessive. 
The ruling came in a lawsuit contesting higher fees imposed at the Grand 
Rapids, Mich., airport. The case has been watched by airport officials 
throughout the country -- perhaps nowhere more closely than in Los Angeles, 
where airport officials and the airlines only narrowly averted a shutdown of 
Los Angeles International Airport in December over the carriers' months-long 
refusal to pay higher landing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new landing-fee rate at LAX triples the old one, set under a complex, 
outdated formula originally created in the 1940s to induce airlines to use the 
then-new LAX instead of longer-established airports in the western United 
States. And even though LAX's new fees remain well below those at several other 
major American airports, the carriers are challenging them in a federal court 
suit.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal case, pending in Los Angeles, might be dismissed in light of 
Monday's ruling. In that decision the Supreme Court said that federal law 
carries only two clear prohibitions concerning airport fees -- no per-passenger 
fees shall be charged and no airport-fee income shall be diverted to 
non-airport use. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that latter finding that clouds Los Angeles' good news. Richard Riordan, 
in his successful campaign for mayor last year, proposed diversion of airport 
surpluses to other, fiscally strapped city services or leasing airport 
facilities to private bidders. The prospect of diversion plainly appears dim 
now, both because of Monday's decision and because of last year's congressional 
reaffirmation of rules on the use of federal airport funds. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mayor Riordan puts the finishing touches on a long-awaited study detailing 
new ideas for financing city services, he clearly will have to rethink his 
airport options.

DATA ON MOLESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What a brilliant idea the California attorney general has hatched ("Lungren 
Urges Molester Data in Libraries," Jan. 12). Indeed, let us post child-molester 
data in all the county libraries.The problem is that many libraries are closed, 
some permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this use of libraries for posting photographs and data of child 
molesters is a better reason to open libraries than to keep them open for the 
public, including the children, to read books. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries used to be places to read and learn about the world. Now they can 
assume a new role in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, too, when libraries were encouraged to report to the FBI on 
people who read objectionable books. But we defeated that one.  
</P>
<P>
 Where is the attorney general leading us?

EXPERIMENTS ON PEOPLE

 * "Protecting Human Guinea Pigs" (Jan. 16) clearly demonstrates the need for 
strong regulation, oversight, and enforcement to prevent scientists from 
performing medical experiments on human beings without their consent. However, 
when it comes to immoral and unethical business practices, a separate standard 
seems to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency reported a few years ago that in one year 
alone, 1987, industry was permitted to spew at least 22.5 billion pounds of 
toxic and cancer-causing chemicals into the nation's air, land and water. Are 
we not all unwilling guinea pigs to this toxic onslaught? If we hold 
individuals responsible for their actions how, and why, is industry permitted 
to get away with committing such abominable acts?

 * The article described Turner syndrome individuals as mentally retarded. 
There is no relationship between Turner syndrome and mental retardation. 
Because Turner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality and early studies were 
conducted with inadequate sampling, inaccurate assumptions have continued to be 
made by those without experience with Turner syndrome or understanding of the 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the over 2,500 Turner syndrome women in our organization are as 
bright and competent as any other group of individuals. Many, including myself, 
are professionally educated and face the same struggles of career and family 
facing all professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the article's point on the studies of human growth hormone in Turner 
syndrome does not show any understanding of the complexity of the issues 
involved. Placebo controls are the cornerstone of medical scientific research. 
The girls participating in the NIH trials deserve our gratitude and admiration, 
not pity. They and countless others using growth hormone, in studies or 
otherwise, have given us much information that shows an increase in growth 
velocity and indicates strongly an increase in final adult height. 
</P>
<P>
 These additional inches do much to improve the ability of Turner syndrome 
women to contribute to society to their fullest potential and be accepted as 
the competent, worthwhile beings they are and not the defenseless, defective 
little girls the article depicts.

 * What is most evident to me in the wake of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 
recent revelations of unethical nuclear experimentation on humans is that there 
have always been in our society groups of people who are considered expendable. 
The expendables include people of color, the mentally and physically infirm, 
and the poor of all races. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence clearly establishes that not just medical and educational 
institutions, but criminal justice, military and social service agencies have 
regarded these groups as less than deserving of their full attention and 
concern unless they could be used to make the unexpendables' lives more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuskegee syphilis experiments showed African Americans the hazards of 
placing blind trust in government institutions.

<P>
 It has often been said that evil occurs when good people are silent. Only when 
white, middle-class, healthy America awakens to and becomes angry at a 
government which uses up its "expendable" citizenry and repeatedly lies to 
cover it up will these atrocities stop.

SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Wanda Waldman's letter concerning Social Security (Jan. 13) fails to mention 
one factor. Congress keeps borrowing from the Social Security trust fund (OASI) 
and replacing that money with IOUs (government bonds) which continue to 
increase the national debt, which must be repaid -- with interest -- from the 
general fund by all the taxpayers.If Congress would limit its spending to its 
own general funds, without this borrowing, and squandering our Social Security 
funds as if they were a piggy bank for their pork barrel, then the Social 
Security and Medicare funds would be completely solvent, as they were intended 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 These "entitlements" have already been paid for, and they should be invested 
as they were initially intended so that they would grow and be there when 
required by us seniors who paid for them. Income tax on Social Security 
earnings becomes just so much more money in the "piggy bank" for Congress to 
play with and squander. Get real, Congress, and pull back to your own funds; 
leave our Social Security and Medicare funds alone.

EXPORTS FROM CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Last year China illegally exported more than $2 billion worth of textile 
products to the United States, mostly by mislabeling goods or "transshipping" 
them through other countries to hide their Chinese origin. On Jan. 18, under 
U.S. threat to slash China's textile quotas by 25% to 35%, China succumbed to 
U.S. pressure and signed an agreement to allow U.S. inspectors into textile 
plants to investigate mislabeling and other export violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The communist government, under the helmsmanship of the octogenarian Deng 
Xiaoping, has no scruples about hoodwinking and cheating on anything and/or 
anybody. The cheating of the United States on textile mislabeling is only a tip 
of the iceberg; they have been cheating on hundreds of other things that were 
not caught. 
</P>
<P>
 This incident of cheating by the Chinese communists taught us two things: One 
is that China led by the communists can never be trusted; second, they 
recognize and can be dealt with only by strength. A policy of appeasement would 
only make them bolder and wilder.

EASING QUAKE DISRUPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It will take at least a year and billions of dollars to repair the gaping 
holes of L.A.'s transportation system. But for thousands of workers, the 
digital superhighway can serve where the physical highway has collapsed -- in a 
fraction of the time, at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 6.6 million workers nationwide are telecommuters -- employees of 
business or government who work full or part-time from home. Many of these 
workers live in the L.A. area, and Mayor Richard Riordan, city, state and 
federal officials should immediately take steps to increase their numbers, 
working with the business community and Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 A good start would be the establishment of a government-industry telecommuting 
task force. The task force's primary role would be to identify which jobs, both 
public and private sector, could be performed from a remote location with no 
loss in productivity. The task force could then recommend employer incentives 
to support telecommuting options.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's just for starters. What's also needed is an ongoing effort to put 
digital technology to work for L.A.'s economy. Video-conferencing, wireless 
communications and other advancements offer cheap, non-polluting alternatives 
to commuting, and allow economic growth without increased strain on our fragile 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector is spending billions on the digital highway. By adapting 
current jobs to new technology, government can piggyback onto this enormous 
investment, increasing revenues and lowering costs into the future. Let's start 
down this road now. It won't collapse when the next disaster strikes.

 * As I brace myself for my newly disrupted commuting experience from Santa 
Monica to downtown Los Angles, several ideas strike me as worth considering to 
alleviate the traffic problems while I-10 is reconstructed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Several alternate routes might become one-way streets to increase traffic 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
 * All stoplights on these routes might be recalibrated to increase the flow of 
traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 * Some streets might become "flexible" in their direction. For example, 
Olympic might be one-way east in the morning and then one-way west in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * All east and west streets might have no-stopping zones along their entire 
length to free up lanes and improve flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the city and county might designate certain lanes as bus-only lanes 
and increase the number of express bus services.

PREPAREDNESS ISN'T OPTIONAL; MAYBE CALIFORNIA SHOULD MANDATE HOUSEHOLD SEISMIC 
SAFETY INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL READY FOR THE BIG ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans cherish the right to self-expression and achievement, but even the 
most rugged individualists among us concede that sometimes, the concerns of the 
individual must be subordinate to the good of the larger community. We agree, 
for instance, that people must be licensed to drive on public streets. And to 
ensure that only safe, non-polluting cars are driven, autos must be inspected 
and registered. For our children to enter school, we must show proof that they 
have been inoculated against contagious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us may grumble at the inconvenience of getting these things done, but 
we understand why they are necessary. For the most part, we do not rail at the 
government for forcing us to do them. We do not consider them fascist plots to 
rid us of our precious right of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's time to extend mandatory requirements to earthquake preparedness, 
since too many of us seem uninterested in preparing for the self-sufficiency 
that will be necessary after the next huge temblor. The scenario for chaos and 
devastation has been illustrated pretty graphically by the Northridge quake 
last week; seismologists and disaster relief experts say that it can only 
become worse as our tectonic plates grind and shift inexorably toward the Big 
One. If a 6.6 earthquake was able to level buildings, snap the ribbons of 
highways that serve as our arteries for transportation and commerce and 
threaten to pollute much of our water supply, it stands to reason that even 
less will be left after an 8. 
</P>
<P>
 We know this, and we know that it will take much longer for relief or rescue 
after the Big One. We know that, unlike the Northridge quake, when help began 
arriving within hours, we may be on our own for days. We know that the four 
hopelessly outdated cans of creamed corn, the two liters of bottled water and 
the Wet Wipes we call our quake kit will be inadequate. Yet as the aftershocks 
wind down and life returns to normal, it is human nature for us to become less 
concerned about our chances for survival when the earth moves big-time. 
</P>
<P>
 So like children who are vaccinated against their will for a greater good, 
perhaps it's time to discuss ways in which we Californians can be encouraged -- 
forced, if necessary -- to become more earthquake-ready. Just as our cars are 
inspected biennially, perhaps our living spaces could be inspected for the 
presence of seismic bracing and quake kits. Insurance companies now offer 
reductions to those with good driving records; perhaps points could be given 
for residents who brace bookcases, bolt foundations, reinforce plate-glass 
windows. A 1% tax hike could cover the indigent families and the fixed-income 
elderly and disabled. (Yes, it's going to cost money, but it's infinitely 
cheaper to pay for preventive measures than to finance a massive clean-up. Our 
purchasing power doesn't seem to have been affected by the tax invoked to 
assist victims of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. Would you really put back that 
soft drink if it cost a few pennies more?) 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's time to revive the Civilian Defense Corps. During World War II, 
members patrolled their neighborhoods, making sure security orders were obeyed. 
During the Cold War, they mapped air-raid shelters, taught post-nuclear 
survival and urged us all to keep water, dried food and blankets ready to 
survive the aftermath of nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of a major earthquake may be nearly as traumatic, but at least 
we usually can emerge from the rubble without fearing widespread nuclear 
contamination. The ultimate irony would be to survive the quake only to die in 
the weeks following from starvation, dehydration or treatable illness or injury 
if because, like the grasshopper in the fable, we couldn't be bothered to put 
some essentials away. 
</P>
<P>
 As life returns to normal, do yourself a favor: Clip and keep the quake 
information provided in this and other newspapers. Use the quake-kit 
suggestions like a shopping list and, each time you go to a grocery, drug or 
hardware store, buy one or two items and toss them into your kit. You know what 
you'd want if you had to live totally under your own steam for, say, two weeks. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake was a huge alarm for Southern Californians; let's don't 
hit the snooze button and roll over. We might not get a second chance.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / DAILY REPORT; PLAYERS DON'T SEE RED OVER GEORGIA FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid talk of blitzes and blocking schemes, the Buffalo Bills' Cornelius 
Bennett was moved Tuesday to speak about the time his father gave him a 
historical tour of downtown Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was 73 years old, and he had seen it all," recalled Bennett, who is 
black. "He took me and showed me the Alabama state capitol, and told me some of 
the things that had happened there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed me various water fountains, and told me what had happened there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett sighed and pondered the original question. Was he bothered by state of 
Georgia's refusal to lower the state flag -- containing a Confederate flag -- 
outside the Georgia Dome for the Super Bowl on Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess when I think of the flag I think, no matter (how much) people look at 
it, it's not going to stop us anymore," he said. "It's just a symbol of a 
culture now. And nothing anybody tries to do can change that." 
</P>
<P>
 This reaction was shared by several players Tuesday, their subdued reaction 
contrasting with local protest over the flag decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, players from both teams either said that they believe the Georgia 
flag is merely another state flag, or that it is not the time or place to put 
up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 After refusing to hold a Super Bowl in Phoenix several years ago because of 
the Martin Luther King Day controversy, the league has decided to avoid this 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 With the flag being flown outside the dome, instead of over the playing field, 
it is remaining neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 So are the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a black first, and a player second, but right now, I'm just dealing with 
being a Cowboy," said the Cowboys' Nate Newton, of Orlando, Fla. "After the 
Super Bowl, I will give you my true feelings, but why say anything now, when 
everybody has been working so hard to get here? 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is the biggest thing for all of us this week. Why not keep it that 
way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, formerly of the University of Alabama, said he would get angry when 
he saw campus groups waving the Confederate battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, you know, we have enough pushing and fighting over other things," he 
said. "I'm satisfied that most people don't look at the flag like they used 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Hull, a white from Mississippi, is also satisfied that most view the 
Georgia flag differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "That flag is part of my heritage and contains no symbolism whatsoever," Hull 
said. "It's got nothing to do with slavery. Nothing to do with racism. New York 
has a state flag, and Georgia has a state flag. That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from both teams are worried that the salary cap will prevent 
them from continuing their Super Bowl streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of changes -- there has to be changes, because of that 
terrible agreement we signed," said Michael Irvin, Cowboy receiver. "It's just 
a matter of how much." 
</P>
<P>
 John Butler, general manager of the Bills, said, "Ultimately, there will be 
fewer great teams because the agreement brings everybody together. It disturbs 
me that we will not reward scouting and development, but instead reward the guy 
who has money left over under the cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Feb. 17 is the date of reckoning. After that, every team 
must be under the salary cap. Many veterans with long-term, non-guaranteed 
deals expect to be releasedthen. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody is predicting doom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Jerry Jones dissed CBS in the TV negotiations, didn't he?" asked Newton 
of the Cowboys. "If he can do that, he can keep this team together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have spent the last two weeks saying that Coach Jimmy Johnson does 
not treat all players the same and guard Kevin Gogan offered an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember once when Michael Irvin came in late to a meeting," Gogan said, 
holding his hand high. "Jimmy looked back at him and said, 'That's OK, Michael, 
because you're up here. With Jimmy, you've got guys up there, and guys way 
down." BILL PLASCHKE

 Cowboy defensive tackle Tony Casillas, who was traded from Atlanta in 1991, is 
no fan of former Falcon coach Jerry Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I've got to say is the last time I checked, he was in Memphis looking for 
a job and finally found one as an Elvis Presley impersonator," Casillas 
said."I'm glad to be back in Atlanta. I'm here, and he's not."

 A mob of reporters surrounded Cowboy defensive end Charles Haley, but he was 
not impressed.

 "This is just another game," Haley said. "It may be a big game to some people, 
but it's just a regular game to me because I already won my big game."

TITAN NOTEBOOK / MIKE DIGIOVANNA; TESTIMONY HEATS UP IN HUFFMAN'S SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Rogers, Titan gymnastics coach, said the trial involving former women's 
volleyball Coach Jim Huffman, who filed a $1.2-million wrongful termination 
suit against the school, has put "a negative cloud over the university." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more like a cumulonimbus cloud, delivering occasional thunder and 
lightning to the courtroom and a steady drizzle over the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are very, very tense around here," one athletic department employee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-time coaches and administrators testifying against their school. Athletic 
department employees testifying against their athletic director. Personal 
attacks on witnesses, which have led to skirmishes among attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the dynamics in Orange County Superior Court, where the 
tension has thickened during the first week of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys, who must prove that retaliation was a motive in the March 
23, 1992, firing of the coach, spent much of the first week trying to build a 
foundation that Huffman was a good coach whose program, despite a 25-80 record 
from 1989-91, was making significant improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim the school terminated Huffman not because of substandard 
performance but because the coach "spoke out about illegalities in the CSUF 
athletic department and initiated successful legal proceedings, which resulted 
in negative publicity to the school and its administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman was fired one working day after a judge signed a preliminary 
injunction blocking the school's Jan. 28, 1992, attempt to drop volleyball. 
Huffman and his players had subsequently filed a suit claiming the move 
violated state sex discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, former Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll, and volleyball coaches 
Craig Choate (San Jose State), Paul Lenae (Nevada) and Marlon Sano (Utah State) 
are among those who have testified on Huffman's behalf, and Huffman spent a day 
and a half on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kevin Gerry, who claims the decision not to renew Huffman's 
appointment was made in November or December of 1991 -- before the school tried 
to drop the sport -- has hammered away at the team's record and NCAA violations 
that occurred in the volleyball program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry also questioned Huffman's performance in fund-raising and academics. 
Defense witnesses will begin testifying next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key testimony so far: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carroll, who resigned as Fullerton athletic director in February, 1991, said 
Huffman's NCAA violations were "very minor" and that the administration was 
"extremely pleased with the quality of recruits Jim was bringing in and his 
creative fund-raising efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lisa Hall, student secretary during the 1991-92 school year for Fullerton 
Athletic Director Bill Shumard, said business manager Nan Bullington had a 
meeting with Shumard in December, 1991, and was told that Huffman's contract 
was going to be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffman said Shumard told him that volleyball -- and Huffman's job -- were 
discontinued "because of budgetary reasons -- not a word was mentioned about 
performance problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rogers said that after Huffman filed the gender-equity lawsuit, Maryalyce 
Jeremiah, associate athletic director, told Rogers that "a line had been drawn 
in the sand between Jim and the university." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil case had been fairly civilized until Monday, when Gerry, during his 
cross-examination of Huffman, asked: "Isn't it true that (Colorado State Coach) 
Rich Feller was not going to rehire you (as an assistant in 1989) because of an 
affair you were having with a student-athlete?" 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kirk Boyd's vociferous objection was sustained, and the question was 
stricken from the record. Afterward, Boyd fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be bringing up relationships, that's a violation of the court agreement 
(not to discuss such allegations)," Boyd told Gerry. "That's despicable!" 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jared Huffman, who is also representing his brother, accused Gerry of 
smear tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just trying to plant sleazy seeds in the minds of the jury," Huffman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three Big West volleyball coaches and Carroll, now the associate athletic 
director for financial affairs at UC Irvine, all testified that Huffman's 
gender-equity suit, his firing and his subsequent wrongful-termination suit 
have permanently damaged his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, who now works for an Anaheim sports apparel company, said he has 
applied for several Division I head coaching jobs but, for most positions, "I 
don't even get a response." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenae of Nevada testified that he tried to hire Huffman as an assistant "but 
was not allowed to -- my women's athletic director said she didn't want to have 
the press in Reno dealing with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Choate of San Jose State said he thought Huffman's coaching career was over in 
1992. "Bucking the system doesn't endear you to many administrators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Carroll: "People don't want to hire people who file lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry said current Titan Coach Mary Ellen Murchison, whose teams are 2-55 in 
two seasons, was able to get a Division I job despite filing a gender-equity 
suit against Santa Clara in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did that to cover their butts," Huffman claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Titan football Coach Gene Murphy testified that his program was placed 
on two years private probation by the Big West in 1990 for NCAA rules 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fullerton assistant coach was reprimanded for using his personal credit card 
to register five players in summer-school courses, and Murphy was reprimanded 
for bringing an academically ineligible freshman on the season-opening trip to 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy and Carroll testified that the football violations were "much more 
serious" than the volleyball violations in 1990 -- $1.16 in improper phone 
calls by athletes and an extra housing benefit provided for an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Shumard talked to Murphy about the violations after Shumard became 
athletic director in 1991, Murphy replied, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was ever told his job was in jeopardy because of the violations, 
Murphy replied, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 The school claims the volleyball violations, which occurred before Shumard 
arrived, led in part to Huffman's termination. Huffman's attorneys are trying 
to establish that Shumard knew of Murphy's more serious violations but took no 
action against the football coach, yet he used less severe infractions against 
Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 1993 final four men's soccer team will make an encore performance 
on Feb. 12, when it plays host to FC Keli Linz, a First Division professional 
team from Austria, in a 4:30 p.m. exhibition in Titan Stadium. The game will 
mark the final Titan appearances of seniors Mike Ammann, Ken Hesse, Paul 
McDonald, Todd Patrick and Mark Vaught, who led the team to a 16-7 record last 
season. . . . A women's alumni basketball game, featuring former Fullerton 
standouts such as Genia Miller, Claudette Jackson and Jill Matyuch, will be 
held at 5 p.m. Saturday, preceding the Fullerton-Nevada Las Vegas game.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: IT MIGHT NOT SHOW, BUT RUSTLERS' 
BRUN IS HAVING A BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristin Brun, a sophomore guard from Golden West College, has fun playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Really, she does. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how it might look to everybody else, she is having the time of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the first to admit that she gives the wrong impression because of her 
game face. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad always tells me that I have to smile more," she said. "But I'm very 
serious on the court. Every win is important to me. The more the better. . . . 
But I'm having a blast, it's too much hard work not to." 
</P>
<P>
 Brun, a two-year starter who is usually all smiles off the court, said the 
steady emotional course she follows is especially important because of her 
primary role as point guard for the Rustlers (23-3, 5-0 in the Orange Empire 
Conference). 
</P>
<P>
 Brun, who normally plays all 40 minutes of a game, leads Golden West in 
assists, averaging five. But she doesn't appear in the top 10 in any other 
Orange Empire Conference statistical category. 
</P>
<P>
 Brun, who is 5 feet 8, makes contributions in several areas.She had a 
career-high 16 rebounds as Golden West held off Saddleback, 54-48, last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me that I don't score that much," said Brun, 20. "I prefer 
to work on my defense and rebounding. If you are only a scorer, you can have an 
off-night. But defense and rebounding will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 She is averaging nine points, fourth-best on the team, and 6.3 rebounds. Brun 
has made 51 of 66 free throws for a team-best 77%. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the most under-rated players in the state," Golden West Coach 
Dave Stricklin said. "She can do whatever we need. Some nights she can score 
and other nights she gets rebounds. Plus, with her experience, she is like 
having a coach on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Burn actually gets a chance to work as a coach in another place. She is a 
lower-level assistant for the Ocean View High girls' program. Brun played four 
years on the Ocean View varsity, the last two as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really helps me to be a coach," Brun said. "You start to understand why 
(coaches) want you to do certain things in a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's showdown: Golden West, the No. 1-ranked team in Southern California 
and the state's No. 2 team, plays Fullerton (16-10, 4-1) at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West enters the game with a 22-game Orange Empire Conference winning 
streak.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, relying on a balanced attack, has won three in a row and four of 
five, including a 60-54 upset of Cypress in overtime Friday. Cypress is ranked 
sixth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress had posted a 66-57 victory over Fullerton in December in the Fullerton 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a legitimate shot, but you can't play average and beat them," 
Fullerton Coach Colleen Riley said of Golden West. "They know how to win -- 
they do it year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Men's race: One game separates the top four teams as they prepare to play the 
last first-round game of the Orange Empire Conference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (15-6, 5-1) and Riverside (19-5, 5-1) are tied for first and 
Fullerton (19-6, 4-2) and Irvine Valley (16-8, 4-2) are a game back. Irvine 
Valley travels to Saddleback in the key game today. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will feature two of the conference's top scorers in Saddleback's Tes 
Whitlock and Irvine Valley's Rashad Wilson. Both are averaging 19.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroing in: Matt Kenney, a freshman guard at Cypress, is narrowing in on the 
college's single season and career mark for three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney has made 76 three-pointers this season, putting him two behind Mike 
Varos, who made 78 in the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney, from Servite High School, also leads the team in scoring (14 points).

LOS ALAMITOS; NEW ZEALAND REMAINS THE LAND OF MILK AND MONEY FOR GOROV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The list of New Zealand-breds that have found the winner's circle in recent 
years at Los Alamitos reads like a who's who of California harness racing in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses such as Mercury, Stand By, Robbie Hest, Cool Charm Girl, Star Legacy, 
Kenwood Don, Popsicle, Kurahaupo Pride, Vance Lobell and Jiffy's Girl have been 
imported to California and won major races or set track records. Some of the 
New Zealand horses have stayed in California for several seasons, while others 
raced only a few times before being sold to buyers in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, even though the current meeting is only three weeks old, New 
Zealand-bred pacers are already having an impact. The latest is a 6-year-old 
mare, Greta Lobell, who has won two of her three starts this year, including 
the invitational for fillies and mares on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Lobell is owned by Elliott Gorov of Laguna Niguel, whose list of imports 
in the past few years includes such major winners as Mary Franco, Sherman and 
Nicola Mary. Last summer, Gorov sent driver James Lackey on a scouting trip to 
New Zealand. Lackey, a perennial top-10 driver at Los Alamitos, returned with 
only two mares -- Greta Lobell and another 6-year-old mare, Yes My Lady, who 
finished sixth behind Greta Lobell on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lackey spent two weeks in New Zealand last June. He saw Yes My Lady win twice, 
including a race against Greta Lobell. On the last day of the trip, he had a 
chance to "test-drive" Greta Lobell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes My Lady won both starts that I saw and I got the impression watching her 
that she had a real strong will, a good attitude," Lackey said. "Greta Lobell 
showed reasonably well. She raced pretty good against Yes My Lady and she 
didn't cost a whole lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trained (Greta Lobell) on a half-mile track. I went slow for three-quarters 
of a mile and she came a huge (final) quarter and she felt strong. Sometimes 
you get fooled, but the price was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorov paid $13,500 for Greta Lobell, his cheapest purchase in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd had eight starts (in New Zealand) and had gotten sick," Gorov said. 
"Sometimes you hear that they are sick and it's difficult to believe it, but I 
think she was always sick." 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in California, Greta Lobell spent a month in training at a 
Hemet farm and then a month training at Sacramento. She was supposed to 
accompany Lackey on the Alberta circuit, but when she came down with a slight 
sickness, he sent her to trainer Stu Boschman at Cloverdale Raceway, near 
Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Gorov and Lackey realized what they had purchased. Greta Lobell reeled 
off five wins in a row and by the end of the year had won seven of her nine 
North American starts.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Great Lobell led from start to finish, even though that wasn't the 
game plan. In her first Los Alamitos victory on Jan. 14, she stalked the early 
leaders, took the lead on the backstretch, and won by 5 1/2 lengths. Her time 
of 1:54 1/5 was the fastest mile of her career. Lackey was hoping to come from 
behind on Friday, but wound up on the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory came against the best older mares in California, including Stand 
By, Brilliant Colors and Cool Charm Girl. Stand By, an 8-year-old New 
Zealand-bred mare, won more than $102,000 in California and Illinois last year. 
She's winless in three starts at Los Alamitos this year, but has not been worse 
than third. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliant Colors is an American-bred who won the first two invitationals for 
fillies and mares this year. Cool Charm Girl, another New Zealand-bred, is 11, 
and although she has been overmatched in three starts this year, she had a 
career-best time of 1:53 3/5 last summer at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a great field we beat," Gorov said. "You could go anywhere in the 
United States, (except) The Meadowlands, with those mares and win. When you 
race that race 10 times, you'll get a lot of different winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorov is maintaining a conservative approach for the future. Nicola Mary will 
race again soon, which will allow him to rest one mare each week and race the 
other two. If Greta Lobell continues to improve, a trip to The Meadowlands is a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Lackey might be headed back to New Zealand in the next month. His record for 
his last crop of imports is perfect -- two winning mares, both of whom have 
earned spots in the top class for fillies and mares at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just trying to buy horses worth the money," Lackey said. "There's no 
possible way I could have thought they would be doing this. It's just extremely 
good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Effective Thursday, purses for overnight races have been cut 20% as a result 
of poor mutuel handle. Through Saturday, the average handle was $705,891, 
roughly $150,000 below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 winter-spring harness meeting averaged $842,511 and purses for this 
year's meeting were based on an average handle of $850,000. Fred Kuebler, the 
general manager of the Premier Harness Racing Assn., a consortium of harness 
owners and breeders leasing Los Alamitos for harness racing, said the purse 
structure will be re-evaluated throughout the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep the purse payments under control when you have a 12-week 
meeting," he said. "If we had a year-long meet like the quarter horses, we 
could ride it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a couple of months to get these horses going, and you suffer when 
your lead-in time is only two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The harness meeting wasn't announced until mid-December, giving horsemen only 
three weeks to prepare their horses. Many horses hadn't started since last 
summer at Sacramento and only now have had a couple of starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The betting handle on Friday and Saturday was the best weekend of the meet, a 
reflection of the number of horses ready to race on a weekly basis. Friday's 
handle of $876,011 was the best of the first three weeks of the meet and 
Saturday's handle of $814,342 was the best Saturday of the meeting. The figures 
are roughly $200,000 less than weekend figures from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take another look at the purses after the sixth week and we might put 
it back up," Kuebler said. "(Friday) night improved and (Saturday) night looked 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The purse cuts affected all classes. Maidens, who raced for $2,700 last week, 
will have purses of $2,200 this week. Saturday's invitational was an $11,000 
race last week, but will be only $8,800 this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 California-bred stakes will resume on Thursday and continue through the week 
with divisions for 3- and 4-year-old pacers and trotters. Thursday's program 
will feature two stakes for trotters, including a $26,000 division for 
4-year-old fillies that drew four horses. Eggwhite, who won the California 
Breeders Stakes two weeks ago and finished fourth against males last week, will 
be a heavy favorite. Presented as the fourth race, the stakes will have win and 
exacta wagering only. There will be 14 races on Thursday, including 11 live and 
three simulcast from The Meadowlands.

SUNSET LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; MARINA ALONE IN FIRST AFTER BEATING SEAHAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ocean View showed the kind of resiliency that makes the Sunset League so 
tough, but it was Marina's unbending defense that determined who's in first 
place today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Marina fended off a late charge by sixth-ranked Ocean View and 
gained a 48-45 victory over the visiting Seahawks, taking sole possession of 
first place in the county's strongest girls' basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (14-5, 7-1 in league) got 15 points and eight rebounds from Shandy 
Robbins, who sat out the final five minutes of the third quarter after 
committing her fourth foul. Ocean View (15-4, 6-2) then closed an 11-point 
deficit to 39-34 entering the fourth. Becky Fraser, who missed her first 11 
shots, then made three in a row and tied the score at 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Norie Nakase's layup after a full-court pass from Marina's Martita Emde on an 
inbounds play with 1:21 left -- immediately following Fraser's fifth foul -- 
made it 48-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina's defense made the difference, especially Nakase, who made only her 
fourth start of the season. She held three-point specialist Jennifer Tuiolosega 
to four points and one three-point attempt -- with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View shooting was poor, (31%), including going three of 16 to open the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Coach Pete Bonny was called for a technical foul -- he crossed the 
midcourt line -- with 28 seconds left, giving Ocean View an opportunity to win, 
but Dustine Yamamoto made one of two free throws and the Seahawks came up empty 
on the ensuing possession. MARTIN HENDERSON

 Jeremiah Ross, a 6-5, 285-pound first-team all-county lineman from Rancho 
Alamitos, made an oral commitment to Fresno State and wide receivers Geoff 
Noisy of Irvine High and Matt Denny of Mission Viejo have committed to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get a chance to contribute as a freshman," said Ross, a senior, who 
recently visited Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 Noisy, who also played defensive back, confirmed his choice after visiting the 
Reno campus on his only recruiting trip, Irvine Coach Terry Henigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noisy was a Times second-team all-county selection and first-team All-Sea View 
League pick this season. He helped the Vaqueros to the Division IV 
championship, their third section title in a row.

GIRLS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; MARINA'S BENSON GETS VICTORY, AND A PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Top-ranked Marina dominated eighth-ranked Ocean View everywhere in the first 
half, except the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got sort of frustrating," Marina midfielder Jenny Benson said. "You only 
get so many opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 But Benson didn't let her opportunity pass in the second half as she whistled 
a wide-open shot past Ocean View goalkeeper Keri Lawson to give her team a 1-0 
victory in a Sunset League girls' soccer game Tuesday at Marina, and herself a 
present on her 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Benson's teammates thanked her by giving her a birthday hat and 
singing happy birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to score a goal on my birthday," she said. "It was a set-piece, 
and I was wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson was actually denied on her first shot, but the rebound came back to 
her. She didn't miss again and scored her 10th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (19-0-1, 6-0-1 in league) outshot Ocean View, 13-1, in the first half 
and, 20-4, in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always have trouble with them," Benson said. "We just needed to hang 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 After Benson scored, Ocean View (12-7-2, 3-3-1) had one more chance to score, 
but Kimberly Engesser's shot was deflected off the crossbar by Marina 
goalkeeper Jennifer Simmons with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina extended its unbeaten streak to 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 2, Huntington Beach 0 -- Second-ranked Edison (18-3-2, 6-1) remained a 
half-game behind Marina. Nicole Price and Erin Bailey scored for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>

Smith scored in the first half for host Brea-Olinda (7-6-3, 5-0-1). Juli Evers 
and Amy Alexander scored second-half goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia 0, Savanna 0 -- Valencia (6-6-5, 3-0-3) still hasn't been scored on 
in league play, but failed to get a victory as Savanna's Rene Miller recorded 
20 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Coast League:

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: DEPARTING GRANT CENTER GETS MORE THAN HANDSHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the first phone calls made by Grant High basketball Coach Howie Levine 
shortly after last week's earthquake was to former player Rick Forscutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Forscutt, a 6-8 senior center, played his last game for Grant on Jan. 14 -- 
the same day escrow closed on his parents' home. The Forscutts were set to move 
to Provo, Utah, the following Monday. Before the sun rose Monday, however, 
Levine was tempted to flee the shaken area with the Forscutts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called up over there to see if there was any space in the back of the car," 
Levine said. "I was ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the chaos and horror that engulfed the area hours after the 
earthquake, the moving vans arrived on schedule at the Forscutts' house in Van 
Nuys on Monday morning, and the Forscutts left the state as planned. Levine was 
left behind to pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levine is certain to miss Forscutt, who was the top rebounder and one of the 
leading scorers for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forscutt, who set a school record last season for shooting percentage (68.3%), 
averaged 10.9 points and eight rebounds in 15 games this season, helping Grant 
(12-3) rebound from a 9-14 season a year ago. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE

<P>
 Sylmar Shakes 'Em Up 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Athletic Director Bob Miller should have known something like this 
would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who coached the Sylmar basketball team many years ago, should have 
warned Coach Jose Fernandez that the earth shakes when Sylmar is successful on 
the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the best season he ever had was in 1971," Fernandez said, "I said, 
'So, how come you didn't warn me this would happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar has a 9-7 record and is in first place by one game in the East Valley 
League. Sylmar was 21-72 over the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone told me when I took this job that the day Sylmar is in first place is 
the day the earth will end," Fernandez said. CAMINO REAL LEAGUE

<P>
 Dear Dan 
</P>
<P>
 So, how do you shoot free throws in the wind? And how do you avoid dribbling 
through puddles? 
</P>
<P>
 Some area basketball teams were forced by the earthquake to practice outdoors. 
If advice on how to do it is needed, St. Genevieve Coach Dan Donovan is 
volunteering his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no gym at St. Genevieve, Donovan is an expert on playing 
against the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been (practicing outdoors) for three years," Donovan said. "They should 
call me for advice. I feel like I should be a consultant and make some money."

 In Search of . . . a Gym 
</P>
<P>
 What's a guy to do? 
</P>
<P>
 With a majority of the gyms in the San Fernando Valley either damaged or being 
used as emergency relief centers, finding a place to play basketball is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive week, all City Section games were postponed, 
leaving players to find ways to avoid getting rusty. Fact is, there aren't many 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real swingman Charles Adams, an All-City player who lives in the 
Valley, said he has been shooting around at Sherman Oaks CES High, a City 
school that didn't sustain major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they let me in," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he received word that this week's games also had been postponed, Adams 
said he planned to round up some friends for a pick-up game. Somewhere. . . .

<P>
 Palmdale is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Its players can spell role . 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons entered the week with a 9-0 record in league play and 15-3 overall 
thanks to each player's acceptance of performing a specific task. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 69-61 victory over Antelope Valley earlier this month, three key 
contributors were unavailable: Rocque Sandoval was on a football recruiting 
trip to New Mexico, Maurice Wright was sidelined because of a knee injury and 
Shad Martin was suffering the effects of food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-guard Mike Hamelin stepped forward with his biggest night of the season, 
finishing with 11 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. "Having a bunch of guys 
who can come off the bench has really helped," Coach Garry Phelps said. "Depth 
has been important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale defeated second-place Highland, 63-57, Friday night, with four Falcon 
players scoring between nine and 16 points.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: IT'S NO 'SIMPSONS,' BUT TOON IN; TELEVISION: FROM THE FOLKS 
WHO BROUGHT US BART AND HOMER, ABC'S NEW 'THE CRITIC' TAKES AIM AT A SLEW OF 
TARGETS. WHEN IT HITS, IT'S VERY FUNNY.

<P>
 Television has trekked so far since "The Flintstones" that prime-time's Fred, 
Wilma and blithering Barney of the 1960s seem like quaint time-travelers from a 
Merchant-Ivory movie, gently remembered high tops, corsets and bustles from a 
much earlier era. 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rated animated feature "Fritz the Cat" made the movie public's fur fly 
in 1971, but that was nothing compared to the loud screeching and honking that 
has greeted the crude antics of a pair of pointy-brained cartoon toms from MTV. 
How ironic that the nation's least-watched animated night-time series -- the 
humorously inane "Beavis and Butt-head" -- has become the most mentioned. It 
has easily topped all other TV cartoons in headlines this season, its teen 
protagonists' allegiance to self-destructive buffoonery earning them a place 
high on the hit lists of those aiming to sweep away broadcasting's lint. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an underclass of its own, "Beavis and Butt-head" hardly owns the 
market when it comes to adult animation. For several years that honor has 
belonged to "The Simpsons," the hilariously dysfunctional family that Matt 
Groening created more or less as filler for "The Tracey Ullman Show" on Fox 
before reinventing his creatures for their own successful half-hour series on 
the same network in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So cartoon-infused is "The Simpsons" that the older kids themselves -- Bart 
and Lisa -- can't get enough of "The Itchy and Scratchy Show," a violent, 
blood-splattering animated TV show about a sadistic mouse and the cat he 
constantly terrorizes. A send-up of all the gory cartoons for kids that 
reformers have been attacking for years, the cartoon within the cartoon is 
sometimes the show's funniest element. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare on television when genius strikes twice in succession. 
</P>
<P>
 As former executive producers of "The Simpsons," a remarkable series as smart 
and witty as anything ever on television, Al Jean and Mike Reiss have big shoes 
to fill. Their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ABC animated series "The Critic" premieres at 8:30 tonight on Channels 
7, 3, 10 and 42, relying on the snide voice of Jon Lovitz, some mischievous 
writing and pictures from the animators of "The Simpsons" to depict the world 
of a short, plump, balding movie snob whose reviews for a New York cable 
channel fall just short of nasty. In fact, so does he. 
</P>
<P>
 The keys to the new series are the writing (the opening script comes from Jean 
and Reiss) and Lovitz, who doesn't so much speak as he does blow out gusts of 
words that seem to fade or dissipate like smoke before they complete a 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Critic" isn't "The Simpsons." Of course, even "The Simpsons" isn't always 
"The Simpsons" anymore. There was a time when its humor was piled on like 
lasagna layers, and peeling each of them back was part of the fun of watching. 
Every show was tightly packed with jokes, to the extent that you could watch a 
second or even a third time and still discover something -- a visual nuance, a 
throwaway reference -- that you missed in earlier viewings. Lately, though, 
there are no layers. What you immediately see and hear is everything you get. 
The show's bratty Bart and once bankable Homer humor are flatter, the gags 
often labored and belabored, and the characters inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with fairly solid ratings, "The Simpsons" still has its moments, still 
is a couple of dozen IQ points above most television. But those moments are 
less frequent, as if Groening and this season's writers have mislaid some of 
the old magic formula's herbs and spices. What used to be finger lickin' 
tremendous is now finger lickin' pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At times, "The Critic" is not even that. A divorced dad with an 11-year-old 
son, Jay Sherman (Lovitz) tonight is an ugly dumpling with an ethical crisis. 
The beautiful star of a film he will soon review -- the kind of luscious woman 
he would usually never attract (the voice of Jennifer Lien) -- picks this 
moment to come on to him. Does he sleep with her or not? 
</P>
<P>
 His dilemma is more than matched by the one that this plot-line poses. Like a 
plane that circles without landing, Sherman is held too long in limbo by this 
love throbbing and is diverted from the much funnier task of satirizing the 
goings-on within the entertainment industry. Those hills are full of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, "The Critic" does indeed sniff out a slew of targets with 
exposed jugulars, and the show's protagonist himself turns out to be one of 
those critics whose means of discourse (he rates movies on his Shermometer) 
replicates the very mass culture that he wishes to diminish. There are some 
very funny jabs here at movies, from "Home Alone V" to "Rabbi P.I.," starring 
Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Chicago cop who wears his thick accent like a prayer 
shawl while going undercover as a Hasidic Jew ("Hava Nagila, baby"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" also takes a hit, as do Gene Shalit (his own voice), 
Woody Allen and Marlon Brando, who shows up as the mumbling manservant Mr. 
French in a neo "Family Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Even at its funniest, though, "The Critic" is a sanitized Pillsbury Doughboy 
compared to HBO's TV-satirizing "The Larry Sanders Show," Garry Shandling's 
live-action hybrid of butt-kicking meanness and lethal subtlety that never 
fails to impale its mark. On the Shermometer, "The Critic" rates about a 7. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Double Duty: As a family program, "Treasure Island: The Adventure Begins . . 
." rated a 0. As a commercial for the newest venture of Mirage Resorts Inc, it 
rated a 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that it was advertised as a program, appearing under the banner 
of an "NBC Special." 
</P>
<P>
 Although confirming that Mirage Resorts paid about $1.7 million for this 
infantile hour that preempted NBC's "seaQuest DSV" last Sunday, the network 
refused to tip off viewers by labeling it up front as a paid program. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let's see. The executive producer was none other than Mirage Resorts CEO 
Steve Wynn. And who should show up in one of the opening scenes? Why, Wynn 
himself, greeting the characters of Mama, Papa and son Robbie Wallace as they 
began their vacation at the new pirate-themed Treasure Island resort at Wynn's 
Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, mate, it appears you like pirates," Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's Steve Wynn," said 12-year-old Robbie (Corey Carrier). 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, call him "the head pirate," said Wynn, who spoke from the heart about 
Treasure Island. "To me, it's more than a hotel. It's a fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," Robbie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great!" gushed Robbie's idiot dad. 
</P>
<P>
 What ensued -- the entire "plot" took place at and promoted Treasure Island -- 
was a story that was written to serve the commercial, an unlabeled hour 
infomercial whose own regular two-minute commercial breaks included several 
spots touting Las Vegas and Mirage Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC called this "a family special, an action-adventure type story, an hour of 
entertainment." It's also called walking the plank for dollars.

 LESSONS LEARNED: Cypress College administrators are taking a cue from "Search 
and Destroy," a school play about a film producer whose scheme to raise money 
by dealing drugs ends in murder. . . . The college needs $10,000 to send its 
production to Northern California for the annual American College Theater 
Festival, but they definitely won't be selling any drugs to get the money. "We 
learned our lesson from the plot," said a laughing department chairwoman Kaleta

 AVOCADO SUNDAY: More avocados are consumed on Super Bowl Sunday than on any

Avocado Commission, and most of them are eaten as guacamole dip. . . . 
California avocado growers are shipping 5.5 million pounds across the nation

McQuade, assistant grocery manager at Ralphs supermarket in Costa Mesa.

 YABBA DABBA: Film buffs viewing Universal Picture's upcoming cinematic version 
of "The Flintstones" won't really be seeing Elizabeth Taylor as Fred 
Flintstone's mother in one scene. Instead they'll be watching Carole Reed, 
above, a Taylor look-alike, who traveled to the desert set to double for the 
star. . . . "There were a lot of snakes and scorpions there," said Reed, who 
runs a talent agency in Lake Forest. "They took me on location so that Liz

 SPIC AND SPAN: Antique car enthusiast Arnold S. Beckman likes his cars looking

commissioners to let him expand his garage to a six-car working area, which 
they pointed out would be bigger than his house. In one area, Beckman said, he 
planned to prepare his restored 1956 Ford pickup truck for a summer tour by 
spending two weeks detailing it with a box of Q-Tips. "And you enjoy that?" 
asked Commissioner Libby Cowan. "I love it," Beckman said proudly.

BILL BOYARSKY: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SPECIAL HELP NEEDED FOR ELDERLY, 
THE HIDDEN VICTIMS OF QUAKE

 Late on Monday afternoon, an elderly woman collapsed while applying for help 
at the Crenshaw Boulevard earthquake relief center. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a moment of confusion. People shouted, "Call 911!" Across the room, 
at the crisis counseling desk, Barbara McNeil Thompson, a registered nurse and 
county mental department worker, excused herself from our interview, hurried to 
the woman's side and bathed her brow with a wet paper towel until the 
paramedics arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 "That lady had not eaten in three days," Thompson told me later. "It was a 
minimum starvation type situation, coupled with not having a place to stay, 
coupled with going to a place where there is no organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Navigating the relief mechanisms that government has thrown together is 
proving to be too complicated, too exhausting for many elderly people, such as 
the woman at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not just my opinion. It's the view of the relief workers who have been 
watching men and women in their late 70s and 80s struggle to obtain aid. "They 
live alone, they have anxiety attacks, there ought to be mobile units set up 
for them (near their homes)," said Paula Cook, who works with Thompson at the 
center. "I hope you can highlight the plight of the seniors. This is a serious 
plight we are not addressing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had gone to the center to check on the situation in South-Central Los 
Angeles, still staggering from the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the state and the city all had 
representatives in the building, which, in normal times, serves as a Department 
of Water and Power office. 
</P>
<P>
 From the looks of it, South-Central has suffered plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a line of tired and worried-looking people extended along the side of 
the building, past the National Guard's water tank and the Red Cross van 
carrying bottled water and snacks. They told of four- and five-hour waits. A 
few portable toilets were on the sidewalk. Several women were pregnant. Others 
were holding babies. There was no place to sit. 
</P>
<P>
 After stepping inside from the late afternoon chill, the big interviewing room 
seemed especially hot and stuffy. Along the wall and in the center were tables 
put up by the city housing department, FEMA and state agencies. Everyone had 
questions, and their anxiety made their voices loud and sharp. The steady noise 
of voices was punctuated by babies crying, and by the occasional shout of an 
angry earthquake victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of them had to fill out fairly long forms to apply for various forms of 
aid. For FEMA disaster assistance, for example, there were more than 40 
questions. None of them were especially hard, although I was stumped when I got 
to question 29, which said "If any of questions 23-28 are marked yes, go to 
matrix A." I looked on both sides of the form and couldn't find anything marked 
matrix A. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the elderly woman brought home how the elderly are affected by 
the lines, the crowds, the noise, the paperwork. I thought about my parents' 
last years, when they were in their 80s. They were intelligent, sophisticated 
people, he a lawyer, she a teacher, who had overcome life's complications. My 
father, with his analytical, mathematical mind, was particularly good at it. 
But when the infirmities of old age hit, simple procedures -- banking by mail, 
dealing with the utilities company -- became difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many such people in Los Angeles, women and men in their 80s who live 
in apartments or in houses they had bought 40 years ago. Many of their homes 
had been damaged or destroyed Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Smith, acting general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Aging, said 
she thought the problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are phoning in, asking how they can get services," she said. "FEMA is 
telling seniors to phone our department. We did not find a lot of seniors in 
the shelters. We suspect that a lot of seniors are sitting in their homes. We 
know there is a problem. We are going to deal with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is planning to add temporary staff to help the elderly. Teams will be 
sent into neighborhoods to find them. The volunteers at the Crenshaw relief 
center are trying to deal with the problem, too. Barbara Rigali of the Red 
Cross said center personnel try to seek out the elderly in lines, and bring 
them inside for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are overwhelmed with all kinds of cases. Disaster has many 
variations, each one throwing a new curve to the volunteers, requiring more 
time and effort to answer questions and fill out forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith expects the problem to grow worse as outreach teams discover more 
elderly victims too confused to have sought assistance. They shouldn't be 
forgotten amid the many stronger and louder voices demanding help.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE LAST SHAKE?; LANDMARK: THE CLASSIC OUTLET 
IN DOWNEY HAS BEEN SHUT SINCE THE TEMBLOR. PRESERVATIONISTS ARE SKEPTICAL OF 
THE MOVE.

<P>
 A nostalgic McDonald's restaurant with a shaky future is even shakier because 
of last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey hamburger stand, one of the last to retain the chain's original 
golden arches and red-and-white-tiled design, has been closed since the Jan. 17 
temblor. A sign on the restaurant blames the closure on earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But preservationists who have been battling McDonald's plans to close the 
restaurant are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe that it could have suffered earthquake damage," 
said Pete Moruzzi, a member of the Los Angeles Conservancy, which has opposed 
McDonald's attempts to close the landmark. "We need to get a full accounting of 
what the damages are, if indeed there are damages." 
</P>
<P>
 Downey building inspector Ralph Ewers said McDonald's, which has refused to 
disclose its plans for the Downey facility, barred a city inspector from 
entering last week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ewers said, the official did conduct an external inspection, and "we 
have no reason to believe it's in imminent danger of collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's spokesman Kevin Mazzu said the Downey restaurant was one of about 
60 in the Los Angeles area closed for safety reasons after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers are scheduled to inspect the restaurant for structural damage as 
soon as possible, but officials have put the visit off to attend to more 
serious quake damage in the San Fernando Valley, Mazzu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's operations center in Woodland Hills was paralyzed for several 
days because telephones and other utilities were knocked out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary closure can only hurt the Downey fast-food outlet's future. Last 
year, McDonald's cited slow business as the major reason for plans to shut it 
down when its lease ran out in December. Without a drive-up window and indoor 
seating, McDonald's officials said, the outlet was losing about $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of the year, the restaurant, which opened in 1953, has been 
operating on a month-to-month lease and there has been no change in that 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal fans of the restaurant believe that the closure is a precursor to a 
permanent shutdown and some were distressed last week to find it closed and 
workers referring customers to another McDonald's just down Lakewood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my favorite McDonald's in Los Angeles," said Cerritos resident Tony 
Lebretto, 25, who stopped by for a cheeseburger, only to be disappointed. "I 
hope they don't shut this place down." 
</P>
<P>
 Downey resident Verna Hagen, who is involved in the campaign to preserve the 
restaurant, said she and others are outraged by the closure. On Sunday, she and 
a friend visited the restaurant with the familiar winking chef named "Speedee" 
to look for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gimmick on McDonald's part," Hagen said. "People are calling to ask 
me what's going to happen. It was my hangout. I hung out there when I was a 
kid, and it needs to be saved."

JUDGE SENTENCES SERIAL RAPIST TO 5 LIFE TERMS AND 279 YEARS; COURTS: PENALTY 
AGAINST MAN CONVICTED IN ASSAULTS ON 13 WOMEN ASSURES HE WILL DIE BEHIND BARS. 
DEFENDANT PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 A man convicted of 41 felony counts stemming from the serial rapes of 13 
Central City women was sentenced Tuesday to 279 years and eight months in 
prison plus five consecutive life sentences, making it almost certain he will 
die behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Romeo Fuentes, who is 33, would have to serve 140 years of his sentences 
before he is eligible for parole, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to ensure he spent the rest of his life in prison," said Geltz, who 
as Fuentes' prosecutor had sought the harshest sentence possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, Geltz said, "engaged in random violent acts and essentially 
terrorized an entire community." 
</P>
<P>
 In handing down the stiff terms, Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor 
acknowledged that "the numbers are going to be beyond anything Mr. Fuentes can 
serve." But she contended that they were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The message she wanted to convey, she said, was that sexual assault is second 
only to murder in seriousness and that Fuentes had "murdered the spirits of 
these women," most of them poor immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, whose trial was delayed a week last month after he was stabbed and 
beaten by other County Jail inmates, proclaimed his innocence at the 
sentencing, as he has since his May, 1992, arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not commit any of the crimes I was accused of," the onetime day 
laborer, husband and father told Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Steven Jay Schoenfield, who during the 
trial tried to show that the crimes could not have been committed by one 
person, said the convictions and sentences will be appealed.  
</P>
<P>
 The rapes for which Fuentes was convicted occurred during a six-month period 
in and around the Westlake area near MacArthur Park west of Downtown, where 
Fuentes lived. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the attacks on the 13 women -- each involving multiple counts 
-- he was convicted of five counts of burglary, seven counts of robbery and 
five counts of kidnaping for robbery, which require mandatory life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have contended that Fuentes was the leading suspect in 27 other rapes, 
but charges were not filed in those cases. In the cases in which he was 
charged, all the women involved identified him as their attacker in lineups or 
through photographs.

 Got some angels on our roadway shoulders: Conceptual artist Jill D'Agnenica's 
plan to place thousands of eight-inch-tall plaster seraphs throughout L.A. was 
only briefly interrupted by the 6.6 bolt from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, she said, "one of my roommates skateboarded up the 118 and put 
an angel up there. Another of my roommates left one looking down that gaping 
hole on Balboa Boulevard (see photo). We also gave some to the National 
Guardsmen at the Northridge Fashion Mall." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agnenica came up with the cherub distribution idea last April as a kind of 
symbolic healing for L.A. on the first anniversary of the 1992 riots (you 
remember the riots, the disaster before the fires.)  
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, she said, "it seemed appropriate to place some near the 
epicenter. We just wanted to do something simple and silly and show there's 
still hope even after the worst disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agnenica doesn't know what happened to the quake angels. "Someone may have 
taken them," she said, "or they may have tumbled down and disappeared after an 
aftershock." 
</P>
<P>
 Or taken wing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Poor guy must have lost his closet in the quake: Susan Tellem found a business 
card that said, "Nude Handyman . . . For Women Only . . . Services include 
cleaning, painting, minor repairs, enclosed yardwork. Also available: party 
services. Call Brad." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellem, who sent us a photocopy of the card, added that she's keeping the 
original "for future reference."

 The next slogan on California's license plates?Beside a "For Sale" sign on a 
Northridge house, P.C. Martin spotted an additional, hand-lettered notice that 
said: "Some Assembly Required." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 But, enough about quakes . . . : Let's get back to the fires. Ann Luke saw a 
Southern California Gas Co. billboard in Sierra Madre, which proclaimed: "It's 
hard to spot the fakes in this town." (Funny -- we'd heard that said about 
Hollywood, but never quiet, respectable Sierra Madre.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Luke points out that the ad, which is a pitch for gas logs, depicts 
flames "dancing above the top of the billboard (in) stark relief against the 
blackened foothills that were recently scorched with real flames. We in Sierra 
Madre can surely tell the fake fires from the real ones!" 
</P>
<P>
 Further proof that everyone in the Southland is a disaster expert of some 
kind.

 A real porcelain-medal winner: And, finally, we wish to thank Jay Hersey for 
sending along his earthquake yarn, a poem titled, "Caught on the Commode With 
No Place to Go."

planned guide, "Places to Sit Out an Earthquake." miscelLAny:

JUDGE ISSUES RESTRAINING ORDER, PREVENTS TRIAD HEALTHCARE MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order 
Tuesday against Triad Healthcare Inc. -- owner of two financially ailing San 
Fernando Valley hospitals -- to prevent the company from firing its management 
team and using hospital operating money for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The order was requested by officials of the state's Cal-Mortgage program, 
which insured the loan that enabled Triad to buy the hospitals in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad defaulted on the $162-million loan last summer, potentially leaving 
taxpayers on the hook for the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the cooperative relationship between Cal-Mortgage and Triad's 
board has deteriorated, according to court documents. Both sides assert that 
they have the better plan to get the hospitals in a position to resume loan 
payments, and both contend that the other has reneged on agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hospitals owned by Triad are Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center 
in Sherman Oaks and West Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park. 
Although they are located in the area most devastated by the magnitude 6.6 
earthquake last week, both hospitals came through relatively unscathed and 
treated hundreds of earthquake victims in their emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he agreed to issue a temporary restraining order, Superior Court 
Judge Robert H. O'Brien refused the state's request to immediately place the 
hospitals into receivership. That action would have effectively cut Triad's 
board out of all management decisions, placing the hospitals under the 
supervision of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge postponed the question of receivership until a hearing Feb. 16. But 
in granting the temporary restraining order, he blocked a plan by Triad board 
Chairman Sanford Weiss to fire Alpha Partners, a management company hired by 
Triad at the state's request in November to replace Triad President Stuart J. 
Marylander. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss questioned Alpha Partners' loyalty to the Triad board, saying Alpha was 
hired and Marylander was fired at the state's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that Alpha Partners views their sole allegiance to the creditor 
that insisted upon their appointment," Weiss said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Douglas Drumwright, president of Alpha Partners, said he will 
"continue to communicate, as we always have, to the board to keep them 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Marylander has been drawing $25,000 a month in severance pay from Triad and 
may continue to do so until November, 1996, under terms of an employment 
contract he negotiated with the Triad board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Marylander wrote the severance provisions for his own benefit," 
Cal-Mortgage Director Dennis Fenwick said in a written declaration. "The 
severance provisions, however, are flagrantly inappropriate and detrimental to 
plaintiff and to defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 Marylander could not be reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials contend that their loan guarantee agreement with Triad 
provides for only a month's severance pay for Triad's former president. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the state also argued in court Tuesday that Triad was planning to 
divert more than $1 million in money earmarked for hospital operations to its 
lawyers to finance a legal battle with the state over control of the hospitals.

FIRED OFFICER'S LAPD LAWSUIT CHARGES RACISM; COURTS: FORMER SERGEANT SAYS 
SUPERVISORS MADE RACIAL COMMENTS AND WERE OUT TO GET HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former police officer has sued the Los Angeles Police Department in federal 
court, contending that he was hit with trumped-up charges and fired because of 
institutional prejudice against African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sgt. Brian K. Powell said police supervisors in the San Fernando Valley 
harassed him, made racial remarks to him and ordered him put under surveillance 
in an attempt to find enough false or exaggerated evidence against him to force 
him out of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court, contends that the department 
violated Powell's civil rights to equal opportunity and to be free of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was humiliated, embarrassed, dehumanized and degraded," Powell said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors and officers were overtly hostile to him and second-guessed his 
judgment, he said. They were openly bitter about his being promoted to sergeant 
in less than six years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD does not comment on lawsuits involving personnel matters, Police Lt. 
John Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a Dec. 3 report recommending Powell's termination, a police 
disciplinary panel said it had decided unanimously to fire Powell because of 
his overall performance and his lack of "commitment to the job, and willingness 
to be responsive to supervisory review." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, 32, who was awarded the department's highest honor, a Medal of Valor, 
was suspended for several violations of departmental policy and then fired last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious of his alleged misdeeds were wearing a department uniform 
while working an off-duty job, misusing a department computer on several 
occasions in August, 1992, and knowingly submitting a falsified quality service 
audit -- a report on how an officer who worked for him handled a routine radio 
call. The audits are used by the LAPD to evaluate police interaction with the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also was found to have used LAPD computers to get confidential 
information about two acquaintances, the board of rights report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, a supervisor testified that Powell "could not function as a 
supervisor because of the character flaw of a basic lack of integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said he was forced to adhere to a higher professional standard than 
white officers. He said he plans to seek his job back in a separate lawsuit to 
be filed in Superior Court.

FALSE ALARM ON FOOD STAMPS STIRS ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some earthquake victims, mistakenly believing that an emergency food stamp 
program was about to end, crowded some county social services buildings 
Tuesday, resulting in some pushing and shoving. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt or arrested in the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke appealed to applicants to remain 
calm while waiting in the long lines. She pointed out that earthquake victims 
have until Feb. 8 to apply for an emergency, one-month allotment of food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these people are poor, live on a fixed or limited income and do not 
have cash on hand to replace the food, which is why the emergency food stamps 
are being issued," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are being accepted at all Department of Public Social Services 
offices. Additional information is available at (310) 908-8610.

DOCTORS BATTLE FOR THEIR RUBBLE; DEMOLITION: TENANTS HIRE LAWYER IN EFFORT TO 
GET FILES AND VALUABLES FROM BUILDING TORN DOWN AFTER QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A wrecking ball has reduced the six-story Barrington Building -- once the home 
of scores of prominent dentists, psychiatrists and other medical professionals 
-- to a pyramid of rubble. But this is better than average rubble, say the 
quake-damaged building's tenants, who hired a lawyer Tuesday to ensure that it 
will be handled with care. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere inside the mountain of wreckage on Olympic Boulevard are 
irreplaceable medical records -- some of them sensitive, given the Barrington's 
high-profile clientele. There is a huge inventory of prescription drugs. There 
are X-rays and chunks of precious metals -- the stuff of fillings. There are 
file cabinets and safes whose contents could mean the difference between 
survival and financial ruin, tenants say. 
</P>
<P>
 But since demolition began Saturday, they say, their valuables have been 
treated like so much garbage. To keep asbestos dust from flying, the building 
has been wetted down as it has been torn down, making its contents soggy even 
before this week's rain. And instead of carefully sifting through the debris, 
tenants say, the crews appear to be concentrating on its speedy removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no salvage. There's only rubble," said L. James Grold, a 
psychiatrist who worked in the building for 25 years. " Salvage is certainly 
not a word that has any meaning for what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 An executive at the Cleveland Wrecking Co., which was retained by the city to 
level the building, said his crews have tried their best, when possible, to 
rescue valuable items. But Donald Fenning, the company's executive vice 
president, said he was not hired to conduct the intensive recovery effort that 
the doctors are demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract was basically to get rid of the building as quickly as you can 
get rid of the building. It would have been our pleasure to undertake a 
prolonged demolition process. . . . But the city did not retain us to do 
salvage and recovery on a minute scale," said Fenning, who added that his 
company has become "the fall guy" in an emotional battle it did not cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned my stomach that we had to do that to people's possessions and 
records," Fenning said, adding that his company is a "wrecker with a 
conscience" that has rented storage space at its own expense to safeguard items 
recovered from the Barrington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Michael R. Leslie, a lawyer hired by the tenants, was working with 
city officials, the wrecking company and the building's owners to try to 
finance a more rigorous salvage effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're not expecting to get office furniture out intact. But file 
cabinets? Safes? It's not like they're looking for a needle in a haystack -- 
one tooth or something," said Leslie, who also sent a private investigator to 
the site to be the tenants' "eyes and ears." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie also did not rule out formal legal action. Many of the tenants have 
alleged that the Barrington Building was demolished too quickly and that 
tenants were unnecessarily excluded from the premises, even though the city had 
deemed it an "imminent, extreme and immediate hazard" after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also believe that the building, whose condition caused traffic to be 
diverted, was a victim of its location -- Olympic Boulevard, which was needed 
to relieve congestion resulting from damage to the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help thinking: If this had happened on some backwoods part of Silver 
Lake, not near any thoroughfares, that building would still be standing," 
dentist Janet Lent said at a tenants' meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gotten in there," said Leslie P. Lipson, a psychiatrist who 
lost his patients' records. "(The building) wasn't going to go over in the 
wind. Did you see how long it took them to knock it down? It was solid as 
hell."

STATE CONFIRMS THAT ROBERTI FACES RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State election officials have confirmed that opponents of Senate leader David 
Roberti had collected enough valid voter signatures to force a recall election 
this spring, less than a year before Roberti would leave office under term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election is likely to be watched nationally as a test of the clout 
of pro-gun groups such as those that backed the recall effort.It will be the 
first recall vote affecting a state official in 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall supporters said this week that their signature-gathering drive was 
sparked by "political corruption and hypocrisy in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti said it was retribution for his successful efforts to restrict 
access to assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Secretary of State Tony Miller said Gov. Pete Wilson has 60 to 80 
days to call a recall election in Roberti's 20th Senate District. April 12 is a 
likely time because a recall election would coincide with other local elections 
on that date.

FAMILY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States population grows by more than 2.5 million people every year. 
China, Thailand, Indonesia, Iran, India, most Third World countries, as well as 
the countries of Europe, have introduced family planning programs in an attempt 
to bring their population under control.The United States has no such program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the United States has the fastest growing population in the 
industrialized world and boasts the highest incidence of teen-age pregnancy. If 
every birth to a teen mother had been delayed until the mother was in her 20s, 
the federal government would have saved $11.7 billion in 1991 alone. Money is 
not the issue, however. Environmental degradation has reached crisis 
proportions. We need a family planning program to join other nations to help 
bring the world's population under control.

CLINTON VOWS MORAL, ECONOMIC RENEWAL; STATE OF THE UNION: PRESIDENT PLEADS FOR 
SUPPORT FOR HEALTH, WELFARE REFORM. HE SAYS U.S. IS BACK ON TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, pledging an economic and moral renewal of the nation, 
appealed in his State of the Union Address on Tuesday night for congressional 
and public support for his aggressive, but still unfulfilled, domestic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton declared that the nation is basically sound and is headed in the right 
direction once again but nonetheless needs fundamental reform of its health 
care and welfare systems. On health care, the centerpiece of his domestic 
agenda, Clinton sought to rekindle the sense of urgency that his strategists 
believe must be maintained if his plan for a comprehensive overhaul is to win 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton again offered to cooperate with Republicans in drafting a health care 
bill. But in a moment of drama, he bluntly threatened to veto any health reform 
bill that does not meet his fundamental requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private 
health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this 
pen, veto that legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, Clinton did not propose many new programs, as presidents often have 
on such occasions in the past. Senior White House advisers believe that voters 
think the President has already promised more than he can accomplish. In fact, 
White House officials fear the image of over-promising, seeing it as the 
President's major vulnerability -- one that his Republican opponents already 
have begun to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 So, rather than make a raft of new promises, Clinton devoted most of his 
speech to convincing Americans that he is hard at work on the promises he 
already has made, and that he can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992 the American people demanded that we change," Clinton said. "A year 
ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of 
our country. Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and 
reform. And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American 
people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between 
a President and a Congress in 30 years," Clinton told his audience, referring 
to a record of legislative action not exceeded since the early years of the 
Lyndon B. Johnson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 On a second issue of increasing public concern, Clinton said the epidemic of 
violence across the land must be addressed but acknowledged that the role of 
the federal government is limited and that many of the country's ills can only 
be handled by family, school, church and community. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton took credit for an expanding economy and a shrinking federal budget 
deficit but said too many Americans remain unemployed and unprepared for the 
job market of the future. He said that he would continue to press for new job 
training programs and that he wants to transform unemployment insurance plans 
into a reemployment program for displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The multitude gathered in the chamber of the House of Representatives for 
Clinton's speech included, by tradition, both houses of Congress, the Cabinet, 
members of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the diplomatic 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been true in past major Clinton speeches, the White House reserved 
special symbolic seats flanking First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the House 
gallery. This time, Mrs. Clinton sat between AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland 
and Jack Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp. Organized labor and the auto 
companies are the Administration's two biggest allies in the health care 
battle. Clinton has also been anxious to mend fences with labor after the 
strains caused by the debate last fall on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seated near Mrs. Clinton were Tommy O'Neill, son of the late House 
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), and James S. Brady, President 
Ronald Reagan's former press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 
assassination attempt on his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton cited the gun control measure named after Brady on his list of major 
legislative accomplishments. He also touted the smaller budget deficit, tax 
cuts for low-income workers, the trade agreement, a national service program 
providing young Americans the opportunity to earn money for college by 
performing public service, family leave and the motor-voter registration bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "All passed. All signed into law with no vetoes," Clinton said. "These 
accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office and they 
were all passed by this Congress. But the real credit belongs to the people who 
sent us here, pay our salaries and hold our feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward future legislative battles, Clinton took aim at the 
credibility of his Republican opponents -- arguing that they were wrong about 
his economic plan and, by extension, cannot be trusted to be right about issues 
such as health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The naysayers said our plan wouldn't work," Clinton said, referring to the 
budget bill passed last year. "Well, they were wrong." The budget deficit, 
Clinton said, had declined from a projected $300 billion to $180 billion and 
both inflation and interest rates are at historically low levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you will stick with our plan," he said, "we will post three consecutive 
years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the 
White House. Once again, the buck stops here." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides began work on the speech shortly before Christmas and 
Clinton first reviewed a proposed outline for the address over the New Year's 
holiday, which he spent at Hilton Head, S.C., at the Renaissance Weekend annual 
public policy retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton saw a first complete draft of the address just before leaving for 
Europe in early January but did not devote serious attention to it until last 
week as he was flying back from Los Angeles after viewing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The President worked extensively on the sections on health care and welfare 
reform and wrote the passages that linked the two, according to aides. He 
worked closely with Mrs. Clinton and senior advisers David Gergen and George 
Stephanopoulos in honing the message of moral renewal that infused the sections 
on crime and middle class values. 
</P>
<P>
 Political adviser Paul Begala and pollster Stanley B. Greenberg also 
contributed ideas for the speech, which was written chiefly by mid-level aides 
David Dreyer, Robert Boorstin and Jeremy Rosner. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clinton practiced delivery of the address for almost two hours in 
the movie theater in the White House residence, as aides wandered in and out to 
offer suggestions on content and oratorical emphasis. He marked up the ninth 
draft of the speech Tuesday afternoon and the final version was still being 
polished a couple of hours before Clinton took the podium in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official involved in crafting the speech said Tuesday 
that "rather than breaking new ground, it's an opportunity to draw together his 
agenda and his themes for the coming year. Many Americans have not had the 
opportunity to hear him discuss crime, welfare and the crisis of values in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of new promises, of course, does not mean that Clinton has 
suddenly changed into a leader with a small agenda. The White House has enough 
business left unfinished from last year to keep Clinton and Congress busy for 
months, perhaps years, to come. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list -- and the centerpiece of Clinton's speech -- is his 
promise of universal, lifetime health insurance for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton first outlined his ambitious health care plan last September, winning 
quick, but ultimately superficial, support in the country and on Capitol Hill. 
Since then, opponents have begun to strengthen their attacks with considerable 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that a slender majority of Americans have held steady in support of 
his plan. But the numbers of people opposed have grown markedly in the last few 
months, and even supporters concede that they know few of the plan's details. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the burgeoning debate have seen this speech as the opening event 
of the most intensive part of the struggle -- a legislative battle certain to 
last many months. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that battle will turn on how Americans and their representatives in 
Congress balance two opposing fears -- the fear that failures in the existing 
medical system jeopardize their health care, versus the fear that Clinton's 
ambitious proposals will backfire and make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, after searching for several months for a theme to use in 
attacking Clinton's plan, in recent weeks have honed in on that first fear -- 
arguing that Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton exaggerate when they 
say the nation faces a "crisis" in health care. Instead, the Republicans say, 
the health care system has a limited series of problems that can be fixed with 
a more modest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tackled that assertion directly, in language that aides said he 
drafted himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also sought to defuse the potential battle for priority between 
supporters of health care reform -- who include most of his party's liberals -- 
and backers of welfare reform, who by and large tend to be more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 The two issues are not rivals, Clinton insisted, but are necessary partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton specifically endorsed welfare reform proposals that would require 
minors receiving welfare to live with an adult and require absent parents not 
paying child support to perform public service work. He repeated his call for a 
two-year time limit on receiving public support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "And to all those who depend on welfare, we offer this simple compact: We will 
provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to two 
years. But after that, anyone who can work must work -- in the private sector 
if possible, in community service if necessary. We will make welfare what it 
ought to be: a second chance, not a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 He also directly linked welfare reform with health care reform, asserting that 
a million people are on welfare today because it is the only way they can get 
health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also spend a considerable amount of time talking about the crime and 
violence that plague the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, the national peace is shattered by crime. In Petaluma, Calif., an 
innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly 
Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter 
rounds. A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he 
is black," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting 
personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us," Clinton said, echoing 
earlier speeches that addressed what he has called a "crisis of the soul" in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton endorsed calls for a "three-strikes" law that would require life 
sentences for people convicted of three felonies. He also repeated his call for 
federal assistance to allow cities and towns to hire 100,000 more police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton appealed to gun owners to join him in taking steps 
to reduce gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunters must always be free to hunt and law-abiding adults should be free to 
own guns," Clinton said. But, he said, "there is no sporting purpose on Earth 
that should stop us from banishing the assault weapons that outgun our police 
and cut down our children." 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't create this problem," Clinton said, addressing those who use guns 
for sport. "But we need your help to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of Clinton's speech focused on domestic policy, he also sought 
to claim credit for the foreign-policy successes of the last year, while 
avoiding mention of bleaker scenes in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign-policy section of the speech was relatively brief and seemed 
more a matter of obligation than conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 A top foreign-policy adviser said before the speech that Clinton chiefly 
wanted to explain to the public why the United States must remain engaged 
abroad, even if the rules of engagement in a confusing new world remain murky. 
Clinton used the speech to restate the principles guiding U.S. foreign policy 
-- opening markets for American goods, containing the spread of dangerous 
weapons and promoting democracy.

MIDEAST TALKS UNEXPECTEDLY RESUME IN CAIRO

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Israeli delegation arrived in Cairo late Tuesday for an unexpected 
resumption of talks with PLO officials on beginning Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was a surprise because the parties had said Monday that negotiations 
were being suspended until after a meeting this weekend between Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 The early resumption of talks suggested new proposals might be under study for 
implementing the Sept. 13 accord that calls for Palestinian autonomy in the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat on Tuesday praised Egypt's effort to bridge differences between Israel 
and the PLO that have delayed the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the 
autonomy zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa visited Israel on Monday, reportedly 
carrying Palestinian suggestions for breaking the deadlock in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt's Middle East News Agency later quoted Arafat as saying that Moussa 
brought important results from Israel and that the talks in Cairo could 
continue until Friday.

 Yasser Arafat is sending some of his most trusted men to the United States for 
specialized training on guarding the PLO leader when he moves to the occupied 
territories, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Palestine Liberation Organization said the team would total 
several dozen men, mostly former guerrillas who fought against Israel from 
Jordan and Lebanon.

 The training deal was worked out after Secretary of State Warren Christopher

THE STATE OF THE UNION; THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Risen, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The expansive objectives outlined in President Clionton's State of the Union 
speech conflict with ever-more-restrictive budget constraints. In his 1995 
budget, Clinton will ask for roughly $16 billion to finance new domestic 
initiatives -- slightly more than half of the $29 billion he originally planned 
to request from Congress. But just to receive $16 billion, an 18% increase over 
last year's investment agenda outlays, Clinton must reduce spending in 
"non-priority" programs. So far, the Administration has not disclosed a full 
list of winners and losers in the 1995 budget he will present to Congress on 
Feb. 7. But a partial list of those already divulged indicates the direction 
the Clinton agenda will take this year. WINNERS 
</P>
<P>
 * EDUCATION -- The largest increase in the education budget will go to 
Clinton's Goals 2000 program, which is slated to receive $600 to $700 million 
in funding. The initiative is designed to create national academic and skills 
standards for elementary and secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMPLOYMENT -- Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich plans to unveil a training and 
skills agenda to help American workers remain competitive in the global 
economy. It will be highlighted by an initiative to transform the unemployment 
system into a "re-employment system," with the long-term unemployed receiving 
educational and training opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEALTH AND WELFARE -- A big beneficiary within the Department of Health and 
Human Services is the National Institutes of Health, which will get a 4.7% 
funding hike. Others include the Head Start program, targeted for an increase 
of $550 million to $1 billion; AIDS research, including funding for the Ryan 
White Act, and the WIC nutrition program for pregnant women and infants. 
</P>
<P>
 * LAW ENFORCEMENT -- Among the short list of winners in the battle for scarce 
federal dollars are the Justice Department and crime prevention programs. To 
fund an anti-crime bill expected to pass Congress soon, the Administration has 
allocated an extra $2.5 billion for 1995 to help put 100,000 more police 
officers on the streets, provide money for "boot camps," and finance prison 
construction. Over five years, the Administration plans to spend about $22 
billion on anti-crime initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * COMMERCE -- For the first time in memory, the Commerce Department has become 
a top priority at the White House. The Administration plans a 12% increase in 
the department's budget for 1995, primarily to help fund new technology 
initiatives. One of the biggest beneficiaries is the Advanced Technology 
Program, an initiative to re-create the Pentagon's success in fostering 
technological research and development on the civilian side. It would receive 
about $451 million in 1995, up from $190 million. LOSERS 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUSING -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development appears to be an 
unexpected casualty of the Clinton Administration budget wars. The White House 
is imposing new cuts on HUD that rival those of its Republican predecessors. 
For example, the Administration plans to cut programs for renovating and 
building traditional public housing by about $2 billion. Clinton is targeting 
programs that fund construction of new public housing units and renovate old 
ones. On the positive side of the ledger, programs for the homeless are 
expected to get a boost of about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * AGRICULTURE -- Another big loser in the Clinton budget is the Agriculture 
Department, which was a major target of the Administration's "reinventing 
government" task force. The 1995 budget will include a plan to close more than 
1,200 farm program field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * DEFENSE -- The biggest blow of all will land at the Defense Department, 
which is feeling the effects of the end of the Cold War. Clinton decided not to 
give the Penatagon $21 billion to cover the anticipated costs of inflation over 
the next five years, and told defense officials they must fund $9 billion in 
military pay raises over that period by taking money from other accounts. The 
Defense Department has already ordered the military services to find a total of 
$13 billion in spending cuts to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSPORTATION -- The Transportation Department fought off steep budget cuts 
proposed by the Office of Management and Budget, but the Administration still 
plans to cut operating subsidies for mass transit systems. The Federal Aviation 
Administration will see its budget frozen at 1994 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * INTERIOR -- Faced with steep budget cuts, the Interior Department will 
eliminate 860 jobs in its personnel department alone. Similar personnel cuts 
will be felt at a wide range of other agencies, ranging from Veterans Affairs 
to Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONSUMER PROTECTION -- Faced with steep budget cuts proposed by the White 
House, the governing board of the Consumer Product Safety Commission have taken 
the unprecedented step of voting to reject the Administration's budget and 
appealing directly to Congress for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposal to provide $6.6 billion in emergency aid for 
earthquake-ravaged Southern California will not count against the budget 
ceilings, and therefore will not reduce the amount available for other Clinton 
priorities.

THE STATE OF THE UNION; EXCERPTS: AFTER GRIDLOCK, A LIST OF ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following are excerpts from President Clinton's State of the Union Address 
Tuesday, as released by the White House:  
</P>
<P>
 Together, we have made a hopeful beginning -- and for that I want to thank all 
of you who heard the American people, broke gridlock, and gave them the most . 
. . productive Congress in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Together we produced: 
</P>
<P>
 * A budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending and 
raised income taxes only on the very wealthiest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax relief for millions of low income workers to reward work over welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brady bill . . . which is now the Brady law. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax cuts to help nine out of 10 small businesses invest more and create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * More research and treatment for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * More childhood immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * More support for women's health research. 
</P>
<P>
 * More affordable college loans for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new national service program for those who want to give something back to 
their community and earn money for higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 * A dramatic increase in investments to move us from a defense to a domestic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new law, the motor-voter bill, to help millions of people register to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family and medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
 All passed. All signed into law with no vetoes. These accomplishments were all 
commitments I made when I sought this office, and they were all passed by this 
Congress. But the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, pay our 
salaries, and hold our feet to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 When I became President, the experts predicted next year's deficit would be 
$300 billion. Because we acted, the deficit is now going to be less than $180 
billion -- 40% less than predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate 
since 1974, and the lowest interest rates in 20 years. Because interest rates 
are down, business investment in equipment is growing at seven times the pace 
of the previous four years. Auto sales are way up. Home sales are at a record 
high. Millions have refinanced their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993 -- more 
than were created in the previous four years combined. The people who supported 
this economic plan should be proud of its first results. 
</P>
<P>
 We must transform America's outdated unemployment system into a re-employment 
system. The old system just kept you going while you waited for your old job to 
come back; but we need a new system to move people into new and better jobs, 
because most people don't get their old jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to get a real job with a growing income is to have real skills 
and the ability to learn new ones. We must streamline today's patchwork of 
training programs and make them a source of new skills for people who lose 
their jobs. Re-employment, not unemployment, will be the centerpiece of our 
program for economic renewal, and I urge you to pass it this year. 
</P>
<P>
 We must tackle welfare reform in 1994, yes, even as we tackle health care 
reform. We must do both at the same time. Millions of people on welfare today 
are there because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who choose work without health benefits find themselves in the 
incredible position of paying taxes that help pay for health coverage for those 
who choose to stay on welfare. No wonder people leave work and go back on 
welfare to get health care coverage. Until we solve the health care problem, we 
will not solve the welfare problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If we let the health care system continue to drift in its present direction, 
Americans will have less care, fewer choices, and higher bills. Our approach 
doesn't take care and choices away from people. It builds on what works today 
in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand the employer-based system and guarantee private insurance for every 
American -- something proposed by President Richard Nixon more than 20 years 
ago. That's what we want: guaranteed private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year I proposed a defense plan that maintains our security at lower cost 
because of the end of the Cold War. This year, many people urged me to cut our 
defense spending again so we could pay for other government programs. I told 
them no. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget I will send to this Congress draws the line against further defense 
cuts and fully protects the readiness and quality of our forces.

HEALTHY AGENDA AWAITS AS CONGRESS GOES BACK TO WORK; LEGISLATION: BESIDES 
MEDICAL CARE, LAWMAKERS FACE ISSUES OF CRIME, BALANCING THE BUDGET, CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE AND PERHAPS WELFARE REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by the voters on one hand and by President Clinton on the other, 
Congress settled down Tuesday to an election-year session focused tightly on 
health care and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back and ready to go to work," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kans.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers had little but ceremonial duties on the first day, and the main 
business was to gather at mid-evening to hear Clinton's State of the Union 
Address. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans alike agreed on the main order of business for the 
year but quickly sketched differing visions about how to tackle them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect the session to be a tough one," said Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.), as Republicans called for Clinton to scale back his health 
care proposal and to step up his commitment to crime-fighting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care and crime aside, bills on education, the environment and the Los 
Angeles earthquake also crowd the agenda. The Administration said it would ask 
for more than $7 billion in relief money, and a struggle was expected over 
whether to cut spending elsewhere in the budget to offset the impact on the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the year is out, leaders say the 103rd Congress will render verdicts on 
a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, on changes in campaign 
finance law and possibly on welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever lawmakers do, they will be judged in November -- when all 435 House 
seats and 34 Senate seats will be on the ballot -- by an electorate demanding 
action on pressing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has proposed a top-to-bottom revision of the health care system, 
including permanent and universal coverage, requirements that employers help 
pay for it and huge purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing bills are generally less ambitious, and Republicans are calling for 
a less comprehensive approach with a smaller role for government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole pledged Republican efforts to enact some type of health care legislation 
but said Americans have a system that is the "envy of the world," and he 
cautioned against weakening it in the name of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) pledged to work toward 
enactment of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said Democrats' efforts would be directed to "where the President has 
placed the emphasis . . . secure health insurance for every American that will 
not be subject to cancellation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the Democrats also are bidding to take credit for a tough 
anti-crime measure that was left half-completed when lawmakers wrapped up their 
business in 1993. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a measure authorizing more 
than 100,000 more police on the streets, money for prisons and an expanded 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the House has yet to act on these tougher measures, and a partisan 
struggle is under way. Democratic liberals generally oppose the death penalty 
and favor preventive programs as much as punitive ones. House GOP Whip Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia launched a sharp attack on Clinton last weekend, saying the 
Administration "acts weak" on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect for welfare reform is uncertain, despite support from Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate Finance 
Committee. Democratic leaders say they hope to pass a bill this year, but 
Clinton has yet to submit one. 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues: 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate debate is set for next month on a proposed balanced-budget amendment 
to the Constitution. Lawmakers must decide how much money to provide for the 
cleanup and reconstruction from the Los Angeles earthquake -- as well as 
whether to cut other programs to offset the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four major bills with environmental impact, including a revision of the 
nation's mining law. Others cover drinking-water safety, the Clean Water Act 
and the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure for voluntary standards for learning achievement for students 
completing grades 4, 8 and 12. Opponents say the measure would open the way to 
an intrusive federal presence in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign finance legislation cleared the House and Senate last year, but 
difficult trade-offs will be necessary to forge a compromise that can pass.

 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the Justice Department will conduct a civil rights 
investigation of a Jewish scholar's slaying during the 1991 Crown Heights 
riots.Reno made the decision after hearing pleas from lawmakers and Brooklyn 
Dist. Atty. Charles J. Hynes, whose office was criticized after a state jury 
acquitted the only defendant charged in the case. Three days of violence 
erupted after a car in the motorcade of a Jewish religious leader jumped a curb 
and killed a 7-year-old black boy. Yankel Rosenbaum, a Hasidic scholar from 
Australia, was later fatally stabbed by a group of blacks.

 The Hoosier Lottery announced a settlement with two players whose $100,000 
tickets in the multi-state Powerball game were ruled invalid because they were 
purchased illegally from a broker. The lottery agreed to pay $50,000 each to 
Scott Peterson of Eagan, Minn., and John Wall of Atlanta. Peterson and Wall 
claimed they were wrongfully denied the $100,000 second-prize payments when 
they matched five numbers in the July 7 drawing.

 Irving B. Kahn, 76, who pioneered the TelePrompTer and cable television. Named 
for his songwriter uncle, Irving Berlin Kahn grew up in Montclair, N.J., won a 
scholarship to the University of Alabama as a drum major, served in the Army 
Air Corps during World War II, and at 27 became the youngest vice president in 
20th Century Fox's history.He left the studio in 1950 to form Teleprompter

it was in its infancy. His cable company grew to be the nation's largest in 
1970 -- a year before he was convicted of perjury and bribing New Jersey 
officials. After serving 20 months in prison, Kahn made a remarkable business 
comeback. In 1974, he bought a 55-franchise cable system in New Jersey, which

MIKE PENNER: FRESH ANGLE: BROOKS A BILL WHO HAS YET TO BE BUFFALOED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They congregate at these things every year like some lost battalion from WWII, 
veterans of The Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the same faces, only older. 
</P>
<P>
 They tell the same stories, only sadder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly's here, back for a fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 So's Thurman Thomas. Show us again where you hid your helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, Don Beebe, Darryl Talley, Steve Tasker, Cornelius 
Bennett. The gang's all here. Pete Metzelaars, Kent Hull, Kenneth Davis, Keith 
McKeller, Mark Kelso, Nate Odomes. Four for four in Super Bowl media days, 
which, by now, has produced a media daze. 
</P>
<P>
 What is left to ask these Buffalo Bills, so unchanged after Super Bowl defeat, 
after Super Bowl defeat, after Super Bowl defeat? 
</P>
<P>
 "So, what has this season meant to the city of Buffalo?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, but you asked me that in '91." 
</P>
<P>
 So many turnovers for this football team -- nine of them in Super XXVII -- so 
little turnover on this football team. Compare the depth chart of Buffalo's 
first Super Bowl representative to this one. Same quarterback. Same tailback. 
Same backup tailback. Same go-to wide receiver. Same center. Same right guard. 
Same right tackle. Same nose tackle. Same right defensive end. Same outside 
linebackers. Same right cornerback. Same free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bills haven't entirely killed off the Super Bowl yet, they've pretty 
much beaten Super Bowl week to a bloody pulp. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for a fresh angle, a writer patrols the floor of the Georgia Dome 
Tuesday morning, studying the name plates above the podiums stationed along the 
sideline. Is there a new face in the house? Just one, unscarred, with eyes that 
haven't cringed at the sight of Scott Norwood wide right, or Mark Rypien 
throwing wild in the Metrodome, or Dallas 52, Buffalo 17? 
</P>
<P>
 BROOKS the sign says. Bill Brooks, according to the roster sheet that was 
handed out at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's wearing jersey No. 80. James Lofton's old number. And he's lanky, 
just like Lofton was. From a distance, you'd have to swear it was the one and 
only, old James, old news, so you prepare to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not James Lofton," the man wearing No. 80 assures you with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I can't long jump 26 feet. Not even close." 
</P>
<P>
 He's wearing Lofton's number, but he insists "Lofton's numbers speak for 
themselves. He's (going) in the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 And another thing: "James likes the long ball. Me, I try to do what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brooks is a different kind of Bill. His Super Bowl record is perfect, 
which is because his Super Bowl slate is clean. He watched last January's game 
from the vantage point of his living room in Indianapolis, which gave him a 
huge advantage over his current teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Brooks turned the game off. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Brooks is "like a kid in a candy store" because he's a Super Bowl rookie. 
"I've got goose bumps. The guys are happy for me, they've been congratulating 
me. For them, this is kind of old hat, but this is a big step for me. This is 
one of the things you dream about when you come into the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 A fine line separates dream from nightmare, as the guys can also tell Brooks. 
But if the Bills are to serve this Sunday as another round of cannon fodder for 
Dallas, as appears likely, Brooks will swear that it beats where he came from 
-- Indianapolis, home of the perennially rebuilding Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks spent seven years with the Colts, far too long for his own good. He 
caught enough passes -- 411 -- to rank second on the club's all-time reception 
list behind Raymond Berry, but his playoff totals are far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has one career playoff reception, in 1987, in a first-round loss to 
Cleveland, the last time the Colts reached the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God for free agency," says Brooks, who jumped to Buffalo as soon as 
the escape hatch was opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was totally different in Indianapolis. This time last year, I was working 
out in a gym back home. We never played in January." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they played in September, October, November and December, they 
usually lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some tough years," Brooks said, "going 3-13, 1-15." Brooks wasted some 
of his most productive seasons on those teams. He'd been waiting for his 
quarterback, Jeff George, to grow into the position -- bound to happen any day, 
right? -- and before Brooks knew it, he was 29 and sitting on the bench, 
backing up Reggie Langhorne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say 'never ever,' " Brooks says. "I don't like saying those words. 
But, at the time, I really started to wonder if I'd ever be in a Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills are back, largely due to Brooks. Filling Lofton's jersey and slot as 
No. 3 receiver, Brooks caught 60 balls in the regular season, more than Reed or 
Beebe. His two touchdown catches against the Raiders bought Buffalo another 
appearance in the AFC final, and from there, it was a quick stampede over 
Kansas City and Joe Montana en route to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is amazing," Brooks said as he looked down from his podium as he fielded 
an hour's worth of questions, some of them posed in broken English by 
journalists from Europe, Mexico and central Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 One foreign correspondent asked Brooks if the Cowboys were taking this game 
more seriously because they wore their uniform pants to media day while the 
Bills were casually attired in blue sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks patiently explained that "wearing pants doesn't mean you're more 
relaxed or less relaxed. This is what they told me to wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Another interviewer asked Brooks if he liked horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not particularly," he replied. " 'The Exorcist' scared me the most. I can't 
watch it anymore. Every time it comes on now, I turn it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks no longer has the same option with the Super Bowl, now that he's a part 
of the supporting cast. All he can do Sunday is try to work on the ending.

CLIPPERS MOVE KNICK GAME TO ANAHEIM DURING REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction workers began patching the earthquake-damaged Sports Arena on 
Tuesday afternoon, forcing the Clippers to reschedule another home game, their 
second in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 With repair work expected to last the rest of the week, the Clippers moved 
Thursday night's game against New York to the Anaheim Arena. Tip-off remains at 
7:30 and all advance tickets and parking passes from the Sports Arena will be 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of Saturday night's home game against Minnesota is uncertain and an 
announcement will be made Thursday morning, Sports Arena officials said. The 
Clippers also are scheduled to play host to Golden State on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's earthquake caused extensive damage to the Sports Arena. Ceiling 
plaster was dislodged over five concourse seating areas, several cracks were 
found in the concourse and seating area and there was damage to several roof 
trusses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, general manager of the Sports Arena, said most of the damage is 
not easily visible and was detected by two structural engineers who inspected 
the facility for four days last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want to take any chances," said Hagerman, who declined to 
estimate the cost of the repairs. "Public safety is a top concern. We were 
confident the work could be done in time for Thursday's game, but I think we're 
going to need a couple of extra days. We hope it can all be done by Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who played in Seattle on Tuesday night, moved last Friday's game 
against Cleveland to the Forum. That was not an option this week, because the 
Kings will play there Thursday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thank our fans for their patience and understanding," said Andy Roeser, 
Clipper executive vice president. "We are fortunate to have at our disposal 
such a fine facility as Anaheim Arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Also affected by the construction work is the USC women's basketball team, 
ranked eighth in the country. The game against California on Friday night has 
been moved to the Lyon Center on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers played their first exhibition this season at Anaheim Arena, home 
to the NHL's Mighty Ducks. Team officials have expressed interest in playing 
several games a year there and recently negotiated a three-year contract that 
allows them six homes games a season away from the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sports Arena has a capacity of 16,005 and Anaheim Arena 17,250. 
</P>
<P>
 Players were excited by the change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is awesome," forward Tom Tolbert said. "We drew a huge crowd there 
earlier this season, and it's one of the nicest arenas in the NHL." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Harold Ellis: "I love that place. We had a great time there 
earlier this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Chris Baker in Seattle contributed to this story.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; A WILD, SATISFYING 
JOURNEY; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER BRUIN, RAM JAMES WASHINGTON OVERCOMES TRAGEDY AND 
EXCELS AS A COWBOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He never knew his father, his mother gave him up when he was 4, many of his 
relatives have been -- and in some cases, remain -- in jail, his best friend 
was shot in the head and died and Tuesday morning James Washington was having 
his picture taken with America's team on the 30-yard line in the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just can't realize how incredible that is," said Henry Washington, 
Southwest L.A. College athletic director and football coach. "Come down and 
spend some time in the area where he grew up; you'd say it's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 James Washington, a former UCLA Bruin, former Ram and present-day safety for 
the Dallas Cowboys, is no relation to Henry Washington, the former Jordan High 
football coach, but they were together in Watts at a most important time in a 
young man's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people had it worse off than I had," James Washington said. "Coach 
Washington is why I am where I am today. That's the man. He gave me a break and 
I made the best out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is still wild and raw, armed with an attitude that keeps strangers on edge, 
but he is dressed in Cowboy blue and white because he had the sense to listen 
when others would not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have gone either way," Coach Washington said. "When I caught up with 
him, he was leaning toward the bad part. I gave him an ultimatum to do it this 
way -- the right way -- and he wanted to do it because he wanted to play 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Washington monitored the youngster on the football field, and then took 
him home after practice, allowing no time for temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was wild, really wild," said Anthony George, who is now in business with 
James Washington. "He was one of those kids who didn't take mess off anybody. 
He'd fight you, and I'm sure you could find some old articles during his UCLA 
days that would say just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a certain amount of aggression to get out of his system. He's matured 
a lot, but let me tell you, this was a wild kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Football motivated the young man to earn his high school diploma and then his 
college degree. And it gave him the opportunity to start his own business -- 
Summation Financial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey to Atlanta, fame and fortune might have appeared easy now as he 
stands tall and confident before the Super Bowl photographers and reporters. 
But if only they knew. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother gave me away," he said. "My grandmother and grandfather raised me. 
I know where my mother is, but I have no contact with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take care of people who take care of me. I only help people who want to be 
helped. We have a homeless shelter for people in Los Angeles, and it's focused 
around people who want to be helped. My mom didn't want to be helped. She had 
the opportunity, so to hell with it." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't say it, but the look on his face communicates clearly that there 
will be nothing more said on this subject. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all about moving on, overcoming obstacles, sticking to the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things deep inside me that keep me motivated," Washington said. "I 
had a friend in high school, Keith Solman, and we were going to become 
councilmen, take over Los Angeles and one of us was going to run for mayor. 
That was our goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wasn't with Coach Washington, this was the guy who stayed on my back 
and kept me straight. The football thing was just a fluke. We had bigger plans. 
I loved him dearly and he got killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's standing in a Church's Chicken on 103rd, there's some shoving, a guy who 
had just gotten out of jail has a gun and he shoots my buddy in the back of the 
head. Keith is the main person that I draw most of my energy from when I'm out 
there on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Former UCLA safety) Don Rogers is another. Everybody knows he died from 
cocaine abuse, but he was a dear friend to me. He wasn't a guy who did drugs 
around me, so I didn't look at him as that. Unfortunately, he had his own 
personal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers had replaced Kenny Easley at UCLA, and Washington followed Rogers. Big 
shoes, but Washington was chosen the Fiesta Bowl game's most valuable player 
his freshman year when the Bruins defeated Jimmy Johnson's Miami team. 
</P>
<P>
 A knee injury during his junior season, however, took the luster off what was 
going to be a mighty fine four-year ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knee injury was a blessing," Coach Washington said. "He got a lot of 
attention and he wasn't handling it too well. He lost his focus academically, 
and he was back on his way to the 'hood with nothing to show for it. The knee 
injury allowed him to refocus and get his degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, though, they don't mention the degree much, and that upsets Coach 
Washington. They look at James Washington, the football player who is getting 
ready for a Super Bowl, and they declare themselves ready to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got guys who aren't 6 feet tall playing as backups and talking about going 
pro," Coach Washington said. "It's the wrong message. We ought to be playing up 
the fact that James Washington finished high school, finished college, started 
a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Super Bowl there is more. There is James Washington, the community 
activist who has contributed time and money to the Parents of Watts. There have 
been time and money spent on rehabilitating parolees, and plans are under way 
to build a homeless shelter for 30 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, he selected his fraternity based on its involvement in community 
service. He started an organization, "Athletes for the Future," and persuaded 
teammates to speak and work to keep kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that I must do," he said. "You hear people say there's a 
certain percentage of people who won't make it out, and I do it for those 
people. I saw a couple of guys at the game in Dallas last week. They had driven 
from L.A. in their ragged Cadillac. 'What the hell are you doing here?' I 
asked. 'To see you, to see you play,' they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no role model, but I want to provide opportunities where there have been 
no opportunities. A lot of guys I grew up with had a bad childhood and teen-age 
type of situation, so they had a bad start. I mean, I've seen people get killed 
who were standing right next to me. I got cut, but they got shot. I figure the 
man upstairs is looking out for me; all He is asking of me is to give back a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was in position to make a personal impact on his former 
neighborhood after the Rams had selected him in the fifth round of the 1988 
draft. Theirs was not a happy union, however. He did not earn start a game in 
his first two years, and the Rams failed to protect him in Plan B free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the Rams and John Robinson screwed me around," Washington said. 
"They didn't like my attitude. I come to Dallas, I have the same damn attitude, 
but Jimmy Johnson puts me on the field and I'm making plays. Now I'm getting 
ready to play in my second Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a great opportunity to win a second Super Bowl ring, too, but that will 
not ensure a happy ending to this journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "My contract's not up, but I'm going to ask them to do some things," said 
Washington, who plays in all nickel situations. "I can't take it anymore. I got 
two great guys playing in front of me, but I think I'm capable of starting 
somewhere in the league. If not, then I'd like to back up where I don't have to 
kiss a whole lot of. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't get back to Los Angeles, I'd love to stay in Dallas. But I'd 
rather be in Los Angeles, starting or backing up." 
</P>
<P>
 There might not be a harder hitter on the Cowboys' roster, but Thomas Everett 
received Pro Bowl recognition as the team's starting free safety; and Darren 
Woodson, a second-round pick in 1992, is a star on the rise at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be a good Raider," Coach Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington acknowledged, "I was a Raider fan growing up and I still am. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not somebody who idolizes people, but I idolize Lester Hayes," said 
Washington, who wears No. 37 in Hayes' honor. "I'd be out on the sandlot as a 
kid and I'd want to be Lester Hayes. That was the dream. I'd take . . . 
corn-bread mix and spread it on my hands like it was stickum and I was the 
coolest back in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys might not like to hear such talk just days before the biggest game 
of the year. They might have a problem with his chippy attitude. They don't 
have to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," James Washington said, "I've been through so much adversity, whatever 
they shoot at me, to hell with it. It just can't be that bad."

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; THERE'S NO LETTING GO; 
COWBOY LINEMAN ISN'T ALLOWED TO FORGET TWO INFAMOUS PLAYS 
</P>

 Don Beebe, Buffalo Bills  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Don:  
</P>
<P>
 My son was out of control. I couldn't talk to him. I couldn't relate to him. 
Then, I used your play in the Super Bowl to show him what it took to play 
sports, how not to quit. Since then, I can talk to him again.  
</P>
<P>
 Thank you,  
</P>
<P>
 A Fan  
</P>
<P>
 Leon Lett, Dallas Cowboys  
</P>
<P>
 Leon:  
</P>
<P>
 That's what Jimmy Johnson gets for drafting (racial epithet) like you.  
</P>
<P>
 Unsigned  
</P>
<P>
 Two letters, one sweet and one bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players, one a hero, the other a goat. 
</P>
<P>
 Beebe and Lett, forever linked in Super Bowl lore. 
</P>
<P>
 But what unites them also divides them. 
</P>
<P>
 A bizarre play during last year's Super Bowl in Pasadena turned Beebe into a 
source of inspiration and hope, and Lett into a target for racists and 
hatemongers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, they will be facing each other once again in Super Bowl XXVIII 
after having lived through 12 months at opposite ends of the emotional 
spectrum. THE PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 Super Sunday XXVII had been a miserable day for Beebe. He had scored on a 
40-yard pass play from quarterback Frank Reich, but that hadn't done much to 
ease the hurt for Beebe, a wide receiver who was completing his fourth year 
with the Bills with his third consecutive Super Bowl loss. It was a game Dallas 
would win, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo committed one of its nine turnovers. 
Reich, who was playing in place of injured Jim Kelly, fumbled the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 Up stepped Lett, a 6-foot-6, 292-pound second-year defensive lineman from 
Emporia State in Kansas. He scooped up the ball and saw a 65-yard path to the 
end zone straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Five yards from the goal line, however, Lett let his emotions get the best of 
him and began celebrating, holding the ball out in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't realize was that he wasn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game was lost, Beebe wasn't about to lose one last opportunity to 
foil the Cowboys. He had put his head down after seeing the fumble and gone 
after Lett without much genuine hope of catching the lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lett's premature celebration enabled Beebe to catch Lett and swat the ball 
loose, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't change anything. It was merely a small Buffalo victory in a big 
loss. And Lett still got credit for the longest return of a fumble in Super 
Bowl history -- 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sacked Reich on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. There is only one thing fans remember about Lett's performance that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't good. THE AFTERMATH 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker rooms afterward, neither Beebe nor Lett lingered over the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was running down the sideline, I was not thinking about the letters I 
would get or how people would react," Beebe said. "I was just doing what I was 
brought up to do, and that's not quit. I didn't think anything of it. All I 
know is, I saw a fumble and I knew my job was to tackle the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Beebe realized he had done something special when Bill owner Ralph Wilson 
came up and put his arm around the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really showed me something, son," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't call me Don or No. 82," Beebe recalled. "That meant a lot to me, 
and it is something I'll never forget. What he said popped my eyes open. Maybe 
what I did was something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, in the euphoria of their Super Bowl victory, didn't have an 
inkling of how harsh public reaction to Lett would be. 
</P>
<P>
 So they kidded him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When anybody talks about Super Bowl boo-boos, Leon will be the guinea pig," 
Dallas receiver Michael Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added guard Nate Newton: "I'm going to put 50 footballs on Leon's seat on the 
plane. I'll tell him, 'Here Leon, hang onto these.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As time went by, though, Lett stopped laughing. The hate mail started coming 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone even sent Lett a spoiled hot dog, telling him that was what he had 
been on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are a lot of people out there who are going to take a shot at 
somebody," Lett said. "No matter what, it doesn't matter. I just try to look 
past it." 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in Sugar Grove, Ill., Beebe was also getting letters, hundreds of 
them. But their tone was vastly different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our butts whipped and I just wanted to get back home," Beebe said. 
"(The mail) was something I really did not expect. (The letters) were from 
coaches, teachers and mostly just fathers. Most of them didn't want anything. 
They just wanted to say thank you for the message they said I got across in 
that play, that no matter what the odds, no matter what the score, no matter if 
it's only football, you never quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Beebe and Lett met during the off-season for a story arranged by a national 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to know the guy," Beebe said. "He's a tremendous guy. I know he got 
hate mail and racial stuff and it's sad to see that side of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to put myself in his uniform. You're a defensive linemen, you get the 
ball and you know you're going to score. So maybe you put the ball out there to 
celebrate. He was not rubbing it into the Buffalo Bills' faces." THE PLAY II 
</P>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving Day, 1993, the Cowboys were playing the Miami Dolphins at 
Texas Stadium, where sleet and ice had turned a game into a winter nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 With 15 seconds to play, Dallas had a 14-13 lead, but Pete Stoyanovich was in 
position to kick a 41-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The kick was blocked by Jimmie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboys win? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ball had rolled dead, the Cowboys would have won. But with his 
teammates waving warnings to stay away from the ball, Lett tried to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it went off his foot, the Dolphins recovered and Stoyanovich got 
another try. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he made the kick and Miami won, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lett: "I was just reacting." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Beebe give him a call? 
</P>
<P>
 "The last person he wanted to hear from was me," Beebe said. THE AFTERMATH II 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tuesday at the Georgia Dome, with reporters there from around the world 
for Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of their prime stories was Lett's. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates talked of him in glowing terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he comes out and has the best damn game of his life and becomes MVP," 
defensive lineman Tony Tolbert said. "He's had some big games, but all people 
want to talk about is that one play, one play, one play." 
</P>
<P>
 Said lineman Jim Jeffcoat of Lett: "He's one of the friendliest, most 
easygoing guys. I don't think the guy has an enemy in the world. He's a heck of 
an athlete. But when you try to make big plays, sometimes things happen. People 
are just ignorant." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a media crowd had formed around Lett, who was seated on the Georgia 
Dome field. 
</P>
<P>
 The first question was about the Beebe play. And the next. And the next. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd grew, so did Lett's obvious discomfort. He got up and moved. The 
crowd followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat began streaming down his face. But nobody backed off. It was Super Bowl 
overkill at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lett had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to leave me alone," he said over his shoulder as he bolted from 
the center of the crowd and headed for the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 He later returned, though, and the questions started anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they ever end?

CITY DECIDES TO CONTINUE ITS WINTER SPORTS SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite damage to gymnasiums at high schools throughout the San Fernando 
Valley, a panel of City Section athletics administrators decided Tuesday to 
resume the winter-sports program -- albeit with considerable modification in 
many instances. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week hiatus caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, basketball and 
soccer schedules for boys and girls will resume next week in most leagues. 
However, because damage varies by school, leagues have the autonomy to set 
their own schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators representing schools most affected by the earthquake considered 
a variety of options -- including outright cancellation of the winter-sports 
season -- before settling on compromise plans that will vary greatly by league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has problems that are unique to their conferences," Reseda boys' 
basketball Coach Jeff Halpern said. "Everybody gave some input. It kept some 
schools from dropping out completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Some leagues will replay games postponed by the quake while others will merely 
resume the schedule without looking back. The only hard and fast rule is that 
there is no hard and fast rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans, which will be forwarded to district administrator Dick Browning today, 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Valley Pac-8 Conference, administrators voted to replay all 
basketball and soccer games that were postponed by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 In boys' and girls' basketball, make-up games will be played Feb. 7, 15, 17 
and 18. Sites will vary depending on availability of gyms, some of which might 
still be serving as Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Northwest Valley Conference, whose member schools sustained the 
heaviest damage, the West and North Valley leagues took decidedly different 
paths. Seven of the eight schools in the conference have lost the use of their 
gyms at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' and girls' West Valley basketball, a 4-A Division league comprised of 
Taft, Kennedy, Cleveland and Chatsworth, postponted games will not be made up. 
Instead, scheduled games resume Feb. 4 and will complete an abbreviated league 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' North Valley basketball, a 3-A alignment comprised of Reseda, San 
Fernando, El Camino Real and Granada Hills, teams will play a three-game 
round-robin mini-tournament at El Camino Real Feb. 9-11.  
</P>
<P>
 Girls will play under an identical format Feb. 16-17-18. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if the El Camino Real gym is available. The school is closed and the 
gym remains on the list of temporarily unplayable sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyms at the other league members -- San Fernando, Reseda and Granada Hills -- 
are unplayable or being used as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Postponed boys' and girls' soccer games in the Northwest Valley will not be 
replayed. Games will resume next week and teams will complete an abbreviated 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the scheduling shuffle, Kennedy and El Camino Real, schools that 
suffered extensive damage, may be forced to forfeit games in several sports 
because of logistics problems, according to administrators from both schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrestling coaches will be directed to complete the season and sort out the 
logistics as they see fit. Only nine City schools field teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' and girls' basketball playoffs begin Feb. 23. Because teams will have 
played different numbers of league games, playoff seedings will be difficult to 
formulate.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; SWITCH IS ON FOR NEWTON; 
PRO FOOTBALL: THE TACKLE BRINGS HIS OWN STYLE, WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE AND 
UNIQUE SPIRIT TO THE COWBOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nate Newton welcomes you to his world with a burp and an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me," he says, "I got in kind of late last night. Was out doing Hot 
lanta. Wherever it was happening, I was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Newton welcomes you to his world by announcing that there will be 
communication in seven languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak ghetto, ghetto style, ghetto black, Negro league, Bahamian, Jamaican 
. . . and that BS language that all reporters put in their newspaper," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton also says that a dress code will be strictly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoes are from Apex," he shouts to a bystander wearing multicolored tennis 
shoes. "Looks like yours are from P.T. Barnum and Bailey." 
</P>
<P>
 Grooming, too, is a matter of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just called my barber the other morning because I needed a haircut, and he 
needed the money," he says, running his hands over his newly shaved head. "This 
is my Michael Jordan look. I ain't got his jack, and I can't jump, but I still 
want to be like Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys hope he just stays Nate. America's player for America's 
team: Overweight, slow, self-deprecating . . . but possessing the kind of 
spirit that prompts common men to do uncommon things. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no joke that Newton has made the Pro Bowl for two consecutive seasons. 
Or that he has started 105 games, more than anybody else in the Cowboy offense. 
</P>
<P>
 And the San Francisco 49ers were not laughing Sunday in the NFC championship 
game when Newton and his fellow offensive linemen shoved them backward for four 
touchdowns in their first five drives. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the reasons the Cowboys are favored to defeat the Buffalo Bills 
on Sunday in the Super Bowl. Not that he doesn't respect the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce Smith is a heck of a man, a heck of a player," Newton says. "I just 
pray he doesn't line up against me. You hear that Bruce? I like you, so don't 
get mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he will be saying those things to Smith on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to joking, the guy has this switch that he turns off and on," 
fellow guard Kevin Gogan says. "When he's around us, working, that switch is 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the time, well, sometimes it seems as if he's auditioning for a 
career in television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I am!" he says. "Why else do you think I kiss up to Lesley Visser 
like I do? Why else do you see me bow at John Madden's feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is as abundant in Newton's world as honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only athlete here who says to black reporters, "Hey, minority, how 
you doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the only one who chides them for standing in the back of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same way on this team, the black guys sit in the back of our bus," 
he says. "So one day I sat up front and told (Coach) Jimmy Johnson, 'I'm a man, 
and I got every right to be here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I look and Jimmy has his name on his seat. So I say, 'OK, you the 
man,' and I go to the back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not many things are frowned upon in Newton's world, but formality is one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got to the Cowboys, I couldn't believe that about 70 of them 
carried briefcases," Newton says. "One day I looked inside one. You know what I 
found? A pair of underwear, a toothbrush, and a playbook." 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when everything seems right in Nate Newton's world, when he is 
surrounded by smiling faces and the jokes are hitting and the legend is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there are the other times. There are jokes about weight in Newton's 
world, but he doesn't laugh at them very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody focuses on my body mass," he says. "You make it a joke . . . but 
I've got to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 With his 330 pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame, Newton will never remind anyone of a 
professional athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the league's only player whose gut is circled by diagraming TV 
announcers. He is referred to not only as fat but sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it used to be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 As a star at Florida A&M in Tallahassee, he wanted to play both offense and 
defense, but coaches wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided I was too fat to play defense," he says. "I would have been a 
dominating force, too. I would have been the No. 1 pick in the draft. Ahead of 
Russell Maryland. Ahead of Bruce Smith, too, although I hope Bruce don't take 
that the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with the Washington Redskins as a free agent in 1983, Newton was 
assessed as a good athlete with an outside chance. But he ballooned to more 
than 380 pounds and was cut on the final day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew it was coming and that upset him, so he tried to hide so the Redskins 
couldn't give him the bad news. They finally caught up with him after he had 
bought a case of beer and driven his car off a nearby road. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next two years with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States 
Football League. His career there was most notable for his part in a 
documentary about one year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, locally released and entitled, "The Final Season," featured one 
scene in which Newton was sitting at a restaurant, proclaiming that he wanted 
to eat every item on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bandits folded, he was given a tryout by the Kansas City Chiefs. It 
lasted less than six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled a hamstring running the 40," he says. "Can you imagine that?" 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with the Cowboys and being prodded into shape, he lost control 
of his weight again before mini-camp in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget walking into my office on the first day of mini-camp and 
finding a letter on my desk," recalls Tony Wise, former Cowboy offensive line 
coach who is credited with turning Newton into an All-Star. "The letter was 
from Nate, who said he had gone to Florida and enrolled in a weight program 
because he couldn't take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was too embarrassed to tell me himself." 
</P>
<P>
 A month later Newton returned, minus about 20 pounds. Less than a year later, 
Newton had his first Super Bowl ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here, people only looked at him like a fat guy," says Wise, now 
the line coach with the Chicago Bears. "He has finally changed that." 
</P>
<P>
 How? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lack of potatoes, man," Newton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he still doesn't have problems. Every other week during the season, 
the Cowboys make him stand on a scale. They fine him $25 for every pound over 
320. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been fined every week. But he has proven that he can succeed at around 
328, so he pays his money and Johnson looks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give them so much money, they have a hell of a Christmas party with it," 
Newton says. "But what am I supposed to do? I'm a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's not how you look or how your breath smells. It's how you play." 
</P>
<P>
 The jokes about his weight still motivate him. Some would even say that behind 
all of his joking is a desire to hide that weight. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants people not to think of him as a fat guy, but a blessed guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of players like Jackie Slater playing 18 years and never winning one 
and I think, 'Man, I'm going to enjoy this,' " Newton says. "I remember all 
those teams that used to pound us and I think, 'Man, I want to pound teams 
forever.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And so he behaves, unlike 99% of the Super Bowl participants, as if he wants 
to laugh forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was just watching the Super Bowl," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 From where, he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "From behind a bucket of fried chicken," he says.

HARDING FALLING VICTIM TO TENSION?; FIGURE SKATING: SHE STUMBLES TWICE IN 
PRACTICE. SECOND REPORT SAYS HER EX-HUSBAND IS LINKING HER TO KERRIGAN ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Is the tension beginning to show on Tonya Harding? 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the beleaguered ice skater took to the practice rink again -- this 
time shouldering a video camera. Her subjects: the news reporters who mob her 
at every step and have ever since men around her became suspects in the assault 
on her Olympic rival, Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you like it?" she asked reporters, tauntingly. 
</P>
<P>
 During her practice, Harding fell twice, not a big deal for an ordinary skater 
readying herself for the upcoming Olympics. But in Harding's case, the missteps 
raised the inevitable question of whether the pressure of the continuing 
investigation and repeated accusations are getting to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Various friends have told reporters that Harding is having trouble eating, 
that she is tired, that her spirits are low. Some skating experts noticed this 
week that she was not as animated or focused as she was last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a second news organization, citing unidentified sources, said 
Harding's former husband, Jeff Gillooly, is implicating her in at least the 
attempted cover-up of the case. NBC reported that Gillooly, who has been 
arrested and charged in the plot, is seeking a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Free Press reported on Tuesday that Gillooly was ready to 
implicate Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly, one of four men charged so far, previously denied wrongdoing. And 
his attorney, through Monday, also denied suggestions that Gillooly was ready 
to turn against Harding, with whom he has broken up and reconciled repeatedly. 
On Tuesday, Gillooly's attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC said Harding might be preparing a legal strategy that would maintain she 
found out about the plot only after the fact and maintained her silence out of 
fear. Harding has previously accused Gillooly of spousal violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The skater's attorney released a statement saying it would be unjust for 
Harding to be removed from the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that many representatives of the U.S. Olympic Committee and 
the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. continue to view the allegations against Tonya 
with an open mind," said the statement, issued by attorney Dennis Rawlinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya has done nothing that would warrant her removal from the team. It would 
be manifestly unjust and contrary to well-established legal principles to 
remove Tonya from the team on the basis of unproven charges."

THE OLD AND THE NEW; HIGH-TECH GYMS COME TO THOSE WILLING TO WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday is the day Aliso Niguel is supposed to have access to the bells and 
whistles in its high-tech gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday will be another missed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 When state-of-the-art is at stake, waiting is often the art of the game. 
University, whose refurbished gymnasium sets the current standard by which all 
other local gyms are measured, waited 13 years. That's how long it was between 
state approval of the project and the time the building was ready for 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever hear the term, "I'll believe it when I see it"? 
</P>
<P>
 That's an attitude the Wolverines at Aliso Niguel might adopt. The gym 
facility at the first-year school was supposed to be ready Jan. 1, in time for 
the basketball teams to play a couple of actual home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The new deadline? At least Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what the Wolverines will get to play on -- and with. 
</P>
<P>
 * A computer/television system that will pipe the game onto monitors in an 
expansive ticket lobby and cafeteria area. 
</P>
<P>
 * A projection system that can replay highlights on the gym wall in 10-foot by 
10-foot format. 
</P>
<P>
 * An auxiliary gymnasium that will also have bleachers and opens up into the 
school's theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contoured bleacher seating, similar to Capistrano Valley's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing is it's going to look like a college and will have an arena 
feel to it," Athletic Director Kurt Westling said. "There's nothing Mickey 
Mouse about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But for sheer volume, you've got to love University's setup. Trojan coaches 
drew up rough plans of what they wanted in the refurbished learning center, 
architects designed it within the financial parameters allowed by the school 
district, contractors knocked out one wall and this is the result: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seating on all four sides of the main basketball court that can accommodate 
2,050 fans. The main court runs across three practice courts that can be 
separated by electronic curtains, which descend from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * An additional basketball room with a full court; in all, there are four 
basketball courts that can be used at once. And of course, there are volleyball 
layouts that go with them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overlooking the length of the additional court is a weight room so large 
that it could accommodate a fifth court if it weren't upstairs. When all the 
equipment is delivered, 96 students can get a complete workout in 45 minutes. 
At one end of the weight room, you can look out over the main basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Directly below the weight room is the wrestling room, which will eventually 
include a team room with desks and video monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent wrestling meet, Athletic Director Mark Cunningham approached a 
visiting wrestler on the bench. He was drinking a beverage. Cunningham told him 
to take it outside, and then explained: "This facility's too nice."

THEY'RE FULL OF CHARACTER; UNIQUE GYMS GAIN CHARM FROM THEIR QUIRKS, FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's cramped, it's steamy, fans' knees are pressed into the backs of players 
sitting on the bench, not to mention the fans in front of them. There's a 
four-sided scoreboard attached to the ceiling, but that seems to be the only 
concession to technology at The Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange High School's gym, a glorified Quonset hut built in 1952 and home of 
the Panthers, represents the best and worst of the high school gym. 
</P>
<P>
 No place in Orange County has more character and charm, and yet few facilities 
appear to be further behind the times. 
</P>
<P>
 Home-court advantage? Athletic Director Dave Zirkle says the place is worth 
about eight points a game for the boys' basketball team, which plays in front 
of SRO crowds of 850. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so little room on the sideline that leggy fans in the front row often 
have their feet on the court. The question begs to be asked: Do you really have 
to be out of bounds to take the ball out of bounds? The answer: Officials seem 
to turn a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Players driving hard to the basket for layups often find themselves hitting 
the baseline wall, which is about three feet beyond the court. That wall is 
only slightly more solid than the wave of heat that hits you as you enter the 
building. No matter the weather, here's some advice: Always leave the sweater 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner named Orange as the Southland's 
second-most difficult high school gym in which to play basketball; Pasadena 
Marshall's gym, built in 1932 with a capacity of 180 and a court too small to 
use for the playoffs, was the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Len Whitacre, who coaches the Villa Park girls' basketball team, said Orange 
is the county's absolute worst, then added, "I wish we played our games there." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other gyms, too, which have flaws that make them unique. They should 
be recognized -- the world can use a little character. DUNGEONESQUE 
</P>
<P>
 What might have seemed like a good idea in 1963 seems just plain goofy today. 
Costa Mesa calls its front gymnasium "The Pit," which is understandable, but 
the home of the Mustangs is really more like a petri dish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like someone's always looking over your shoulder," Estancia girls' 
basketball Coach Russ Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because they are. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no bleachers that start on the floor. They begin atop the sideline 
walls, giving fans a bird's-eye view of the action. And no one dares jump off 
the wall to rush the floor after an exciting victory or to join an on-court 
skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the boys' team put some of its fans, the loudest, rowdiest ones, in 
folding chairs on the floor opposite the benches. "I went to the referee and 
asked him to move them back," Century boys' Coach Greg Coombs said. "During the 
JV game, they had their feet on the court." But Coombs was impressed, and later 
did the same thing at his games. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's gym has U-shaped seating, and it rocks with a full house. 
Fans in the end zone bleachers, which also sit atop a wall, are directly behind 
the backboard, making it an ideal spot to distract opposing free-throw 
shooters. READ THE CHART 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that players encounter in a Southern Section final usually 
involve shooting, because arenas with large open spaces behind the backboards 
affect depth perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley and Estancia, which has another basketball court 
perpendicular to its main court, have lots of room behind one backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill has a stage at one end of its court, which naturally creates some 
perception problems, and there are mirrors at the back of the stage. This makes 
it possible to actually watch yourself shoot -- and miss. IT'S NOT THE SHOES 
</P>
<P>
 If you're 5 feet 6 but want to play taller, play at Laguna Beach, where it's 
like walking on air. The locker rooms are directly under the gymnasium floor, 
and not only do you get a hollow sound when you're dribbling, but you also get 
more spring in your step. A PINE TIME TO FIDGET 
</P>
<P>
 This has nothing to do with what takes place on the floor, and it's purely 
subjective, but it can make all the difference in the world when a game goes 
into double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleachers. Which ones have really hard wood? 
</P>
<P>
 The writers in the office point to El Toro. "The hardest benches I've ever 
encountered," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View wasn't popular, either: "One half and my lower back -- and my butt 
-- were sore." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's, too, will make you squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon," said another writer, looking oddly at the questioner, "wood is wood." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But not all sports writers are without feeling. GYM DANDY TO THE RESCUE 
</P>
<P>
 How's this for a sweet deal: You have a small campus gymnasium and draw so 
many fans that you play your games in one of the best facilities around -- off 
campus. Mater Dei's boys, ranked 15th nationally, play their home games in the 
Bren Center at UC Irvine. The Monarchs, besides being more talented than 
everyone else around, are used to shooting there and don't have the perception 
problem of visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as good is Brethren Christian's setup -- for the boys, anyway. Because 
the Warriors' new off-campus gym in a Cypress warehouse won't be finished until 
summer, they still practice at their abandoned campus in Paramount but play 
their games at Biola University and Cypress College. PICK YOUR SURFACE 
</P>
<P>
 The Brethren Christian girls don't have it as good as the boys. Although the 
Warriors play at least half their games at Downey Calvary Chapel's new 
structure, and the others are split between Western and Cypress, the practices 
require a road map. When they practice at Cypress Evangelical Free Church, they 
work out on a hard rubber floor; when they practice at Lakewood's Life 
Community Church and Bellflower's Calvary Baptist Church, they practice on 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 They lead the county in rug burns. ONE-SIDED LOVE AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>
 University can put people on four sides of the court, and Newport Harbor can 
put people on three, but what's really bothersome are the gyms that have fans 
on only one side of the court. This is the case at Tustin, Mater Dei and 
Rosary. There's something goofy about sitting in the stands -- next to the 
opposing team's fans -- and looking at a stage on the other side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Say this about Rosary, though: The gym is the right size for the school, and 
its restrooms are clean enough to pass Marine inspection. PSYCH JOB 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar and Santa Ana have NBA regulation-length courts -- 94 feet -- 
and that makes athletes think. The basket might be only 10 feet high, but 
running an extra five or 10 feet up the floor takes a toll over the course of a 
game. Ever drive your car and know you don't have enough gas to make it home? 
</P>
<P>
 Century's court is shorter, but its gym resonates with NBA-style noise. This 
is the story as girls' basketball Coach Jeff Watts tells it: "They were 
supposedly going to spray an acoustic cover on the ceiling, but they didn't, so 
it's a metal top with cement walls. It's extremely noisy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult while playing, difficult during timeouts, difficult during 
practice, when three courts are in use. It's so loud, the boys' coaching staff 
uses signs to communicate to its players. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you know why it's called the Thunder Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and Century feature a four-sided scoreboard hanging over midcourt. 
Players aren't used to looking there for basic information -- like how much 
time is left in the game. At Century, it hangs low, creating havoc with long 
passes and volleyball matches. MORE MACARONI AND CHEESE? 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing varsity boys' teams -- and half the opposing girls' teams -- won't 
play games on campus at Capistrano Valley Christian because they contend it's 
unsafe for the speed, quickness and athleticism of the players. See, the floor 
is tile, which is perfect for its daytime use. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brethren Christian Athletic Director Robin Davis: "It's a nice gym -- for 
a cafeteria. "

THE OLD AND THE NEW; FULLERTON'S HOME HASN'T CHANGED WITH THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it was built in 1922, the Fullerton High gymnasium was an island in a sea 
of orange groves, and although 72 years have passed, the gym remains largely 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym, believed to be the oldest in Orange County, and the school, which 
opened in 1893, is a source of pride for students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has done an excellent job of taking care of the gym and the 
school throughout the years," said Bob Van Voorhis, a math teacher at Fullerton 
who coached boys' basketball from 1965-85. "It's like the entire campus, very 
tradition-oriented. The district has really tried to keep that old-time 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, maintaining that feeling didn't require much effort. The Fullerton 
Joint Union High School District has done little to the gym. Only two years ago 
a new floor was installed for the first time. This year, the locker rooms were 
refurbished for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the new floor was installed, players were at the mercy of various dead 
spots and other quirks in the original surface. 
</P>
<P>
 George Van Velte, who has been at the school since 1962 and its athletic 
director since 1976, remembers having to make repairs in the middle of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have nails come up on the floor in the middle of basketball 
games," Van Velte said. "I'd have to walk around at halftime with a hammer and 
pound them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Lawyer, who coached boys' basketball at Fullerton from 1952-64, said when 
it rained, water would leak through the roof, causing the floor to warp. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym is actually two small gyms. The main one consists of everything a gym 
normally contains, while a smaller, adjacent gym has only a court and a 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleachers, believed to be the original seats, are inches from the 
sidelines, and at full capacity can accommodate 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 However, during the 1974 season, the gym's seams were tested when about 1,300 
showed up for a Fullerton-Troy game. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, Fullerton's biggest rival, has always drawn well at Fullerton, but this 
game featured Mark Wulfemeyer, who was a two-time All-Southern Section 
selection and the county's career-scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had one official for some reason," Van Voorhis said. "They started 
the game with people hanging from the rafters, on the floor and in the windows. 
They were there to see Wulfemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got through the first quarter, but then the principal and athletic 
director decided the game was too crowded and too tight for one official, so 
they postponed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Velte said when the district put in the new floor and refurbished the 
locker rooms (at a cost of almost $250,000), workers also checked much of the 
plumbing and infrastructure, and found everything to be sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It serves its purpose for high school basketball," Van Voorhis said. "If you 
get 600 people in there, you'll have a good crowd and it'll be nice and loud."

THERAPY FOR SHELLSHOCKED CSUN; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: REELING FROM STRING OF 
TRAGEDIES, MATADORS WELCOME FIRST POST-QUAKE PRACTICE, HELD AT UCLA'S PAULEY 
PAVILION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team got back to business Tuesday, 
though certainly not business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors worked to sharpen fundamentals in a relatively light two-hour 
workout in the unfamiliar surroundings of Pauley Pavilion. The practice was 
held at UCLA because Northridge's home gym still must pass another round of 
post-earthquake safety inspections before its doors are reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least one Matador, the session marked only the second time in a week he 
had held a basketball. "The last time I touched a ball was when I was moving 
mine out of my apartment last Friday," point guard Andre Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which next will play Saturday night against Northeastern Illinois 
in Chicago, last week canceled a game against Air Force and rescheduled another 
against California in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake that destroyed or severely 
damaged many of the players' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were in Boulder, Colo., for a game against Colorado when the 6.6. 
quake hit. Northridge stayed to play the game, losing 100-85, but broke off its 
trip and returned home the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way it's hard to get back to basketball, but it's also necessary to get 
back," Coach Pete Cassidy said after practice. "It's time to move forward, to 
get on with life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were without center Peter Micelli in their first practice since 
the quake. His father, Nicholas, was buried after services in Beverly Hills on 
Monday. Peter Micelli was driving his sister, Maria, to Santa Barbara, a school 
spokesman said. He is expected to rejoin the team today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Micelli, 50, an avid supporter of the team, died last Wednesday, 
apparently of a heart attack, only hours after delivering food and other 
supplies to his son's Northridge residence, which had become a shelter for more 
than a dozen displaced Matador athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli's death rocked the team at a time when the players appeared to be 
winning a struggle to stabilize their own quake-ravaged lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just getting ourselves together," guard Ryan Martin said. "At least 
we all had our lives and our close ones, but then Pete's father dies and it's 
like . . . the hits just keep on coming and coming and coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Micelli's death is the latest in a string of tragedies that have 
touched the Northridge team. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepfather of Keith Gibbs, then Northridge's star swingman, died in 
February, 1992. Six months later, Maurice Contesse, the best friend of forward 
Chris Yard, was killed when a truck Yard was driving was involved in an 
off-road accident in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after that, only days before the first exhibition game of the 
Matadors' 1992-93 season, Lloyd McLinn, father of guard Brooklyn McLinn, died, 
apparently of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge players wore black bands on their uniforms last season as a tribute 
to McLinn, Contesse and John Flowers, a recruit who lost both legs in an 
August, 1992, car accident that occurred two weeks before he was scheduled to 
leave his Glendale, Ariz., home and move to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You reflect on the tragedies and the injuries that have happened and you say, 
'Well, those are challenges in life,' " Cassidy said. "You work with what is 
dealt to you. It's going to change. There are only so many hurdles and then the 
tide turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane O'Doherty, the Matadors' backup center, said Micelli's death has 
affected the team even more adversely than the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre and Brooklyn and the rest of us will get new places to live, but Pete 
will be without a dad forever," O'Doherty said. "It gets to all of us, 
emotionally, but I think getting back to basketball will help us. For a few 
hours we can get our troubles off our minds." 
</P>
<P>
 The rhythmic beat of dribbling basketballs was certainly music to Martin's 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been so miserable, to actually get back out and play was a relief," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is precisely the effect Cassidy was hoping for. "This is our little 
world right now," he said, surveying the arena. "We can take our little world 
and use it to our advantage, for our psychological healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our therapy session." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to Chicago, and then on to South Bend, Ind., for a game against Notre 
Dame on Monday, also has given the team something to look forward to, if only 
for the opportunity to travel to a place where aftershocks won't interrupt 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose it will be refreshing just to get back out there," Martin said.

SHOVING INCIDENT CITED AS A FACTOR IN CANCELLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tonight's scheduled Marmonte League game between Simi Valley and cross-town 
rival Royal highs has been canceled by the Simi Valley Unified School District, 
in part because of an altercation between Simi Valley basketball Coach Dean 
Bradshaw and a player. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, district administrators cited lack of practice time because of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake as the major factor in canceling the game. Simi Valley's gym 
has gone unused since the earthquake because of structural damage and Royal's 
gym served as a Red Cross shelter until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leslie Crunelle, director of secondary education for the district, 
admitted Tuesday that Bradshaw's shoving of senior guard Sam Rodriguez during a 
51-44 league victory over Westlake on Jan. 14 affected the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw has been suspended while the district conducts its investigation of 
the incident, which might not be completed until early next week. "The 
situation (with Bradshaw) was not the sole determining factor," Crunelle said. 
"But, yes, I'm sure that had to do with it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's junior varsity and sophomore teams, however, will play as 
scheduled at Royal. Officials said the varsity game will be rescheduled only if 
it is needed to determine seeding for the Southern Section playoffs. If needed, 
the game is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 12 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team has played since Jan. 14. Simi Valley is 12-5, 3-2 in league 
play. Royal is 4-10, 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Coach Larry Wiksell is troubled by the district's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The official explanation) is the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard," 
Wiksell said. "This is a shame. Playing our rival is always a big game, and it 
was something the kids were really looking forward to because of all the 
problems from the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley will return to the court Friday night when it plays host to 
Camarillo in a league game at 7:30 at the Apollo Continuation School in Simi 
Valley. Royal plays host to Channel Islands on Friday night.

WITHDRAWAL FROM TRACK MEET MAY COST NORTHRIDGE NCAA FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge's decision not to compete in a four-way indoor track meet 
at Northern Arizona on Saturday could cost the school's athletic department 
$14,000 to $17,000 in NCAA sponsorship funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Don Strametz announced his decision Monday after it became 
apparent it would be several days before any students -- including several 
track athletes -- will be allowed to return to their on-campus dormitories 
because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several other track athletes whose apartments were condemned are 
looking for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those athletes are distance runner Michelle Ishio, triple jumper Amy 
Myers and javelin thrower Mike McClintock, whose whereabouts were unknown by 
Strametz until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got too many kids spread out all over the place right now," 
Strametz said of his decision. "We've still got too many kids who haven't been 
able to get back into the dorms." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsorship funds of approximately $7,000 to $8,500 are awarded for each sport 
a school offers that exceeds the NCAA minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 An institution must field a minimum of 14 sports teams -- seven men's and 
seven women's -- to participate at the Division I level during the 1993-94 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Northridge was expected to field 18 sports teams -- 10 men's and eight 
women's -- it would have exceeded the minimum by four and been entitled to 
$28,000 to $34,000 in sponsorship funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With Northridge's men's and women's teams pulling out of Saturday's meet, 
however, the Matadors might not be able to compete in four meets, the minimum 
number required for an indoor track season. This would leave Northridge with 
only 16 sports teams this school year, unless the NCAA grants it a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz is confident that will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding that (getting a waiver) shouldn't be a problem," he 
said. "In the past, teams have been granted a waiver when they couldn't get to 
a meet because of severe weather conditions, and I would think a disaster such 
as this would warrant the same treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Whitaker, the NCAA membership coordinator, said that NCAA bylaws do 
allow for a waiver based on "circumstances beyond a team's control." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is scheduled to compete in the Wolf Pack invitational in Reno on 
Feb. 12 and in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships in Reno on 
Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's meet would have counted as two meets for Northridge because the 
Matadors were scheduled to compete against Southern Utah and Northern Arizona 
in dual-meet scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors might drop a Feb. 19 outdoor meet at Cal State Fullerton in order 
to take part in an indoor meet at Northern Arizona, but that still would leave 
them one meet short.

L.A. PREP OFFICIALS VOTE TO TRY TO SAVE SEASONS

<P>
 Athletic officials from the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to try 
to salvage the winter sports season Tuesday despite earthquake damage to 
facilities at many of its schools in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 All district athletic events have been postponed since the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
and none are scheduled to begin until next week. Many schools have not resumed 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the troubles for the nation's second largest district, there was 
unanimous support to try and save seasons in a meeting Tuesday at Grant High in 
Van Nuys. The sports affected include boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and 
girls' soccer and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have to go out and look for a place to play," said Steven Kalan, 
athletic director at Van Nuys, whose two gymnasiums are being used as shelters. 
"These sports mean the world to some of these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Tuesday's meeting concerned basketball, which is played by all of the 
district's 49 high schools. Two of the district's six conferences, Northwest 
Valley and Valley Pac-Eight, are made up of schools from the San Fernando 
Valley. Many of those schools have gymnasiums that are damaged or being used as 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of facilities and concerns over transportation had some schools 
considering canceling their seasons on Monday. But it was a different story 
Tuesday, as Barbara Fiege, district athletic commissioner, vowed to do whatever 
she could to meet the demands. Fiege had coaches and athletic directors meet 
with others in their conference to work out plans. She will compile their 
requests and make a proposal to her supervisor, Dick Browning, today. An 
announcement is expected by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four conferences, made up of schools from central and South-Central 
Los Angeles, the Westside and South Bay, will resume their schedules next week.

50 ATTEND VIGIL FOR SLAIN DEPUTY; MEMORIAL: AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS CALL FOR 
HEALING, TRUTH ABOUT SHOOTING DURING TRAINING EXERCISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prayers for truth and justice were combined Tuesday night with calls for peace 
and community healing as about 50 people gathered for a candlelight vigil in 
honor of Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Robins, who was shot and killed one month ago 
by another officer during an impromptu training session. 
</P>
<P>
 The vigil was organized by a coalition of Orange County African American 
leaders and was held in the mall alleyway where Robins was killed on Christmas 
Day.  
</P>
<P>
 On a drizzly evening, the group prayed for the families of the slain deputy, 
who was black, and the deputy who fired the fatal shot, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come together in peace," said the Rev. John McReynolds of the Second 
Baptist Church of Santa Ana. "We come together in love." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, who was married and the father of an 18-month-old daughter, was 
killed when fellow Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, shot him in the face during what 
authorities described as an impromptu field training session behind an El Toro 
Road shopping complex and movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have called the shooting an accident, but have released few 
details about what happened, citing an ongoing investigation by the district 
attorney's office. The office routinely reviews all officer-involved shootings 
and will determine if criminal charges are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates has said Scanlan's use of a loaded gun during the drill 
appears to have violated department training regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of public information after the shooting prompted the coalition of 
black community leaders to call for an investigation by the state attorney 
general's office, but their request was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, representing some 15 groups from various facets of the county's 
black community, has vowed to remain active in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Van D. Roberson of the Greater Light Baptist Church of Santa Ana 
prayed that the truth of the tragedy will soon be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was an accident, at least let it be known what truly happened," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's vigil was designed as a break from the anger and criticism 
surrounding the tragedy, said Eugene Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is essentially a period of healing and prayer so that we can ask God's 
blessings for the two families," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gathered for the vigil remembered Robins for his dedication in helping 
young people avoid drugs and stay out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very special person," Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph said. "The 
lights of the candles he lit around the city will never go out."

STATE OFFICIALS SAY COUNTY'S DISASTER CALL WAS PRUDENT; RELIEF: THEY DEFEND 
WILSON'S DECISION TO SEEK AID FOR QUAKE-DAMAGED SCOREBOARD, NOTING COUNTY ASKED 
FOR IT BEFORE EXTENT OF DAMAGE WAS CLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State officials on Tuesday defended Gov. Pete Wilson's decision to declare a 
state of emergency in Orange County, despite complaints that authorities 
stretched the disaster law to tap state and federal taxpayer money for 
earthquake repairs at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful temblor did catastrophic damage in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties last week, while just rattling homes and nerves throughout Orange 
County, where the only significant damage was to a 17-ton scoreboard at the 
city-owned stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Eckery, a Wilson spokesman, said Administration officials "understand 
the sensitivity" of using taxpayer money to help finance more than $3 million 
in repairs at the stadium, but he said the governor was simply responding to a 
request from the city of Anaheim and Orange County for disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our role was strictly administrative," Eckery said. "Given the severe damage 
that we've seen in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, how prudent would it have 
been to hold off in Orange County, when indeed there could have been more 
damage that surfaced later?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also requested that President Clinton include Orange County in the 
federal disaster declaration, making Anaheim and other cities in the county 
eligible to seek federal grants and other assistance in addition to the state 
relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the decision to include Orange County in the disaster 
declaration was made before state officials knew the extent of damage in Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's request for help was criticized by some residents and 
politicians, who argued that it is inappropriate to use taxpayer money to 
repair a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only the wrong use of taxpayers' money, but it's an insult to those 
families in Los Angeles who lost their loved ones and their homes in a real 
catastrophe," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). "It cheapens 
their death and their property losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said there was nothing he or his colleagues in the Legislature could 
do to stop the governor's declaration, but he expressed hope that public 
pressure would prompt Anaheim officials to look for other means to finance 
repairs to the Sony Jumbotron video scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Such criticism has surprised Anaheim officials, who said they are trying to 
protect the taxpayers of their city, not minimize the severity of damage 
elsewhere. They agreed that those who need housing and transportation 
assistance should have priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the request for state and federal relief, city officials have said 
they would prefer to recover the repair costs from any party that may be at 
fault for poorly erecting or securing the massive Jumbotron scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city documents, Sony was responsible for securing the scoreboard 
at the stadium. Engineers said the existing structure for the scoreboard could 
not support a weight over 50,000 pounds. The Jumbotron weighs about 34,000 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the state Office of Emergency Services said the decision to 
include Orange County in the emergency declaration was made soon after the 
county requested aid early last week -- and before the agency's damage 
assessment teams could determine the quake's full impact. The emergency 
declaration by the governor was not announced until Monday evening, more than a 
week after the earthquake, because of delays in completing paperwork needed to 
enact the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't on the basis of hindsight go back and say, 'Oh, never mind,' " said 
Cindy Shamrock, the state Office of Emergency Services chief deputy director. 
"It was a done deal, and it was done at a time when we didn't know the full 
extent of damage and we were faced with the possibility of greater damages than 
there turned out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Shamrock said that the toppled scoreboard represents a "huge disaster" for the 
city of Anaheim, which already faced an estimated $8-million budget deficit 
even before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In events of this magnitude," she said, "if there's any evidence of damage, 
we will err on the side of granting a county's request for help." 
</P>
<P>
 As a municipally owned facility, the stadium will now be eligible for grants, 
just like a school or city hall damaged in the quake, Shamrock said. Such 
grants do not have to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stadium certainly is a source of employment, it's certainly a source of 
revenue I assume the local area needs," Shamrock said. "Whether it should be 
considered the same thing as a school or city hall, I think you could ask 15 
different people and get 15 different answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials have estimated damage at the stadium at $3 million to $4 
million. Because the city's stadium insurance policy has a $6.5-million 
deductible, the city is potentially liable for those repairs. The collapse of 
the scoreboard caused part of the cantilever above the upper tier to cave in, 
damaging four giant advertising panels and damaging about 1,000 seats.

DANA PARSONS: SOMETIMES GAME PLANS GO AWRY IN SUPER BOWL OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Dana Parsons' column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would love to have my ex-wife over this Sunday for the Super Bowl. She could 
bring the chips, I could be the dip. We'd have plenty to talk about. Maybe even 
some football. 
</P>
<P>
 Our last one together would have been Super Bowl XIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Game . . . January, 1980 . . . Thinking back on it now, I remember 
being bone-tired and grimly aware that darkness was descending over the house 
as the game clock wound down to those final minutes and seconds. I remember a 
blur of lights and motion and the field spinning; the game seemed to have 
lasted an eternity, or was it just a moment? I don't know, everything was so 
topsy-turvy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The game had begun in bright sunshine and with much clarity, that much I 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 I was young and strong and unbridled, thinking I could pull off anything that 
came my way. Despite my lack of big-game experience, I was fully confident I 
knew exactly what I was doing. It's easy to look back now and realize that was 
foolish, immature youth talking, but when you're young and you see your whole 
life stretched out before you, nobody's thinking about what you can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 She was even younger, but, oh, what a player! This was somebody you could 
build a franchise around. I noticed right away, however, that she didn't have 
the confidence. Little did I know that what I diagnosed as lack of confidence 
was instead a wariness about what lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all hindsight now, but my game plan could have used a lot more wariness 
and a lot less confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, before I realized the stakes we were playing for, the game was fun. 
And that's what it was -- a game. I marched up and down the field, seeing what 
worked and what didn't, and enjoyed the give and take. We both got penalized 
plenty of times, but there were no flagrant fouls. No matter how bloodied we 
got, there was always another game the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that the games got tougher and tougher. I made my mistakes, but 
tried to shrug them off and avoid repeating them. You may think you're a 
natural athlete, but nobody just shows up and shines in this game. If you don't 
practice, the off-season comes early. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, man, they make you play a lot of games. What's fun in early 
September, when the cuts and bruises haven't started adding up, becomes 
business by late December. 
</P>
<P>
 When did that sun start setting so quickly? When did it start getting dark so 
fast? 
</P>
<P>
 And then before you realize what's happening, it's way, way late in the season 
and you're out there alone in the biggest game of your life, the clouds are 
hanging low over the stadium and it's all up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing so dispiriting as thinking you're ready for it only to get 
steamrollered. You think you're in complete control and that your hard work is 
going to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 But, somehow, things start going awry. 
</P>
<P>
 What the hell happened to the game plan? I thought I was prepared for 
anything. These plays were supposed to work!  
</P>
<P>
 You're scurrying furiously as the disaster unfolds right before your eyes. Not 
only are you not marching down the field, you're going backward. You're eating 
turf, buddy. It doesn't help that everyone you know in the world is watching 
you unravel. It becomes too painful to watch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's how The Game was playing itself on that cold day in hell. Watching Good 
ol' Super Bowl XIV wind down about the same time the other one was. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers were in control, and I would have sworn I was too. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a while, I was. And it was a great game. I feel sorry for the people 
who don't experience the highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the blink of an eye, it was third-and-long with time almost expired. . 
. . I dropped back for a desperation pass . . . she threw up a defense I didn't 
recognize quickly enough . . . I held the ball a fraction of a second too long 
. . . the next thing I knew, boom, a blind-side shot that bent me like a twig. 
. . . I was being hauled off the field on a stretcher, slightly cuckoo. . . . I 
remember her leaning over me, saying, "Nice game," then smiling in that faintly 
condescending way that victors congratulate the vanquished before trotting off 
the field. . . . I have a vague recollection of someone -- a doctor, I think -- 
saying somberly, "This could be career-ending." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it didn't kill me. But why didn't someone tell me this game is adults 
only? 
</P>
<P>
 It's painful losing the big one, but take heart from the former player who 
once said during Super Bowl week: "If it's the Ultimate Game, how come they 
play it again next year?"

DOGFIGHT OVER LEASE; 84-YEAR-OLD AVIATOR FACES EVICTION IN DISPUTE WITH AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Cliff Fraizer started an airplane repair service at John Wayne Airport in 
1957, shortly after retiring as an airplane mechanic in the Marine Corps, where 
he served for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the owner of Fraizer's A & E Service, he taught 102 people to fly, logged 
more than 7,000 flight hours and repaired hundreds of planes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 25 years, Fraizer has also battled the airport over terms of his 
lease. In 1989 he was almost kicked out after he refused for a year to pay a 
rent increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Santa Ana resident may lose his business because of a misunderstanding 
about a $2,000 security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an 84-year-old person that's just trying to get along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said that Fraizer has not posted his security deposit, as 
all tenants are required to do. The Board of Supervisors, which oversees 
airport operations, may decide at its Feb. 1 meeting whether to evict Fraizer 
if he does not comply by the Feb. 28 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer began his flying career in 1928, when he worked as a barnstormer -- an 
exhibition flyer who also sold rides to people. More than 65 years later, 
Fraizer is still flying. He no longer repairs airplanes, but he still wears his 
mechanic's uniform and refuses to give up his business at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight planes now rent parking spaces on the nearly one-acre lot he leases from 
the county. Aero Instruments rents one of the two buildings Fraizer constructed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer wears a worn leather Navy airman jacket, a replica of the kind he wore 
in the Marine Corps during World War II. A leather Harley Davidson Motorcycles 
cap sits on his head. Before he flew planes, Fraizer made his living driving a 
Harley to deliver newspapers and medical prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass displays on the inside and outside of his building contain photos, 
awards and other memorabilia. One blurry black-and-white photograph from 1957 
shows a PT-22 propeller training plane and next to it, Fraizer's 1953 Chevy. 
The same car now sits in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 A list on the wall shows the 102 students Fraizer trained for private and 
commercial pilot's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer, born in Seattle, served in the Marines from 1935 to 1957, working as 
an airplane mechanic in the South Pacific and Korea. Adm. W.F. Halsey gave 
Fraizer a citation, which is framed on the wall, for his repair of military 
airplanes during the battle of Guadalcanal in 1942 and 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer also has a hefty chunk of shrapnel in one of his glass cases, a 
memento of that battle. He said he wanted to be a pilot, but was rejected 
because he never completed high school.  
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Lillian, died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to his war photos and commendations are framed the conflicts over the 
lease: a series of calculations he believes shows that he was overcharged 
almost $50,000 for his rent from 1968 to 1987. County property agents said his 
lease calls for his rent to increase in accordance with the Consumer Price 
Index. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has framed old airport development plans for a hangar over his site. 
But airport spokeswoman Pat Ware said the airport has no plans to develop the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer has never been one to back down from a disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been sued twice; once because a plane he piloted was damaged in a 
runway accident, and again when a plane that he had inspected failed to start. 
The plane's owner tried to jump-start it by spinning the propeller and injured 
his hand, Fraizer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both lawsuits, Fraizer served as his own attorney. "I know the federal 
regulations better than any attorney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both times he won, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To settle the 1989 rent dispute with the county, an instrument repairman who 
rents a building from Fraizer agreed to pay higher rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have breached this lease numerous times," Fraizer said of the county 
agencies. He pointed to the chain-link fence, topped with barbed wire, which 
encircles the airport and comes within a foot of his buildings. He said the 
fence was built over his protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer said he wanted a 25-year lease in 1968, when the county gave him a 
10-year lease. The county granted him a 25-year lease in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the argument is over a security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer said he has set the money aside in a bank account, but airport 
officials said they have not received the proper paperwork. They said a 10-year 
bank certificate for $2,000 expired in October, and Fraizer has not renewed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware said it's a pretty simple problem: Fraizer must put up the same kind of 
security deposit as the other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware said Fraizer pays 30 cents per square foot for his property. The other 
companies that lease space from the airport pay between 82 cents and 90 cents 
per square foot, she said. Fraizer's rent on the site is $1,190 each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraizer's A & E Service has been in operation under the same owner longer than 
any other business at the airport, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Commission met last week and recommended that the Board of 
Supervisors terminate Fraizer's lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission chairman Michael L. Lapin said Airport Director Janice M. 
Mittermeier talked with Fraizer before the meeting and tried to explain the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he had to do was renew the certificate from the bank," said Lapin. "If he 
would do that, this whole thing would go away."

DESPITE PROBE, MOTOROLA WINS BIG RADIO CONTRACT; SUPERVISORS: AWARD IS MADE AS 
CRIMINAL INQUIRY CONTINUES INTO RIVAL FIRM HARRIS CORP.'S CLAIMS OF A RIGGED 
BIDDING PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as they await the outcome of a criminal investigation into allegations of 
a rigged bidding process, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday awarded an 
$80-million contract for a law enforcement radio system to giant Motorola 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision came after officials representing a competing firm -- 
Harris Corp. -- assailed the county's contractual process as riddled with 
improprieties and set up to favor communications giant Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process has been flawed from the outset," Harris Corp. Vice President 
Lewis Kling told the supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, supervisors tentatively awarded the contract to Harris, but county 
officials Tuesday found that the company had failed to satisfy seven technical 
standards necessary for completion of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-of-the-art radio system would link all law enforcement, fire and 
public works departments to one communications system. It is seen as a key 
component in the county's overall disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is reviewing Harris' complaints 
about how the contract was awarded, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Maury Evans 
confirmed Tuesday. Harris alleges that technical standards in the contract were 
designed so that only Motorola could meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said that the board vote in favor of Motorola would have no bearing on 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract process has been a matter of controversy for months, since 
General Services Agency Director R.A. Scott claimed that Sheriff Brad Gates had 
talked to him at least three times about giving Harris a "fair shot" at the 
project. Harris had employed the sheriff's political ally, San Juan Capistrano 
Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer, on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates has denied contacting Scott on Hausdorfer's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Kling asked that a final decision be delayed until the competing 
proposals could be reviewed by "an unbiased" third party and offered to help 
finance such a study for up to at least $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors, however, rejected the Harris request and voted unanimously to 
award the project to Motorola. But the action came with a warning: "If the 
other shoe drops in the D.A.'s office," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said, "I 
will pull this back for independent review." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors William G. Steiner and Harriett M. Wieder also said they now view 
the project as "clouded" and suggested they could reconsider their decisions 
should Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi's office uncover any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola consultant Randy Smith said that while the company was "pleased with 
the outcome," he was disappointed that "Harris took the opportunity to malign 
some very good people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been any kind of thing going on that Harris has been talking 
about," Smith said. "I don't expect anything to come of their lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Kling and Harris' attorney, Randall L. Erickson, Tuesday accused a county-paid 
consultant -- C.S.I. Telecommunications of San Francisco -- of conspiring with 
Motorola officials to develop technical standards for the massive project that 
no other company but Motorola could meet. 
</P>
<P>
 C.S.I. Vice President Michael Newman has repeatedly declined to comment about 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris officials have also accused county staffers of leaking confidential 
documents concerning the Harris proposal to Motorola during the hotly 
competitive contractual review process. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola and county officials acknowledge that the documents were "mistakenly" 
faxed to Motorola. But, they said, Harris was immediately notified of the 
incident. GSA director Scott said the documents had no bearing on the contract 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 Kling has turned the allegations over to the district attorney's office for 
investigation. Additionally, Kling and Erickson have questioned county GSA 
communications engineer Gary Gray's alleged relationship with Motorola. Gray 
was listed as a guest speaker for a Motorola-sponsored seminar in Santa Barbara 
last September while the project was under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray could not be reached for comment, but Scott said earlier this week that 
Gray never attended the event.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HILLSIDES WEATHER THE STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a half-inch of rain fell in Orange County, including Laguna Beach, 
where worried firefighters and public works technicians watched the storm's 
activity until the wee hours of Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had one small hill slippage," said Laguna Beach Battalion Fire Chief 
Joe McClure, "and that was on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road.No lanes were 
blocked and we just put up a few barricades until it gets cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of Orange County, storm drains handled the rain and there were 
no damage reports, said Bill Reiter, Environmental Management Agency public 
works manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmer and drier weather expected today should help dry out soggy hillsides, 
said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said today's highs should be in the 50s to lower 60s. With the cloud 
cover expected to remain this evening, nights should warm up to the mid-40s, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a large area of tropical moisture now west of Baja California could 
be just enough for a few showers on Thursday when it mixes with weak remnants 
of a northern storm, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a 4,000-gallon sewage spill has closed an area of beach about 2,500 
feet long from Dumond Drive south to Blue Lagoon Drive in Laguna Beach, said 
Lawrence Honeybourne, County Health Care Agency program chief of water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill, from the South Coast Water District, was caused when a manhole on a 
line running along the bluffs became blocked, causing sewage to flow into the 
ocean, Honeybourne said. DAVID REYES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST; CYPRESS; POLICE MAY SEEK RECALL OF COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police here are threatening a recall campaign against the City Council if the 
council does not agree to their demands for an outside auditor to review the 
city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union believes the city has enough money to hire more officers and 
offer pay raises, and disputes the findings of a city fiscal advisory panel 
that has recommended cuts in the police budget, among other austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
 About 125 people, including residents and police officers, attended Monday 
night's City Council meeting to express their support for the audit and make 
public their views about law enforcement in Cypress. The police have worked 
without a contract for two years and without pay increases for 26 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers' "lives are on the line daily to provide the serenity you all enjoy 
as you close your eyes at night every night because they're out there doing the 
job they're underpaid to do," Steve McKinney, a 20-year Cypress resident, told 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Cypress Public Safety Employees Assn., the police union, are 
seeking a pay increase of 5% to 7% and are also asking for the hiring of at 
least eight more sworn police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wage dispute," said Lee Buzzard, the association's chief 
negotiator. "We don't accept (the council's) financial crisis pronouncements. 
If they say no to the audit review, we will initiate a recall campaign based on 
what we believe is a substantial base of community support." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they will decide whether to hire an auditor after meeting 
next Monday with the council-appointed Cypress Fiscal Advisory Committee, which 
has recommended that the city eliminate some management positions, lay off 20 
to 25 city employees and reduce employee fringe benefits to reduce the city 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The current city budget is $16 million and the committee anticipates a deficit 
of $1 million to $2.5 million a year for the next five years if the council 
does not trim expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money, the fiscal panel also recommended trimming police training 
costs and eliminating the DARE, or Drug Abuse Resistance Education, program in 
a report presented to the council two weeks ago. If these cuts in the Police 
Department and other services fail to balance the budget, the committee further 
suggests contracting for police services with the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police disagree with the committee's findings and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union paid for an auditor to review the city's budget in November. 
That auditor concluded that the city is not facing a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's finance director, Richard Storey, said the association's audit 
failed to recognize that the state is taking $825,000 annually from the city's 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's budgetary problems, Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry said: "We 
are not closing our ears. We want this community to stay as great as it is and 
we will do whatever is necessary to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently decided to hire four more officers and is seeking a state 
grant to help pay for four more. The council "will do anything we can" for the 
police and to improve public safety, Mayor Richard Partin said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS PRAISE EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's emergency response team is prepared for a natural disaster 
similar to last week's Northridge earthquake, the Board of Supervisors 
determined Tuesday after reviewing a report prepared by the Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors commended the department's response plan, although authorities 
noted that efforts to renovate some county fire stations are still underway. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also praised the firefighters, building inspectors, health workers 
and other county employees who assisted with relief efforts in Los Angeles 
County last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very pleased at the response of our county to the past floods, then 
the firestorms and the recent mobilization of our resources, sending them up to 
Los Angeles County for the good work done there," Supervisor William G. Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department's 28-page emergency preparedness report was prompted by 
the Northridge earthquake and concerns by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder that 
longtime structural problems put at least 14 local fire stations at risk of 
serious earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the "at-risk" stations are being remodeled, according to the 
county report. But Wieder said she is now satisfied that fire officials are 
following a schedule of renovations or relocation for the other stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The report outlined a $3.2-million plan to reinforce the weak structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1986, the Orange County Fire 
Department has allocated nearly $1.5 million to improve fire stations, County 
Fire Chief Larry J. Holms said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said his department could respond more quickly to local emergencies if 
it could call on helicopters to help in rescues and firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said helicopters were key to responding to fires sparked by the 
Northridge quake. E.J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE; COSTA MESA; BASKETBALL HOOPS' 
FATE HANGS ON PANEL 
</P>

<P>
 Park commissioners will meet tonight to decide whether to replace four 
basketball hoops that were removed from Tanager Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks, Recreation Facilities & Parkways Commission in October ordered the 
hoops removed for six months after neighbors complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the guys were down there playing basketball and using foul language," 
said neighbor Thresa McHugh. "I was with my two children and was scared to 
confront them. They looked like gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two courts at the park. One has hoops set at eight feet and one at 
10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 McHugh said she is happy the hoops came down. "Now tons of mothers go there 
with their kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But basketball enthusiasts, including two high school players, challenged the 
decision at a City Council meeting in December. The council asked the park 
commissioners to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Supt. David Alkema said emotions are running high on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman John De Witt noted that the October decision was simply to 
remove the hoops for six months to see if that would improve the situation. 
Then a public hearing was to be held, and the hoops could be put up again, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A November Community Services report stated that the city should build 14 
additional basketball courts because of community interest. The city now has 11 
courts, including the two at Tanager Park. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city telephone survey, basketball is the third most popular 
organized team sport among residents, after baseball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The park commission meets at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE; IRVINE; LEAGUE TO DISCUSS 
CAMPAIGN REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters is putting the finishing touches on tough new 
campaign reforms it hopes the City Council will approve later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules, which are the subject of a public meeting tonight, would 
close what reformers consider loopholes in existing campaign regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as the next step," said Linda Brown, co-chair of the league's 
Irvine chapter. "Irvine politics has generally been pretty decent and 
aboveboard. But we want to be proactive. We want to take action before (the 
rules) are abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Under campaign rules adopted in 1977, a contributor can give a maximum of $190 
to each candidate in an election. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such limit exists for political action committees (PACs) and groups 
that spend money to support candidates but have no official affiliation with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that PACs representing city employee associations as well as those 
set up to support or oppose certain candidates have circumvented the $190 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying that there is anything wrong or illegal about it," Brown 
said. "But we do feel it has the potential for problems. People with a lot of 
money could come in and truly influence the election." 
</P>
<P>
 The league's new rules would extend the $190 limit to PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 They would also prohibit PACs and other independent committees from 
transferring money to a candidate's campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees would be barred from asking firms that do business with the 
city to contribute to a candidate's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has presented the proposal to all five council members. Some, 
including Councilwoman Paula Werner, have expressed support. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this closes some of the loopholes, it makes it more fair for anyone to run 
for office in this city," Werner said. "It's another step toward good 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the changes are aimed at preventing wealthy interests from having 
undue influence on Irvine politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this will level the playing field a little between the regular 
citizen and someone who can attract more money," she said. "It's really a 
question of fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 The league and Orange County Common Cause will hold a public meeting to 
discuss the proposed reforms tonight at 7 at the Irvine Ranch Water District 
Building, 15600 Sand Canyon Ave. Four Reforms 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters is seeking Irvine City Council approval for a 
series of campaign finance reform rules. The proposed rules would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit individual contributions to political action committees and campaign 
groups not affiliated with any candidate to $190.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE; COSTA MESA; FAIR MANAGER LEAVES 
LEGACY OF GROWTH

 The general manager of the county fair resigned Tuesday to take another job. 
</P>
<P>
 Norbert J. Bartosik, who worked for 10 years as the manager of the Orange 
County Fair and Exposition Center, said he is leaving in March to manage the 
California State Fair in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160-acre fairgrounds in Costa Mesa is the site for the fair, a swap meet 
and the Pacific Amphitheater. According to fairgrounds officials, Bartosik 
increased summer fair attendance from 330,000 to 685,000 during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said Bartosik and his staff were creative about 
developing uses for the fairgrounds. "They were not just cruising along," she 
said. "They were really thinking of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartosik approached the City Council in December with a proposal to drive 250 
head of cattle down Fairview Avenue to kick off the 1994 fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said she hopes that Bartosik's replacement will be willing to work with 
the community. A replacement for Bartosik has not been selected. The council 
had ordered Bartosik to meet with fairgrounds neighbors to plan the cattle 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bartosik, the fairgrounds also moved to end years of complaints about 
noise from the Pacific Amphitheater, which it recently agreed to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's board of directors will talk about how to fill Bartosik's position 
at a meeting Thursday. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH; ANAHEIM; POLICE PICKET COUNCIL MEETING A 3RD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's increasingly angry police officers picketed a City Council meeting 
for the third time Tuesday, again demanding higher wages and an end to an 
18-month stalemate between their union and the city over their labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 Anaheim Police Assn. members and their supporters, waving signs that 
read "The City is Being Mickey Mouse -- Bargain Now" and "Millions for Disney, 
0 for Cops," rallied on the steps of City Hall for 40 minutes to press their 
demands. The demonstration was a virtual replay of protests the police staged 
last October and November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a police officer in Anaheim for 20 years and I have never, ever 
seen such deterioration (in the relationship) between the police officers and 
City Hall," Det. Warner Raes said. "This city does not have enough cops, and 
the ones the city does have, their pride is slowly being taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's demonstration followed a "blue flu" sickout Jan. 18 and 19, in which 
96% of the officers scheduled to work during a 24-hour shift participated by 
calling in sick. The city was forced to patrol its streets with officers from 
other cities and Anaheim police lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers have been working without a contract since July, 1992, and have 
not had a raise since July, 1991. They say their salaries rank 18th among the 
20 Orange County police departments. They accused the city of "stonewalling" 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that makes the city look bad has an impact on the negotiations and 
all of this makes the city look bad," said Bruce Bottolfson, the association's 
president. "I don't want the city to capitulate, all I want is a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are seeking a 10% raise through July, 1995, which would cost the 
city $7.5 million. The city has offered a 10% to 11.5% increase by July, 1996, 
which would cost the city $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers want a 4% raise immediately, a 2% raise in July and a 4% raise 
next January. The city is offering raises of 3.25% now, 3.25% next year and an 
increase in 1996 of 3.5% to 5%, depending on the inflation rate. The city would 
also give each officer an immediate $750 bonus for accepting the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have insisted that they cannot afford to meet the union's 
demands and said the union's demonstrations will not influence their offer. The 
city is already projecting an $8-million budget deficit in its $135-million 
1994-95 fiscal year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offer is a fair one," City Councilman Irv Pickler said. "Negotiating is a 
two-way street and the officers need to meet us halfway. The police (union) 
owes it to the city to sit down at the bargaining table." TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SADDLEBACK/SOUTH BEACH; LAGUNA HILLS; JUDGE MAY OK BAR TO 
AREA'S ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge said Tuesday she is leaning in favor of 
letting county government officials block the city's attempt to annex North 
Laguna Hills while the city and county battle over the area's sales tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in Santa Ana, Judge Eileen C. Moore told attorneys she 
tentatively planned to deny the city's request for a resolution from the county 
that would permit the city to argue its annexation case before the Local Agency 
Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing arguments from the city's attorney, Thomas F. Nixon, and 
Deputy County Counsel Benjamin P. de Mayo, Moore said she will make a ruling in 
the matter within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the city's attempt to annex the 722-acre area, whose 4,600 
residents voted more than four years ago to be part of the new city of Laguna 
Hills. Because of objections from the county, LAFCO did not allow North Laguna 
Hills to be included when Laguna Hills incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has been blocking the annexation because it could lose a huge 
amount of revenue in the process. Based on fiscal 1993 figures from the county 
auditor, the area generates about $600,000 in property taxes and $2.3 million 
in sales and others taxes for the county while requiring about $540,000 in 
costs for law enforcement, planning, animal control and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's sales tax revenue is particularly lucrative because it includes 
numerous stores concentrated along a street commonly known as "furniture row." 
The proposed annexation area is bounded by Interstate 5, Ridge Route Drive, 
Santa Maria Avenue, Moulton Parkway and the city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state law, the county and city must reach agreement on dividing 
up taxes in the targeted area before the city can argue its annexation case 
before LAFCO. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that it is required to negotiate with the county only on property 
taxes, the Laguna Hills City Council last year offered to let the county have 
all the property tax revenue and set its sights on the remaining sales and 
other tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contends that no further negotiations are required and that the Board 
of Supervisors must pass a resolution allowing the city to proceed with its 
application to LAFCO. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also asked the judge to rule that the city is correct in arguing that 
the property tax issue should be the only matter that should be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has used an inaccurate interpretation of the (law) to justify 
preventing LAFCO from considering our interpretation of the merits of the 
annexation," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Counsel De Mayo said the county believes it has the right to 
hold up the annexation attempt for two reasons: The city did not follow certain 
state-required procedures for filing an annexation application, and the county 
has the right to negotiate a share of revenue from sales and others taxes in 
the proposed annexation area. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL; WESTMINSTER; AMBULANCE SERVICE MAKES FIRST RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first call came less than two hours into their shift Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bryan James and Matt Gordon, the excitement momentarily turned to 
nervousness as they prepared for their first run as ambulance drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 With sirens blaring, James, 22, took the ambulance out of Station 1 on 
Westminster Boulevard while Gordon, 20, prepared the stretcher and other 
equipment under the watchful eyes of training officers who rode along. 
</P>
<P>
 In little time, they reached their patient, an elderly woman suffering from 
chest pains, who was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous, but it's fun," said James, who hopes that his experience as 
an ambulance driver will help him become a firefighter some day. 
</P>
<P>
 James and Gordon work for Superior Ambulance, a Santa Ana-based company that 
provides drivers for the city ambulance service that began this week. The 
drivers, not city employees, are under the supervision of Fire Department 
officials, who are running the ambulance program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten other full-time and six alternate drivers have been provided by Superior 
Ambulance under a renewable six-month contract that will cost the city 
$144,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance program, only the second of its kind after that of Huntington 
Beach in Orange County, will improve the medical response capabilities of the 
city and generate additional income, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited," said Mayor Charles V. Smith. "This will save lives 
because it will cut considerably the time to get victims to hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, one ambulance will be housed at Station 1 at 7351 
Westminster Blvd. and another at Station 2 at 15061 Moran St. An ambulance will 
accompany the paramedics responding to a medical emergency, unlike in the past 
when private ambulances would arrive 10 or more minutes after the paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're testing new waters here," said Capt. Craig Campbell, the Westminster 
Fire Department training officer. "We'll evaluate (the program) and make some 
changes, if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is using two used ambulances and is anticipating the arrival in April 
of two new ambulances from an El Monte company. Last year, the city spent 
$243,000 to buy the new ambulances, paramedic equipment, communication and 
safety equipment, and the uniforms and training for the ambulance drivers. 
Officials hope to make $250,000 a year from offering the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulance fees will range from $225 to $300, depending on whether the patient 
needs medication on the way to the hospital. There will be additional charges 
for mileage, night calls or use of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. Local 2425, who have opposed 
the changes in the Fire Department, said paramedic services will not improve 
unless the city hires more firefighters and paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hired ambulance drivers, not firefighters," said Mike Garrison, a 
director of the firefighters union, who said the city needs 21 firefighters 
more to add to its current 63-man force. 
</P>
<P>
 But for James and Gordon, who both have taken fire services courses at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana, driving an ambulance is the closest to driving a 
fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my foot in the door," said Gordon, whose father is a 14-year veteran 
at the Fullerton Fire Department. BERT ELJERA

 Ned Doffoney, academic affairs vice president of Los Angeles City College, has 
been named president of Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Doffoney, 43, said he was notified of the selection Tuesday morning and plans 
to assume his new job on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Doffoney, an African American, also brings a racial minority to 
the top position of a college that has been beset with racial problems in the 
last year, including reported threats against black students and the 
circulation of racist flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doffoney has been in his current position at LACC since 1990. He previously 
was academic affairs vice president and dean of academic affairs at Los Angeles 
Southwest College, assistant dean of admissions and records at Los Angeles 
Trade-Technical College, and financial aid and affirmative action director at 
Lassen College in Susanville. RICHARD CORE

PANEL KILLS BILL TO BAR STATE COLLEGES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key Assembly committee on Tuesday killed an Orange County lawmaker's bill 
that would have barred illegal immigrants from attending California's 
universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Higher Education Committee defeated the measure by Assemblyman 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) on a 5-2 vote after college officials argued that it 
would deter them from carrying out their educational mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, we continue to believe that decisions about admission should 
be based on educational considerations," said Stephen A. Arditti, the 
University of California's government relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, said that state lawmakers and educators are out of step with 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a philosophical bent that we ought to educate everyone in the 
world, whether they're here legally or not," Conroy said after the hearing. "I 
don't think the taxpayers of California should subsidize illegal aliens and 
their education, especially when we're having to deny slots at our universities 
to legal residents." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials argued that winnowing out illegal immigrants is 
administratively difficult and defies the traditional standard for selecting 
students -- academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said taxpayers do not subsidize immigrants, who end up 
paying higher fees charged out-of-state students. Some educators also said the 
measure expressed bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy said the bill was simply an effort to underline existing federal law 
requiring immigrants to enter the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Republican versus Democrat, liberal versus conservative," he 
said. "This is an issue of upholding our constitutional responsibility."

ANAHEIM TO PAY FIRED OFFICER BACK WAGES; COURTS: CITY SAYS FIGHTING HIM IN 
COURT WOULD HAVE COST MORE THAN THE $155,000 SETTLEMENT. PATROLMAN FAILED TO 
HELP INJURED MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has agreed to pay $155,000 in back wages to a police officer who was 
fired for abandoning a drunk and injured homeless man outside a hospital and 
then falsely reporting the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a settlement signed Jan. 7 but newly disclosed, the city also reinstated 
Officer Bernard Rubio for one day on the condition that he immediately resign. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Tuesday they accepted the settlement because, after losing 
one round in Superior Court, it would have been more expensive and 
time-consuming to continue fighting Rubio's lawsuit to get back his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have to face an uphill battle at the appeals court level in getting 
the lower court's (decision) overturned," said City Manager Allan L. Roeder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Rubio was fired in January, 1992, after an internal investigation that 
concluded he violated department policy when he left the homeless man outside 
Hoag Hospital instead of making sure he received medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio had found the man, Philip Stennett, loitering at a liquor store and 
suffering from a slight cut on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Rubio drove away from the hospital, Stennett walked toward the entrance 
but collapsed into some bushes, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rubio logged "GOA," or gone on arrival, on the police report, 
indicating that Stennett had left the liquor store by the time the officer 
arrived and that no statement was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio, who filed a lawsuit in Superior Court seeking job reinstatement, said 
in court records he left Stennett after he determined that the man was not 
hurt. Rubio also said he didn't see Stennett fall down. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, Superior Court Judge William P. Rylaarsdam ruled that Rubio 
failed in his ethical duty by leaving Stennett without getting him help, and 
that the officer had falsified his report. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge concluded that firing was too harsh a punishment because 
the department had apparently tolerated similar actions from officers in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Rylaarsdam found that "the city has a policy to permit officers to leave 
a person who is so intoxicated as to be unable to take care of himself where 
found, or even a policy which would discourage an officer from seeing to it 
that aid is rendered to such a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a policy, Rylaarsdam said, "would seem to create an atmosphere where 
conduct such as (Rubio's) implicitly is given an aura of approval." The judge 
ordered that the department rehire Rubio, pay him back pay and impose a less 
severe punishment.  
</P>
<P>
 The city asked the appeals court to overturn Rylaarsdam's ruling, but finally 
relented to a settlement that involved the officer's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also disagreed with the judge, insisting the department has no 
policy, written or otherwise, allowing officers to leave an individual.

RESTAURATEUR TAKES STAND IN VALET'S TRIAL; COURTS: LARRY CANO SAYS HE NEVER 
GAVE UNLIMITED BANK ACCOUNT ACCESS TO THE MAN ACCUSED OF STEALING $400,000 FROM 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Larry J. Cano, founder of the El Torito restaurant empire, testified Tuesday 
that he never gave unlimited bank account access to his longtime valet, who is 
accused of stealing more than $400,000 from the Newport Beach millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano took the witness stand as trial got underway for former valet Clarence R. 
Wheeler, 39, who is charged with eight felony counts of credit card fraud, tax 
evasion and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano told jurors that Wheeler frequently accompanied him to sunny beaches in 
the south of France and on ski trips to Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked about a lavish lifestyle, including the thousands in spending money 
he would take from the bank in a single transaction, his fondness for fresh 
floral arrangements, and expensive meals and drinks with friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano told jurors he would pay when Wheeler accompanied Cano's ex-wife or other 
companions to lunch, dinner or on trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's defense attorney, Scott Well, contends that Cano gave his personal 
assistant a free spending hand, and is now seeking to blame Wheeler for the 
millionaire's poor financial situation, which soured after he sold the El 
Torito concept for $18 million. Two of Cano's businesses recently filed 
bankruptcy actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prosecutors are portraying this as a rags-to-riches-to-rags story," Well said 
outside of court, adding that his client was a dedicated employee who did 
nothing wrong. "There are a lot of sour grapes going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino declined to discuss the case while the trial 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano told jurors that the trusted employee had unspecified -- but not 
unlimited -- access to his financial accounts. There were no spending limits 
beyond reason, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no reason to mistrust," Cano testified. "It seemed reasonable, what was 
being spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, who has also filed a civil suit against Wheeler, has stated in civil 
court records that he never allowed Wheeler power of attorney to transfer money 
from Cano's account and to write checks.  
</P>
<P>
 In court Tuesday, Cano said he did not recall knowingly signing any 
power-of-attorney documents, and said that he never specified limits on 
Wheeler's use of the financial accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's testimony resumes today before Superior Court Judge Robert Fitzgerald.

 Maureen DiMarco, California's Secretary for Child Development and Education 
and a longtime Orange County resident, said Tuesday she is "95% sure" she will 
seek the state superintendency of public instruction because "it is time to end 
the education wars." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, a Democrat appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson upon his election 
in 1990, said her experience in schools and government, plus her ability to 
work with a range of politicians, qualify her for the state's top schools job, 
which was vacated last year when Bill Honig was convicted of 
conflict-of-interest charges.Wilson has nominated businessman Sanford Sigoloff 
as interim superintendent, but Sigoloff has said he will not be a candidate in 
this year's election even if he is confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cypress resident since 1972, DiMarco, 45, served for 11 years on the Garden 
Grove Unified School District's Board of Trustees, after being a parent 
volunteer and classroom instructional aide. She spent 1983 as an executive 
consultant to Honig, and went to work for Wilson in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a decade of wars. I think it's time to get people together and 
start figuring out exactly what we want our schools to have," DiMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must file a notice of intent to run by Feb. 9 for the June 
nonpartisan election. Other expected candidates for the post include 
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) and Tustin Unified school board member 
Gloria Tuchman.

HUNDREDS OF TIRES SLASHED IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 tires were slashed late Monday night and early Tuesday morning 
in what police called an indiscriminate act of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the tires were slashed in an area defined by Chapman Avenue on the 
north and Garden Grove Boulevard on the south; and Western Avenue on the west 
and Nutwood Street on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think tire slashing is not a heinous crime, but a lot of people trying 
to get to work were inconvenienced," said Sgt. George Jaramillo,

DISCOVERERS AND CREATORS; THE FILMMAKER: O.C. DIRECTOR GREG MACGILLIVRAY IS 
'SUPER-PROUD' OF CAPTURING THE SPIRIT OF THE EXPLORERS' QUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The last surf movie Orange County filmmaker Greg MacGillivray worked on was 
"Big Wednesday" in 1978. That was six years after he and his late partner, Jim 
Freeman, finished the last of a string of surfing films they produced together: 
"Five Summer Stories," a documentary that became a classic of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, MacGillivray found himself on a beach in Hawaii, shooting a new 
generation of surfers in a film format somewhat larger than the 16 millimeters 
in which he shot "Five Summer Stories": IMAX, with a frame size 10 times bigger 
than standard 35-millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really enjoyable. . . . I was able to meet all these new professional 
surfers whose names I didn't know," said MacGillivray, head of Laguna 
Beach-based MacGillivray Freeman Films. 
</P>
<P>
 The new breed of surfers is finely tuned and serious, he found, different from 
the laid-back lot he knew as a surfer and surf filmmaker in the '60s and early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The modern professional surfer is more or less like the professional athlete 
in any sport," he said. Although the new surfers are "very much in love with 
what they do," MacGillivray said, there are "fewer characters than there used 
to be. In the old days, it seemed like every 10th surfer was a real character. 
. . . The best surfers were the guys who hung out at the beach the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing is only one part of his current IMAX project, "The Living Sea," but it 
represents something of a return to MacGillivray's first love. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign that his professional life has come full circle, in one respect: 
the first video release of "Five Summer Stories," scheduled for later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ocean has always been probably the most important thing to me. I really 
love the ocean," MacGillivray said. "I've always wanted to communicate that 
feeling I had for the ocean with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Living Sea" will be the next in an impressive body of IMAX films directed 
by MacGillivray, probably the foremost director in the format. 
</P>
<P>
 His credits include "To Fly," "Speed," "To the Limit" and the most recent 
entry, "The Discoverers," now playing on the IMAX screen at the California 
Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles, and in San Diego at the Reuben 
H. Fleet Space Theater and Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Discoverers" was inspired by the book of that title by historian Daniel 
J. Boorstin (related story, F1). It represents a departure from MacGillivray's 
previous IMAX efforts and from other works in the format (the films are 
projected on a five-story screen designed to fill the viewer's field of 
vision). 
</P>
<P>
 IMAX films tend to be long on visual flash but short on narrative structure. 
MacGillivray took a different tack with "The Discoverers," which briefly tells 
the stories of six real-life explorers and scientists, three segments with the 
actual people and three with actors playing historical characters. 
</P>
<P>
 IMAX is "such an in-your-face kind of medium," MacGillivray said, that it was 
difficult to balance the personal stories in the film with the high-tech 
visuals people have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really super-proud of 'The Discoverers.' It's not the easiest kind of 
film to make in that medium," he said. "It's kind of the exception in the IMAX 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Discoverers" came about when MacGillivray Freeman Films won a competition 
to produce a 19-minute film for Expo '92 in Barcelona, Spain, marking the 500th 
anniversary of Columbus' journey to North America. The idea to use Boorstin's 
book as a model was raised, and to simultaneously make a 40-minute version of 
the film for standard IMAX release. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter and documentary filmmaker Jon Boorstin, the historian's son, was 
asked to write the script and help direct some of the interior sequences. He 
had worked with MacGillivray on 1989's "To the Limit," which took a prize at a 
Paris festival of IMAX films. 
</P>
<P>
 His first task was to boil down the essence of "The Discoverers" in a script 
for the World Expo film -- for an international audience, with no narration. "I 
was essentially trying to make a 19-minute silent film out of a 700-page book," 
Boorstin said by phone from his home in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The work isn't an adaptation in any traditional sense: Four of the six 
characters in the longer film do not even appear in the book. Rather, the film 
tries to capture what the book conveys about the spirit of discovery and make 
audiences "feel it through the characters," Boorstin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the trick was to find moments of discovery" where viewers could 
"understand the story without even understanding the words." 
</P>
<P>
 The three historical incidents depicted are Newton's discovery of the 
refractive qualities of light, Magellan pioneering the path across the tip of 
South America and the discovery of prehistoric cave paintings in Altamira, 
Spain, by an amateur archeologist. Three modern scientists were added for the 
general IMAX release, their stories told in semi-documentary fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Boorstin agrees that depicting personal stories as narrative is a 
challenge in the IMAX format: "It is unusual for IMAX, and for good reason," he 
said. "The IMAX camera is big, intrusive, temperamental. . . . It's not really 
an actors' medium." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Daniel Boorstin's involvement was minimal, his son did send drafts of 
his script for suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved the idea of seeing his work played with on film," Jon Boorstin said. 
"I have to say it was a great pleasure for me, because I had never worked with 
him."  
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Boorstin said in a telephone interview that he is "very much impressed" 
with the film and appreciates that it brings the message of the book to a wider 
audience. "I was glad to see the ideas of the book translated in that way," he 
said. "I was very pleased with the way it caught the spirit of discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin even helped promote the film by giving a "brilliant speech" in 
September in Charlotte, N.C., at a convention of the International Space 
Theater Consortium, MacGillivray said. "He's an American treasure; he's so 
learned and well-read. He's especially interesting to talk to, although you 
don't want to say a word when you're talking to the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, MacGillivray was already putting together his next projects before 
"The Discoverers" was released. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Living Sea," he is working with prominent marine biologist Robert 
Ballard and experts from other institutions. He has traveled to Palau, an 
island east of the Philippines, to a village that has lived in harmony with its 
environment for centuries; other locations will include Nova Scotia and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 The film aims to point up threats to the ocean while still giving a positive 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a doom-and-gloom kind of thing," MacGillivray said. He said his hope 
is that "the audience will get a real respect for the value and the fragility 
of the ocean and will use it better. . . . There's an awful lot we can draw 
from the ocean without being harmful to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 MacGillivray has started work on the next IMAX project, a film called "Storm 
Chasers" about scientists who study storms. He already has some spectacular 
film of hurricanes and tornadoes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to continually seek new and different projects.  
</P>
<P>
 He's been exhorted to make sequels to some of his popular films, such as "To 
Fly," about the history of flight, but "you have to kind of resist that 
temptation," he said. It's something he says he learned when he worked as a 
production assistant to director Stanley Kubrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Why do the same thing twice?' Your life's too short to do that.' . 
. . The whole point is doing a good job. Satisfying myself is the point in 
filmmaking, in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Discoverers" plays daily at 10 a.m., noon, 3, 6 and 9 p.m. at the 
California Museum of Science and Industry, off the Harbor (110) Freeway at 
Exposition Boulevard, Los Angeles. $10. (213) 744-2014. The film will play at 
the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego's Balboa Park 
today and Thursday at noon, 2 and 5 p.m. Beginning Friday, it will screen 
weekdays at 1 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. $3.50-$6. (619)

DISCOVERERS AND CREATORS; THE AUTHOR: DANIEL J. BOORSTIN INSPIRED THE MOVIE 
WITH HIS 1983 WORLD HISTORY OF THE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Historian and author Daniel J. Boorstin has studied the American heart and 
soul for more than half a century. As he surveys the terrain today, he sees a 
disturbing decline, both in public life and in the private sphere, of what he 
calls "the amateur spirit," the spirit that our system of government was 
founded upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before amateur became virtually a synonym for unskillful , it carried a 
meaning closer to its Latin root: amator, or lover. It is to this definition 
that Boorstin remains passionately devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amateur spirit has been much maligned," Boorstin, 79, said recently in a 
telephone interview from his home in Washington, D.C. "I think the amateur is a 
lover, a person who does something for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy," he added, "is government by amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay that predated by several years the disillusionment with 
professional politicians that characterized the 1992 elections, Boorstin wrote: 
"The two new breeds whose power and prestige menace the amateur spirit are the 
professionals and the bureaucrats . Both are byproducts of American wealth, 
American progress. But they can stifle the amateur spirit on which the special 
quality and vision of our American leaders must depend." 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur spirit also informs the best writings on history, Boorstin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic "History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," written by 
18th-Century British scholar Edward Gibbon, has long been held by Boorstin as a 
model of historical writing: "I've felt that the great works of history have 
also been great works of literature. That's the only way they can reach out to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 If Boorstin is an amateur in spirit, he is not in deed. He was librarian of 
Congress for 12 years, director of the National Museum of History and 
Technology, senior historian of the Smithsonian Institution and professor of 
history at the University of Chicago for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With a body of work that includes his trilogy "The Americans" (the third 
volume, "The Democratic Experience," won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 
1973), plus "The Discoverers" (1983) and "The Creators," his most recent opus, 
Boorstin has written some of the most widely read histories of the past several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow author Harrison E. Salisbury had this to say about Boorstin in his 
review of "The Creators": "Not often in our contemporary world do we meet a man 
who evokes the expression 'polymath.' Indeed, we shy away from this concept -- 
the man whose knowledge passes freely across eras, arts and disciplines. But it 
is clear that Boorstin is such a man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin considers himself lucky not to be writing only for his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate in that I never had to make a living from writing," Boorstin 
said, a situation that has allowed him to pursue only those book projects that 
interest him, and to write broad-ranging books for a general audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first stage of his writing career, Boorstin distinguished himself 
as a keen and often prescient observer of the American scene, from Colonial 
times ("The Lost World of Thomas Jefferson," 1948) to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades ago, for instance, Boorstin wrote "The Image," a still-relevant 
chronicle of the rise this century of the public-relations industry and the 
concomitant dominance of the news by "pseudo-events," calculated "for the 
immediate purpose of being reported or reproduced." 
</P>
<P>
 The processes Boorstin documented have only accelerated in the decades since. 
He had thought of updating "The Image" but decided that his examples and the 
conclusions he drew still hold true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays everybody tells us that what we need is more belief, a stronger and 
deeper and more encompassing faith. A faith in America and what we are doing . 
. . ," he wrote in 1961. "What ails us most is not what we have done with 
America, but what we have substituted for America. We suffer primarily not from 
our vices or our weaknesses, but from our illusions." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes the book demonstrates to new readers that the processes have 
been going on for some time. "It's meant to be a tonic and not an emetic," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Discoverers," Boorstin ventured into world history, outlining the 
human search for knowledge. "I thought perhaps it was time to grow up and 
deprovincialize myself," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 His trek into world history continued with "The Creators" (1992), which 
followed the development of the arts through the ages. As he approaches his 
80th birthday (on Oct. 1), Boorstin is at work on the third book of the series, 
which he calls "The Seekers." 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of the new work flows naturally from the previous two, he said. All 
the accumulated knowledge and the works of art, Boorstin said, beg a question: 
"So what? What does it all add up to?" The current work will be about "the 
search for meaning" and the ways in which Western peoples have strived for 
self-knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin's most expansive works occupy him for long stretches. The three parts 
of "The Americans" took some 25 years to research and write; "The Discoverers" 
and "The Creators" each took about nine years. He works closely with his wife 
of more than 50 years, Ruth Boorstin, who is his primary editor ("Without her, 
my books would be twice as long and half as readable"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Every book is a kind of experiment," said Boorstin, who works closely with 
his wife of more than 50 years, Ruth, his primary editor ("Without her, my 
books would be twice as long and half as readable"). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a special satisfaction in writing a long book, in that you hope to 
grow. . . . You must learn in the course of it. That's the challenge of the 
historian, to keep learning. . . . If other people enjoy it, that's a 
dividend." 
</P>
<P>
 The personal challenge of expanding his own knowledge is balanced by another, 
broader goal: to make the book compelling to the average reader. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of nonfiction, people know how it turned out," Boorstin said. 
"You have to create suspense within the limits of the facts. That's what the 
good historian has to do, to create a drama." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a common thread through Boorstin's writings on history, it's that 
he is less likely to focus on politics and war than on the telling detail of 
individual lives, and the technological and social developments, that shaped 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples from "The Americans: The Democratic Experience" are men whose 
impact was very different in effect yet similar in scope. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christopher Columbus Langdell, who took over in 1870 as dean of Harvard 
Law School, who invented and introduced the concept of "case law." Langdell's 
approach replaced the application of grand legal principles to matters of law. 
The new emphasis on the factual minutiae of law as it had been applied in 
previous cases produced a sea change in legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was naturalist Clarence Birdseye, who went fishing one day in 
sub-freezing temperatures, caught a fish and set it on the ice until he was 
done. When he got home and threw the frozen fish into a pail of water, he was 
startled to see it revive and start swimming again. It prompted Birdseye to 
develop the frozen-food company bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Boorstin notes, decades later nearly every home in America contained a 
refrigerator-freezer unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin has written that a historian is both "discoverer and creator" -- one 
who roots through the relics of the past to resurrect something of the spirit 
of an age. In his own searches and writings, Boorstin has refrained from 
espousing a dogmatic view of past events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt strongly that ideology is a kind of prison," Boorstin 
said. "That's the genius of American politics. What distinguishes American 
political institutions is the absence of dogma." Of his series, "The 
Americans," Boorstin said: "It's not a history of philosophies; it's a history 
of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Discoverers" and "The Creators" paint their pictures by spotlighting the 
lives of people Boorstin sees as key figures. "My books do not have abstract 
titles. The titles are about people," Boorstin said. In the case of his most 
recent book, "I didn't call it 'Creativity' or 'The Arts,' I called it 'The 
Creators.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin has served books not only as an author, but also as librarian of 
Congress, a post he held until his retirement in 1987. As librarian emeritus, 
he maintains an office in the library, although he continues to do his writing 
and research at home. 
</P>
<P>
 A keen observer of advancing technology, and particularly its effects on the 
dispersal of images and information, Boorstin quickly makes the distinction 
between "information" and "knowledge," remaining skeptical about the 
much-heralded information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information tends to drive knowledge out of existence," Boorstin said, and 
the coming rain of "pseudo-facts" only makes it more important "that we anchor 
ourselves in the printed word." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin is often asked if he fears for the future of books, but he joked that 
as one who receives regular royalty checks, "I can bear witness to the fact 
that people are reading books." The fear is predicated on the "displacive 
fallacy," he said: "They assume that the new technology is going to drive the 
old one out of existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Some predicted that "when movies came in, nobody would read a book anymore. 
That was not the case," Boorstin said. What happens, he continued, is that new 
technology "forces people to find niches for the old technology." 
</P>
<P>
 And books, he believes, will always have a niche. 
</P>
<P>
 Books can be "smuggled under a mattress," carried and read anywhere, Boorstin 
said. The book is "an explosive and a sedative and a companion and an avenue to 
community for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone once remarked to him that the Library of Congress is "the world's 
largest collection of bad books," Boorstin said, "and that is true, because 
we're a free society . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That's one definition for freedom, that images are allowed to compete. . . . 
Libraries remain so important as reminders of how many efforts and reaches 
people have made." Historian Daniel J. Boorstin on . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Television: 
</P>
<P>
 "When people have running water, they don't have to go to the well. The same 
thing happens with entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, Boorstin says, television divides people and breaks down 
community, because they do not leave their homes. "That's one of the reasons 
I'm glad to see movie theaters prosper. Even if they have to sit in the dark, 
at least they're with other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Multiculturalism: 
</P>
<P>
 "The building of the country is the building of communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin said he is wary of any "emphasis on diversity as an end" in itself. 
"The history of the United States is a remarkable example" of the creation of a 
"shared humanity . . . between groups who had not lived together before." 
</P>
<P>
 Heroes and celebrities: 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused. Yet we confuse 
them every day, and by doing so we come dangerously close to depriving 
ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not 
simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are 
great. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The old heroic human mold has been broken. A new mold has been made. We have 
actually demanded that this mold be made, so that marketable human models -- 
modern 'heroes' -- could be mass-produced, to satisfy the market, and without 
any hitches. The qualities which now commonly make a man or woman into a 
'nationally advertised brand' are in fact a new category of human emptiness." 
(From "The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America," 1961).

 Christopher Rouse, the composer who won the Pulitzer Prize in music last year, 
likes to laugh, likes to talk, likes loud music, likes rock and roll, likes to 
be slightly outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, when composer-in-residence of the Baltimore Symphony, he 
orchestrated "Twist and Shout" as an encore piece for the orchestra's tour of 
the then Soviet Union. He famously describes what is probably his best-known 
orchestra piece, "Bump," as the Boston Pops in Hell.

 When an interviewer phones him at his home in Rochester, N.Y., to talk about 
his new Cello Concerto, which the Los Angeles Philharmonic will premiere 
tonight with Yo-Yo Ma as soloist, the call happens to come in a couple of 
minutes early, interrupting the conclusion of his favorite afternoon soap 
opera. At the end of the conversation, he jokes about the new concerto being so 
depressing that he advises not bringing any knives or poison to the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 He jokes. But he is also deadly serious. The Cello Concerto is not a happy 
piece. Its tone is not celebratory, although it was commissioned to celebrate 
the Philharmonic's 75th anniversary this season. The piece also honors Betty 
Freeman, the Los Angeles philanthropist who financed the commission and about 
whom Rouse, in dedicating the concerto to her, says he is expressing his 
gratitude for all she has done to foster new American music, not just his. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is a somber concerto. Its subject is death, and our longing to 
transcend it. If that sounds just too uncheery, it is worth recalling that such 
is a subject made for music. Many beloved pieces are death-transcending, 
including, of course, Strauss' "Death and Transfiguration," Wagner's "Tristan 
und Isolde" and a great deal of religious music (especially Bach's). 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Rouse's concerto may prove -- as did John Corigliano's so-called 
"AIDS" Symphony recently and the chart-busting Gorecki Third Symphony -- to be 
just the serious music to express what is on so many people's minds these days. 
If death preoccupied Rouse, it is, he says, because of the deaths of three 
colleagues and close friends, the composers Sir Andrej Panufnik, William 
Schumann and Steven Albert, who died in 1991 and 1992 and who are all quoted in 
the score, as are a couple of poignant moments from Monteverdi. A bad time for 
music -- during the gestation and composition of the score, Rouse notes, 
Olivier Messiaen and John Cage also died. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly there is no place, in what Rouse describes as his darkest work, for 
the more antic side of the 44-year-old composer. But Rouse is a dramatic 
composer who happens to feel that his oft-noted love for '60s rock 'n' roll is 
not anything peculiar for a serious composer. "I think a lot of people retain a 
fondness for the popular music they grew up with. In my case that was rock 'n' 
roll, and it may or may not find its way into my work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the great good fortune of being in high school during the years of the 
Beatles at their height, the Rolling Stones, the Byrds. To me it still is a 
wonderful repertoire of music. So it wasn't so much a conscious decision on my 
part to say, 'Oh boy, I'm going to use rock 'n' roll in my music and make a big 
impression.' It just seemed a natural thing for me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It also seemed natural for Rouse, who teaches at the Eastman School of Music 
in Rochester, to bring his passion for rock to his students. But Rouse's rock 
history course, the first fully accredited in the subject to be offered at a 
music school, has no politically correct agenda, no social theory about popular 
culture associated with it. Rouse says he simply found his students ignorant of 
his favorite period, from the Beatles to the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first taught about this in '79, I found that students already didn't 
really have memories that went back much beyond Peter Frampton. So when you 
told them about the Supremes or the Four Tops or the Moby Grape, this was all 
new repertoire. As I've continued to teach the course, people tend not to know 
much about pop music before Madonna. So it's that much broader a spectrum of 
music that I could expose them to. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it's partly an act of proselytization. Ultimately, the goal is just to 
get them excited about it, which I would hope is the purpose of any music 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rouse realizes that popular music is popular music, and, as a kid 
growing up in Baltimore, he did make the decision to go into serious 
composition, studying at Oberlin and Cornell, and finding that the great, 
serious works of the Western culture ultimately had more sway. And whether his 
own works, which include several recent concertos, allude to the popular world 
or not (they just as well might be Shostakovich or Bruckner obsessed), there is 
always a sense of dramatic immediacy about them. (It was a compellingly 
theatrical Trombone Concerto, premiered last year, that won him the Pulitzer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Such drama, grim though it might be, seems to characterize the new Cello 
Concerto, as well. Rouse describes the solo cello as the everyman spirit that 
in the first movement does battle against the orchestra.  
</P>
<P>
 The cello, stung, flies into a wild cadenza. The second movement is, Rouse 
says, "almost entirely quiet, which is something people don't associate with 
me. I had in mind the split second in real time between life and death, where 
one is neither alive nor dead, but just there on the cusp. I extended that into 
about 12 minutes." The cello dies, trailing off into nothing. The wooden 
percussion has a triumphant hiss by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rouse offered this description a couple of days before the Los 
Angeles earthquake, his music antennae this time seemed eerily prophetic, 
attuning to just the kind of music likely to mean the most to a jittery 
audience.

SUNDANCE FEST RETAINS ITS COUNTERCULTURE ESSENCE; MOVIES: DESPITE THE 
INEVITABLE HOLLYWOOD OVERLAY, A YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM FOR FILM STILL 
CHARACTERIZES THE ANNUAL EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, the Sundance Film Festival is more crowded than it's ever been. Yes, the 
Barking Frog, the town's restaurant of choice, was fully booked before a single 
film was shown and agents with cigars can be seen walking down Main Street and 
talking on cellular phones at the backs of theaters. But somehow the essence of 
this event still gets through. Witness Megwynn White. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really, really cool here -- I don't know how else to say it," says 
White, one of a group of 24 exuberant students from a filmmaking program at 
Pacoima Junior High who have come en masse as the festival's partial guests to 
experience its wonders. "We've been at other festivals, but since we're kids, 
we don't always get a really good response. But here we can go up to directors, 
say, 'Hi, we're students,' and actually talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year a group from Pacoima has come to the festival, and 
though Sundance supplies them with free tickets, the students spend the entire 
year, in vintage Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney fashion, raising money to pay their 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold hundreds of boxes of chocolates, blow pops, gummy bears, gummy worms, 
everything there is that's gummy," says Josh Gray-Emmer, who has moved on to 
Van Nuys High School. "If you counted each of the M&Ms we sold, it was in the 
millions. And we all had to keep a B average to be able to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it worth it? "It's incredible," says Gray-Emmer, 15, whose ambition is to 
be the youngest producer in the motion picture academy. "A lot of students 
don't go to anything but what's in the big theaters, and that's so limited. 
You'd be amazed at how different our films were after last year's festival. 
This gives us a chance to see what else is out there. We didn't even know films 
like this could exist." 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the inevitable Hollywood overlay, it is this kind of youthful 
enthusiasm for film and its ability to say something meaningful, to form an 
emotional connection with its audience, that still characterizes the Sundance 
festival. With posters taped to walls and a hand-lettered message near a hectic 
box office reading, "Avert misunderstanding by calm, poise, balance," the 
festival maintains a shaggy, counterculture feeling. Where else would "Darkness 
in Tallinn," an out-of-competition thriller shot in the Baltics, try to get 
everyone's attention with mimeographed flyers reading, "Everybody must get 
Estoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously paralleling their audience, many of the films in competition this 
year are earnest and sincere, more notable for the decency of their intentions 
than the dazzling nature of their execution. Judging by the first few days, 
dysfunctional families are a popular theme, with "Spanking the Monkey" 
confronting incest and "Fun" examining a thrill killing by teen-age girls who 
didn't exactly have caring parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in this mode is the touching and sentimental "blessing," the story of a 
free-spirited Wisconsin farm girl who dreams of better things but must deal 
with an abusive father, not to mention all those cows. Actress Melora Griffis 
gives a nicely unaffected performance and gets to play a lot of emotional 
scenes against her real-life father, actor Guy Griffis. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the audience favorites among dramatic films, "Fresh," written and 
directed by Boaz Yakin, also has a splintered family at its core. 
Twelve-year-old Michael, street name Fresh, is a wise-beyond-his-years Brooklyn 
kid who works for a pair of local drug dealers and, yes, dreams of better 
things. An unlikely and often unwieldy amalgam of social consciousness and 
commercial thriller elements, "Fresh" does feature solid performances from 
Samuel L. Jackson as Fresh's chess-addicted father, Giancarlo Esposito as the 
boy's drug-dealing mentor, "Zebrahead's" N'Bushe Wright as his troubled sister, 
and Sean Nelson as Fresh himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular documentaries so far also has a family theme. "Martha 
and Ethel" is an extremely personal look at the lifelong nannies who raised the 
large families of each of the filmmakers. Martha, who emigrated from Germany, 
is the disciplinarian who took care of all six Ettingers, including co-producer 
Barbara, while Ethel is an affectionate black woman from South Carolina who 
reared five Johnston children, including director-co-producer Jyll. The film 
has become something of a Cinderella story, getting a distribution deal with 
Sony Classics after just one screening. 
</P>
<P>
 With the highly anticipated "Hoop Dreams," a nearly three-hour documentary on 
four years in the lives of Chicago-area basketball players still to come, the 
most thoughtful and informative doc at the festival so far is "Freedom on My 
Mind," co-directed and co-produced by Connie Field and Marilyn Mulford. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of the activities of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee in rural Mississippi in the early 1960s, this spirited look at a 
spirited time evokes a struggle whose enormity we have largely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremely politically incorrect but often quite funny is "Clerks," a 
black-and-white dramatic look at a really bad day in the lives of two members 
of the dazed and confused generation, New Jersey division. Dante clerks at 
Quick Stop Groceries in Asbury Park, an establishment that makes a 7-Eleven 
look upscale, while buddy Randel works at a nearby video store so feeble he 
himself rents elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragged, anarchic and clearly too long, this gleefully raunchy series of 
sketches is a kind of Eric Bogosian meets "Slackers." Writer-director Kevin 
Smith doesn't handle his female characters very well, but his ear for the 
obscene banter of guys hanging out is impeccable. Equal parts funny and 
offensive, "Clerks" has the kind of cinematic energy that shows Sundance at its 
best.

STATE MUSEUM GROUP MAKES BOWERS ITS NEW HOME; RELOCATION: THE NONPROFIT SERVICE 
ORGANIZATION, PREVIOUSLY IN L.A., OFFERS SERVICES TO 225 INSTITUTIONS, 
INCLUDING MANY IN O.C. 
</P>

<P>
 The California Assn. of Museums, a nonprofit service organization founded in 
1979, has relocated to the Bowers Museum from the Natural History Museum in Los 
Angeles, where Bowers director Peter Keller used to be associate director. 
</P>
<P>
 CAM offers professional conferences, workshops, a legislative advocacy 
network, an annual salary survey and other services to some 225 California 
member institutions, including zoos, natural history museums and art museums. 
Members range from museums run entirely by volunteers to institutions with 
annual budgets of more than $1 million, according to executive coordinator Teri 
Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll said her goals include establishing a central data base of Orange County 
arts organization contacts and patrons, and urging the state Legislature to 
require "M" (for museum) signs near appropriate off-ramps of all major 
highways. CAM does not have a history of involvement in more controversial 
issues, such as censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll assumed her post last fall, at the same time the Natural History Museum 
announced that CAM's office space was needed for museum purposes. Then a 
resident of Tustin Ranch (she since has moved to Aliso Viejo), Knoll decided to 
relocate the association to Orange County. She called Keller, who had worked 
closely with CAM during his years in Los Angeles, and he agreed the Bowers 
would donate office space and utilities. CAM is otherwise independent of the 
museum, paying for all its own equipment and services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County members of CAM include the Laguna Art Museum, the Decorative 
Arts Study Center in San Juan Capistrano, the Fullerton Museum Center, the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton, the Museum of Anthropology at Cal 
State Fullerton, the Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine and the Huntington 
Beach Center for the Arts scheduled to open in the spring. The Newport Harbor 
Art Museum is reinstituting its lapsed membership, Knoll says. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll, 35, is a former special programs coordinator at the Craft and Folk Art 
Museum in Los Angeles, where she did educational outreach. She also has served 
as curatorial coordinator for the California Afro-American Museum in Los 
Angeles and has worked with the Art Brazil Society, which arranges exchanges 
between artists in Los Angeles and Sao Paulo.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 2 FREEWAY LANES MAY REOPEN SOON; 
TRANSPORTATION: STATE AND SANTA CLARITA OFFICIALS SEEK TO EASE BOTTLENECK OF 
VEHICLES HEADING INTO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Caltrans and Santa Clarita city officials said Tuesday that they plan to 
reopen two lanes of the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway heading into the San 
Fernando Valley for the first time since the earthquake either late this week 
or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled reopening is one of a series of immediately forthcoming changes 
that officials said are aimed at easing the freeway bottleneck for residents of 
the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. Many have faced four-hour or longer 
commutes to jobs in the Valley and Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the Antelope Valley Freeway, which has been closed southbound in 
Santa Clarita since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, calls for reopening the 
two truck lanes to the Golden State Freeway -- one for all traffic and the 
other for car pools, van pools and buses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state Department of Transportation crews were working Tuesday to 
re-stripe the northbound Golden State Freeway-to-Antelope Valley Freeway route 
to add a third lane to the two lanes already opened. The third lane would also 
be reserved for so-called high-occupancy vehicles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Connell, Caltrans deputy district director for Los Angeles 
operations, said the agency decided to implement high-occupancy segments on the 
northbound and southbound interchanges of the two freeways because of the heavy 
congestion and high level of such traffic through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the southbound freeway connection should be open "the latter part of 
this week or early next week, depending on the rain. The exact timing of it 
we're not positive, but that's what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 By using the southbound truck lanes of the Antelope Valley Freeway, traffic 
will bypass the regular elevated segment of the transition road that collapsed 
during the earthquake. A Los Angeles police motorcycle officer was killed 
shortly after the quake when he could not stop from plunging off the severed 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans and Santa Clarita officials said the changes to the two freeways 
should come on-line about the same time as Caltrans opens a bypass on the Old 
Road to resume north and south traffic flow on the Golden State Freeway through 
Santa Clarita. That, too, had been closed since Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Engineer Tony Nisich said various agencies have decided to 
reconfigure Sierra Highway heading into the San Fernando Valley at about the 
same time as the freeway lanes will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Highway will become three lanes southbound and one lane northbound 
instead of the four lanes southbound in effect since the quake.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SAN FERNANDO GETS LONG-AWAITED HELP; RECOVERY: 
OFFICIALS COMPLAIN IT TOOK AN EARTHQUAKE TO GET METROLINK STOP. AND IT TOOK 
ANOTHER WEEK TO GET A DISASTER CENTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Surveying the wreckage, including damage to 22% of his city's housing stock, 
San Fernando Mayor Dan Acuna recovered his sense of humor: 
</P>
<P>
 At least the city's long-awaited Metrolink station is open now, he said -- too 
bad it took an earthquake to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proud of their independence, residents of this 2.4-square-mile city 
often complain they are ignored by Los Angeles city and county, which surround 
them. If the idle station -- slated to open today to help ease the commuter 
crisis after a year of delays -- hinted at San Fernando's lack of clout, the 
earthquake hammered it home. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: It took a week of political string-pulling, including a visit 
from federal Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, before San 
Fernando got its own disaster assistance center, according to Acuna and others 
involved in the effort. The center opened Monday at 1245 San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando city officials say it also took until Monday for the city to 
borrow two building inspectors from Los Angeles County to help assess damage to 
about 835 structures. For most of that time, San Fernando got by with one 
licensed inspector for its population of 23,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just now got two inspectors from the county," City Administrator Mary 
Strenn said. "But prior to that, our requests for help have not been heeded too 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said he started pressuring federal 
officials on the evening after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told federal officials, 'Remember, this is not just the city of Los 
Angeles,' " Berman said Tuesday. "I told them, 'Please, tomorrow, bring them 
into this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, response to the disaster in San Fernando was homespun, 
Berman said. City Hall staffers pitched in, GTE donated a massive tent, and the 
Red Cross started serving food, Acuna said. About the only outside agency that 
responded quickly was the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, he said, 
which showed up to help the city's 34-officer Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our own people, I can't say enough," Acuna said. "Of course, as you go up the 
bureaucracy, you run into problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said his efforts paid off last Wednesday when HUD Secretary Cisneros 
and James Witt, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, toured the 
city and pledged to open the disaster center. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, when it hired five private inspectors, San Fernando had only 
one licensed building inspector, and as a desperate stopgap sent two community 
preservation officers to "condemn" the most obviously damaged structures until 
licensed inspectors could check them, said Howard Miura, the city's community 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
 The city now is considering emergency demolition of 30 structures and is 
trying to assess how many of the 835 damaged buildings will be habitable, Miura 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week of aftershocks contributed to about 60 water-main breaks, and residents 
continue to be warned to boil their water, said Strenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of Friday, we really thought we were in recovery mode," she said. "And 
then the aftershocks started." 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many breaks in water pipes along San Fernando Mission Boulevard 
and Kalisher Street that the city gave up patching the pipes and started 
replacing them instead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only half the city's industrial buildings have been inspected, and even fewer 
of its residential and commercial buildings, Strenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection problem has been complicated by a jittery population skeptical 
of official opinions about the safety of their homes, according to Strenn. Even 
though the inspectors say many of their homes are safe, about 450 people still 
are camped in San Fernando Recreation Park, beneath a massive tent erected by 
GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's partially human relations and partially inspections of the buildings," 
Strenn said. "One of the inspectors said he was surprised at the terror of the 
residents. He'd had to take people inside and show them the problems were 
cosmetic" -- damage that, however ugly, posed no threat to lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Strenn said the city should have enough reserve funding to support the relief 
effort, and will seek reimbursement from federal and state sources when the 
dust settles. She said no one is sure exactly what the cost will be to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also is struggling to keep some of the staff of the San Fernando 
Superior Court based in temporary offices inside the city. The courthouse was 
deemed unsound and most court functions will be moved to Van Nuys during 
repairs, which could take a year, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It honestly looks like someone set a bomb off," said Superior Court Judge 
Judith Ashmann, who supervises the building's 12 courtrooms. The San Fernando 
Municipal Courthouse survived and will continue operating.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE LOWS OF HIGH-PRESSURE JOB; SAFETY: 
FIREFIGHTERS KEEP 24-HOUR VIGILS TO MONITOR WATER PUMPED FROM HEALTHY TO 
QUAKE-DAMAGED MAINS. IT'S A LESSON IN CREATIVITY, BOREDOM AND DISCOMFORT.

 They dreamed of fighting flames and rescuing victims when they became 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a disaster strikes, everyone has a job to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's killer quake prompted Los Angeles Firefighters Terry Onishi and 
Martin Enriquez to work 24-hour shifts this week from their shiny red engine, 
monitoring the water pressure of a pair of fire hydrants at a Granada Hills 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine, which is parked at the intersection of Chatsworth Street and Petit 
Avenue, is one of 15 positioned throughout the San Fernando Valley that have 
been pumping pressurized water from healthy mains into quake-damaged 
low-pressure mains. 
</P>
<P>
 For firefighters like Onishi and Enriquez, monitoring the pressurizing 
technique, which was last employed in the 1971 Sylmar quake, has been a lesson 
in creativity, boredom and discomfort. They spent Monday night in a plastic 
tent erected in front of their engine. It was furnished with a television, a 
pair of cots, and a stash of food and bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of strange looks when people just see us sitting there, but it 
gets to the point where there's only so much you can do," Enriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The diesel-fueled engines have been running virtually nonstop since Wednesday 
morning, pumping water into a main that runs along Rinaldi Street and down 
Valley Circle Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 The 4-foot-wide main was among many that suffered breaks during the quake, 
leading to difficulties in fighting several quake-triggered fires. In the days 
following the 6.6-magnitude quake, water outages and low-water-pressure areas 
were "initially widespread," throughout the Valley, Battalion Chief Don 
Dahlstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressurizing technique and the magnitude of the operation "is very, very 
unusual," but was a necessary response to the devastating effects of last 
week's quake, Dahlstein said. At first, 22 engines were pumping water into 
damaged mains, but the operation has been scaled back as the mains have been 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 City firefighters also helped the Department of Water and Power spot breaks in 
mains by pumping water into the pipes and looking for leaks, the majority of 
which have been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters will continue to pump water into the Rinaldi Street main until 
the two remaining breaks are fixed, which they estimate will take up to three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30 water tankers from throughout Southern California have also been 
assigned to Valley fire stations to provide backup water supplies in case a 
fire erupts in a low-water-pressure area. 
</P>
<P>
 Onishi and Martinez said the toughest part of their assignment has been 
protecting the fire hose that has been carrying water across Chatsworth Street 
from being crushed by passing cars. Firefighters built wooden ramps over the 
hose, which they said ripped out the mufflers on several speeding cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't see the ramp until it's too late," Enriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge for firefighters has been battling the cold nights. While 
some firefighters have parked their motor homes near their engines to make the 
shifts endurable, others have had to survive with makeshift tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Onishi said the first two firefighters assigned to monitor the engine at 
Chatsworth and Petit were left on the corner with a pair of blankets. The two 
men were abruptly awakened at 3 a.m. when a sprinkler system activated on the 
lawn where they were sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "They froze," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that episode, firefighters brought cots, and Friday's shift erected the 
plastic tarp tent when rumors of rain began to circulate. A television was 
installed by Sunday, so that firefighters could catch the football playoffs 
that day.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; HARDWARE STORE STILL A BASTION FOR JITTERY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The wooden bin of peanuts is right where it always was in Cooper's Hardware 
Store, beside the sign asking patrons to please throw the shells on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The peanuts were there at 7 a.m. last Monday too -- a sign that even after the 
earthquake, some institutions remained. Customers who streamed into the 
darkened store on Foothill Boulevard in search of emergency supplies nibbled 
them as they shopped, tossed the shells, then paid what they could. Many just 
promised to pay some time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just writing up tickets, because we didn't have any generators yet," 
said David Cooper, the 26-year-old grandson of store founders Eileen and Ray 
Cooper. "We just handed out flashlights, and they would hand them back when 
they found what they needed." 
</P>
<P>
 In a community that all but burst at the seams in the 1980s condominium craze, 
this 45-year-old hardware store is an institution. And like the rest of Sylmar, 
it is shaken but not fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Harried building inspectors still have not sorted out the damage statistics by 
geographical areas, so it is impossible to say how badly Sylmar was hit, said 
Los Angeles' principal inspector, David Keim. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents just use the 1971 quake as a benchmark. Damage wasn't as widespread, 
but sporadic pockets look like they did 23 years ago. Entire blocks of rural 
homes and horse barns seem almost unharmed. On still other blocks, buildings 
and houses buckled. An entire seven-building complex has been fenced off, 
festooned with red "unsafe" tags. 
</P>
<P>
 Callous observers might call Sylmar a two-time loser. But it is bouncing back, 
longtime residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a lot of calls, a lot of people that want to volunteer," said 
Frank Jacobs, president of the Sylmar Chamber of Commerce, and another two-time 
survivor. "Neighbors are talking to neighbors, people come by and wave." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1971 quake, Sylmar felt stranded, Jacobs said. The community had no 
water for a month. Now, there not only is water but volunteers who bring it to 
your car at the Sylmar High School disaster center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cooper says the quake shook loose some of the traits Sylmar boasted in 
its more rural days, when the store's staple was horse feed. "It's surprising 
how honest everyone was," he said. "They just came back and paid," added his 
mother, Sue Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, they are still coming in, and Cooper's is still scrambling to 
find what they want. No one has had time to sort the bolts that crashed across 
the aisles, or clean up the splattered paint and varnish. But the peanuts -- 
they're still in the same place. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; LIFE SLOWLY IS RETURNING TO NORMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most people who live and work in Woodland Hills, life this week returned 
to some semblance of order after the earthquake's upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-day delay, classes at Pierce College began Monday. The Pierce 
College gymnasiums, however, were declared unusable. Physical education classes 
are being held outside when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment on Tuesday was down 8% Across the street from Pierce, the West 
Valley Occupational Center remained closed this week because of structural 
damage, as did Calabash Street Elementary School, El Camino Real High School, 
Hale Middle School and Parkman Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Many major employers in the Woodland Hills and Warner Center areas -- 
including Health Net, Rocketdyne and 20th Century Insurance Co. -- were up and 
running at near-capacity after several days of cleanup and repair work. 20th 
Century issued a memo telling employees that casual dress "is appropriate" for 
employees in damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Center Marriott hotel -- which was evacuated shortly after the 
quake -- reopened Sunday night. The Hilton Hotel in Warner Center also was 
evacuated. It reopened Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick will propose temporarily lifting some parking 
restrictions in the Warner Center area because several parking structures have 
been deemed unsafe, said Jackie Keene, a field deputy for Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Many smaller businesses along Ventura and Topanga Canyon boulevards were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days after the 6.6-magnitude quake, Keene said, residents of the area 
near El Camino Real High and other neighborhoods were still without running 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization has rescheduled a planned meeting 
with Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams from Thursday to Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills, unlike the ravaged Kaiser facility in 
Granada Hills, was mostly back to normal this week after using emergency power 
and reserve water supplies to treat a crush of patients, said James L. Breeden, 
hospital administrator. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; AREA'S DAMAGE CALLED A WELL-KEPT SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although no community along Ventura Boulevard's 17-mile stretch through the 
San Fernando Valley escaped serious damage in last week's temblor, few were hit 
as hard as Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Fire-gutted restaurants and stores dot the trendy community known as the 
"Melrose of the Valley," serving as both a reminder of the disaster behind and 
the recovery ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shopping malls remain closed this week, including Fashion Square, 
where one floor of a Bullock's department store collapsed onto the floor below. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sherman Oaks is devastated," said Jeff Brain, a board member and past 
president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. "We've got burned-out 
buildings, displaced tenants and not a whole lot of places to move them. It's 
going to take awhile to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were particularly hard-hit; dozens of "red-tagged" or condemned 
apartment buildings line residential streets along the busy thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best-kept secret in the world, how hard we've been hit in Studio 
City and Sherman Oaks," City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said in a recent 
interview as he watched rescue workers search for a quake victim buried in the 
rubble of what was once a majestic home in nearby Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said that while damage to apartment buildings in his district was 
not so dramatic as that at the collapsed Northridge Meadows apartments on 
Reseda Boulevard in Northridge, the destruction in Sherman Oaks would create 
many of the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a mass evacuation going on in Sherman Oaks," he said. "Whether a 
building falls down or is condemned because of a crack in the wall, people are 
going to be displaced." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a house collapse in Sherman Oaks that claimed the quake's youngest 
victim. Five-year-old Amy Tyre-Vigil was found buried in a pile of stucco, tile 
and glass after her home slid down a hillside in the violent temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's safe to say that Sherman Oaks will never be the same," said 
Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "With the 
economy, inadequate earthquake insurance and a lack of financing, it could be 
years before these areas are rebuilt." SCOTT GLOVER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; RESIDENTS PROTECTED STATION FROM LOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the quake shattered the windows of the North Hills police substation on 
Sepulveda Boulevard, neighbors rushed over to protect the computers and video 
equipment from looters. They guarded the tiny office -- where police run youth 
programs -- for nearly seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout North Hills, people joined together to prevent a natural disaster 
from becoming a neighborhood full of catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors and police say the shaker's damage to North Hills has not 
been as severe as it was in other communities. As of Saturday, 39 structures 
had been declared unsafe and 77 had been designated for limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Adminstration and the Small Business 
Administration have set up a joint registration center, open from 3 to 10 p.m., 
at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration hospital on Plummer Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the most dramatic quake scenes was at the V.A. hospital. Hardest hit was 
the building that houses the hospital's inpatient services, including intensive 
care and emergency rooms and X-ray labs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake hit, the building split several inches in two locations, but 
did not collapse. In the darkness, doctors and nurses rushed to evacuate about 
230 patients, many on respirators and intravenous tubes. About 100 patients 
were evacuated from another building. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is providing outpatient services through two V.A. mobile health 
clinics sent from Arizona and Washington. All inpatients are being referred to 
V.A. medical facilities in Loma Linda, West Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches in North Hills continued to provide charitable and spiritual work. At 
the Calvary Chapel on Parthenia Street, whose cracked facade sported a yellow 
inspection tag denoting that entry was limited, volunteers passed out food and 
water to quake victims. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 'DRESS-REHEARSAL' FOR THE BIG ONE OFFERED 
INVALUABLE LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighter Patrick Killian of the Los Angeles City Fire Department's Disaster 
Preparedness Division is a specialist in earthquake preparedness. In his 
Sherman Oaks office late last week, he discussed lessons of the Northridge 
quake with Times correspondent Rebecca Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. Did the experiences of this earthquake reaffirm everything we 
believed about how to prepare for a quake and what to do during one?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer. It does definitely reaffirm. You have to be prepared, as you can see 
with the water problems we're having right now. You need to have a supply of 
water at your house, and you need to rotate it so that's it's good drinkable 
water. Things like that. Do you have an alternate route to get in and out of 
places that you want to go? I mean, obviously, the San Fernando Valley was 
pretty much cut off for a time. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. Has what we should do during an earthquake -- heading for a hallway, 
staying put inside -- has anything changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. We noticed with the collapsed apartment buildings that some beds, 
because they would compress, left a gap between where the ceiling collapsed and 
the ground. We have told people in the past to stay on the bed to keep from 
being thrown hither and yon. We will now suggest that they roll off their bed 
and be right next to their bed during an earthquake. We don't know how much 
difference it will make. It's all still too preliminary, too early right now. 
But we will suggest that people roll off their bed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We're always hearing you shouldn't run outside during a quake. Yet a lot of 
those killed last week died when their buildings collapsed. Isn't it prudent to 
get out of a building?  
</P>
<P>
 A. No, it is not. It is worse to run outside, because a lot more things are 
going to fall on top of you -- roof tiles, chimney bricks, that sort of thing. 
So even though those buildings collapsed, in general people running outside are 
more at risk of injury or death. You'd be surprised at how many people think, 
"I've got to get out of this building because it's going to collapse." But in 
most cases it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What have you learned in terms of preparing? Is there anything that you 
hadn't thought of, anything new?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Probably the length of time people should prepare for. We tell people 
basically to plan on camping for a week. If they can camp for a week, if they 
are totally self-sufficient for a week, we should be able to get supplies into 
the area via the Red Cross. I would feel very comfortable saying two weeks now. 
Because this was a moderate earthquake. This wasn't "The Big One." And look 
what it's done to this city. It has overwhelmed our resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How is The Big One going to be different from the Northridge earthquake in 
terms of simply surviving and then recovering?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It will depend a lot of the type of waves that hit. There are different 
types of earthquake waves that will help determine the destruction of that 
particular quake. This one was pretty much centered in the Valley, although 
downtown and West L. A. had pockets of devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big One is going to be farther reaching. It's going to affect Riverside 
County, and they're here helping us this week. It's going to affect San 
Bernardino. It's going to affect L. A. County as a whole. They won't be able to 
drop what they're doing and come help us, because they're going to be having 
their own problems. Things will move slower, because everybody will have their 
own situation, their own areas to deal with. We will be more responsible for 
our area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is the disaster preparedness office getting more calls than usual in the 
few days after the earthquake?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Oh, yes. The calls range from, "How do I shut off my gas?" to "When can we 
have you out for a one-hour slide show and lecture on earthquake preparedness?" 
</P>
<P>
 One thing you have to realize is that only 18% of the population even cares 
about The Big One. Only 18% of the population is willing to do anything to get 
prepared for the major earthquake. Right now it seems we're going to be flooded 
with calls, and our phone's going to be ringing off the hook. But in a few 
months it will die down and people will get complacent again. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can't do that. They can't afford to do that. This was the wake-up 
call. Wake up and get ready, because it's going to happen. You magnify this 6.6 
times anywhere between 10 and 100 and make it citywide, and definitely this 
type of quake would have been a lot worse. The San Andreas, when it ruptures, 
they're guesstimating will be anywhere between an 8.0 and a 9.2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So this is almost a dress rehearsal, just a warm-up?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, very much so. One thing that it impressed upon me is that people need 
to be prepared in all aspects of their life. Meaning not just prepared for The 
Big One, not just prepared with their food and water and medical supplies and 
things like that, but do they have their information? Do they have their 
insurance forms where they can get to them readily? 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have all their personal items accounted for? Do they have videos or 
pictures of their personal items, you know, for after the quake and the 
devastation and they have to turn these in to their insurance people? 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have out-of-state contact? You can't call into the devastated area, 
you have to have your out-of-state contacts set up. And if you don't, no one is 
going to know how you're doing. You're going to be that much more isolated from 
everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have a next-of-kin-type of notification made out? If you get killed, do 
you have plans for what you do with your children? You don't want to think 
about that. It's doom and gloom. But that's the reality. The percentage of 
people who got killed in this one was extremely low. Even the number of deaths 
they're guesstimating in The Big One is going to still be a low percentage. A 
high number but a very low percentage compared to the number of people it's 
going to affect. But still, you could be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What else should people do to prepare?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Water, food, first aid, an alternate place to live. That's another thing to 
think about. Would these people be in a park now if they had already thought 
about having an alternate place to live outside of their devastated area, miles 
away? Do you have someone in Northern California you could stay with? Someone 
in Nevada? Arizona? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Some parents I spoke to said the idea of staying in bed, crouching in a 
doorway, didn't even occur to them during the earthquake. They were going 
straight to their children. One woman died trying to reach her child. What do 
you say to parents?  
</P>
<P>
 A. In our presentations, we tell them that that's exactly what they're going 
to do. That most people, the first thought in their mind is, "Is this The Big 
One? Is it going to get bigger?" That's what they're thinking. And we reinforce 
in our presentation that they have to take an action. The minute the ground 
starts shaking, don't sit there and say, "Is this The Big One?" Take your 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's go for your kids, then go for your kids. We can't tell someone who's 
got a 2-year-old, it's ridiculous for me to sit here and say, "No no, no, don't 
go for your kid. Protect yourself and go for your kids later." They're not 
going to do that. If they take that action immediately when the ground starts 
shaking, then they've got a better chance of getting to their child. 
</P>
<P>
 And then have a plan of action once you get to your child. Are you going to 
just throw your body over your child or are you going to get down and lie by 
the bed? If you sit there and wait to see if it's The Big One, you're going to 
become a casualty, as opposed to assisting somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You mentioned that about 18% of the population bother to prepare for an 
earthquake. Do you think that percentage will rise permanently after this or 
will it be temporary?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think it will rise, and then we'll see it peak out and level off and go 
down again. If The Big One doesn't happen for five years, I think we'll be back 
down to the 18%. People will put all these supplies away. They will have used 
them in their house, they won't have rotated them and they will have gone 
stale. They'll become complacent again. And it will be back down to where we're 
at now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Doesn't that frustrate the heck out of you, doing what you do?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's frustrating when we go out to a presentation when we know 5,000 
notices have been sent out to people and we're giving a presentation in a 
school and only 100 people show up or only 40 people show up. Or any school 
where they've got 300 or 400 families and only 10 or 15 people show up. This is 
information that is potentially going to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that people don't care. It's that a lot of people don't want to think 
about it because it's a doom-and-gloom-type of subject. And I think human 
nature is basically lazy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Now that you've got their attention, what would you say to those people?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Get prepared. Take notice. Don't look at these collapsed apartments and the 
(55) people who've passed away and say, "It's no use; why get prepared?" 
Because that is a very low percentage. The percentage is very low of people who 
are going to die. And chances are you're going to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question is how are you going to live? . . . You're going to be on 
your own for a period of time. You won't have the Fire Department, you won't 
have the Police Department, you won't call 911 and get an ambulance there. You 
have to be able to take care of yourself. And you are going to live, probably, 
so be prepared.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLOSURE OF CITY HALL COMES AS A SURPRISE; QUAKE 
REPAIR: DAMAGE TO THE SANTA CLARITA GOVERNMENT BUILDING IS WORSE THAN THOUGHT. 
EMPLOYEES AND TENANTS WILL BE KEPT OUT FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Hall will remain closed for 60 to 90 days to allow work crews to shore up 
columns in the earthquake-battered building. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that it will cost $3 million to restore the three-story 
structure, triple the initial projection. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Tuesday to close City Hall came as a surprise to city employees 
and building tenants, who had expected to begin working out of the Valencia 
Boulevard site this week. They are being allowed limited access to the building 
during the next few days to remove belongings and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors discovered additional damage to City Hall on Friday when they tore 
open the building's main columns and found that the mechanisms that allow the 
structure to absorb earthquake tremors were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is structurally sound, but has only half of the stability it 
originally did to withstand an earthquake, according to Jesse Juarros, city 
general services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to fall on anybody," said Juarros, "but we want to make it 
where it is seismically sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced seismic strength will cause the building to rock more during a 
temblor and cause more damage to items inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the safety issue, city officials don't want contractors to have 
to work around tenants, which would slow repair efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarros said it will cost about $3 million to repair the building and another 
$1 million to replace furniture and fixtures inside.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita purchased City Hall two years ago for about $11.5 million. The 7 
1/2-year-old building has 72,000 square feet of space and houses most city 
administrative offices and 18 private tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 City offices that normally operate out of City Hall have been relocated to 
temporary buildings on the site's east parking lot. In the days following the 
Northridge earthquake, they were operating out of tents in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Caravalho predicted few services will be cut back because 
the staff will be working out of portable offices. Some non-essential city 
services, such as registering for adult recreation programs, have been 
temporarily postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts are under way to find more permanent structures for city departments 
for the next 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Also searching for available office space are the 18 private tenants. They 
include the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce, Valencia National Bank 
and a variety of other professional offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants praised city officials for keeping them informed of the fate of their 
offices, but some say it will be a major problem for them to relocate. Santa 
Clarita stopped charging rent after the Jan. 17 earthquake, losing about $2,000 
per day in income. 
</P>
<P>
 One business that will have trouble moving is the office of dentist Alexander 
Villar. Dental facilities require special plumbing and careful moving of 
delicate machinery, according to office manager Rhonda Villar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult because we have major equipment," said Villar. "We can't 
just operate without that equipment. It's not just like picking up your 
paperwork and moving."  
</P>
<P>
 Villar hopes to find another dental office in Santa Clarita that will be 
willing to share space while repair work goes on at City Hall. She said the 
dental practice will definitely return to City Hall when repairs are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall was not the only building unable to return to its normal routine 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosedell Elementary School, in the Saugus Union School District, will remain 
closed until further notice as crews attempt to remove asbestos from one wing 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Revised estimates by Santa Clarita indicate $162.3 million in damage from the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. The figure does not include damage to post offices or 
libraries.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ANTELOPE, SANTA CLARITA VALLEY LEADERS SHARE 
RELIEF PROPOSALS 
</P>

 Reeling from the economic aftershocks of last week's earthquake, civic leaders 
from the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys met Tuesday to trade ideas on how 
to unclog transportation routes and help local commuters hang onto their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster, Palmdale and Santa Clarita were cut off from Los Angeles when the 
quake damaged the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, the two main roads 
used by thousands of commuters and truck drivers in the north county. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford, who chaired the meeting in Palmdale City Hall, 
said it was important for the cities and local business leaders to share their 
relief proposals. Among the suggestions raised at the meeting were redirecting 
trucks away from the damaged freeways, supporting new commuter routes and 
setting up new telecommuting centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point here is that as a region, it's good for us to brainstorm," 
Ledford said. "Let's plan where we want to go from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Because full repairs to the Antelope Valley Freeway may take a year to 
complete, some local leaders urged the cities to seek funds to widen or improve 
other roads leading to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be looking at a year of gridlock through that bottleneck," said 
Lancaster Mayor Arnie Rodio. "It's not good enough to sit here and wait for 
that freeway to be put back together." 
</P>
<P>
 The alternate routes in and out of the Antelope Valley that need improvement 
include California 138 between Palmdale and San Bernardino County, and Angeles 
Crest Highway, a winding road through the San Gabriel Mountains, Rodio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The civic leaders praised the prompt establishment of Metrolink commuter train 
service to Palmdale and Lancaster. But several said the steep ticket price -- 
$208 for a monthly pass -- poses a hardship for many local commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep commuters off the trains and highways altogether, city and county 
officials said they are trying to set up new telecommuting centers, where Los 
Angeles area workers could use computers and telephone lines to do their jobs 
from a desk in the Antelope Valley.

MAN KILLED IN FIERY CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man driving a stolen car ran a traffic light Tuesday, lost control and 
smashed into a parked car that caught fire and killed the occupant, the Los 
Angeles Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters who arrived at the crash scene at 5:45 p.m. did not know there 
was anyone in the car until they extinguished the fire, said Police Sgt. Ron 
Ryan of the Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the stolen car, whose identity was not available, was treated 
for chest cuts at North Hollywood Medical Center, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred near the corner of Lankershim Boulevard and Hesby 
Street, near the dead man's home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver will probably be charged with felony manslaughter, Ryan said.

FIRED BLACK OFFICER ALLEGES PREJUDICE IN LAWSUIT AGAINST LAPD; COURTS: BRIAN K. 
POWELL CONTENDS HE WAS HARASSED BY VALLEY SUPERVISORS AND WAS THE TARGET OF 
RACIAL REMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former police officer has sued the Los Angeles Police Department in federal 
court, charging that he was hit with trumped-up charges and fired because of 
institutional prejudice against African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sgt. Brian K. Powell said police supervisors in the San Fernando Valley 
harassed him, made racial remarks and even ordered him put under surveillance 
in an attempt to find enough "false or exaggerated" evidence against him to 
force him from the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal lawsuit, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court, contends that the 
department violated Powell's civil rights to equal opportunity and to be free 
of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was humiliated, embarrassed, dehumanized and degraded," Powell said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 His West Valley Division supervisors and officers alike were overtly hostile 
to him, he said, second-guessing his judgment in the field and in the station, 
and were openly bitter that he had been promoted to sergeant in less than six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under departmental policy, the Police Department does not comment on lawsuits 
involving personnel matters, Police Lt. John Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a Dec. 3 report recommending Powell's termination, a police 
disciplinary panel said it had decided unanimously to fire Powell because of 
his "overall performance" and his lack of "commitment to the job, and 
willingness to be responsive to supervisory review." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, 32, who was awarded the department's highest honor -- a Medal of Valor 
-- was suspended for several violations of department policy and then 
terminated last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was accused of a number of alleged misdeeds, the most serious of which 
included wearing a department uniform while working an off-duty job, misusing a 
department computer on several occasions in August, 1992, and knowingly 
submitting a falsified "quality service audit" -- a report on how an officer 
who worked for him handled a routine radio call. The audits are a tool the 
Police Department uses to evaluate police interaction with the public by 
interviewing those who had contact with an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also was found guilty of checking department computers for confidential 
information about two acquaintances, according to the board of rights report on 
Powell's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the board of rights report, one supervisor testified that Powell "could not 
function as a supervisor because of the character flaw of a basic lack of 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, in court documents and an interview, contended he was forced to adhere 
to a higher professional standard than white officers, and that he did nothing 
to deserve being fired. He said he plans to seek his old job back in a separate 
lawsuit to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the supervisor who questioned his character was white, as were all the 
other police supervisors who initiated disciplinary actions against him. All of 
those complaints, he said, "were falsely lodged due to an intense personal 
dislike for plaintiff individually and black officers in general." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Powell said he was not only subjected to unequal terms and 
conditions of employment, but that he was punished more severely than white 
officers. Whenever a complaint against him failed to get him fired, he 
contends, another one would immediately be initiated, for the purpose of 
blocking any promotion for him until he could be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell contends that he has endured "humiliations and indignities" that have 
caused him to suffer physical, mental and emotional pain, as well as lost 
income and benefits. Powell and his lawyer said they have not specified 
monetary damages in the lawsuit, but said the amount to be asked eventually 
would be significant because the department's action derailed his lifelong 
ambition to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about a patrolman working a street beat," said Powell's 
lawyer, Robert M. Ross. "We're talking about a sergeant with nine years on the 
force and a Medal of Valor." 
</P>
<P>
 Police records show that Powell had other disciplinary problems. He was 
suspended for 129 days in July, 1993, for spending unauthorized time at his 
residence, without noting that on his official log. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said police can take lunch breaks wherever they want within their area 
of patrol. "But even if you live within the division, you can't spend time at 
home and put down on a log you were someplace else," Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said such a lengthy suspension for unauthorized trips to his house was 
an indication of the prejudice he was facing. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also took his complaints to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. In an affidavit, dated Sept. 20, 1993, to the EEOC, Powell said: "I 
believe that I was suspended because of my race," and that a supervising 
lieutenant told him "blacks should not be in supervision" and that he was "out 
to get" Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 The former sergeant also swore in the document that the lieutenant ordered 
other officers to follow him and monitor his activities, and that those 
officers saw him go to his residence while on duty. But Powell said he was 
within his rights to go home, since he lives within his police jurisdiction, 
and that he was only going home to use the bathroom.

 Two years ago, Santa Monica adopted what is believed to be the nation's first 
sweeping program to alleviate homelessness. But today, the city's homelessness 
problem is as bad as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica residents, along with millions who visit the city each year, 
still encounter homeless-related problems rivaling those of major metropolitan 
downtown areas across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 People are accosted at bank money machines by beggars offering to wash car 
windows. Panhandling is rampant in commercial areas, with some brazen enough to 
snatch food from the plates of restaurant patrons eating outdoors. Residents 
shy away from city parks because large enclaves of transients have turned these 
public spaces into campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as bad or worse than ever," said Herb Katz, who voted for the plan two 
years ago when he was a member of the City Council. "The public is furious." 
</P>
<P>
 And scared. "People feel threatened," said Santa Monica Police Chief James T. 
Butts. "The public won't put up with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the continuing frustration at what the homeless themselves must 
endure -- the filth, the hunger, the lack of medical and psychiatric attention 
-- all amid relative affluence. Such conditions prompt some to recommend more 
help, rather than a crackdown. Indeed, many city residents got a firsthand look 
at homelessness after the Jan. 17 earthquake, which drove hundreds of 
apartment- and home-dwellers to emergency shelters and makeshift encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Elizabeth Noble Lee, who was staying in a Red Cross shelter after the 
quake left her Topanga Canyon home without electricity, water or gas: "Being 
here, I realize how close I could have come. It's a rude awakening." 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluating Santa Monica's homeless policies is important these days: Other 
cities from New York to Seattle are launching major homeless programs of their 
own. Santa Monica's plan, developed by a citizens Task Force on Homelessness 
after months of toil, is viewed by many officials elsewhere as a test case for 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, approved in December, 1991, is part carrot and part stick. Under 
the program, the city has moved to speed construction of homeless housing, 
moved the homeless feeding program off the City Hall lawn and prohibited 
encampment in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the plan was hailed by City Council members as a way to forge an 
alliance between those who wanted to crack down on the homeless and those who 
wanted the city to embrace them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sharp departure from the city's previous philosophy, which frowned on 
restrictions that might make homeless people feel unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica has not made much headway. Signs of the large homeless population 
abound. 
</P>
<P>
 At Memorial Park, carts and boxes of belongings line the fence. People bed 
down on the tennis courts, in adjacent alleys and on the grass. The fences on 
the tennis courts at Lincoln Park serve as laundry lines and makeshift 
headboards for folks who lean their gear or themselves up against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of construction, Palisades Park has had a recent reprieve from its 
former notoriety as a homeless encampment with an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally found a way to clean up Palisades Park," quipped one Westsider. 
"They fenced it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of visible progress after two years of work is partly a result of the 
city's philosophy of homeless services. That philosophy favors focusing social 
service resources on long-term solutions for a few people rather than shelter 
for many.  
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, enough emergency help -- clothes, meals and assistance 
getting general relief money -- to maintain people, albeit barely, on the 
streets. It's also enough, however, to keep the homeless coming to town.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Jalili says Santa Monica's uphill struggle with homelessness 
shows that a small city, no matter how dedicated, can't solve a regional 
problem, especially when other locales aren't doing their fair share. That 
regional problem has clearly worsened in the past year because of the lingering 
recession and cuts in welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the homeless task force never pretended that its recommendations 
would cause the homeless to go away, says Vivian Rothstein, a task force 
member. The goal, rather, was to gain community consensus on some approaches to 
the homeless problem, ending a political battle royal over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But others contend the liberal forces that control the City Council may lack 
the political will to make life more difficult for homeless people who refuse 
to adhere to tougher standards of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the evidence cited by such critics: 
</P>
<P>
 * To protest the passage of a law to close down the parks after midnight, 
about 40 homeless people last summer lived on the City Hall lawn for months, 
blocking the entrance and urinating under the office windows of city workers. 
The city allowed them to remain on the lawn so as not to violate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a televised public hearing on the parks measure, Mayor Judy Abdo lashed 
out at Butts, demanding to know why a uniformed police officer had appeared in 
the doorway at the back of the council chambers. She said she was afraid his 
presence would upset the homeless people in the audience "while we were doing 
something difficult for (them) to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about tough love," City Councilwoman Asha Greenberg said. "We've 
had all the love part, but none of the tough part." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people are no happier. They agree that the situation is worse than 
ever, but not because the city is being too kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting worse because we're getting more police harassment," said 
Michael Flenoy, who lives in Memorial Park, where he played Little League 
baseball several decades ago. "Where you want us to go? They run us out of 
everywhere we go." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is accusing the city of not trying to address homelessness. Under the 
new zoning rules allowing speedier construction of homeless shelters, plans are 
in the works for three separate projects -- mostly for individuals and families 
in transition from homelessness to permanent housing. SHWASHLOCK, a program to 
provide showers, lockers and coin-operated laundry vouchers for the homeless, 
got under way last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who say the homeless problem is worse than ever point to one 
welcome change under the city's homeless program -- removing the trademark 
homeless feeding service from the City Hall lawn. It was moved to three indoor 
locations and linked with other homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks are posing the toughest challenge to the city's homeless policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City staffer Julie Rusk acknowledged that the situation in the parks has 
gotten so out of kilter that maintenance workers are afraid to pick up the 
trash near homeless people for fear they would be accused of violating their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is about to change, Rusk said. Two years into the plan, she said, 
"We're just starting to work on the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already passed three laws affecting the use of parks by homeless 
people. But enforcement has proved difficult. Two of the measures -- one that 
prohibits encampments in public places and another that requires permits for 
large groups that want to use the parks -- have been challenged in court.

O.C. BOARD CONDEMNS RECORDER BRANCH; GOVERNMENT: SUPERVISORS ASK GRAND JURY TO 
DETERMINE IF HE CAN BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE FOR ALLEGED MISCONDUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an unprecedented move, the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday 
publicly condemned Recorder Lee A. Branch and asked the grand jury to determine 
whether allegations of misconduct warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-barreled decision was met by quiet applause from more than a dozen 
employees of the recorder's office, one of whom likened Branch's treatment of 
workers to "child abuse" in testimony to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Maury Evans said his office would provide assistance 
to the grand jury if asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury is an independent body and will act as they deem appropriate," 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the jury's involvement is necessary since 
Branch has refused to resign his obscure elected office although a county 
personnel investigation has found that he has mismanaged his office and 
sexually harassed employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The county investigation, which was made public last week, also found that 
Branch's office romance with and favored treatment of supervisor Nancy L. Smith 
created such a hostile work environment that nine employees sought medical 
treatment for stress and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 At home Tuesday afternoon, Branch declined comment on the board's actions. But 
Smith, who answered Branch's home phone, called the decisions "unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its unanimous action, the board recommended that Smith be 
transferred from the recorder's office to another county job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just horrified by this entire thing," she said. "I don't take this as a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has said that the investigation of his office has been part of a 
political "hidden agenda" initiated by the board to remove him from office to 
make room for a favored candidate, County Clerk Gary Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, both Steiner and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez referred to the 
employees' gripping testimony to the board in explaining their vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "No report that I have ever read conveys the power contained in the statements 
of these employees," Steiner said. "They have taken this matter to a new level 
of seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime government observers said they could not remember any other time when 
the board had publicly condemned another elected official or sought an 
official's removal from office through the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board is justified in its action," said William Mitchell, 
director of Common Cause in Orange County. "There appears to be gross 
mismanagement in every facet of the recorder's job. I think the supervisors are 
doing the only thing they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Before they voted, the supervisors heard testimony from three recorder 
employees who came to the Hall of Administration on Tuesday morning on their 
work breaks to detail "years" of office turmoil. They were accompanied by 
colleagues including Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff of the recorder's office have been like abused children," said 
12-year employee Cyndi Viall, "afraid to tell the parents of their abuse and 
suffering because of intimidation and fear of retaliation by their abuser. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been degraded, harassed, prejudged, lied to, slandered and forced to 
work in a mentally and physically unhealthy environment," Viall said. "I pity 
Mr. Branch for not acknowledging his obligation to the voters, the county 
family and his position by respecting their needs and resigning." 
</P>
<P>
 Said employee Corinna Rubio: "During the years, I have been subjected to 
discrimination, harassment, abuse and ridicule from (Nancy Smith). 
Astonishingly, Mr. Branch has allowed the continuance of this harassment 
throughout the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said the recorder's apparent conduct presented "an 
incredible situation" for the board since supervisors have limited authority 
over the independently elected public official. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old Branch has held the office since 1978 and has vowed to seek 
reelection in June despite the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of pressing for his being voted out of office, supervisors said the 
grand jury inquiry is the strongest action they can recommend. Board members 
also said a grand jury format could offer a safeguard for employees who are 
fearful of possible retaliation for their testimony to the board Tuesday, and 
for county personnel investigators who took part in the three-month 
investigation of Branch's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the investigation, county affirmative action officials found -- among other 
things -- that there was ample evidence to support allegations that Branch had 
made lewd comments to a female employee suggesting a sexual liaison, made 
sexual advances to another female employee during a Christmas party and allowed 
general office operations to be affected by his relationship with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees also complained to investigators that Smith "wielded tremendous 
power" in the office and used that authority to intimidate the employees. 
Assistant Recorder Murphy told investigators she was barred by Branch from 
evaluating Smith's work performance for about nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not seen anything like this in any organization I have been a part 
of," Stanton said Tuesday. "If there is any effort to retaliate against any of 
the employees for their testimony, they should feel free to speak to any one of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the board's censure, Steiner said the county would not provide 
Branch legal defense in the event he is the subject of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said Branch's behavior is unacceptable but should not surprise 
officials who have been familiar with management troubles in the recorder's 
office, which began in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez referred to a December, 1987, memo to Branch from then-County 
Administrative Officer Larry Parrish who sharply denounced the recorder's 
handling of an office problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Parrish wrote: "By now, I should not be surprised by your 
(Branch's) unlimited capacity to miss the point of a conversation, form an 
idiotic opinion and choose a course of action whose only effect is to reinforce 
the widely held view that you are incompetent."

WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE DISNEY'S NEW ATTRACTION: A FUN LINE; AMUSEMENT: STATE-OF-ART 
QUEUE OUTSIDE ROGER RABBIT RIDE AIMS TO KEEP PATRONS LAUGHING INSTEAD OF 
FUMING. 
</P>

<P>
 At Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin in Disneyland, you can expect to stand in line 
20 minutes for a four-minute ride. 
</P>
<P>
 You might not notice the wait, though. The attraction, which opens officially 
today, is designed to keep people entertained from the moment they queue up. 
</P>
<P>
 The line winds past a manhole where sinister voices can be heard from below 
plotting Roger Rabbit's demise. A brutish-sounding bouncer at the door of a 
speak-easy orders visitors, "Beat it!" And a pressure cooker spews out a brew 
that supposedly dissolves cartoon characters on contact. Scrambling to draw 
customers as the recession wears on, theme parks are putting new emphasis on 
the least popular part of their attractions: the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer do you just stand in line and look at your neighbor," said George 
Ladyman, vice president in charge of design for the Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. 
in Parsippany, N.J. "Now you have the sights, the sounds and the smells, a 
total sensory experience from the moment you get in line." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion isn't new. Walter Knott, seeing crowds waiting for seats in his 
wife's fried chicken restaurant in Buena Park in the 1940s, hauled some 
shanties in from the desert for patrons to explore while they waited. The 
resulting "ghost town" became Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 And theme parks are hardly alone in their concern about queues. A variety of 
service industries over the years have tried to take the wait out of waiting as 
a way of generating consumer appreciation and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants and banks have experimented with freebies if service is not 
completed within a specified period. Some supermarkets promote their policy of 
opening a new checkout line whenever customers are standing more than three or 
four deep at the cash registers. Other businesses where customers have to wait, 
including some post offices, have contracted for wall displays that print the 
latest news and sports in a continuous scroll, a service called Silent Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The stagnant economy has forced businesses, especially in the service sector, 
to pay more attention to repeat customers, and few industries are doing so as 
ferociously as amusement parks. In the fun business, few things are more of a 
drag for patrons than being at the end of a long line. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 Harvard Business School study titled "The Psychology of Waiting Lines" 
found that slow service can do more than ruin a customer's day. "The bitter 
taste of how long it took to get attention pollutes the overall judgments that 
we make about the quality of service," the study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. is widely regarded as the leader in the art of queuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are unsurpassed," said Richard Larson, a Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology professor who has studied queuing for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have complained to me that they are so successful at this," he said of 
Disney, "that on off days they can't move people through the queue channel fast 
enough because they are entertained in line." 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, Roger Rabbit is considered a masterpiece of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a 1987 movie that starred Bob Hoskins interacting with a bevy of 
animated characters, the ride is a Disneyland version of a carnival fun house. 
Patrons drive individual taxicabs through a pie-in-your-face cartoon land. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the few major rides in the park's new Mickey's Toontown, Roger 
Rabbit is expected to be a big hit -- and that means long lines. So Disney 
engineers created an elaborate "pre-show" -- their term for activities to kill 
time while waiting for the main attraction -- to keep the anticipated crowds 
entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are going to have a wait. So how can we make that wait time as 
enjoyable as possible?" asked Norman Doerges, executive vice president of 
Disneyland. "It's a combination of keeping people moving and finding little 
surprises along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure people keep moving -- and thus feel that they are making progress 
-- Disney came up with a complicated mathematical formula for adjusting the 
width of the line. The more people who can be accommodated on a particular ride 
every hour, the wider the queue. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers also studied the shape of the line itself. The Roger Rabbit queue 
twists so that visitors see only a dozen people behind and ahead of them, 
thereby disguising the size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland also typically posts signs telling patrons how long to expect to 
wait before boarding a ride. MIT's Larson said that such notices are crucial, 
for they satisfy consumers' need to know just how long the wait will be. As if 
to prove that point, Disney visitors fumed one day last week when the signs 
were missing from the Roger Rabbit ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very long wait," complained Sarah Maldon, an Australian visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other theme parks are following Disney's lead in planning fancy pre-shows for 
the coming summer's attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia is building an entire Gotham City to keep 
patrons amused while they wait to board the Batman roller coaster. And Knott's 
Berry Farm is constructing Mystery Lodge, a special-effects theater where the 
13-minute pre-show will be as long as the main event. The line for the 
attraction will snake past a roaring waterfall and be shaded from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to make the experience of standing in line as pleasant as possible," 
said Pat Scanlon, executive vice president of BRC Imagination Arts in Burbank, 
which is developing the Mystery Lodge for Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 But worse than a long line is no line at all, at least from the theme parks' 
point of view. If a ride has no crowd outside, that means visitors just aren't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A line," Scanlon said, "is an indication that it is worth standing in."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRESIDENT FIXES GAZE ON HISTORY AND ELECTORATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

<P>
 Health care, crime, welfare reform and foreign affairs all had their appointed 
places in President Clinton's State of the Union Address Tuesday night, but the 
speech was above all a testament to the evolving and expanding ambition of the 
man who delivered it. 
</P>
<P>
 From his youth, Bill Clinton was goaded by a personal drive to achieve the 
office he now holds. As President, he has displayed an equally powerful but 
markedly more expansive ambition: to use the Oval Office to put his stamp on 
the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If George Bush always betrayed the sense that the presidency was the end to 
which he had struggled, Clinton made clear Tuesday night that he has come to 
see the Oval Office as a means, not an end. His address was a catalogue tour of 
just how vast a presidency he desires. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also a tacit reminder that he has found it far easier to translate 
broad visions into rhetoric than into results. As in other speeches, Clinton 
could and did glide past the inherent tensions in his broad agenda -- between 
the need to cut the budget, for example, and the need to spend more money if 
his calls for reforming welfare and rescuing children from poverty are to be 
more than token gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he could not square that circle: In a public environment skeptical 
of new spending, Congress focused on deficit reduction and significantly scaled 
back his investment agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Clinton declared he will try once again. 
</P>
<P>
 He called first of all for health care reform. Then swift completion of the 
massive crime bill. To be followed by welfare reform -- only recently consigned 
to policy limbo by White House aides who feared it would clog the legislative 
arteries. Not to mention a new job training program and education reform and 
urban revitalization. And a national information superhighway -- laid down in 
legislation, this year, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Not neglecting foreign affairs, he had a blueprint for his own new world order 
built around promoting democracy and open markets around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, he passionately urged a reconsecration of American values. 
"Our problems go way beyond the reach of government," Clinton declared. "The 
American people have got to change within, if we are to bring back work, family 
and community." 
</P>
<P>
 These are all ideas Clinton has long championed. But by any standard, they 
represent the impatient wish-list of a man with one eye on the history books, 
the other on the electoral calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very small window to initiate change," one Cabinet secretary said 
Tuesday. "In terms of the initial design and implementation of these programs, 
there isn't very much time. That sense is spread throughout the 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 What unifies Clinton's insistent ambitions is his drive to create a new 
construct for American politics -- a realignment not only in electoral 
loyalties but in the guiding principles for government. Through all his ups and 
downs, Clinton has never wavered from one central belief: the conviction that 
he can thread a "third way" between the "false choices" of traditional liberal 
and conservative dogma. 
</P>
<P>
 To Clinton and many of his advisers, building that bridge across the political 
divides of the past quarter century remains the key to constructing both a 
reelection majority and a public consensus behind the activist government the 
President hopes to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the inherent tensions within his program make that effort a constant 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again this year, Clinton must struggle to reconcile his two overriding 
economic goals: reducing the deficit and increasing public investment on such 
programs as education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-widespread emphasis on deficit reduction has forced Clinton to phase 
in all of his cherished programs more slowly than he had hoped. And the caps 
imposed on discretionary domestic spending last year mean that he will only be 
able to increase his "investment" spending to the extent that he can push cuts 
in other programs through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it's going to be easier (to fund the investment agenda) in 
1994," acknowledged William A. Galston, deputy director of domestic policy in 
the White House. "It's going to be harder in many respects." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other top domestic issues, Clinton must manage the second principal 
tension in his "third way" approach: bridging the often divergent interests of 
his liberal Democratic base and the moderate voters he hopes to attract in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, for example, Clinton now faces intensifying pressure from the left 
and right. Last year, he endorsed expansion of the death penalty and funding 
for 100,000 new police officers -- ideas with considerable appeal to moderates. 
Republicans promptly put him on the spot by drawing a different dividing line, 
calling for tougher sentences and more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, in a move certain to anger many liberals, Clinton moved toward 
that new line by endorsing the so-called "three strikes, you're out" provision 
that would impose life imprisonment without parole on criminals found guilty of 
a federal felony after two previous felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he spoke, however, he found himself one-upped by the GOP: House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) last Friday demanded a two strikes 
provision for violent criminals even though the crime bill sponsored by nearly 
90 House Republicans, including Gingrich himself, contains a three strikes 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare debate could see a similar dynamic, with each Clinton proposal to 
impose new responsibilities on welfare recipients trumped by even sterner 
Republican proposals that attempt to force the President to choose between his 
fellow Democrats in Congress and the larger public. 
</P>
<P>
 This intricate byplay with the GOP pulls Clinton's tightrope ever tauter. 
Already, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, the Congressional Black Caucus and 
House liberals are complaining that the crime bill passed overwhelmingly by the 
Senate last November tilts too heavily toward punishment; they want Clinton to 
repudiate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, House liberals already have signaled that they will fight the call 
for a two-year time limit on welfare that Clinton repeated in his speech; fear 
of provoking another tussle with the left is one reason the White House has 
hesitated to introduce the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, Clinton faces the opposite problem: extensive resistance from 
moderate and conservative Democrats. Many centrist Democrats view his complex 
health care plan -- with its vast new federal and state bureaucracies and a new 
federal entitlement to health care -- as fundamentally incompatible with his 
calls for fiscal prudence and streamlining government. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of ideological cross-fire, with liberals and conservatives 
simultaneously sniping at him over different issues, has become an occupational 
hazard for Clinton. It may be unavoidable for a President who zigs and zags 
along the ideological demilitarized zone that has long divided the parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, amid all the flak and tensions, Clinton's third way agenda has begun to 
yield tangible successes. As Clinton recounted Tuesday night, he forged 
bipartisan coalitions last year behind national service, aid to Russia and the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. And despite all the ideological jostling, 
sometime this spring Clinton is almost certain to end years of gridlock by 
signing a crime bill that offers more cops and more prisons, more gun control 
and more social programs -- in effect marrying the alternatives over which 
conservatives and liberals have long feuded. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare, he could ultimately build a similar coalition in the center, 
joining liberal calls for more training and education with conservative demands 
for personal responsibility and work. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of the political spotlight toward crime and welfare should help 
Clinton fortify his standing with voters in the political center. But some 
Democrats fear that the debate over health care could cut in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's budget fight, Clinton was seriously wounded with centrist 
voters when a parade of moderate Democrats seconded Republican criticisms of 
the plan as too heavy on taxes. A similar pattern appears to be developing on 
health care, with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.) questioning the Administration's underlying assumption of a health 
care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Union speech, Clinton showed no sign of retreat, declaring 
explicitly that he would veto any bill that "does not guarantee every American 
private health insurance that can never be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Many electoral tacticians in both parties believe that the safest political 
step for Clinton is to seek a diluted compromise on health care that would 
allow him to avoid a polarizing fight and claim victory on a central campaign 
promise. That route might boost his prospects of reelection in 1996 -- and 
protect his personal ambition to remain at the pinnacle of power. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as his remarks Tuesday night suggested, that would not satisfy his 
ambition to leave a lasting imprint on the nation. In the months ahead -- on 
health care and on the rest of his enormous agenda -- bridging those two 
strains of his own ambition may be the most difficult challenge the President 
faces.

L.A. GETS A TASTE OF COMMUTING AT ITS WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Traffic congestion between the Santa Clarita Valley and Los Angeles on Tuesday 
reached new highs since the earthquake -- transforming one-hour commutes into 
morning-long ordeals -- while motorists elsewhere found enough alternative 
routes to keep their cars moving at tolerable speeds, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As more people returned to work and schools reopened, the volume of traffic 
bypassing quake-damaged freeways hit new peaks. For those who depend on the 
Golden State Freeway, their congestion woes worsened after snow slowed one 
alternate route through the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traffic experts predicted that Angelenos would require about two weeks to 
learn to cope with the new world of commuting created by last week's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then traffic will equalize. Commuters will figure out alternatives," said 
David (Dr. Traffic) Rizzo, author of a book on freeway shortcuts. "The motorist 
is very intelligent and will find the path of least resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 In search of that solution, thousands of motorists fanned out on the Westside, 
using a network of surface streets, where traffic signals had been fine-tuned 
to increase the amount of green-light time on east-west thoroughfares. For 
them, the commute was a trip of wits and creativity, with what Caltrans called 
moderate delays. 
</P>
<P>
 But motorists traveling between the Santa Clarita Valley and Downtown Los 
Angeles found themselves mired in gridlock, taking almost two hours to travel 
less than 10 miles. "It's getting worse," said Joe Brahm, a Caltrans senior 
transportation engineer who oversees the traffic operations center. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say there is precious little relief that they can offer 
those who depend on the Golden State Freeway, a portion of which collapsed in 
last week's quake. For those beleaguered drivers, Tuesday's commute is probably 
typical of what they will face for months to come, officials said. Trucks 
caused much of Tuesday's congested conditions, coming in on southbound 
Interstate 5, Caltrans officials said. On average, the bottleneck at the 
junction of I-5 and the Antelope Valley Freeway has caused truckers to take 
detours of up to 150 miles, said Dave Titus, spokesman for the California 
Trucking Assn. Titus predicted that trucking companies would soon increase 
their rates for deliveries in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delays are fairly extensive," he said. "We're talking about it taking two 
or three hours of delay getting into and out of the L.A. Basin." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials can offer few road alternatives to I-5. Instead, they urge 
truckers to avoid the region's freeways and encourage single-car motorists to 
car-pool, take a bus or Metrolink trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership increased to 17,850 on Metrolink's Santa Clarita line, but the 
response is not enough to solve congestion problems. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, motorists who usually take the Santa Monica Freeway have a host 
of options, including buses, various routes on surface streets, and other 
east-west links -- such as the Century or the Ventura freeways. Since the 
earthquake, traffic on those two freeways has increased considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has adjusted street lights around the Santa Monica Freeway to 
increase traffic flow and ease congestion on east-west streets that are serving 
as detours. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other freeways were damaged in the quake and O'Connell said that traffic 
has been moving at reasonable speeds in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, O'Connell and others say, they have another powerful tool 
that they hope will keep cars moving: Car-pool lanes. But on Tuesday, the six 
miles of newly opened car-pool lanes remained virtually empty, while traffic 
occasionally slowed to bumper-to-bumper on the mixed-flow lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The six miles of car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway run westbound near 
Normandie Avenue to Overland Avenue, and eastbound from Overland to Robertson 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To help get the word out that cheaters, or lone drivers, would not be 
tolerated, the California Highway Patrol ticketed more than 100 motorists for 
illegally driving in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Westsiders also continue to shun an express bus line, No. 634, which was 
created after the quake and runs Downtown via Century City. Other local 
east-west bus routes showed some increase in ridership, MTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alan Epstein, incoming chairman of Commuter Transportation Services, said 
he believed transportation attitudes will change. "Different people have 
different tolerances for pain," he said, "those who are less tolerant of pain 
will act more quickly."

FERVENT CLINTON ASKS SWIFT HEALTH REFORM; STATE OF THE UNION: HE ALSO STRESSES 
WELFARE, CRIME IN ADDRESS THAT PURPOSELY AVOIDS ANY MAJOR NEW PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, striving to rekindle support for the centerpiece of his 
domestic agenda, Tuesday night called on Congress to pass his massive health 
reform plan as he delivered a State of the Union speech strong on passion but 
deliberately devoid of major new legislative initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a lengthy, and still partly unfulfilled, catalogue of promises from 
his first year in office, Clinton used his 65-minute, nationally televised 
address to review his successes and to appeal for swift action on the three 
largest items that remain -- health reform, welfare and crime control. 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, which occupied by far the longest section of his speech, 
Clinton again offered to cooperate with Republicans in drafting a bipartisan 
program, but he bluntly threatened to veto any bill that does not meet his 
fundamental requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make this very clear," he said with studied determination. "If you 
send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health 
insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, 
veto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 The veto threat, a rare moment of drama in a State of the Union Address that 
for the most part tracked over familiar ground, was part of an effort to stir 
the sense of urgency that White House strategists believe must be maintained if 
his plan for a comprehensive overhaul is to win approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response after the speech, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the 
minority leader, gave little sign of compromise -- sharply attacking Clinton's 
health plan. The President's proposal, he said, contained a "massive overdose 
of federal control" that would "put a mountain of bureaucracy between you and 
your doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also made a lengthy pitch for his welfare reform proposals, promising 
to submit legislation this spring. Working on the two simultaneously is 
"inevitable and imperative," Clinton said, arguing that many people remain on 
welfare precisely to obtain health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 While he pushed for passage of his agenda, Clinton carefully avoided proposing 
new programs, as other presidents often have on such occasions. Senior White 
House advisers believe that voters think the President already has promised 
more than he can accomplish. In fact, White House officials fear 
over-promising, seeing it as Clinton's major vulnerability -- one that his 
Republican opponents already have begun to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as Clinton stressed, the constraints of last year's budget plan 
have left Congress and the White House virtually no flexibility to propose new 
spending without cutting existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 So rather than make a raft of new promises, Clinton devoted most of his speech 
to convincing Americans that he is hard at work on the promises he already has 
made, and that he can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992 the American people demanded that we change," Clinton said. "A year 
ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of 
our country. Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who 
broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President 
and a Congress in 30 years," Clinton said, referring to a record of legislative 
action not exceeded since the early years of the Lyndon B. Johnson 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 On a second issue of increasing public concern, Clinton said the epidemic of 
violence across the land must be addressed. But he added -- in an 
acknowledgment that Democrats in the past often have been reluctant to make -- 
that the role of the federal government is limited and that many of the 
country's ills can only be handled by family, school, church and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problems go way beyond the reach of government. They're rooted in the 
loss of values and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families 
and our communities," Clinton said. "The American people have got to want to 
change from within if we're going to bring back work and family and community." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Clinton pointed to one of the most controversial issues of 
social policy -- the nation's rapidly growing rate of out-of-wedlock births. 
"We cannot renew our country when, within a decade, more than half of the 
children will be born into families where there has been no marriage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he endorsed a set of specific steps to reduce crime, 
beginning with a "three strikes" law that would require life sentences for 
people convicted of three felonies. He also repeated his call for federal 
assistance to allow cities and towns to hire 100,000 more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton appealed to gun owners to join him in taking steps 
to reduce gun violence. "Hunters must always be free to hunt and law-abiding 
adults should be free to own guns," Clinton said. But, he added, "there is no 
sporting purpose on Earth that should stop us from banishing the assault 
weapons that outgun our police and cut down our children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't create this problem," Clinton said, addressing those who use guns 
for sport. "But we need your help to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast with the emphasis on domestic policy, only about 10 minutes of the 
speech focused on foreign affairs. And even those remarks appeared perfunctory 
-- repeating statements Clinton and his top aides have made in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's voice was hoarse as the speech started and seemed to fade more as he 
continued. Twice his voice cracked -- once as he referred to violence against 
children and a second time toward the end of his speech when he referred to his 
mother, who died earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The multitude gathered in the House chamber for the speech included, by 
tradition, both houses of Congress, the Cabinet, members of the Supreme Court, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been true in past major Clinton speeches, the White House reserved 
special symbolic seats flanking First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the House 
gallery. This time, Mrs. Clinton sat between AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland 
and Jack Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp. Organized labor and the auto 
companies are the Administration's two biggest allies in the health care 
battle. Clinton has also been anxious to mend fences with labor after the 
strains caused by the debate last fall on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seated near Mrs. Clinton were Tommy O'Neill, son of the late House 
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), and James S. Brady, President 
Ronald Reagan's former press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 
assassination attempt on his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton cited the gun control measure named after Brady, which requires a 
waiting period before a handgun can be purchased, on his list of major 
legislative accomplishments. He also touted the smaller budget deficit, tax 
cuts for low-income workers, the trade agreement, a program providing young 
Americans the opportunity to earn money for college by performing public 
service, family leave and the motor-voter registration bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "All passed, all signed into law with not one single veto," Clinton said. 
"These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office 
and, in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress. But I am 
persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay 
our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward future legislative battles, Clinton took aim at the 
credibility of his Republican opponents -- arguing that they were wrong about 
his economic plan and, by extension, cannot be trusted to be right about issues 
such as health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton labeled his opponents as "naysayers who said this plan wouldn't work. 
But they were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget deficit, Clinton said, has declined from a projected $300 billion 
to $180 billion, and inflation and interest rates are at historically low 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you will stick with this plan," he said, "we will post three consecutive 
years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the 
White House and once again, the buck stops here." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides began work on Clinton's speech shortly before Christmas and 
Clinton first reviewed a proposed outline for the address over the New Year's 
holiday, which he spent at Hilton Head, S.C., at the Renaissance Weekend annual 
public policy retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton saw a first complete draft of the address just before leaving for 
Europe in early January but did not devote serious attention to it until last 
week, as he was flying back from Los Angeles after viewing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The President worked extensively on the sections on health care and welfare 
reform and wrote the passages that linked the two, aides said. He worked 
closely with Mrs. Clinton and senior advisers David Gergen and George 
Stephanopoulos in honing the message of moral renewal that infused the sections 
on crime and middle-class values. 
</P>
<P>
 Political adviser Paul Begala and pollster Stanley B. Greenberg also 
contributed ideas for the speech, which was written chiefly by mid-level aides 
David Dreyer, Robert Boorstin and Jeremy Rosner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen's influence could, perhaps, be seen in several instances in which 
Clinton adopted strategies once used by Gergen's former boss, Reagan. As Reagan 
loved to do, Clinton introduced a man in uniform to his audience -- a New York 
City police officer whose community policing efforts had been featured in a New 
York Times Magazine cover story in December. Clinton also continued his effort 
to steal for the Democrats themes of family and community that Reagan had used 
so effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final Reaganite line, Clinton loudly vowed to resist cuts in the defense 
budget. "Many people urged me to cut our defense spending further," Clinton 
said. "The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense 
cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric, however, was largely hollow, for the most influential pressure 
in Congress now is not from liberals seeking to cut defense spending but from 
conservatives who argue that Clinton already has pared it too much. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clinton practiced delivery of the address for almost two hours in 
the movie theater in the White House residence, as aides wandered in and out to 
offer suggestions on content and oratorical emphasis. He marked up the ninth 
draft of the speech Tuesday afternoon and the final version was still being 
polished a couple of hours before Clinton took the podium in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of new promises, of course, does not mean that Clinton has 
suddenly changed into a leader with a small agenda. The White House has enough 
business left unfinished from last year to keep Clinton and Congress busy for 
months, perhaps years, to come. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list -- and the centerpiece of Clinton's speech -- is his 
promise of universal, lifetime health insurance for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the burgeoning health reform debate have seen this speech as the 
opening event of the most intensive part of the struggle -- a legislative 
battle certain to last many months.

JACKSON SETTLES ABUSE SUIT BUT INSISTS HE IS INNOCENT; COURTS: SINGER WILL 
REPORTEDLY PAY $15 MILLION TO $24 MILLION TO TEEN-AGER. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
WILL PROCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lawyers for Michael Jackson and a 14-year-old boy who alleged in a lawsuit 
that the singer sexually molested him announced Tuesday that they have settled 
the case, abruptly ending one chapter of a scandal that has dogged the 
internationally renowned pop icon since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the attorneys declined to discuss any aspect of the settlement, 
sources close to the negotiations said it was for $15 million to $24 million, 
with some of the money paid to the boy in cash and the rest funneled into a 
trust fund. The terms of the settlement were reviewed by a judge who has been 
appointed to serve as the boy's guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief court hearing Tuesday, Larry R. Feldman, the boy's attorney, 
said he and his client were "very happy with the resolution of this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the settlement, Jackson's attorneys said their client stands by his 
assertions of innocence and agreed to the deal so that he could get on with his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resolution of this case is in no way an admission of guilt by Michael 
Jackson," said attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of two lawyers representing 
Jackson in the matter. "In short, he is an innocent man who does not intend to 
have his career and his life destroyed by rumors and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, however, Jackson publicly recanted his charge that 
he was the victim of an extortion attempt by the boy's father. That claim, long 
advanced by Jackson's advisers and by the entertainer, has been the mainstay of 
his defense since the first days of the case, which erupted in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of the civil case resolves Jackson's most immediate legal 
troubles and may effectively put an end to a criminal investigation. The boy's 
lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial in March. In preparation for that, a judge 
had scheduled Jackson to be deposed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson previously had resisted giving a deposition, and had the case not been 
settled he might have been forced to choose between answering questions and 
refusing to respond based on his right to not incriminate himself -- a common 
legal maneuver but one that could have had grave public relations implications 
for the superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those immediate problems have been lifted, and he will avoid the 
spectacle of a nationally televised civil trial probing the most intimate 
aspects of his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 But the civil case was only a part of Jackson's legal woes. The longer-term 
question that the end of the lawsuit raises is whether Jackson might still be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 That answer is more complicated. One prosecutor said Tuesday that the 
investigation will continue, but most legal experts agree that it now appears 
unlikely that Jackson will be indicted -- at least for any alleged abuse of 
this boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, who waged an aggressive legal effort on behalf of the boy, would not 
say Tuesday whether his client would testify if prosecutors sought to file 
criminal charges against Jackson. He emphasized that the civil settlement in no 
way committed his client to remaining silent, but at the same time Feldman 
repeatedly suggested that the boy might be better off by getting on with his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cannot heal, he cannot get better until he puts this matter behind him," 
said Feldman, whose client has met with psychologists in recent months. "He 
wants to put this behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by his office, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti said the criminal investigation will go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal investigation of singer Michael Jackson is ongoing and will not 
be affected by the announcement of the civil case settlement," Garcetti said. 
"The district attorney's office is taking Mr. Feldman at his word that the 
alleged victim will be allowed to testify and that there has been no agreement 
in the civil matter that will affect cooperation in the criminal 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County prosecutors, who also are weighing the possibility of 
criminal charges against the entertainer, declined to comment on Tuesday's 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the terms of the settlement were not made public, nothing in the 
document is likely to prevent the child from cooperating with authorities, 
lawyers said, because the law prevents anyone from conspiring to obstruct the 
work of police and prosecutors as they investigate a possible crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way that a civil settlement can somehow keep the prosecution from 
seeking information in a criminal investigation," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA 
law professor. "But the pragmatic reality is that with an uncooperative victim, 
the prosecution would be unable to secure a criminal conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Arenella and other legal analysts agreed that if the boy and his family 
determine that it is in his best interest to put the case behind him, there is 
almost no chance that prosecutors could proceed without him. Under California 
law, children can and sometimes are forced to testify against their will, but 
the law does not allow authorities to punish alleged victims of sex crimes who 
decline to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 1219 of the California Code of Civil Procedure states that "no court 
may imprison or otherwise confine or place in custody the victim of a sexual 
assault for contempt when the contempt consists of refusing to testify 
concerning the sexual assault." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola University and a former federal 
prosecutor, said that provision would prevent prosecutors from calling the boy 
to the stand if he elects not to testify. And without the alleged victim, 
Levenson said, prosecution becomes extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the victim," Levenson said, "there is no more case." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the lawsuit brings down the curtain on a tumultuous act in the 
extraordinary life of Jackson, one of the world's richest and most recognizable 
entertainers. The allegations that he sexually molested the boy -- who was 13 
at the time of the alleged abuse and turned 14 earlier this month -- surfaced 
in August as Jackson was leaving on his "Dangerous" world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Jackson's advisers insisted that the allegations were leveled only 
because Jackson had rebuffed an attempt by the boy's father to extort $20 
million from the singer. Monday, however, Garcetti's office announced that 
prosecutors had declined to prosecute that case, and Jackson's lawyers agreed 
Tuesday that Jackson "withdraws any previous allegation of extortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's tour was dogged by the molestation allegations and by the singer's 
apparently fragile health. A number of concerts in Asia were canceled or 
delayed when Jackson fell ill, first with dehydration and later with migraine 
headaches and other ailments, according to his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Nov. 12, Jackson suddenly called off the remainder of the tour dates 
and released a tape recording in which he said he was suffering from a 
debilitating addiction to painkillers brought on in part by the stress of being 
falsely accused of child molestation. Jackson disappeared from public view, 
touching off an international media manhunt for the celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson sightings were reported around the world: A Jackson look-alike stirred 
paparazzi in London, a hotel operator in the French Alps announced that the 
singer was staying at his resort, and a newspaper in Connecticut quoted an 
"impeccable source" who said Jackson was recovering at a nearby drug treatment 
center. All those reports were false. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jackson eventually did return to the United States, four weeks after 
disappearing, he was whisked from the Santa Barbara Airport to his nearby 
Neverland Ranch. From there, Jackson issued a public statement via satellite 
hookup Dec. 22 in which he reasserted his innocence, denounced the media for 
its coverage of the case and thanked his friends, family and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I have maintained from the very beginning," Jackson said that day, "I am 
hoping for a speedy end to this horrifying, horrifying experience to which I 
have been subjected." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson supporters rallied to his defense from the start -- fans in Upstate 
New York posted a huge outdoor message to the entertainer and offers of 
marriage poured in. But the case even divided the Jackson family. His parents 
and most of his brothers and sisters steadfastly stood by him, but his sister 
LaToya -- long alienated from the rest of the clan -- called a news conference 
in Israel to proclaim that she believed her brother had molested children for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement means that Jackson will not get the chance to argue his 
innocence in a civil trial, but, as with the boy, it does not bind him to 
silence. His lawyers, in their statement, said Jackson will soon speak out 
about "the agony, torture and pain he has had to suffer during the past six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come for Michael Jackson to move on to new business, to get on 
with his life, to start the healing process and to move his career forward to 
even greater heights," the statement said. "This he intends to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Cochran nor Howard Weitzman, Jackson's other lawyer, would answer 
questions Tuesday. Anthony Pellicano, an outspoken private investigator who 
worked for Jackson until resigning last month, said the settlement merely 
reaffirmed his belief that the boy and his family were after the singer's 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have maintained Michael Jackson's innocence from the very start, and I 
still maintain that he is innocent," Pellicano said. "Obviously, there has been 
an exchange of money to settle this case. It all boils down to money." 
</P>
<P>
 That echoes a theme that Jackson's advisers have reiterated again and again -- 
that the singer's enormous fame and wealth make him a magnet for false claims 
and extortion attempts. Legal analysts agree, but they also note that the 
settlement could send an equally troubling signal about the role that fame and 
wealth have had on the conduct of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a criminal defense lawyer and former deputy district 
attorney, said the settlement could be interpreted as "the rich man's exemption 
in a child molestation case" and added that it could stir controversy in some 
quarters. Others agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the general public, there may very well be the troubling message that if 
you have the means, you can get your criminal troubles to go away," Levenson 
said. "That may not be the facts in this case, but some members of the public 
will believe that Jackson was able to buy his way out of this."

 Throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, school bells beckoned 
581,000 of the region's jittery youth back to class Tuesday -- some arriving in 
tears, others trudging off buses after two-hour commutes -- as officials 
scrambled to reopen 13 more quake-damaged schools. 
</P>
<P>
 All 640 district campuses were closed last week to assess damage after the 
quake. In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, where 76 schools remained closed 
Tuesday, attendance was unusually low, prompting some principals to roam 
through tent cities and shelters pleading with parents to send their children 
back to familiar classroom surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final attendance figures were not available, administrators estimated 
that overall attendance was about 80% -- about 10% below average. But for the 
most part, school started on time, most buses ran on schedule, few teachers 
missed work and teachers and students alike were generally relieved to be back 
among classmates and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion did arise at many of the 76 closed schools Tuesday as scores of 
parents showed up with children in tow, only to be turned away at the gate. 
Some criticized the district for making announcements about closures late in 
the day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the mix-ups, about 75 children were bused from their homes in 
South-Central Los Angeles to closed Valley schools because neither parents nor 
bus drivers found out in time about the rapidly changing school closure plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, district officials were pleased with the quake comeback, a day 
that Supt. Sid Thompson described as "a very profitable day for our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the district, elementary school children ran into their teachers' 
arms, eager for a hug after the district's unprecedented emergency closure. 
Other youngsters clung to their mothers' arms, afraid to be left alone. Some 
teen-agers were so somber in class that they simply shook their heads when the 
teacher asked them to share their feelings about the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers cast aside academics and dealt with the conflicting emotions inside 
their classrooms. These were the lessons of the day: It's OK to be afraid. 
School buildings are safe. What is a tectonic plate? Do you know what 
price-gouging means? 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of school counselors were on hand to offer reassurance to returning 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are nervous and a little tense," said psychologist Marcy Feldman 
at Shenandoah Street Elementary School in the Beverlywood neighborhood of Los 
Angeles. "But for the most part they've gotten back into their routine. . . . 
We're trying to reassure them that they have the skills to get through an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thompson announced that 13 more schools will open this morning, along with 
two day-care and preschool centers. He predicted that all but five of the most 
damaged campuses will open by the end of the week. While some students will be 
temporarily transferred to other campuses, Thompson said every effort will be 
made to keep students at their regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional school openings will be announced today. Thompson also asked for 
volunteer therapists to help counsel troubled students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * School board President Leticia Quezada was informed that President Clinton's 
emergency aid plan before Congress would direct about $700 million to Los 
Angeles Unified schools, which suffered earthquake damage from the Crenshaw 
district to the Valley. She said the pledge "is an incredible reassurance and 
gives us tremendous hope" that the district will be able to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education is seeking congressional approval for another 
$165 million for Los Angeles Unified and other hard-hit school districts to pay 
for emergency operating expenses and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first of 200 portable classrooms arrived at two Valley campuses, part of 
the state's promise to cut through red tape that tends to stifle quick action. 
Twenty of the bungalows are headed for Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, 
one of the most severely damaged schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson announced that California National Guard troops, finished 
with the urgent task of building tent cities, have been dispatched to damaged 
Valley schools to help with cleanup. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) 
said that, at the school district's request, he is also prepared to seek 
military assistance in school cleanup and reconstruction. Getting There 
</P>
<P>
 After spending last week cooped up with his mother in their home just west of 
Downtown Los Angeles, Alex Lainez, 17, was more than ready to return to Verdugo 
Hills High School in Tujunga. So bored and so ready, in fact, that he arrived 
at the bus stop at Beverly Boulevard and Loma Drive at 6:30 a.m, half an hour 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 Lainez is one of 80,000 students who travel in the largest school bus fleet in 
the nation. On a typical day many students commute more than an hour to school. 
Officials said Tuesday that the city's damaged highway system doubled the 
commuting time for some students. Still, 93% of the buses arrived on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lainez's bus picked him up at 6:55 a.m., just as the sky began to lighten. 
Like most of the other buses headed for Verdugo, it had an abnormally light 
passenger load -- only 15 students. In all, said Verdugo Hills Principal Gary 
Turner, only about half of the bused students showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 As it pulled onto the Glendale Freeway, the bus joined the usual caravan of 
school buses heading out of the inner city. Most were only half full -- stark 
evidence of the quake's impact on families and their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Although traffic was not a problem for buses heading from Downtown to the 
Valley, those traveling many Westside routes endured long waits on choked 
streets and crippled freeways, making students late for class. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Mary Pickett picked up her first passenger on 42nd Street and Vermont 
Avenue in Los Angeles at 6:20 a.m. and headed west on Jefferson Boulevard for 
Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles. The 3 1/2 miles from Crenshaw 
Boulevard to National Boulevard took 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus driver Charlotte Spikes usually picks up 18 Valley students who travel to 
Hamilton High. On Tuesday morning, only five boarded. "I think a lot of parents 
are still afraid to let their kids out of their sight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Turner: "I got a lot of calls from parents saying 'I don't want to send 
my kids to the Valley.' " Saying Goodby 
</P>
<P>
 For many parents and children, the hardest part of the day was the morning 
goodby, the time when mom or dad had to finally let go of that little hand 
clasped tightly around her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart's going a hundred miles an hour," said Debbie Neeley of Van Nuys 
after dropping off her 11-year-old son in front of the school. "You just don't 
know what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6th Avenue Elementary School in the Crenshaw district, 9-year-old Isabel 
Galvan softly cried into her mother's sleeve, "I'm afraid, I'm afraid. What if 
the building falls?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, my love," Rosa Galvan said in Spanish, stroking her daughter's 
braided hair. "It's safe in school. Don't you see all your friends there. Don't 
you want to see your teacher?" 
</P>
<P>
 It took three kisses, the final bell and a last-minute bear hug with her 
2-year-old brother before Isabel ran into line, disappearing into a crowd of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carrie Laurin, delivering her 7-year-old daughter, Kristina, to school was 
a way to reassure the girl that life had returned to its regular routine, even 
if the family continues to sleep together in their sunken living room and 
aftershocks test their nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the one who wanted to cry," Laurin said after the drop-off at Noble 
Avenue Elementary School in North Hills. "The only thing is that you can't let 
them know that you're as scared as they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, were eager to say goodby to their families for the 
day. School relieved them of frightening baby-sitting duties last week when 
parents were summoned back to work -- but aftershocks continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to be in charge of my two brothers and cousin all week. I was so 
scared. We just sat on the sofa and hoped we wouldn't have to dive under the 
table," said Anna Rosa Blake, 15, of John Adams Middle School, just south of 
Downtown. "At school, now my teacher can take care of me. She knows what to 
do." In the Classroom 
</P>
<P>
 From the South Bay north to Sylmar, teachers incorporated the quake into 
lessons at all grade levels. Vocabulary drills introduced such words as 
seismograph and thrust fault. Children talked about their fears and wrote in 
journals, read about the San Francisco quake of 1906, constructed earthquake 
preparedness kits and practiced "drop and hold" drills in case of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 School psychologists held group sessions in classrooms and counseled the most 
rattled students individually. For the most part, older children's concerns 
involved the impact of a quake on the family as a whole, said Shenandoah 
psychologist Feldman, while younger children most feared separation from their 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were subdued, classes small. Said Nerinita Munro, who teaches English 
as a second language at Verdugo Hills High: "It's very somber. Usually the kids 
are much more talkative. Some of the kids can't even talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth-grade class in Point Fermin Elementary School in San Pedro prepared 
care packages, and kindergartners painted outdoors -- including one girl who 
daubed a desert scene complete with fault lines running through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have got to be able to express themselves," said Principal William 
Fukuhara. "To just go to a lesson would be totally out of context." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Noble Avenue went over the scientific whys and wherefores of 
earthquakes to dispel possible misimpressions or superstitions of children who 
might believe that the temblors were caused by their bad behavior or were 
punishment for same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to move to Florida," declared one fifth-grade boy whose special 
education class grouped in a circle to compare notes and express concerns. "My 
mom said we might." 
</P>
<P>
 At Langdon Avenue School in North Hills, students gathered in "magic circles" 
and talked out their feelings. There was no difficulty in making them small 
groups because only about 200 out of the 1,000 students had shown up for school 
by 9 a.m. With the full roster of 37 teachers present, the student-teacher 
ratio was less than 6 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should've seen the yard this morning," Assistant Principal Jacqueline 
Howard told one of her teachers. "It was like a bomb (had hit) -- no kids. One 
here, two there." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-grader Dominique Harris and her classmates used Play-Doh to re-enact 
scenes of terror from the earthquake that they had seen in their neighborhoods 
or on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jose Victor Carrillo, 12: "I drew the freeway falling down." 
</P>
<P>
 At Taft High School in Woodland Hills, snippets of survival stories peppered 
conversations that echoed through the corridors: "The building was, like 
shaking. . . . There was all this glass. . . . My friend Toby, her dog ran 
away. . . . Do you have any eyeliner?" 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Robert A. Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks, teacher Robert 
Hayes said the quake prompted a lesson in his first-period science class, a 
demonstration of aftershocks using a metal Slinky to knock down a miniature 
cardboard house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," Hayes said. "Nature does some strange things." 
</P>

Bryant and Susan Byrnes. Back in Business 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will resume today at an additional 13 campuses and two children's 
centers in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles Unified School District 
officials announced. Quake-related repairs will continue at another 63 campuses 
that will remain closed until further notice. Parents should call their child's 
school for more information about closures.

CLINTON ASKS $6.6 BILLION IN AID; SCHOOLS OPEN AMID RELIEF, SOME MIX-UPS; 
RECOVERY: PRESIDENT'S REQUEST WOULD BRING THE U.S. COMMITMENT FOR EARTHQUAKE 
ASSISTANCE TO $7.5 BILLION. FUNDS WOULD HELP REBUILD SCHOOLS, ROADS, ASSIST 
HOMELESS.

<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Tuesday announced a $6.6-billion aid package for 
victims of the Northridge earthquake and pledged that the money will not get 
bogged down in a debate over finding offsetting cuts in the pared-down federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is proposed for a wide range of emergency assistance in Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties, including education funds to restore the shattered school 
system and highway funds to rebuild broken freeways. The Administration also is 
asking for $150 million for rent vouchers, enabling 10,000 homeless earthquake 
victims to apply for subsidies to help pay for private apartments for up to 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with nearly $900 million in previously committed funds, the 
Administration's request totals $7.5 billion, one of the largest emergency aid 
packages ever proposed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the Clinton proposals from California generally was positive and 
grateful, but also tinged with caution that it might not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The overall death toll from the magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake climbed to 60 
with the death of a woman injured in a car crash while traffic lights were 
blacked out after the Jan. 17 shaking. Of the 60, 57 died in Los Angeles 
County, two in Kern County and one in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic hit new peaks on quake-damaged freeways as schools reopened and more 
people returned to work. Congestion was worst for commuters traveling between 
the Santa Clarita Valley and Los Angeles, while motorists elsewhere experienced 
moderate delays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles public schools opened their doors for the first time in a week 
and quake-jittery children flowed into classrooms where teachers spent the day 
counseling youths. While attendance in the hard-hit San Fernando Valley was 
less than half of normal, administrators estimated attendance overall to be 
about 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, declaring that she would be a "friendly 
banker" to earthquake victims, proposed a $1.3-billion state earthquake relief 
package to supplement Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, reacting to the Clinton Administration 
plan, said, "This is a tremendous and incredibly swift federal response to an 
unprecedented disaster. Hour by hour, we are learning the increasing dimension 
of the damage and its incredible effects on our local economy. We are just 
beginning to assess the mid-term and longer-range impact. In the absence of 
clear numbers, we just don't know if this is the full amount necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was more skeptical. In a letter to Clinton, Wilson said he 
was grateful but said he expects California will need much more help by the 
time the cost of the quake is tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary numbers . . . involving transportation appear to be similar 
to initial damage estimates that we in the state have obtained. However, in all 
other areas . . . it is impossible and unreasonable to commit to a dollar 
amount." 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman said, "We want to look at this with a huge warning. Proceed 
with caution. We don't want California left holding the bag if the numbers are 
low-balled." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Budget Director Leon Panetta emphasized that the federal request 
is preliminary, based on the best damage estimates available, and will be 
revised upward if needed, as in the process Congress followed with emergency 
aid to flood-ravaged Midwest states. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal aid package for Florida and Hawaii for hurricane damage in 1992 
totaled $8.5 billion, Panetta said, and about $4.5 billion was allocated for 
last summer's devastating Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the largest 
disaster they've had to deal with," he said. "They are dealing with 99,000 
applications (for aid)." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, backed at a midday news conference by a group of nine Democrats but 
only one Republican from the state's congressional delegation, is counting on 
bipartisan support for the proposal even in the face of Republican calls for a 
pay-as-you-go approach that would require cuts in other federal programs to 
finance quake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an emergency by any definition of the term," said Panetta. "We must 
ask the Congress and the country to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest chunk of money, $3.84 billion, will go to FEMA, mostly for 
infrastructure repairs, including $700 million for the city's devastated school 
system. Other funds will be used for temporary housing, crisis counseling and 
repair of public buildings, non-federal roads, water systems, government 
buildings and eligible nonprofit buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified school board President Leticia Quezada said the pledge "is 
an incredible reassurance and gives us tremendous hope" that the district will 
be able to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The next-largest allocation is $1.35 billion to help repair the region's 
damaged freeway system. The Department of Transportation money would go for 
clearing debris, emergency traffic operations and repair of roads and bridges, 
including the nine major highway failures in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration would receive $757 million in additional 
funds to write disaster loans to homeowners, renters and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in line to get $500 
million, $150 million of which would pay for 10,000 rental vouchers to allow 
families to move into new apartments with subsidized rents. HUD would also 
receive money for repairs to federally insured multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also requested a $400-million contingency fund to pay for 
unanticipated expenses from other federal departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances the federal government will pick up 90% of the FEMA 
expenditures, but some programs require a non-waivable 25% state match. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to travel to Los Angeles on Thursday and 
is expected to make several quake-related stops before receiving an award at an 
AIDS banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a House Appropriations Committee member who 
helped push for the swift emergency assistance, said the sometimes-divided 
California delegation "to a person was satisfied and very pleased with the 
federal response." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jerry Lewis of Redlands, a Republican member of the appropriations panel, 
echoed those thoughts, saying he "couldn't be more pleased" with the package. 
But he said "it may only be the beginning as (damage) numbers roll in." 
</P>
<P>
 California delegation members said that the powerful appropriations chairmen 
in both houses of Congress were backing the aid request. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer said they each contacted Senate 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) shortly after the 
quake to solicit his support for emergency funding. Both said they received 
assurances from Byrd that he would back whatever the Administration requested 
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Bob Byrd as soon as I saw what was happening. He committed his 100% 
support," said Feinstein. "I have assurances that the supplemental will be 
added to, both from the Administration and a willingness from Sen. (Robert J.) 
Dole, so I think we've got enough flexibility there." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Dole over the weekend had advocated that the quake aid 
be balanced by other budget cuts. But in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday, 
Dole passed up a chance to repeat the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some conservative members of Congress will certainly raise objections 
to the federal aid being "off budget," Administration officials are hopeful 
that the package can be approved on an accelerated legislative schedule. 
Panetta, who said the $6.6-billion supplemental appropriation request will be 
introduced today, hopes to have the legislation on President Clinton's desk in 
a little over two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would ask that Congress and the American people approach this with the 
same sense of compassion" that had been shown in other disasters, "and that the 
Congress act expeditiously," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many California Republicans could find themselves in the position of voting 
for the California aid package, despite voting against similar "off-budget" 
emergency aid for the Midwest flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the predicament, Lewis chuckled and then responded: "Consistency 
is not required in this process. A crisis becomes ever more real as it comes to 
your back door." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some members of the California delegation will undoubtedly be troubled by 
the plan. Fourteen Republicans failed to sign a delegation letter sent last 
week urging Clinton to seek emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said, "I don't think every time you 
have an emergency you have to reduce other spending, but there should be some 
offsets. It shouldn't be totally deficit-enlarging. I'd be more comfortable 
(with the package) if a respectable portion is not passed on to a future 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher, who is pushing for an amendment to the supplemental aid bill 
prohibiting disaster aid to illegal immigrants, said that if he is barred by 
the Democratic majority from bringing his amendment to a vote, he may withhold 
his vote for the aid request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, I'm in an unsure position." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's reluctance to say how much aid the state will provide for disaster 
relief was criticized Tuesday by some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the governor still believes it is too 
early to decide whether California should raise money through taxes or bond 
issues to contribute to the recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) described Clinton's proposal 
as "fabulous" and faulted Wilson for his cautious reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown noted that California will have to pick up at least 10% of the costs and 
said the state inevitably will need more money, either from a sales tax or 
gasoline tax surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Wilson's approach could be counterproductive because the governor 
is giving the impression that Californians do not want to contribute to their 
own recovery. That could cause a backlash in Congress, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think California's standing with the rest of the nation is one of a kind of 
selfishness," Brown said. "For us to be seeking assistance without first making 
a sacrifice is not terribly persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), whose district includes many of the 
hardest-hit areas, said he still believes a temporary sales tax hike may be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If $7 billion covered it, I'd be delighted," Hayden said. "But something 
tells me we ought to keep the sales tax issue alive a while longer, until we 
see what the total costs are." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden added: "We can't expect the national taxpayers to entirely subsidize 
us. We're going to have to do our share as well." 
</P>

Washington, Daniel M. Weintraub in Sacramento, and Mark Lacey and Stephanie 
Chavez in Los Angeles.

 * RELATED COVERAGE: A4-A7, A26, B1-B3, D1, D3 Federal Aid 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials Tuesday recommended $6.6 billion in new 
funding for earthquake recovery. Combined with $900 million already released to 
deal with the emergency, the total comes to $7.5 billion. Federal officials 
gave the following breakdown of the proposed spending: 
</P>
<P>
 * $3.4 billion to FEMA to rebuild public schools, roads and utilities and to 
provide temporary aid to individual quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * $1.3 billion to repair bridges, freeways and other portions of the 
transportation infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 * $757 million to the Small Business Administration for low-interest loans to 
homeowners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * $500 million for housing assistance under HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 * $400 million for a presidential contingency fund and a variety of programs 
administered by other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * $245 million for education system operating costs. In addition, $700 million 
of the $3.9 billion in FEMA aid would go toward school rebuilding and for the 
purchase of modular classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * $21 million for VA hospital repairs.

THE TIMES POLL; PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA STILL LINGERS FOR MANY; QUAKE: ONE-QUARTER 
OF RESIDENTS IN SAN FERNANDO AND SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS CITE MEMORIES AS BIGGEST 
PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's terrifying burst of pent-up geological energy fractured thousands 
of walls and foundations but also struck deep into residents' psyches, with 
half of those closest to the epicenter now saying it marked one of the worst 
experiences of their lives and nearly one in three saying the psychological 
aftershocks continue to be severe, a Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more than one in four residents of the hard-hit Santa Clarita and San 
Fernando valleys say the lingering psychological trauma of those horrible 
seconds is the biggest problem they face from the quake in the difficult days 
ahead, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.6 magnitude quake, the largest ever recorded in the Los Angeles basin, 
also delivered a devastating financial punch, with 42% of those living within 
five miles of the epicenter reporting cracked walls, shattered windows or worse 
damage to their homes. Hinting at the billions of dollars in private losses in 
addition to the cost of repairing freeways and public buildings, 88% of the 
775,000 adults in the area say they lost at least some possessions and nearly 
one in four calculated the damage to their houses at more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, white middle-class residents who make up the majority in the area of 
the epicenter reported slightly more overall damage. But the poll also found 
that Latinos and poorer residents were most likely to report the heaviest 
damage. Countywide, 4% of Latinos and 6% of very low income groups said their 
homes were unlivable because of the quake. Among the respondents, virtually no 
whites, blacks or adults from households making over $20,000 a year said their 
homes were uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, conducted this past Saturday and Sunday, interviewed adults in Los 
Angeles County and included 582 residents of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of sampling error for both groups is plus or minus four percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll did not reach those living in emergency shelters and outdoors, 
estimated to be in excess of 13,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are a small share of the county population and do not significantly 
affect the overall findings, said John Brennan, director of The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, loss of a job rather than damage to a home or property losses is the 
biggest worry and comes on top of the region's pre-quake economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Two out of five said they expect to be worse off financially after the quake 
than they were before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hit with a double-whammy," said Erika Schwartz, 49, a Canyon 
Country bookkeeper who lost her part-time job in Canoga Park because the 
building was badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago the recession took away a $60,000-a-year advertising job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," she said in a post-poll interview. "We have no cushion. We've 
been living paycheck to paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 The hardships of the quake are many and widespread, with those closest to the 
epicenter twice as likely as those in the rest of the county to see problems 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-six percent of the residents of the Santa Clarita and San Fernando 
valleys face at least a "good amount" of hardship of all kinds, compared to 
only 23% in the rest of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Linda Siegel, 32, a medical clerk who can no longer work during 
the week because traffic tie-ups would make it impossible to get home to Canyon 
Country from Tarzana in time to pick up her 6-year-old daughter from the 
baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she will work on weekends and have no days off with her husband, who 
works in Woodland Hills and faces a two-hour commute himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to see each other," she said of her husband, Mark, a graphic 
artist. "He's thinking of staying in the (San Fernando) Valley all week and 
just coming home on the weekends, when I will be going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such problems, the poll found that three out of four residents of the 
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys remain steadfast in their attachment to 
Los Angeles and are not ready to give up on the region. 
</P>
<P>
 And twice as many respondents, 29% compared with 15%, think that living in New 
York City is more dangerous than living in disaster-prone Los Angeles. Just 3% 
of respondents -- and 4% in the most heavily damaged areas -- said they will 
definitely move because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is "a wonderful place to live," said poll respondent Sue 
Danielson, a real estate agent who lives with her family in the Santa Clarita 
Valley hamlet of Val Verde. 
</P>
<P>
 "The climate is great, the economy is getting better. Everywhere you go in the 
world there are natural disasters. It doesn't matter where you go, you're 
always going to have to come up against something. Why leave just because the 
earth moved?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Danielsons were among the 43% of residents who said they were 
well-prepared for the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 They had attached bookcases to the walls and stored water, food, flashlights 
and a first-aid kid. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the family had practiced what to do when the quake hit, assigning 
each of the four children, ranging in age from 7 to 16, a specific duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live out here in the boonies . . . and when you live in earthquake 
country, you need to be prepared for earthquakes," she said, matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in an area that has tornadoes, you have to be prepared. When 
you live in a fire area, you have to be prepared for fire." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Cheryl MacDonald, a 50-year-old nurse who lives in Toluca Lake, 
has decided to leave as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her property losses were negligible, the emotional damage was not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably, all things considered, the worst" experience of her life, 
she said, "because I have no control over it, and I'm an in-control person. I'm 
very depressed. I'm upset. I want to move." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy living here . . . but I don't want to go through The Big One," 
she said. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the vast majority of residents not plan to leave, they don't plan 
to get out of their cars to help solve post-quake traffic headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though one in two commuters who live in the Santa Clarita and San 
Fernando valleys say their travel time will be lengthened by quake damage, 86% 
of those who drive to work alone say they don't plan to switch to mass transit 
or organize car pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the rest of the county remain just as attached to their autos, 
with 83% saying they will continue driving alone, even though one in five 
consider traffic problems their most severe difficulty as a result of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding is worrisome because plans for trying to ease quake-related 
traffic congestion depend heavily on persuading those who drive alone to switch 
to car pools, buses and trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread property damage and hardship related to the quake has 
undermined residents' confidence, but they are strongly supportive of the 
elected officials' response to the quake, with President Clinton getting a 77% 
approval rating and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 73%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's approval rating was 59% in the two valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three in five valley residents and one in two residents in the rest of 
the county fear that their houses would be unsafe in the event of "The Big 
One," defined as an earthquake in excess of eight on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
 And with scenes of collapsed and cracked overpasses fresh in their minds, 86% 
of the residents of the two valleys think freeways would be unsafe in a quake 
of that magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the county, 79% said they thought freeways would be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many believe that the destruction wrought by such a powerful 
earthquake is virtually inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the residents of the valleys and 58% of other county areas doubt that 
Los Angeles can take steps to minimize the damage from a quake that strong. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Northridge quake still fresh in their minds, nearly eight in 10 in 
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys and more than half of those in other 
areas of the county say they've felt nervous, had sleepless nights or that 
they've worried frequently about the earth's next devastating shudder since 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those affected by such feelings are earthquake veterans, such as 
36-year-old child psychologist Merilla Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family's home was destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar quake and they moved from 
one home to another for months, but she feels more fearful now. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who lost numerous fragile personal possessions when the quake shook her 
Northridge home, said that she finds herself wondering where her children will 
be if another one hits and that the hundreds of aftershocks continue to cause 
the thin veneer of normalcy she has tried to paint over her fears to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be feeling things are going to get back to normal and then we have five 
in a row, like we did on Friday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said she looks forward to the days when pictures are back on the walls, 
the garden wall is rebuilt and other damage repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 And she also has taken some steps to prepare for the next one, but has a long 
list of other precautions she wants to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely is foremost on my mind and it will be for a while," said Scott, 
who works in a Culver City mental-health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a long list of things I want to do to be prepared as time goes on . . 
. and I feel unsettled because I haven't completed that list yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that before Jan. 17, half of the residents of the Santa Clarita 
and San Fernando valleys had taken none of six recommended steps for protecting 
them from earthquake damage, such as securing loose objects or strapping down 
the water heater; only 13% of those in the two valleys had taken at least three 
of those steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, 60% of the residents of the two valleys say they have taken at 
least one additional precaution to protect their homes and 69% have obtained at 
least one additional emergency supply item. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar resident Benjamin Guzman, 22, is frantically trying to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
 He has strapped his water heater to the wall, bought a new flashlight, put a 
wrench next to the gas line and stored 10 gallons of water and a stash of 
canned food. 
</P>
<P>
 The dressers, which fell onto the Guzmans' bed moments after they leaped up, 
are now attached to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, he expects the trauma of running out of his still shaking 
house to see mobile homes exploding all around him to stay with him for the 
next six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes at night I kind of wake up wondering if and when another one is 
going to strike," said Guzman, a commercial loan service officer and a 
full-time college student. "The quake kept going and going and going and to me, 
every time there is an aftershock, I wonder if it's going to keep going." 
Valley's Reaction to the Quake 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys reacted to the quake 
differently from those in the rest of Los Angeles County, according to a Jan. 
22-23 poll of 1,116 Los Angeles County adults. 
</P>

Source: Los Angeles Times Poll How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,116 adult residents of Los Angeles County by 
telephone Jan. 22 and 23. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all 
exchanges in the county. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that both 
listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in 
English and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform with census 
figures for sex, race, age, education and employment. An oversample of 582 San 
Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley residents is included and weighted to 
its proper proportion in the countywide sample. The margin of sampling error in 
the total and valley samples is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For other 
sub-groups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be 
affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in which 
questions are presented.

WILSON SETS DEADLINE ON SMOG CHECK; ENVIRONMENT: THE GOVERNOR AGREES TO RESUME 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EPA ON TIGHTENING STATE'S VEHICLE POLLUTION CONTROL 
PROGRAM. BUT HE WANTS A COMPROMISE IN TWO DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson agreed Tuesday to restart negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration over strengthening California's vehicle Smog Check program, but 
set a deadline of just two days to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed to the resumption one day after EPA Administrator Carol M. 
Browner canceled the threatened cutoff this spring of $800 million in federal 
highway aid to California in a dispute over how the state should conduct 
vehicle smog checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner ordered the sanctions scrapped because they could jeopardize economic 
recovery after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials did not return calls seeking comment Tuesday on Wilson's new 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chief legislative negotiator, said that 
talks will resume today in Sacramento between state and federal officials. He 
said he believes the issue can be resolved swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, through his environmental secretary, James M. Strock, told 
Browner in a letter Tuesday that California would return to the bargaining 
table but a "final agreement with appropriate mutual guarantees in writing" 
must be reached by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock also laid out a series of other conditions that he said a settlement 
must contain, including protection against throwing Smog Check garages out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday deadline, Strock said, would enable an agreement to be written 
into urgency legislation and speedily passed to the governor by Feb. 2, the 
deadline Wilson faces for signing a California Smog Check reform bill passed 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That bill, carried by Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), is opposed by the EPA 
on grounds that it does not go far enough in cleansing California skies of 
automobile-caused smog. Wilson and others contend that the bill would meet 
federal standards without further disrupting the economy by putting Smog Check 
and repair operations out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, about 9,000 neighborhood service stations and garages both test and 
repair California vehicles for compliance with smog standards. The recently 
passed California bill would retain this system, but adopt a series of other 
clean air reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA proposal would consolidate the inspection process into a network of 
about 200 test facilities statewide that would be prohibited from making 
repairs. Supporters insist that it would be cheaper and more convenient for 
motorists and do a better job of reducing air pollution. The EPA plan is 
supported by several environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who participated in the first round of negotiations until their failure 
Jan. 7, disclosed the resumption of bargaining several hours after Wilson 
signaled his willingness to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said Browner agreed to send her chief of staff, Mike Lundenbergh, to 
represent her along with EPA regional administrator Felicia Marcus. He said 
other participants will include representatives of the Wilson Administration 
and key legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will resume negotiations to see if we can resolve this," Katz said. "I 
think we can fairly soon."

 Add one more to the long list of ills associated with coffee drinking. 
Researchers at UC San Diego report today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. that women who drink more than two cups of caffeinated coffee per day 
suffer a loss of bone density that can lead to bone fractures in later life. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have suspected such a link for several years, but the report 
provides the strongest evidence of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of 980 Anglo women in the Rancho Bernardo community had good news as 
well. The researchers found that the effects of the coffee were offset if the 
women also drank a glass of milk every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coffee is a diuretic that washes nutrients out of the body," said Dr. 
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of UC San Diego, primary author of the report. "I 
think the take-home message is that if you are going to drink more than two 
cups of coffee a day, you should be sure to consume enough calcium to restore 
your calcium balance." 
</P>
<P>
 The UC San Diego results are compatible with what he has seen in his own 
study, said Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University School of Medicine, 
director of the Nurses Health Study. "Coffee and caffeine do seem to be 
detrimental for bone density. But Barrett-Connor goes another step and suggests 
that this effect might be counteracted by increased calcium intake. That's not 
been shown before." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Barrett-Connor added: "Almost no woman in this country gets 
enough calcium." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the study also revealed that the women who drank the most 
coffee drank the least milk, so that those who most needed the calcium were 
least likely to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of ailments associated with coffee drinking has been growing in 
recent years. The latest results suggest that four cups of coffee per day 
increase the risk of heart attack 40% or more. It also might increase blood 
pressure. Some studies suggest that decaffeinated coffee raises cholesterol 
levels in blood. Caffeinated coffee may be linked to bladder cancer. Giving up 
coffee can cause depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies in rodents have shown that caffeine can deplete the body's calcium by 
causing it to be excreted in urine. But the eight to 10 human studies performed 
have yielded contradictory results, Barrett-Connor said, largely because they 
did not account for the women's intake of calcium. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one project, the massive Framingham study, indicated that women who 
drank more than two cups of coffee per day had as much as a 69% increase in the 
risk of serious fractures. Women have been the focus of such studies because 
they are more likely to lose bone density after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 850 women in the Rancho Bernardo study, ages 50 to 98, only 115 
reported little or no consumption of coffee, and seven said they drank only 
decaffeinated coffee. The researchers determined the women's lifetime 
consumption of coffee, milk and a variety of other potential risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that women who had drunk more than four cups of coffee per day for 
most of their lives, and little or no milk, had on average less than 90% of the 
bone density of women who drank fewer than two cups per day. In contrast, those 
who drank four cups of coffee and an average of a glass of milk per day had 
normal bone density for their ages.

LIGHT BRIGADE; FIRST SEGMENT OF BORDER TO BE LIT UP IN SHOW OF FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Four years after activists aimed car headlights at the Tijuana hills to 
protest illegal immigration, their slogan -- "light up the border" -- is 
becoming reality: the U.S. Border Patrol is installing high-intensity lights 
along the entire 14-mile San Diego-Tijuana line. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-mile stretch of lights will begin functioning within a month as part of 
a Clinton Administration plan to toughen border enforcement. As the traditional 
post-holiday influx of illegal crossing intensifies, the Border Patrol is 
preparing for a new high-profile deployment strategy in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem down here is that (illegal immigrants) basically own the night," 
said Gustavo De La Vina, chief agent of the San Diego sector where the patrol 
makes half of all arrests on the U.S.-Mexico border. "We own the day. But we 
are hampered by darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 The new deployment plan includes the hiring of about 350 agents -- and 172 
civilian employees to free other agents working in support jobs for enforcement 
duty -- according to Justice Department officials who asked not to be 
identified. In addition, 20 agents employed in detention duties will be 
replaced by private contractors and 78 positions lost to attrition will be 
filled, for a total of about 620 new agents on border duty, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a more effective use of our resources," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, four Southern California Congress members said Monday that the 
Administration's package may provide fewer agents than promised by a 
$45-million package recently passed by Congress. They urged Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno not to shortchange the perennially overworked Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years of fighting for adequate funding and a substantive increase in 
agents, we are unwilling to accept a lesser number," said the letter from Reps. 
Randy Cunningham (R-San Diego), Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon), Carlos Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) and and Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to San Diego last year, Reno had questioned the efficiency of 
the Border Patrol's deployment, pointing out that the 1,000-agent sector 
routinely has less than 100 agents guarding the border. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as staffing shortages, Border Patrol officials admit that hiring 
rushes during the 1980s allowed dubiously qualified, poorly trained recruits to 
slip through the system, resulting in abuse, misconduct and high turnover. More 
than 1,000 agents were hired in 1989 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "A priority of this Administration is that people are screened and hired in an 
efficient, professional and adequate way," the Justice Department official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lights are an extension of a program begun in 1990, when the Border 
Patrol installed tall stadium-type lights along a one-mile stretch of the 
Tijuana River levee that is a busy and often hazardous crossing area for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Those first lights were erected after protests by hundreds of demonstrators 
opposed to illegal immigration who parked on the U.S. side of the border and 
shined their headlights on crossing zones. They clashed verbally with 
counter-protesters, who charged that illegal immigrants were being made into 
scapegoats and who used mirrors to reflect the light north. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol officials say the use of spotlights has reduced crime and helped 
agents detect illegal immigrants, who often wait until dusk to attempt the dash 
north, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officials have wanted to extend the lighting along the border for some 
time, but had to await completion of an environmental impact study. U.S. Army 
construction crews began installing lights this month along five miles of 
rugged hills between the Tijuana River levee and the Pacific Ocean. Commanders 
hope to light the rest of the 14-mile strip by October. 
</P>
<P>
 Border-crossing traditionally increases in January, when immigrants return 
after spending the holiday season in Mexico. This year, De La Vina has been 
under political pressure to respond with a blockade similar to a recent 
operation in El Paso, where a shift of agents to the border proved to be a 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina insists that a full-fledged blockade would fail in San Diego 
because of differences in the landscape and in the immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in recent weeks the Border Patrol has positioned more agents 
close to the front lines. The high-profile deployment has succeeded in some 
areas, but has not stopped migrants from crossing in other areas, De La Vina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just weren't enough officers to contain the shift," De La Vina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers on the Mexican side say the beefed-up enforcement is having a 
visible impact. Crowds of would-be immigrants at the border have grown larger 
than usual because more of them are stymied by the Border Patrol's show of 
force, Mexican authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more vehicles and a greater presence on the other side," said Hugo 
Ayala, chief of the Grupo Beta police unit, which fights border crime and 
monitors the migratory flow. "Days go by and you see the same groups of people 
waiting to cross."

CAL STATE PANEL OKS 8.6% RAISE FOR PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite some hand-wringing over how it would look during a year of deep state 
budget cuts and student fee increases, a committee of the Cal State University 
board of trustees approved pay raises Tuesday averaging 8.6% for campus 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee on university and faculty personnel unanimously approved raises 
that would bring the average presidential salary on CSU campuses from $120,075 
to $130,461 a year, but not without a lively debate in which board members 
expressed feelings of pride, embarrassment, concern -- and anger -- over the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, trustee Ralph Pesqueira, a San Diego restaurateur, leveled what 
amounted to a preemptive strike against state legislators who may criticize the 
raises, especially if the state must slash more than $3 billion from yet 
another recession-grade budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so embarrassed that we have to cower at the threat of legislators who 
will criticize us and then turn around and raise their own salaries," Pesqueira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee vote is almost certain to guarantee full board approval, which 
is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the board rescinded pay raises for campus presidents after 
public uproar over the way former Chancellor Ann Reynolds pushed through a 
hefty raise for herself in a closed session. The scandal led to Reynold's 
ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, trustees have been loathe to handle the politically sensitive 
subject of executive pay. The result, Chancellor Barry Munitz says, has been a 
widening salary gap that has made it increasingly difficult for the 
327,000-student system to lure or keep campus presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his predecessor, Munitz has been aggressively public in his campaign to 
increase presidential salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 He first broached the subject in September, when he gave trustees a 1992 
California Postsecondary Education Commission survey that showed the top campus 
executives at 16 comparable schools -- such as Arizona State University -- 
making an average of $144,908 a year, while CSU presidents earned $120,075, 
about 17% less. Munitz also complained that campus executives' housing 
allowances were much lower than those of their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees approved a policy allowing Munitz to peg compensation to what was 
being offered elsewhere. In November, they approved his plan to increase campus 
presidents' housing allowances to as much as $18,000 a year under a schedule 
giving some presidents increases of 230% to 329% for housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Munitz was able to complete the circle when trustees approved more 
than $200,000 in presidential pay increases. Although the average raises were 
slightly less than 9%, some presidents received bigger boosts, such as Warren 
J. Baker at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, who will receive 18% more and be the 
highest paid at $146,343 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, trustee William Hauck, a consultant to Gov. Pete Wilson, expressed 
concern over how it could "send the wrong message" if CSU raised presidents' 
salaries while the governor and other constitutional officers have taken 
voluntary pay cuts and California taxpayers face another grinding state budget 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 William Moton, president of the CSU student association, questioned the move 
in light of stiff student fee increases and the recent budget hits taken by the 
university system. 
</P>
<P>
 Before considering the increases for presidents, trustees also approved 
faculty raises of 3%.

ON CALIFORNIA: OUTTAKES FROM THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite its awesome power and potential for severe, long-term repercussions, 
the earthquake is becoming, well, a bore. Michael Jackson and the skaters creep 
ever forward in the nightly news lineup. The Lakers are again a concern. Images 
of crudely bisected freeways and shattered apartments no longer elicit gasps. 
Stories of survivors no longer seem as riveting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually this way with natural disasters. It's usually this way with about 
everything. The collective attention span runs about three days, a few more for 
truly spectacular disasters. Then it all gets old. The process is natural, and 
probably in its way a form of healing. But it can have consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 As familiarity takes hold and tedium sets in, the television satellite trucks 
rumble away to wherever it is that television satellite trucks go when the 
world isn't ending. And after the cameras exit, so do the politicians and the 
insurance company field teams and all the rest of the good-neighbor brigade. 
The rhetoric returns to earth. The contractual fine print is re-examined. 
Promises are hauled away with the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 And has anyone been up to the fire zones lately? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A presumption about Los Angeles is that everybody lives in a ranch-style house 
-- just like mom, dad and the Beav. In fact, the percentage of 
single-family-home dwellers citywide has been in fast decline over the last 
decade or so. Today only about half of residents live in their own houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest are apartment tenants, and to thousands upon thousands of 
these renters, the earthquake's impact can be measured in days. Specifically, 
13 days: The quake hit on Jan. 17; rent commonly was paid up until the month's 
end. Thus, outside uninhabitable apartment buildings all over town, the 
complaint last week was the same: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was paid up in rent," a Northridge tenant explained, "until the end of the 
month, right? So the owner owes me 13 days of rent. That's about $400. I need 
that money to move into a new place. But he hasn't been around since the 
earthquake. I can't find him. And what about my security deposit? Do you think 
I will ever see that money?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days later, and the earthquake's enormity remains difficult to grasp. 
Six-point-six means nothing. Thirty billion dollars is impossible to 
comprehend. Flying into Burbank, tents and National Guard convoys and some 
empty parking lots can be seen. Still, it doesn't look so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the ground does some sense of scale emerge. I drove Monday for hours 
across the Valley, from Burbank to Studio City, from Reseda to Northridge. I 
didn't stop to talk to many people. Mostly I just looked -- at cracked 
apartment houses, tumbled mini-malls, condemned office buildings, shattered 
storefronts, vacant shopping plazas. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they are not all down in a row. No, they do not appear, at least from the 
outside, as pulverized as the Northridge apartments where so many people died. 
And yet they are wrecked all the same. And that was just the Valley. There 
wasn't enough daylight to explore the other side of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Orange County supervisors, backed by Gov. Wilson, really did apply for 
federal disaster relief because the scoreboard fell down at Anaheim Stadium. 
People who know baseball suggest a bigger disaster in Anaheim might be found 
any season in the Angels' bullpen, but that is a sports story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Metrolink debuted not long ago, passengers were allowed to ride free. 
This grace period helped them grow accustomed to both the trains and an 
excessively complicated ticketing procedure. Well, the grace period came and 
the grace period went, and then so did much of the early ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, because freeways broke where they did, Metrolink found itself 
positioned to attract some badly needed business. Demand increased tenfold 
overnight. So, did Metrolink officials let the new commuters ride free? They 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the first, crucial images of the train system after the quake 
were TV shots of frustrated novices trapped in three-hour lines, waiting for an 
opportunity to figure out the ticket machine. No wonder so many Antelope Valley 
commuters decided to take their chances on the two-lane. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined that the federal government could ever run short of 
bureaucrats and forms? That, of course, was what happened last week at the FEMA 
centers. This week it is different. This week the engineers of government are 
back on their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This line," a sign at Balboa Park announced Monday to baffled earthquake 
victims, "is for current appointments and teleregistration returnees with 
CONTROL NUMBERS ONLY." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that's government in action, whatever it means.

REP. DON EDWARDS WILL RETIRE; POLITICS: DEAN OF STATE DELEGATION HAS BEEN 
CHAMPION OF CIVIL RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the dean of the California congressional 
delegation and a champion of civil and constitutional rights, announced Tuesday 
that he will retire in November after 32 years in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the most liberal members of Congress, Edwards, 79, served as 
chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
for 23 years. He played a role in passing the historic Voting Rights Act of 
1965 and was one of the most active members in Congress opposing the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "For his entire career, Edwards has been a true stalwart in the fight for 
justice in this country," said Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for 
Democratic Action. "All who have faced the lash of discrimination, whose 
freedom of speech has been threatened . . . and countless others owe 
Congressman Edwards an enormous debt of gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Edwards spearheaded an effort to unify a California 
delegation deeply split along partisan lines. He helped found the California 
Institute, a private, nonprofit research organization designed to work with the 
delegation to promote California interests on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is unique because he is a principled and deeply caring guy who really 
believed in the delegation and what we were doing here," said Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City). "He has been willing to work with most conservative 
Republicans, people who have disagreed with him on every ideological issue, to 
try and create a California agenda. He has never let his ideology undermine his 
commitment to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said he decided to retire after finishing a 12-year battle with the 
Reagan and Bush administrations on civil rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there ever was a time, this is it when things are looking up and when I 
have a few years left to do things with my grandchildren," Edwards said. "We 
haven't been able to have a dog for the last 25 years. That is kind of 
significant because we'd like to have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' second wife, Edith B. Wilkie, is executive director of the Arms 
Control and Foreign Policy Caucus, a bipartisan congressional coalition with 
more than 100 House and Senate members. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Edwards was first elected to Congress in 1962, he seemed an unlikely 
candidate to lead the civil libertarian charge on Capitol Hill. He came from a 
well-to-do San Jose family, had served as chairman of Young Republicans in 
California and was a state amateur golfing champion. He served as an FBI agent 
in 1940 and 1941, was a Naval intelligence officer during World War II and 
earned a fortune after starting the Valley Title Co. in San Jose in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few weeks of his arrival in Washington in 1963, Edwards served notice 
that he intended to be an activist in civil liberties when he was one of only 
20 members to vote to abolish the House Committee on Un-American Activities. It 
was not until a dozen years later that Edwards' motion to eliminate the special 
House committee was passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was one of only 16 lawmakers who voted against a bill in 1967 making 
flag burning a federal crime. He led the House floor passage in 1971 of the 
Equal Rights Amendment, which would give women a constitutional right to 
equality. The proposed amendment fell three states short of ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 His Judiciary subcommittee resisted dozens of proposed amendments, ranging 
from introducing prayer in public schools to outlawing busing for the purpose 
of integrating public schools, which Edwards considered attempts to weaken 
constitutional rights. His subcommittee also enacted several laws reversing 
Supreme Court decisions during the Reagan and Bush years that limited voting 
rights, equal educational opportunity and fair employment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to Congress, we didn't have any civil rights to speak of that 
were worth anything," Edwards said. "Black people and Hispanics were 
discriminated against and we had apartheid just like South Africa. We have made 
major strides in civil rights and I'm proud to be a part of them."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CITY'S EMERGENCY STAGE GIVING WAY TO RECOVERY 
PHASE; OPERATIONS: ATTENDANCE AT TEMPORARY SHELTERS WANES. EXTRA POLICE 
DEPLOYMENTS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE VALLEY AND THE LAPD WEST BUREAU.

 Los Angeles city officials struggling with the earthquake's aftermath shifted 
from an emergency footing to a recovery mode Tuesday, consolidating shelters, 
cutting hours at the main operations center and returning police to their 
regular shifts in all but the severely damaged areas of the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopefully winding down this emergency stage," said Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan, "although it won't be fully wound down until everybody is in 
homes and shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 The head-count at more than 34 Red Cross and Salvation Army shelters -- 
including four encampments of Army tents in the Valley -- had dropped to 7,675 
Monday night from more than 12,000 the night before, according to city 
officials, Red Cross and Salvation Army executives and National Guard officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 17 transitional shelters being operated by the city, attendance 
continued to fall steadily, and was down by about 500 people to 405 Monday 
night, said Frank Catania, director of planning and development for the city's 
Department of Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are . . . trying to get people into long-term shelter or back into their 
homes," Catania said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie Williams said that the city's emergency operations center, 
which has bristled with activity around the clock since the quake hit last 
week, will ratchet down its hours, operating instead from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m., 
seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said his troops will now pull back into a modified mobilization, with 
extra deployments limited to the San Fernando Valley and the LAPD West Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Commander Dave Gascon, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said police 
in the Valley will remain on emergency status, with officers working 12-hour 
shifts. The Valley also will receive extra support from a temporary deployment 
of 160 officers from the downtown Metropolitan Division and about 20 extra 
traffic officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's West Bureau will return to regular eight-hour shifts, Gascon 
said, but it will be buttressed by an extra layer of 80 to 100 supplemental 
officers who will remain mobilized on 12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said the redeployments will provide welcome relief for exhausted 
police, who have been working 12-hour shifts throughout the city since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the scale-backs, the displaced quake refugees on Tuesday continued 
their weary quest for a restoration of something approaching normality. 
</P>
<P>
 Faye Washington, general manager of the city's Personnel Department, said her 
workers had received countless demands for assistance. Particularly pressing, 
Washington said, is the demand for Armenian translators for quake victims in 
the Hollywood area and for infant formula for the hundreds of babies whose 
families were uprooted by the calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Water and Power reported that Monday night's rainstorm cut 
off power to 4,000 customers, mostly in the Valley, but service was fully 
restored by Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Water-line repairs were continuing however and parts of the West Valley were 
still under a directive to boil all water before drinking. The directive is 
expected to remain in effect until Thursday morning, said DWP General Manager 
Dan Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said that nearly 900 leaks have been repaired in DWP lines since the 
quake. He said crews have reduced the backlog of unrepaired leaks to 21 in the 
valley and about 15 on the West Side. 
</P>
<P>
 "But aftershocks continue to rock us," Waters said, noting that about 2,000 
customers in the Granada Hills area still are without water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be very surprised if we have a tremendous problem because our water was 
not sewage contaminated," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control 
for the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is conducting a survey of private physicians and medical clinics to 
determine whether they have been treating an unusually high number of 
gastrointestinal complaints since the earthquake, Fannin said. Drinking 
contaminated water can lead to nausea, cramps and diarrhea, which can lead to 
dehydration and other medical complications if left untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin and other public health officials warned residents of Valley areas 
where the boil order remains in effect that they should not brush their teeth 
with tap water. They also noted that unless fruits and vegetables are cooked, 
which kills bacteria, they should wash their produce in boiled or bottled 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boil order is lifted, they should let faucets run for 15 to 20 
minutes to cleanse pipes of impure water, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien, head of the city's Building and Safety Department, said he 
expects housing inspections to be completed by the week's end. So far, a 
whopping 15,552 housing units have been declared unsafe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, inspectors will begin resurveying "red-tag" buildings that this 
week were declared unsafe for occupancy, in the hopes that repairs will allow 
upgrades of many to "yellow tag" status -- meaning that limited occupancy has 
been approved. The upgrade would mean that residents can enter the buildings 
and retrieve belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall death toll from the quake climbed to 60 Tuesday with the death of 
a Reseda woman injured in a car crash about 20 minutes after the initial 
magnitude 6.6 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzia Raziye, 22, died at Kaiser Foundation Hospital-Woodland Hills at 2:46 
a.m. Tuesday, according to Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Raziye was severely injured when her car crashed into another vehicle at 
Saticoy Street and Mason Avenue in Canoga Park at 4:50 a.m. on Jan. 17, police 
said. Officers said the crash was considered earthquake-related because it 
occurred at an uncontrolled intersection at which the street lights and traffic 
signals had been knocked out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's death was listed as the 57th fatality in Los Angeles County 
connected to the temblor. A Rancho Cucamonga woman in San Bernardino County 
also died. In addition, the overall toll now includes two men who died in a 
helicopter crash in Kern County while checking for earthquake damage to a 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, county hospitals had treated more than 9,200 people injured in 
the quake. For 1,495 of them, the injuries had been serious enough to require 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals said there was an increase in patients who have been living in 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night's rain just exacerbated the health problems seen in these tent 
cities," said David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern 
California. "Without proper sanitation, refrigeration and food preparation, we 
expect to see more admissions." 
</P>
<P>
 One worry of health authorities is an outbreak of communicable diseases, 
particularly chicken pox. But they cautioned that the incubation period for 
chicken pox is 13 to 21 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any child that acquired exposure in the camps won't get their pox until 13 to 
21 days later," Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that it would 
open a new Metrolink station in Sylmar today, about six weeks ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 No parking is yet available at the station, at Hubbard and First streets. A 
403-car lot will not open until Feb 21. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second day in a row, ridership topped 25,000 Tuesday, the majority 
coming from the Antelope Valley, a Metrolink official said -- causing the rail 
service to borrow additional passenger cars from Toronto, Canada and the San 
Francisco Bay area to handle the growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, declaring she would be a "friendly banker" to 
earthquake victims, proposed a state package of $1.3 billion to rebuild public 
structures, including damaged classrooms. She said she envisioned her plan as 
part of a "team effort" to be combined with President Clinton's proposed 
$7.5-billion federal aid plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the state money, about $1 billion, would come from state investment 
funds that could be lent to school districts at 4.3% interest, Brown said. She 
described it as sort of "a bridge loan" that would be repaid from future 
earthquake-repair bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $234 million could come from the sale of bonds approved by California 
voters in 1990 to retrofit public buildings following the Loma Prieta 
Earthquake in Northern California in the fall of 1989, she said. The rest, 
about $74 million, is in unsold school bonds, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents California beginning to step up to the plate to match the 
federal effort," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 26 county facilities closed by the quake are four courthouses, 
including Beverly Hills Municipal Court, Van Nuys Municipal and Superior courts 
and a San Fernando courthouse; three Department of Social Services offices on 
Vermont and Canoga avenues and on West Pico Boulevard; five Health Services 
facilities, a mental health facility in Santa Monica and the downtown Hall of 
Justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block said damage at the Hall of Justice has rendered the 
department's data systems there -- from computers to automated fingerprint 
systems to criminal history information -- at least temporarily useless. He 
said the cost of repairing the building -- an estimated $100 million -- is so 
high that the structure probably will be permanently vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning news briefing Tuesday at the disaster assistance center in 
Hollywood, federal Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros said 
that the more than 15,000 dwelling units declared uninhabitable in the city of 
Los Angeles represent "a fair-size small town that has to be rebuilt, almost -- 
in terms of the housing stock -- immediately to provide housing for people. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a simple task to get people into housing, there's money involved," 
Cisneros continued. "But without housing, peoples' lives are destabilized. So 
it becomes one of the most critical things we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Under HUD's housing-voucher system, 4,500 people already have certificates in 
hand "and are now looking for apartments in the San Fernando Valley or other 
areas that they choose," Cisneros said. "And families are now moving in daily." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council moved to prevent the eviction of tenants who do 
not pay their rent for apartments that have been rendered uninhabitable. Under 
the proposed law, tenants would not have to pay rent on unusable units at least 
through February. 
</P>
<P>
 The council earlier acted to forbid landlords from using earthquake damage as 
an excuse to evict tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers also voted to send a notice to landlords notifying them that 
within three weeks they must refund rental and security deposits for housing 
that is no longer habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials said "unused" rent, for the period from the quake to 
end of the month, should also be refunded within three weeks. But 
representatives of an apartment owners group said the law is unclear on that 
point and that rent refunds would be difficult, because the money has already 
been spent. The council is expected to take up that question some time this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, said that 
as of 6 p.m. Monday, 64,674 people had registered for disaster assistance. 
About 40,000 had registered by phone and the remainder at the 16 disaster 
assistance centers that have been set up across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Small business Administration officials said they have thus far issued 
40,000 applications for home loans, 3,200 for business loans and 1,400 for 
economic injury loans. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, garbage contractors have collected 3,000 tons of debris in the San 
Fernando Valley since the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross announced it is opening 15 service centers from Fillmore to Los 
Angeles where quake victims can meet with a counselor who can help them obtain 
beds, linens, groceries and other items necessities to get their lives back to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Centers in the Valley are located at the First United Methodist Church of San 
Fernando, the Woodland Hills Church of Christ, Our Lady of Perpetual Hope in 
Santa Clarita, and the Masonic Temple in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, campus President Blenda Wilson gave a 45-minute 
presentation to state trustees Tuesday on the extent of damages, which she said 
had turned the campus into "a money sieve." A team of asbestos-removal experts 
alone, working around the clock, costs $20,000 to $25,000 a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz said there was little that could be done to 
prevent such damage in a quake as severe as this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a building is sitting on the epicenter of the 6.6 earthquake, it doesn't 
matter what you do to it, how much money you put into it," he said. "It's going 
to go down." 
</P>
<P>
 A humorous note was struck when trustees inquired about a portion of a damage 
report, distributed by Wilson, which stated that at Building 5 of the 
University Park Apartments: "All snakes to be removed prior to occupancy . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some student in the building had pet snakes, we know not what kind," she 
replied. "At each briefing, I asked if there were volunteers to remove them and 
I haven't had one yet. We will find the snakes some day."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH; TRANSPORTATION: NEARLY 
TWO DECADES AGO, CAR-POOL LANES WERE UNPOPULAR. BUT AFTER THE TEMBLOR, CALTRANS 
IS TRYING THEM AGAIN ON THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 When transportation officials opened car-pool lanes on the crippled Santa 
Monica Freeway this week, their decision awakened a ghost seemingly laid to 
rest nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In an experiment turned public relations fiasco, transportation officials in 
1976 converted two fast lanes on the jammed freeway into diamond lanes -- 
meaning they were reserved for buses and car-pools -- between Santa Monica and 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic eased somewhat, but the project was so unpopular that motorists staged 
protests, lawsuits were filed and a federal judge ordered that the experiment 
be dropped after just 21 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, the state transportation agency, was so battered by the experience 
that it changed the name for such lanes to HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) lanes 
and pledged to leave the Santa Monica Freeway alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't every day that we have an earthquake," said Charles J. O'Connell, 
deputy district director at Caltrans, which reversed its position after last 
week's temblor and opened six miles of HOV lanes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Is the public willing to accept that kind of measure during 
an emergency situation? I think they are," he said. "We would hope they are." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot has changed in Los Angeles in the intervening 18 years, but O'Connell 
and other transportation officials opted for the car-pool lanes only after 
lengthy discussions, and then with a high degree of trepidation. Caltrans 
remains so skittish about the lanes that it rejected suggestions to extend them 
the entire length of the freeway, opting to limit them to stretches near 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a bitter taste in a lot of people's mouths," said Caltrans 
spokesman Russ Snyder. "History looks back and says it was a failure and didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who helped sink the 1976 experiment, 
supported the installation of the lanes this time, saying the emergency 
situation warranted it. But Yaroslavsky said Caltrans will have to sell him and 
other Los Angeles commuters on the idea over the next few months if it intends 
to make the lanes permanent, particularly because that would mean removing two 
lanes from the overall traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot will depend on how it works," Yaroslavsky said. "If it works well, 
people like me could be persuaded. If it doesn't work, we have to be adult 
enough to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports show that the lanes -- one in each direction -- are barely 
being used by commuters. A Caltrans count shortly after 7 a.m. found a single 
vehicle using the car-pool lane during a five-minute period -- while 40 
vehicles passed in other lanes. Half an hour later, after rush hour picked up, 
officials recorded two cars using the special lane during a one-minute period 
-- while 25 cars passed in the go-it-alone lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans blamed the low use on ignorance of the new lanes and the availability 
to commuters of other routes away from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But some transportation officials predicted that the lanes will never catch on 
with Santa Monica Freeway drivers, who continue to resist efforts to drive in 
car-pools -- and remain a different breed from most freeway commuters in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beach people will not car-pool," said one traffic technician. "They can't 
share a surfboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Eric Julber, whose lawsuit in 1976 was instrumental in killing the 
diamond lanes, said he was uncertain whether the lanes would catch on with 
commuters this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been away from Los Angeles for several years," he said from his new 
home in Northern California. "Such problems are far from my mind."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TENT CITY MAY BE DAMP, BUT SENSE OF COMMUNITY 
PREVAILS; SHELTER: QUAKE REFUGEES SAY THE NOISE OF RAIN IS COMFORTING -- AND 
HELPS DROWN OUT THE SNORING AND THE BABIES CRYING.

 You go to bed early when you sleep in Tent City. It's like living on a farm 
and turning in with the chickens. Except this is Los Angeles, and the sound of 
the sirens and the chop of the copters overhead lull you into an uncomfortable 
repose. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night at Reseda Park on Victory Boulevard, where a makeshift refugee 
camp housed about 500 earthquake victims, there was also the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 It began shortly after dusk and fell in gray needles throughout the long 
night, piercing the roofs of green canvas army tents, dripping down onto faces 
like the cruelest of water tortures. 
</P>
<P>
 At its hardest, the rain swallowed even the wail of the anonymous sirens, its 
sledgehammer blows waking you up, making you feel the cold outside like an 
unwanted bedfellow, as though this were some urban camping trip gone terribly 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
 But these were hardy souls, this gathering of working-class men and women -- 
most from Central American countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and 
Nicaragua -- pious people who stared unflinchingly at the ink-stained skies and 
gave thanks for what little they had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I don't mind the rain," said Leticia Lopez, 41, a nurse's assistant 
from El Salvador. Under the bright lights of a soccer field, she slept in an 
oblong tent with 17 others, most of them relatives who, like her, had been 
driven by the temblor from their nearby apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a downpour, but it has a nice rhythm and it helps me go to sleep. It 
drowns out the sounds of the babies crying and the men snoring. That's the 
worst sound of all, that snoring. You can hear it in your nightmares." 
</P>
<P>
 The helpers -- National Guard soldiers, Red Cross workers and wide-eyed 
volunteers who showed up here offering a hand -- searched for words to describe 
this collection of 40 tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer camp in the wintertime, some said. Family boot camp. Or some 
water-logged Purgatory. But there were brighter images. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a community campground you see along the freeway," said Jim 
Alexander, a first lieutenant with the National Guard -- the unofficial police 
chief of some 70 Guard troops who help supply security here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't need us here as policemen. These people are taking care of 
themselves. I've seen it happen before. When a crisis occurs, instead of 
causing problems, people pitch in and help. People do." 
</P>
<P>
 This Tent City, like the others, did not exist a few days ago. People appeared 
in droves at the Reseda Park Recreation Center the morning the quake hit. They 
slept under trees, cooked meals in the public grills, set up pup tents. But it 
was not until Saturday, when the National Guard moved in, that this bustling 
city took form. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers used mallets to drive the wooden stakes into the ground and 
string up the tents, many of which had been used during the Korean War -- tents 
they said a prayer would hold up amid the oncoming wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some did. Others leaked like jailhouse roofs, turning the grass floors of 
these temporary living quarters into a mud-and-water cocktail. But few 
complained. Speaking Spanish in quick bursts, they moved their Red Cross-issue 
cots to another corner of the tent and went back to sleep, listening silently 
to the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the middle of the night, there were patrols to count heads and take 
stock of the water damage. Their flashlights darting about the park, the beams 
capturing the full force of the drizzle, Red Cross center manager Liz Dewar and 
Tom Murotake, a National Guard staff sergeant out of Long Beach, walked the 
squishy grounds on night patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the wife of a San Bernardino County pastor. He is a family man. But on 
this night, they were soldiers of ill-fortune. Their beams moved across the 
sleeping faces. The cots were lined up barracks-style in tents that smelled of 
musty canvas and waterlogged clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cots were clumped together in family groups, a baby carriage or child's 
truck here, a wrinkled suit on a hanger there. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, you could see the mist as their hot breath hit the early morning 
chill and you knew their noses, hands and feet were cold to the touch. The 
leakiest tents were abandoned. In the end, the Guard troops shook their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these tents have been around for a long, long time," Murotake said, 
hurrying to get in out of the rain. "Tomorrow, when the weather turns, we'll 
fix 'em up real good with epoxy." 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee and the diapers, like everything else here, were free. After 
completing a form, new residents were issued a cot, blankets and a Red Cross 
comfort kit containing essentials such as toothpaste and shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the promise of something for nothing brought opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of cots were lost to people who showed up at the park, collected their 
handouts and walked off. There was the woman who demanded a red cot, not a 
green one, and then disappeared as quickly as she had come. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday night, armed soldiers were stationed inside two tents that held 
enough supplies to feed an army. "Some guys were coming in here with camouflage 
pants, saying they were Guardsmen," said Valsin Francois, holding an M-16 
rifle. "But they didn't fool me. They didn't have name tags." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the phone fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, two telephone companies supplied a block of a dozen phones for 
earthquake victims to call worried relatives back home -- anywhere in the world 
-- free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake, volunteers say, was that the phones were at first placed along 
busy Victory Boulevard. Soon, news of the free calls rumbled through the 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were coming in by the busloads," said volunteer Steve Novak, who flew 
to the San Fernando Valley from New York City after hearing about the quakes. 
"People were calling Iran and Pakistan and India." 
</P>
<P>
 Murotake said: "I saw a guy with a phone book where all the names were in 
Arabic. There was a woman, some marketing representative, making her calls all 
around the country. It was, like, out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a fight broke out between two men arguing over the length of a 
call. The police were summoned and the phones were moved near the office and 
restricted to use by National Guard troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were selfless acts of charity, too. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, well before the warehouse of Red Cross supplies arrived, people 
appeared with donations. A woman brought 100 homemade sandwiches. Another 
produced 200 meals purchased at a McDonald's. Still another brought food for 
stranded pets. Indian food arrived from Beverly Hills, clothing from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point these lawyers and hairdressers from Orange County showed up with 
a truckload of hot dogs and the Red Cross was saying, 'Get it out of here' and 
an LAPD cop on the scene was insisting that they be fed to people. They were 
really going at it," said Lorin Ginsberg, a volunteer emergency medical 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the mountain of ice -- hundreds of bags piled up on the grass 
near the tennis courts like some mound of melting snow. No volunteer could 
remember where the ice had come from. Or what they were going to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glitches, a family atmosphere has grown in this Tent City and 
others like it: Volunteers have bummed cigarettes from Guard troops, then 
bought them small gifts in return. Addresses have been exchanged. And embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a rap band showed up unannounced and performed a free concert. Early 
Tuesday, a woman and her 8-year-old son offered a bed for the night to a 
teen-ager shivering in a thin blue blanket. And then there is the goose that 
playfully chases the children every morning. And the little boy with the bow 
and arrow who walks up to the soldiers and says, "Hey soldier, where's your 
gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 One night, while Sgt. 1st Class Louis Ortiz played his harmonica for a group 
of people, a woman approached and said that in her country, people ran in fear 
from men in uniforms. "She had tears in her eyes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sense of community has its limitations. Not everyone abides by rules 
against alcohol or public urination. Some husbands complain that other men gawk 
at their wives. Then there are the crying babies. And sometimes the stench from 
the nearby public outhouses wafts through the tents like a bad breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sick bay, several children screamed as they were treated for 
chickenpox. Their parents complained of headaches, colds or diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident said a cockroach had crawled into his ear while he slept. He 
screamed in agony as workers struggled to extract the bug, grinding his teeth 
and praying aloud. Finally, with the bug in sight, the medical team was forced 
to give up and send him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Tent City's command center is like some near-deserted Army 
outpost. Deserted Jeeps are parked chaotically. With the lights dimmed since 10 
p.m., the generator's steady hum is no longer heard, nor are the voices that 
once chattered inside the tents in the darkness. The dawn would come slowly, 
almost imperceptibly, with the geese that populate the park honking like drill 
sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, wrapped in blankets and wool caps, the residents emerged from 
their shelters. They built fires, made breakfast and stomped their feet to stay 
warm. The brave ones splashed cold water on their faces, trying to come alive 
and face another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would go off to work. Others would play a waiting game. Waiting for 
repairs to their damaged homes. Waiting for better weather, for better times. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for night to come again in Tent City.

 The Northridge earthquake pummeled large parts of Los Angeles with two 
distinct pulses of energy -- the second and stronger of which may have 
accounted for some of the unexpectedly violent shaking on the Westside, 
scientists said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena field office said sensors 
showed that the second pulse occurred on the Westside and in Hollywood about 
five seconds after the shaking was initiated there by the arrival of secondary 
earthquake waves. In some other areas, it occurred after three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists Susan Hough and David Wald said the second pulse marked the most 
violent instant of the earthquake south of the Hollywood Hills and Santa Monica 
Mountains. Hough described it as a burst of energy that contributed to the 
damage to buildings and freeway structures caused by the quake as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary waves, which cause the noticeable shaking in an earthquake, are 
marked by surges of energy, or pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 The two separate phases in the magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake were not of the 
same relative intensity in all parts of the city. For instance, in the northern 
San Fernando Valley, the first pulse caused more violent shaking than the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Wald said in an interview that scientists believe radio reports are 
exaggerating by saying that there may actually have been two 6.6 quakes 
occurring within seconds of one another at the same point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not venture to call them separate quakes," he said of the two pulses, 
"They were part of the same rupture." Hough agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quake was complex, as many of them are," Wald said. "We've seen this 
before. There are seismic events, and within those events, there are 
sub-events." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Californians who felt the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake may remember 
that there was a second, more violent pulse in certain neighborhoods in that 
magnitude 5.9 jolt as well. The shaking began and then suddenly intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists think the 1992 Landers quake had as many as seven pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 The pulses of the Northridge quake are clear; they show up on the sensors put 
in place by the state Division of Mines and Geology at various points in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hough said the interval between the first pulse and the second pulse varied 
according to the position in the basin. Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson 
added that one of the most important studies of the Northridge earthquake will 
be an attempt to determine the details of how energy emanated from the rupture 
zone to various parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists cautioned that there will be many different analyses of the 
Northridge earthquake, and that a full understanding of the event will not be 
reached for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 In another theory to surface this week, Tom Henyey, executive director of the 
Southern California Earthquake Center at USC, said scientists are studying the 
possibility that although the source of the shaking was at a single point, 10 
miles under Northridge, two different thrust fault planes may have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 One, he said, would have been on a shallowly dipping plane, to the northeast 
toward Granada Hills, Sylmar and the Santa Clarita Valley, and the other would 
have been on a steeper fault to the northwest, toward Canoga Park and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Henyey said there appear to be two distinct clumps of aftershocks, one to the 
northeast of the epicenter and the other to the northwest, with relatively few 
aftershocks in the space between them. 
</P>
<P>
 If two different fault planes were involved, it would help explain the 
confusion last week when scientists first tentatively named one fault system as 
responsible for the Northridge earthquake, only to name another two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Wald agreed Wednesday with the other scientists that all quakes are 
complicated, and he said he expects to do research on the direction, or what he 
said may be the "double-directivity" of last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Directivity has to do with the concept that a quake often seems pointed in one 
direction, with most of the damage in that direction. It is often clearer, 
however, in cases of long faults than relatively short ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Landers earthquake, for example, seemed to aim its power to the north, out 
into the desert, where few people lived. This seemed to be the major reason 
that damage to the south of the epicenter was less than might have been 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge earthquake appears to have shot its energy in many 
different directions. Damage was extensive in such widely separated directions 
from the epicenter as Hollywood, the Westside, Tarzana and the Santa Clarita 
and Simi valleys, in addition to the San Fernando Valley communities closest to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take us some time to look at the directivity of this earthquake," 
Wald said. "But this is not shockingly different than in the past. The Sylmar 
quake (of 1971) was also complicated." A Second Pulse 
</P>
<P>
 Two scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey have found a distinct -- and 
violent -- pulse of the Northridge earthquake. Sensors in place before the 
earthquake show the second pulse hit the Westside and Hollywood about five 
seconds after the onset of secondary waves, which are responsible for shaking 
people can feel. This may help explain the destruction that occurred 
unexpectedly in those areas. The sensors, placed by the state Division of Mines 
and Geology, give three readings at each location. 
</P>
<P>
 Types of Waves 
</P>
<P>
 * Primary (P) waves travel quickly, between 3 and 4 miles a second, 
compressing rock ahead of them and elongating it behind. They are not 
immediately felt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secondary (S) waves, traveling about 2 miles a second, cause undulating 
movement that is felt sharply at the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA CITY HALL SENSOR READING 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is 13 miles south-southeast from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 MOORPARK SENSOR READING 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, in Ventura County, is 22 miles west-northwest from the epicenter.

U.S. MAY SEND PATRIOT MISSILES TO PROTECT SOUTH KOREA; ASIA: THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION SEEKS TO SEND SIGNAL TO THE NORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration is considering sending Patriot anti-missile 
batteries to South Korea to strengthen U.S. forces there and help discourage 
any possible attacks by North Korea, officials here said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which still requires a final decision by the President, was 
requested two weeks ago by Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, 
in the face of a continuing buildup of North Korean troops along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Defense Secretary Les Aspin has given preliminary approval 
to the proposal and that the Administration has begun sounding out key members 
of the House and Senate Armed Services committees on whether they would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials insisted that the move is not related to North Korea's 
refusal to allow international inspectors to visit its nuclear facilities, 
deployment of the Patriots would be a visible symbol of U.S. resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-missile batteries, which were used during the Persian Gulf War to 
protect U.S. troops against attacks by Iraqi Scud missiles, would be deployed 
near key harbors or military airports and would be operated by U.S. crews. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear how much protection the batteries could provide, considering 
the multitude of potential targets and the limits of Patriot technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriot's performance has been a matter of some controversy. The weapon 
initially was given high marks by the military during the Persian Gulf War, but 
later assessments suggested that it was nowhere near as effective as it had 
been billed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials now say that later versions of the missile have been far more 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that initial conversations with key members of Congress have 
suggested that lawmakers generally would back the Administration if it chose to 
ship Patriots to South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been under pressure to take a bolder stance in 
pressuring North Korea to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and 
it clearly is hoping that granting Luck's request will satisfy those critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations defense 
subcommittee, recently called the threat of nuclear weapons development by 
Pyongyang the nation's No. 1 security problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA has said it believes that North Korea already has developed the 
technology to assemble a nuclear bomb and that it may have built one, possibly 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear how many Patriot batteries ultimately would be sent to South 
Korea if President Clinton decides to proceed with the plan. Officials said 
that Luck had asked for two but that the Pentagon may decide to deploy more. 
</P>
<P>
 The batteries, designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles in flight, 
presumably would be relocated from U.S. bases in Europe and transported by ship 
to South Korea -- a process that could take as long as two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials stressed Tuesday that the plan to send the Patriots is "not an 
emergency" decision. "There is no effort to rush this," a knowledgeable 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military strategists have become increasingly worried about the massing 
of forces by North Korea near the South Korean border over the last several 
years. North Korea is believed to have 750,000 troops within a few miles of the 
South Korean border. Recently, the North Koreans have begun shipping more 
tanks, artillery and advanced equipment into the area.

SOMALIA FEARS RISE AS PEACE FORCE DWINDLES; AFRICA: U.N. OFFICIALS WORRY ABOUT 
A NEW OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although images of stick-limbed, swollen-bellied babies no longer numb the 
minds of workers in Somalia, U.N. officials are troubled by hints of potential 
disaster as the peacekeeping force there dwindles in size and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shaky situation, a touch-and-go situation," said Jan Eliasson, the 
Swedish diplomat who is departing as U.N. undersecretary general for 
humanitarian affairs. "What we fear is an outbreak of hostilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Security Council two weeks ago, U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned, "Though the fight to end famine in Somalia has 
been successful, several indicators suggest that in the past few months 
malnutrition levels are again on the rise in parts of Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.N. and private relief officials, however, stress that large-scale 
feeding of the population has not resumed. Moreover, most private agencies, 
while acknowledging the persistence of troubling signs, insist that, compared 
with the dispiriting scenes of a little more than a year ago, the current 
relief situation in Somalia is a marvel. 
</P>
<P>
 A Nov. 29-Dec. 1 conference of Somali leaders and foreign relief workers 
convened by Eliasson in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa concluded that the 
mass starvation and malnutrition that first brought U.S. Marines to Somalia a 
year earlier had ended. It was now time to close out mass feeding programs and 
start reconstruction and development projects such as laying roads, building 
schools, clearing mines, supplying electricity and purifying water. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the United Nations has 25,000 peacekeeping troops in Somalia. In 
addition, the Clinton Administration deploys 5,500 U.S. troops in the Horn of 
Africa nation and almost 4,000 others on ships offshore. After 18 U.S. soldiers 
died as the result of a raid last October, however, President Clinton announced 
the withdrawal of all U.S. troops by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the U.S. deadline passes, Boutros-Ghali expects to be able to field no 
more than 16,000 peacekeeping troops, almost all from the developing world, a 
large number without adequate military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali wrote that "the security 
situation in many parts of Somalia has given rise to concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the secretary general said, "the countryside continues to enjoy a level 
of security far superior to that of 18 months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the capital of Mogadishu, the situation, according to the secretary 
general, was less sanguine. He reported that "armed banditry on the streets of 
Mogadishu has grown considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief discussion of food shortages, Boutros-Ghali said that "in the lower 
Juba Valley . . . acute malnutrition among children under five has doubled to 
20%." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has been complicated by a shortfall in the November-December 
harvest.

MAN BEHIND 'PEROT PHENOMENON' SEES BIGGER CHANGES AHEAD; JOHN J. HOOKER, A 
FLAMBOYANT DEAL-MAKER, ENVISIONS A 1996 CAMPAIGN WITH FIVE CANDIDATES FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's made and lost several fortunes. He's never held public office after a 
lifetime of lusting to be President. In his hometown, he's derided as a 
flamboyant blowhard and has-been by people who in their next breath praise his 
visionary brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, John J. Hooker, lawyer, deal-maker and world-class eccentric -- the man 
credited (or blamed) for orchestrating Ross Perot's entry into the last 
presidential campaign -- is getting ready for 1996 with an even bigger idea: 
the end of American politics as we know it. Just remember you heard it from him 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the "Perot phenomenon" he helped engineer fizzled like a bad 
spoof of a Frank Capra movie; Hooker says that doesn't matter. "The Perot 
phenomenon had nothing to do with Perot!" he said the other day. (In 
Hooker-speak, every sentence ends with an exclamation point.) "It had to do 
with the American people wanting to take the government back, wanting one-man, 
one-vote and wanting to feel like true participants!" 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for 1996? This is Hooker's vision: five candidates, all 
with their own political parties, running for President in the general 
election. One would be a Democrat, one a Republican, one would represent the 
far left, another the far right, and Hooker is betting that one will be Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come in America when people are going to have candidates that 
will speak their point of view on a more meaningful basis than is possible 
under a two-party system!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennial Democratic insider Bert Lance, Hooker's co-conspirator in 
formulating this theory of the American political future, put it another way: 
"We're going to see a ballot that looks like America." 
</P>
<P>
 With five strong candidates, no single person likely could win sufficient 
votes in the Electoral College, and selection of the President would be thrown 
into the House of Representatives. Hooker and Lance argue that this would be 
the start of coalition government, with various political factions uniting over 
common interests to pick a President. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say this is a recipe for chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see serious social and economic problems if the House elected the 
President," said George Barrett, a Nashville attorney active in state 
Democratic politics and a longtime friend of Hooker. "It would open the door to 
the selection of a demagogue." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a contradiction embedded in the proposition, Barrett contends: 
While such a system would appear to give various constituencies a stronger 
voice in government, the actual selection of a President would be made by the 
435 Washington insiders who make up the House of Representatives. He sees this 
as far less responsive to the people than the current Electoral College system. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of running this theory past friends in private, Hooker and 
Lance took it public recently, spelling it out before an audience of Neiman 
Fellows at the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot proved that a candidate can get on the ballot and win 19% of the vote 
without support from the two major parties, even while running a "bad 
campaign," Lance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker and Lance predict that either Patrick J. Buchanan or Pat Robertson, 
recognizing that they have no chance of winning the Republican Party 
nomination, will launch an independent candidacy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker, a liberal who won overwhelming black support in his races for 
Tennessee governor in 1966 and 1970, said that he is actively courting the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson to run in 1996 as the independent leftist candidate. He 
suggested, however, that the two-time presidential candidate lacks the fire to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Jackson would say only that Hooker is a "friend" and would 
not comment on a possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sander Vanocur, the former TV political and diplomatic correspondent who is 
now working at the Freedom Forum, criticized the plan as a Balkanization of the 
electoral process that would lead to congressional government. "You all want 
excitement in politics," he said. "I don't think you can govern with 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker and Lance insist that they are not advocates. "I'm not at all happy 
about what is taking place," Lance said. "I'm just saying change is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not above agitating to help make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging Perot to enter the race, Hooker said, was the first step to the 
realization of this vision. 
</P>
<P>
 And what qualifies these two discredited politicos to advance such a theory? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kovach, former New York Times Washington bureau chief and now director of 
the Neiman Fellowship, introduced Lance at the forum as having a keen 
understanding of American politics -- a man so integral to the Jimmy Carter 
White House that when he resigned as budget director in 1977, the 
Administration lost its effectiveness and vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance, now a business consultant in Calhoun, Ga., resigned because of a 
congressional investigation into allegations of mishandling funds at his 
Georgia bank. He was indicted on 33 federal counts of bank fraud, but a jury 
acquitted him of nine counts in 1980; the other counts were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned as bank chairman in 1986 and agreed to pay a fine after being 
charged with violating federal security laws and making questionable loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his troubles, Lance's political judgment is respected. Walter F. 
Mondale nominated him -- unsuccessfully -- as Democratic Party chairman in 
1984, and Lance chaired Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign and advised 
Jackson in his 1988 bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker also has the ear of the politically powerful, despite being dismissed 
by many for his flamboyance and much-vaunted lack of personal discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Jay is erratic, psychotic and brilliant," said Raymond Thomasson, an 
aide to Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter. "John Jay has an uncanny, unnatural 
ability to read individuals, to read groups of individuals and the winds of 
change and predict where things may go. . . . He is absolutely a visionary." 
</P>
<P>
 John Siegenthaler, the Freedom Forum director and a former aide to Robert F. 
Kennedy, remembers being on hand in 1968 when Hooker eloquently and movingly 
persuaded Hubert H. Humphrey to denounce the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 But this serious side is often hidden by the cartoonish character he created 
for himself to play four decades ago while still in law school. The character, 
who wears a cream-colored homburg, dark vested suit, collar pin and gold watch 
fob, is in part a homage to his father, a larger-than-life Nashville trial 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from advancing his new political theory and planning a book, Hooker, 63, 
is launching a new business venture. He describes it as being like the Domino 
Pizza franchise, only offering home-delivered full-course meals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Hooker made his first fortune with Minnie Pearl's Fried Chicken. 
He had several hundred outlets when a Securities and Exchange Commission probe 
led to its collapse during his 1970 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when Hooker helped orchestrate Perot's entry into the presidential 
race, he was widely described in newspaper articles as a "flamboyant 
millionaire." People who know him well say he was dead broke, a condition from 
which he has yet to extricate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he still keeps up appearances while plotting his financial and political 
comeback. Still wearing his trademark uniform, he quickly takes charge of any 
room he enters -- flirting with any woman in sight -- and he still insists on 
picking up the dinner check. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be in a room with John J. Hooker and not know who he is!" he 
exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Edith Stanley contributed to this story. Vision or Political 
Folly? 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Hooker is described as a brilliant deal-maker whose serious side is 
often masked by the cartoonish character he's created for himself.

NETWORKING AMONG REBEL GROUPS TROUBLES MEXICAN GOVERNMENT; REVOLT: CHIAPAS 
REBELS' CALL TO ARMS IS ANSWERED BY A SHADOWY PEASANT UNION THAT HAS OPERATED 
IN COUNTRY FOR TWO DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Mexico's Indian rebels did not have to wait long for a reply to their 
call early this month for other organizations to join their struggle: The next 
night, a car bomb exploded in a shopping center here. 
</P>
<P>
 The rash of subsequent bombings and bomb threats in the capital and other 
cities bore the mark of the Revolutionary Worker Peasant Union of the People 
Party-Party of the Poor, a shadowy urban guerrilla group that has operated in 
the country for the two decades since the last rural insurgents were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The peasant union is the patriarch of the country's guerrilla groups, 
descended directly from the schoolmaster-turned-rebel-hero Lucio Cabanas, who 
led the army on a seven-year chase through the hills of southwestern Mexico 
until he was killed in December, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the peasant union has pulled off sporadic feats of urban 
terrorism, such as the bombing of IBM Mexico headquarters and a McDonald's 
restaurant two years ago, providing a constant reminder that Mexico may not be 
quite as stable or as friendly to foreign capital as its leaders portray their 
country to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas, on the 
southern border, is a call to arms for the peasant union and other rebel 
groups, suspected to be scattered throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of armed groups have grown frequent in parts of Hidalgo and Veracruz 
in the east, as well as Oaxaca and Guerrero in the south, states with 
traditional ties to the peasant union's urban guerrillas. Many of those rural 
bands are thought to be defense groups that Indians and peasants formed to 
protect themselves against gunslingers hired by local ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent news weekly Proceso reported that last spring, 80 people from 
the town of Paso de Aguila on the Tehuantepec Isthmus in the south bought guns 
and took to the hills. Gunmen from a local ranch ransacked the Indian village 
four times in four months, convincing townsfolk they had to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A little farther north, the Eastern Mexican Democratic Front Emiliano Zapata 
-- named for the same revolutionary hero the Chiapas guerrillas chose to honor 
but otherwise seemingly unrelated to them -- has also taken up arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For more that 40 years, we asked for help from the Agricultural Reform 
authorities without getting a solution," representatives of the group wrote in 
a letter to Amnesty International. "For that reason, we decided to form an 
independent organization to defend the interests of our people." 
</P>
<P>
 The group claims to have recovered more than 80,000 acres -- communal lands 
they accuse rich ranchers of having stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of organizations can easily switch from defensive to offensive 
tactics, fast becoming guerrillas, said Jose Luis Moreno, a researcher at the 
Center for Studies of Armed Movements, a small think tank of former rebels who 
study Mexico's resistance movements. "If people are being killed, they organize 
to defend themselves," he said of the armed peasant groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He suspects that the Zapatistas in Chiapas began as a self-defense group and 
then turned to aggression when they grew frustrated that their peaceful 
protests brought no results. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno and his colleagues at the center are clearly impressed by the size and 
discipline of the Zapatista forces. "It goes for beyond anything we were ever 
involved in," said Moreno, who served two years in prison for his participation 
in kidnapings and bank robberies when he was part of the Sept. 23 League, a 
guerrilla organization. His sentence was cut short by a 1977 amnesty for 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts at the center also said they were impressed by the ties in other 
states, besides Chiapas, that allowed the Zapatistas to claim responsibility 
for destroying two electrical towers in central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The networking among rebel groups appears to be among the biggest worries for 
the Mexican government as it awaits the Chiapas guerrillas' reply to proposals 
for peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from the Interior Ministry, the peasant union and the 
Zapatistas already are in contact with each other, raising the threat of a 
network of violent underground groups that could disrupt the country 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The peasant union is the product of a merger between urban and rural 
guerrillas. After the army killed Cabanas, a group of his followers led by his 
brother, David, went underground. They were committed to continuing the 
struggle but had lost both their tactician and commissar when Cabanas died. "It 
was a difficult period, mainly because nearly all of us lacked a theoretical 
base," David Cabanas said in a 1991 jailhouse interview. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1976, the Cabanas group -- the Party of the Poor adjunct to the 
organization's name -- had made contact with the peasant union. It was founded 
in 1964 from the remnants of a guerrilla movement in the northern border state 
of Chihuahua, and in the 1960s and early 1970s was another set of initials in 
the alphabet soup of rebel movements that robbed banks and kidnaped politicians 
and industrialists throughout Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly before contacting the Party of the Poor, the peasant union hit on 
a strategy not previously tried in Mexico: the war of attrition. "Their 
trademark became bombings," Moreno said. Shopping centers, banks and government 
offices were the usual targets. Then there was the statue of the soldier in a 
prominent intersection of Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 The group would bomb the concrete statue, leaving the figure crooked. City 
officials would restore it and a few months later, the guerrillas would bomb it 
again. Moreno and his colleagues tell this story with humor but stop short of 
discounting the group as a force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their practices are different from what we attempted, the creation of an 
army, " Moreno said. "The truth is, they are into their strategy and we are out 
of circulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing at the urban guerrillas, or even criticizing them, is dangerous. In 
1984, Francisco Fierro Loza won third prize in a contest for essays about the 
history of the state of Guerrero. His theme was the Party of the Poor. In July 
of that year, he was found murdered. A communique from the peasant union stated 
that he had been "judged" for falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, two security guards at the left-leaning newspaper La Journado 
died when a bomb delivered by peasant union partisans exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Ministry officials refused repeated requests for interviews or 
information about the urban guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the peasant union, no one is sure how large or how strong it is. "That 
is part of the advantage in being clandestine," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain is that authorities have consistently underestimated the urban 
guerrillas. The government has declared the group vanquished various times: 
when David Cabanas was arrested in 1990; after Felipe Martinez Soriano -- the 
former rector of the University of Oaxaca, who denies any ties to the group -- 
was imprisoned as the mastermind behind the deaths of the newspaper security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, the guerrillas have staged another assault. The group has attacked 
police stations to steal arms or planted another of its trademark bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 After this month's bombings, eight people were arrested, all of whom deny 
membership in the group. Proletarian, the group's newspaper, which is 
distributed secretly at centers such as public universities, also denies that 
the jailed suspects are guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a measure of how the government is now treating rebel groups, though, after 
the latest bombing arrests, officials offered no new claims of having destroyed 
the peasant union. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot of people underground," said Moreno, who noted that 
poverty and desperation encourage others to join armed movements, whether in 
the hills or cities. "To the extent that people propose change peacefully and 
change does not come about," he said, "armed struggles will erupt -- as many 
times as is necessary."

'HIGHLY POSSIBLE' HOSOKAWA MAY QUIT, AIDE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation "is highly possible," 
Hosokawa's chief personal adviser said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prime minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling to a 
position," Shusei Tanaka said."He has made it his principle to live up to his 
promises." Tanaka was referring to Hosokawa's pledge when he took office in 
August to "assume responsibility" if he failed to enact political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, Hosokawa denied that he might resign if the political reforms are 
not enacted by Saturday, when the current legislative session ends. Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, however, refused to confirm or deny 
Tanaka's prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, 21 upper house members of Hosokawa's coalition rebelled to help 
defeat a political reform package that would have constituted the biggest 
overhaul of Japan's electoral and political system since the U.S. occupation 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa had made the reforms the core of his policy for a coalition that took 
power after the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority.

RUSSIAN WHISTLE-BLOWER CALLS CLOSED TRIAL 'A CRIME'; RIGHTS: SCIENTIST WHO 
PUBLICIZED CHEMICAL ARMS PROGRAM FACES ARREST AFTER REFUSING TO APPEAR IN 
COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian scientist who publicized a covert chemical weapons program and is 
now being prosecuted for revealing state secrets said he expects to be arrested 
today after refusing to appear at a closed-door trial that he calls a Stalinist 
farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Vil S. Mirzayanov, the first dissident under the government of President Boris 
N. Yeltsin, said a warrant was issued for his detention Tuesday after he failed 
to appear in court to participate in what he calls "a crime" against human 
rights and the new Russian constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old chemist expects to be sent back to Lefortovo Prison, the 
notorious former KGB jail where he was held for 12 days in October, 1992, after 
publishing an article saying the top-secret Moscow laboratory where he worked 
had produced a binary chemical weapon more potent than any previously known. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of revealing state secrets, Mirzayanov will face up to eight 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to prosecute the whistle-blower -- and to do so behind closed 
doors -- raises questions about Russia's commitment both to human rights and to 
chemical disarmament. It dismays U.S. officials, who have broached the issue 
with the Russians repeatedly, and who lodged another diplomatic protest on the 
eve of President Clinton's recent visit to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov argues that he did not reveal state secrets, because he neither had 
access to nor disclosed any technical information on the making of the chemical 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he argues that his prosecution violates Russia's newly adopted 
constitution, which requires that a law be published before it can be used to 
prosecute. The government's definition of what constitutes a state secret has 
never been made public, according to his lawyer and the human rights defenders 
who have rallied to his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the evidence against Mirzayanov is an order marked "Top Secret" and 
signed by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. The order, which Mirzayanov 
obtained while preparing his defense, states that information about chemical 
weapons shall be added to the list of state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin's order is dated March 30, 1993 -- months after Mirzayanov's 
arrest. Mirzayanov's lawyer argued that such a retroactive prosecution is 
unconstitutional -- a position that Russian and Western human rights defenders 
have championed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Dr. Mirzayanov is convicted, would it mean that every time the state 
agencies find it unpleasant to have certain issues raised, there will be a new 
law adopted to retroactively punish disseminators of information?" said a 
statement from the Andrei Sakharov Foundation, a human rights group named for 
the Nobel Prize-winning dissident physicist and headed by his widow, Yelena 
Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seemed to influence the three-judge panel, which denied each of 
Mirzayanov's motions and appeals Monday, according to the chemist and his 
lawyer, who emerged periodically from behind the worn courtroom door to brief 
reporters waiting in the dingy hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov likened the proceedings to "something from a movie about trials in 
the 1930s," in which an avenging prosecutor denounces "enemies of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Leonid S. Pankratov told the judges that Yeltsin had said that 
although the Soviet Union no longer exists, "Russia has the same secrets, so 
let's proceed on that basis," Mirzayanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov, a mild-mannered ethnic Tatar, is an unlikely dissident. His very 
name, Vil, is an acronym for Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and he spent 30 years 
quietly serving the Soviet war machine. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes his prosecution is intended to intimidate other scientists who 
might challenge Russia's still-powerful military-industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov alleges that field testing in the chemical weapons program 
continued as late as 1992 -- after Yeltsin had promised to abide by an earlier 
Soviet-U.S. pledge to ban large-scale chemical weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
 The program may not be a violation of international agreements, however, as 
Russia had not specifically pledged to ban development of chemical weapons. In 
January, 1993, Russia did sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans 
development, production and storage of such weapons. But the treaty has not yet 
been ratified and will not come into effect until January, 1995, at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov warns that the Russian chemical weapons research Establishment 
wants to keep the new binary weapon secret precisely to avoid having to destroy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Mirzayanov's trial comes at a time of Western optimism about 
Russia's willingness to dismantle its chemical arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two chemical disarmament accords, signed earlier this month during the 
Clinton-Yeltsin summit, were described by U.S. officials as "a breakthrough" 
and "real progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The accords commit the United States and Russia to eliminate chemical weapons 
stockpiles, and they allocate U.S. money to help Russia safely reprocess its 
poisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution of Mirzayanov for squealing on the chemical weapons program is 
perplexing because Russian officials have made a point of publicizing and 
repudiating many Soviet-era sins, from 1950s radiation experiments on soldiers 
to recent leaks at nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov said the explanation is simple: The Yeltsin government is too weak 
to control the military-industrial complex and could not stop his trial even if 
it wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell everybody that the totalitarian regime in Russia has changed its form, 
but not its essence," Mirzayanov said. "The KGB, the prosecutor . . . and, as 
you see today, the court all serve the military-industrial complex."

DOLE, IN GOP RESPONSE, JABS AT HEALTH CARE PLAN; REACTION: SENATOR INSTEAD 
PITCHES 7-POINT OPPOSITION PROPOSAL. DEMOCRATS PRAISE 'FIRED UP' CLINTON AFTER 
SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Taking aim at President Clinton's call for universal health care, Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) charged Tuesday that the Administration's 
plan would produce more taxes and government control while reducing quality and 
limiting choice of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, giving the official Republican response to Clinton's State of the Union 
Address, called instead for action on "common sense solutions" that would stop 
well short of the President's program of guaranteed coverage for all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected Clinton's argument that the nation faces a crisis in health care, 
adding: "But we will have a crisis if we take the President's medicine -- a 
massive overdose of government control." 
</P>
<P>
 The response set out the battle lines for what will be the major clash of the 
congressional session. The Administration's comprehensive health package, which 
makes significant changes in the current system, will compete with a major plan 
by opponents, which advocates modest adjustments without changing the roles of 
government, insurance companies and the medical Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is banking on the conclusion that people are unsettled enough 
about health costs and their medical security to take on the larger overhaul; 
Republicans and many conservatives believe that people, even if initially 
intrigued, will become more skeptical about a big government solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole charged that Clinton's program would cost $1 trillion more over six years 
than it would generate in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the House chamber where the President spoke. Democrats cheered lustily 
when Clinton outlined his approach to health care while Republicans sat on 
their hands. Afterward, when Dole received his television time, the Republican 
leader unleashed his frontal attack using a complicated chart to buttress his 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's idea is to put a mountain of bureaucrats between you and your 
doctor," Dole asserted. "We can fix our most pressing problems without 
performing a triple-bypass operation on our health care system." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole outlined a seven-point program that he said would guarantee continued 
coverage for everyone with health insurance and bar denials of coverage for 
pre-existing conditions or a serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
 This program would help uninsured low-income Americans pay for health care 
through tax credits or vouchers, he said, while individuals who buy their own 
insurance would get a 100% tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Clinton spoke, the House Republican Policy Committee denounced his 
health care plan with these words: "Only in ivory tower isolation could 
academic ideologues create a plan to take over 14% of the economy, cripple job 
creation, hinder technological and pharmaceutical breakthroughs and ration 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, however, were energized by Clinton's emotional address. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fired up tonight,' said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.). As for the chances 
of doing what the President wants, Glickman said: "It's not going to be a bed 
of roses or a piece of cake, but we can get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Whip Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), however, added a somber note. 
"The problem is, I don't know how we're going to pay for all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Republicans and Democrats leaped to their feet, applauding and cheering, 
when the President endorsed legislation to lock up three-time violent offenders 
for life. Even Dole praised the President for talking tough about crime but 
asked: "Will he act on it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dole told his audience that Republicans were outnumbered by Democrats in both 
the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when the President spoke tonight, he knew that whatever he really wants, 
he stands a good chance of getting, because most Democrats will vote with him," 
Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole questioned Clinton's commitment to tough crime legislation and 
welfare reform. And he challenged the President on defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one place the President has cut (the budget) drastically is precisely the 
wrong place: national security -- slashed to the lowest levels since before 
Pearl Harbor," Dole asserted. "History tells us, and many of us know firsthand, 
that America cannot afford to have a hollow military."

THE STATE OF THE UNION; THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The objectives outlined in President Clinton's State of the Union speech 
conflict with ever-more-restrictive budget constraints. In his 1995 budget, 
Clinton will ask for roughly $16 billion to finance new domestic initiatives -- 
slightly more than half of the $29 billion he originally planned to request 
from Congress. But just to receive $16 billion -- an 18% increase over last 
year's investment agenda outlays -- Clinton must reduce spending in 
"non-priority" programs. So far, the Administration has not disclosed a full 
list of winners and losers in the 1995 budget he will present to Congress on 
Feb. 7. But a partial list of those already divulged indicates the direction 
the Clinton agenda will take this year. WINNERS 
</P>
<P>
 * EDUCATION -- The largest increase in the education budget will go to 
Clinton's Goals 2000 program, which is slated to receive $600 million to $700 
million in funding. The initiative is designed to create national academic and 
skills standards for elementary and secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMPLOYMENT -- Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich plans to unveil a 
training-and-skills agenda to help U.S. workers remain competitive in the 
global economy. It will be highlighted by an initiative to transform the 
unemployment system into a "re-employment system," with the long-term 
unemployed receiving educational and training opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEALTH AND WELFARE -- A big beneficiary within the Department of Health and 
Human Services is the National Institutes of Health, which will get a 4.7% 
funding hike. Others include the Head Start program, targeted for an increase 
of $550 million to $1 billion; AIDS research, including funding for the Ryan 
White Act, and the WIC nutrition program for pregnant women and infants. 
</P>
<P>
 * LAW ENFORCEMENT -- Among the short list of winners in the battle for scarce 
federal dollars are the Justice Department and crime prevention programs. To 
fund an anti-crime bill expected to pass Congress soon, the Administration has 
allocated an extra $2.5 billion for 1995 to help put 100,000 more police 
officers on the streets, provide money for "boot camps," and finance prison 
construction. Over five years, the Administration plans to spend about $22 
billion on anti-crime initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * COMMERCE -- For the first time in memory, the Commerce Department has become 
a top priority at the White House. The Administration plans a 12% increase in 
the department's budget for 1995, primarily to help fund new technology 
initiatives. One of the biggest beneficiaries is the Advanced Technology 
Program, an initiative to re-create the Pentagon's success in fostering 
technological research and development on the civilian side. It would receive 
about $451 million in 1995, up from $190 million. LOSERS 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUSING -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development appears to be an 
unexpected casualty of the White House budget wars. The Administration is 
imposing new cuts on HUD that rival those of its Republican predecessors. For 
example, the Administration plans to cut programs for renovating and building 
traditional public housing by about $2 billion. Clinton is targeting programs 
that fund construction of new public housing units and renovate old ones. On 
the positive side of the ledger, programs for the homeless are expected to get 
a boost of about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * AGRICULTURE -- Another big loser in the Clinton budget is the Agriculture 
Department, which was a major target of the Administration's "reinventing 
government" task force. The 1995 budget will include a plan to close more than 
1,200 farm program field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * DEFENSE -- The biggest blow of all will land at the Defense Department, 
which is feeling the effects of the end of the Cold War. Clinton decided not to 
give the Pentagon $21 billion to cover the anticipated costs of inflation over 
the next five years, and he told defense officials they must fund $9 billion in 
military pay raises over that period by taking money from other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSPORTATION -- The Transportation Department fought off steep budget cuts 
proposed by the Office of Management and Budget, but the Administration still 
plans to cut operating subsidies for mass transit systems. The Federal Aviation 
Administration will see its budget frozen at 1994 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * INTERIOR -- Faced with steep budget cuts, the Interior Department will 
eliminate 860 jobs in its personnel division alone. Similar personnel cuts will 
be felt at a wide range of other agencies, ranging from Veterans Affairs to the 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposal to provide $6.6 billion in emergency aid for 
earthquake-ravaged Southern California will not count against the budget 
ceilings, and therefore will not reduce the amount available for other Clinton 
priorities.

THE STATE OF THE UNION; CLINTON TEXT: THERE'S MUCH WORK AHEAD, HE SAYS

From Federal News Service

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is the text of President Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday 
night:  
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the 103rd Congress, my fellow 
Americans. I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope 
we can talk about the state of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this 
chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself "A Man of 
the House," and he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of the people, 
a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American middle class. Tip 
O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from or who sent him here. 
Tonight, he's smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord's gallery. 
But in his honor, may we too also remember who we are, where we come from and 
who sent us here. 
</P>
<P>
 If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we 
simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education and a fair 
shot at the American Dream, they will do extraordinary things. 
</P>
<P>
 We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations 
are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such change, to use 
it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad. But for too long 
and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted. 
Dream Slipping Away 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years the 
wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12 years of 
trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our 
national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth 
in a half-century. For too many families, even when both parents were working, 
the American Dream has been slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 the American people demanded that we change. One year ago, I asked all 
of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. And I 
want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who broke 
gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a 
Congress in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 This Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion 
dollars, cut spending and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest Americans. 
This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward 
work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the Brady bill, now the Brady 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 This Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small 
businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It produced 
more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood immunizations, more 
support for women's health research, more affordable college loans for the 
middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give 
something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a 
dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a 
domestic high-tech economy. 
</P>
<P>
 This Congress produced a new law -- the motor voter bill -- to help millions 
of people register to vote. It produced family and medical leave -- all passed, 
all signed into law, with not one single veto. 
</P>
<P>
 These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office, 
and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress. But I am 
persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay 
our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire. But what we do here is really 
beginning to change lives. Let me just give you one example. 
</P>
<P>
 I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one 
father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was unusual to see 
a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three 
children there, one of them in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 And I came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I 
was walking off, and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said: "Mr. 
President, let me tell you something. My little girl here is desperately ill. 
She's probably not going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because of the family leave law, I was able to take time off to spend 
with her, the most important time I ever spent in my life, without losing my 
job and hurting the rest of my family. It means more to me than I will ever be 
able to say. Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a 
difference. It does." Work Has Just Begun 
</P>
<P>
 Though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans 
still haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't 
touched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant. 
There's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very 
difficult times and look to us for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create 
more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward welfare 
-- work over welfare -- to promote democracy abroad and to begin to reclaim our 
streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to renew our own American 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit 
that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in spending, 
including entitlements, in over 340 separate budget items. We froze domestic 
spending and used honest budget numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the vice president, we've launched a campaign to reinvent government. 
We've cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines. After 
years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose actions expanded 
it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next five years. By 
the time we have finished, the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point 
in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in 
the 1980s, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the 
deficit. So on April 15, the American people will discover the truth about what 
we did last year on taxes. Only the top one -- yes, listen -- the top 1.2% of 
Americans, as I said all along, will face higher income tax rates. Let me 
repeat, only the wealthiest 1.2% of Americans will face higher income tax rates 
and no one else will, and that is the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said 
this plan wouldn't work, but they were wrong. When I became President, the 
experts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion, but because 
we acted, those same people now say the deficit's going to be under $180 
billion, 40% lower than was previously predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and 
the lowest interest rates in 20 years, and because those interest rates are 
down, business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the rate of 
the previous four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto sales are way up, home sales at a record high. Millions of Americans have 
refinanced their homes and our economy has produced 1.6 million private-sector 
jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous four years combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early 
results -- proud. But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that 
there is more to do. Next month I will send you one of the toughest budgets 
ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300 programs, 
eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the way in which government buys 
goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending 
ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring the deficit 
down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle 
class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you will stick 
with this plan, we will post three consecutive years of declining deficits for 
the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White House. And once again, the 
buck stops here. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the 
world. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive 
edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers. In one year, 
with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and the national export 
strategy, we did more to open world markets to American products than at any 
time in the last two generations. 
</P>
<P>
 That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people, low 
deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers and high 
investments. These are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we want to 
take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you 
all know we must do more. 
</P>
<P>
 As we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the 
technologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and 
create jobs for our people here at home. 
</P>
<P>
 As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental 
technologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight for 
a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed 
Superfund program. 
</P>
<P>
 And the vice president is right: We must also work with the private sector to 
connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in America 
into a national information superhighway by the year 2000. Think of it. Instant 
access to information will increase productivity. It will help to educate our 
children. It will provide better medical care. It will create jobs. And I call 
on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information superhighway 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must 
continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, 
because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in 
its bounty. But we all know, too, we can do all these things -- put our 
economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, 
guarantee equal opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work 
unless we also give our people the education, training and skills they need to 
seize the opportunities of tomorrow. We must set tough, world-class academic 
and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and 
students the tools they need to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment 
with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or 
having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we 
measure every school by one high standard: Are our children learning what they 
need to know to compete and win in the global economy? 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grass-roots reforms, and I hope 
Congress will pass it without delay. Our school-to-work initiative will for the 
first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of 
apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the people we're counting 
on to build our economic future won't graduate from college. It's time to stop 
ignoring them and start empowering them. 
</P>
<P>
 We must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new 
re-employment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going 
while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have a new system 
to move people into new and better jobs because most of those old jobs just 
don't come back. And we know that the only way to have real job security in the 
future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the 
ability to learn new ones. So we've got to streamline today's patchwork of 
training programs and make them a source of new skill for our people who lose 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-employment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic 
renewal. I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also 
revolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work; it defies our values as a 
nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare more 
attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child support 
absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of 
their children. If we value strong families, we can't perpetuate a system that 
actually penalizes those who stay together. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the 
government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a 
grandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong and we ought to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked on this problem for years before I became President, with other 
governors and with members of Congress in both parties and with the previous 
Administration of another party. I worked on it with people who were on 
welfare, lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
 And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue: The 
people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on 
it. They want to get off welfare; they want to go back to work; they want to do 
right by their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 I once had a hearing when I was a governor and I brought in people on welfare 
from all over America who had found their way to work, and a woman from my 
state who testified was asked this question: What's the best thing about being 
off welfare and in a job? And without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 
governors and she said: "When my boy goes to school and they say, 'What does 
your mother do for a living?' he can give an answer." These people want a 
better system and we ought to give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, we began this. We gave the states more power to innovate because we 
know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington and many states are 
already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic step. Instead of taxing 
people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out 
of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned income tax credit. It will 
lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, 
making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents. 
Now that's real welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on 
the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and 
responsibility. We will say to teen-agers: If you have a child out of wedlock, 
we'll no longer give you a check to set up a separate household, we want 
families to stay together. Say to absent parents who aren't paying their child 
support: If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, 
suspend your license, track you across state lines and, if necessary, make some 
of you work off what you owe. 
</P>
<P>
 People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple 
compact. We will provide the support, the job training, the child care you need 
for up to two years, but after that anyone who can work, must, in the private 
sector wherever possible, in community service if necessary. That's the only 
way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be: a second chance, not a way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time 
we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is inevitable and 
imperative. It is estimated that 1 million people are on welfare today because 
it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many 
entry-level jobs don't have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible 
position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those 
who made the other choice, to stay on welfare. No wonder people leave work and 
go back to welfare -- to get health care coverage. We've got to solve the 
health care problem to have real welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year we will make history by reforming the health care system. And I 
would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue 
where the people are way ahead of the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, the First Lady has received now almost a million letters from people 
all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share just one of 
them with you. Health Cost Burden 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Anderson of Reno, Nev., lost his job and, with it, his health 
insurance. Two weeks later, his wife, Judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. He 
rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days. The 
Andersons' bills were over $120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went 
back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them and they were 
literally forced into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Clinton," he wrote to Hillary, "no one in the United States of America 
should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives because they 
were unfortunate enough to become ill." 
</P>
<P>
 It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First Lady 
and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform 
issue. We owe them our thanks and our action. 
</P>
<P>
 I know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell it to 
Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no 
coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81 million Americans 
with those pre-existing conditions; those folks are paying more or they can't 
get insurance at all or they can't ever change their jobs because they or 
someone in their family has one of those pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell it to the small businesses burdened by skyrocketing costs of insurance. 
Most small businesses cover their employers, and they pay on average 35% more 
in premiums than big businesses or government. Or tell it to the 76% of insured 
Americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits, and that 
means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need 
it the most. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people, 
because I can't. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this 
problem on people's lives, but all you have to do is go out and listen to them. 
Just go talk to them anywhere, in any congressional district in this country. 
They're Republicans and Democrats and independents. It doesn't have a lick to 
do with party. They think we don't get it, and it's time we show that we do get 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to 
strengthen what is good about our health care system -- the world's best health 
care professionals, cutting edge research, and wonderful research institutions, 
Medicare for older Americans. None of this -- none of it should be put at risk. 
But we're paying more and more money for less and less care. Every year, fewer 
and fewer Americans even get to choose their doctors. Every year, doctors and 
nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the 
absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become. 
</P>
<P>
 This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and 
everybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies call the 
shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They can cut off your 
benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans go 
to bed just an illness, an accident or a pink slip away from having no coverage 
or financial ruin. It means every morning millions of Americans go to work 
without any health insurance at all -- something the workers in no other 
advanced country in the world do. It means that every year more and more 
hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to 
pick a new plan. And countless others turn down better jobs because they know, 
if they take the better job, they'll lose their health insurance. Can't Let 
System Drift 
</P>
<P>
 If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have 
people with less care, fewer choices and higher bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It builds 
on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer-based coverage, 
to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I might say, 
employer-based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago 
by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress. It was a good idea 
then, and it's a better idea today. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now, nine out of 10 
people who have insurance get it through their employers -- and that should 
continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, 
that should continue too. And that ought to make the Congress and the President 
feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 Our goal is health insurance everybody can depend on -- comprehensive benefits 
that cover preventive care and prescription drugs, health premiums that don't 
just explode when you get sick or you get older, the power -- no matter how 
small your business is -- to choose dependable insurance at the same 
competitive rates that governments and big business get today, one simple form 
for people who are sick and, most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the 
right to choose your own doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Our approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress proposes 
to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this. We believe those 
savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens. Medicare 
must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take 
the first steps in covering long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the solution 
to today's squeeze on middle-class working people's health care is not to put 
the squeeze on middle-class retired people's health care. We can do better than 
that. When it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me. Insurance ought to 
mean what it used to mean: You pay a fair price for security, and when you get 
sick, health care is always there -- no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there 
must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system. 
People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should all take advantage 
of preventive care. We must all work together to stop the violence that 
explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice better health habits, and we 
can't abuse the system. Everybody Can Contribute 
</P>
<P>
 And those who don't have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but 
they will have to pay something for it too. The minority of businesses that 
provide no insurance at all, and in so doing shift the cost of the care of 
their employees to others, should contribute something. People who smoke should 
pay more for a pack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute something if we 
want to solve the health care crisis. There can't be anymore something for 
nothing. It will not be easy, but it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and 
Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down 
costs and to achieve lasting health security. But if you look at history, we 
see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care. President 
Roosevelt tried, President Truman tried, President Nixon tried, President 
Carter tried. Every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat 
them, but not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will raise 
critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists 
yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never get any easier 
until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this 
current system. So I also must now call on you to finish the job both houses 
began last year, by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and 
lobby reform legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The 
American people provide those of us in government service with terrific health 
care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always there. I 
think we need to give every hard-working, taxpaying American the same health 
care security they have already given to us. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to make this very clear: I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to the 
best ideas of concerned members of both parties. I have no special brief for 
any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: If you send me 
legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance 
that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the 
legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act now. I 
believe that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to guarantee every 
American the same health care that you have, health care that can never be 
taken away -- now -- not next year or the year after. Now is the time to stand 
with the people who sent us here. Now. 
</P>
<P>
 As we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn 
away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad. This is a promising 
moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, 
Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the 
United States. Nor will we point ours at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to build 
the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms 
proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in 
many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over and 
fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror. As the world's 
greatest power, we must therefore maintain our defenses and our 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 This year we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against 
those who harbor them. We worked to promote environmentally sustainable 
economic growth. We achieved agreements with Ukraine, with Belarus, with 
Kazakhstan, to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenals. We are working to 
achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. We will seek early 
ratification of the treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today 
we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to 
stop all nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing -- nothing -- is more important to our security than our nation's 
armed forces. We honor their contributions, including those who are carrying 
out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in Bosnia -- those who will 
complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave 
their lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 Our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had, and I have pledged 
that as long as I am President they will remain the best-equipped, the 
best-trained and the best-prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-Cold War security 
at a lower cost. This year, many people urged me to cut our defense spending 
further to pay for other government programs. I said no. The budget I send to 
Congress draws the line against further defense cuts. It protects the readiness 
and quality of our forces. Ultimately, the best strategy is to do that. We must 
not cut defense further. I hope the Congress without regard to party will 
support that position. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable 
peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't 
attack each other. They make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy. 
That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic reformers in Russia 
and in the other states of the former Soviet Bloc. I applaud the bipartisan 
support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia, 
Ukraine and the other states through their epic transformations. 
</P>
<P>
 Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and 
vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to urge 
Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms, and we will 
seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems while insisting that, 
if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those 
states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures, and they 
must chart their own futures, how much more secure and more prosperous our own 
people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former 
Communist Bloc. Our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the 
policy of the Congress. We should continue it. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European 
partners to help to integrate all the former Communist countries into a Europe 
that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire 
history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in 
Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders. 
Partnership For Peace 
</P>
<P>
 With our allies, we have created a partnership for peace that invites states 
from the former Soviet Bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in 
military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's leaders, including Lech 
Walesa and Vaclav Havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, I 
told them that the security of their region is important to our country's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights 
and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask Congress to 
ratify the new GATT accord, we will continue standing by South Africa as it 
works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We will convene a summit of the Western Hemisphere's democratic leaders from 
Canada to the tip of South America. And we will continue to press for the 
restoration of true democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must continue 
to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 We will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year the 
world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White House when they had 
their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long, hard road 
ahead. And on that road, I am determined that I and our Administration will do 
all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold War, America 
should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the world were 
afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a pledge that had no 
partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of 
the world. And this year, because of our work together, enacting NAFTA, keeping 
our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have 
reaffirmed America's leadership, America's engagement, and as a result, the 
American people are more secure than they were before. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all know 
that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. Everyday the 
national peace is shattered by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In Petaluma, Calif., an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy 
for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a 
hail of nine-millimeter rounds. A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by 
bigots simply because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Right here in our nation's capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a 
policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting 
personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a 
chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by saying I 
care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out in public life, 
I was the attorney general of my state. 
</P>
<P>
 I served as a governor for a dozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws 
increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death 
penalty. I understand this issue and it is not a simple thing. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small 
percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on 
parole. Now, those who commit crimes should be punished, and those who commit 
repeated violent crimes should be told, when you commit a third violent crime, 
you will be put away and put away for good -- three strikes and you are out. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, 
beginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know right 
now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the 
neighborhood kids, focus on high-crime areas, we know that they are more likely 
to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17% in one 
year when that approach was taken. Here tonight is one of those community 
policemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square 
blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York. Every day he restores 
some sanity and safety, and a sense of values and connection to the people 
whose lives he protects. I'd like to ask him to stand up and be recognized 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the 
law-abiding working people of this country, and don't forget, in the toughest 
neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this 
country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay 
their taxes, do their best to raise their kids. They deserve people like Kevin 
Jett, and you're going to be given the chance to give the American people 
another 100,000 of them, well trained, and I urge you to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to 
encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police 
officers, which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police 
forces -- and enormous resources for our country, one which has safe-schools 
provisions which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in 
safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets. These are 
important things. 
</P>
<P>
 The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady bill -- the Brady law 
to take further steps -- to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals. Now, I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always 
be free to hunt, law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and 
protect their homes. I respect that part of our culture. I grew up in it. 
</P>
<P>
 But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in 
this campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know you didn't create 
this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There is no sporting purpose 
on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault 
weapons that outgun police and cut down children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of 
crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again 
among our young people. The crime bill contains -- all the crime bills contain 
-- more money for drug treatment, for criminal addicts, and boot camps for 
youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off 
drugs. Our Administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains a large 
increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must pass them 
both. We need them desperately. 
</P>
<P>
 My fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an un-American problem. It has 
no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you find ways as 
quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, 
tough crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties for 
those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point. 
In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural 
areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family 
and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. This has created a vast 
vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs. So I ask you to 
remember that even as we say no to crime, we must give people, especially our 
young people, something to say yes to. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to 
national service will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen 
families, to provide work, but more needs to be done. That's what our community 
empowerment agenda is all about -- challenging businesses to provide more 
investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the 
same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the 
power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, 
opportunity and hope where they're needed most. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to put 
our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas 
to do even more. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's be honest, we all know something else too. Our problems go way 
beyond the reach of government. They're rooted in the loss of values and the 
disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our communities. My 
fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around 
the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in 
history and still leave too many of our people behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going to 
bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country when, 
within a decade, more than half of the children will be born into families 
where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country when 13-year-old 
boys get semiautomatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't renew our country when children are having children and the fathers 
walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew the country 
when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad 
but ignore those people right here at home who'd give anything to have their 
jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't renew our country unless more of us -- I mean all of us -- are 
willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the 
black ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I 
met at Our Lady of Help in East Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campolo in 
Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like that, people who 
are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer. All of us can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise 
children; parents do. Parents who know their children's teachers and turn off 
the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong 
-- those kind of parents can make all the difference. I know. I had one. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm telling you we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who 
have no future and reach our hands out to them. Our country needs it. We need 
it. And they deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I say to you tonight, let's give our children a future. Let us take 
away their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair and replace 
it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our 
neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new 
American community that once more stands strong against the forces of despair 
and evil, because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the challenges 
of this time, but they misread our history, our heritage, even today's 
headlines. All those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earth shook and fires raged in California; when I saw the Mississippi 
deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500-year flood; when the century's 
bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News, it seemed as though the 
world itself was coming apart at the seams. But the American people, they just 
came together. They rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers 
risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our 
deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing 
hope and moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as 
the Republic itself -- what is the state of our union? 
</P>
<P>
 It is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still. With your help and 
God's help, it will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, and God bless America.

 President Clinton opened his State of the Union Address Tuesday night with a 
joke on himself about a mix-up with the TelePrompTer the last time he spoke 
before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope we can 
talk about the State of the Union," Clinton said to laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to his address to Congress last Sept. 22 outlining his health 
care program. An old economics speech popped up on the TelePrompTer, forcing 
him to temporarily ad lib and refer to a written text.

OKLAHOMA WELFARE PROJECT WILL PENALIZE THOSE WHO SKIP SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children and teen-age parents in Oklahoma will be required to stay in school 
as a condition of collecting welfare under a federal demonstration project 
approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration, which required a waiver of federal regulations governing 
the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, will begin Feb. 2 and last 
for three years.It was approved by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest in a string of state experiments with welfare reform that 
seek to force children and teen-age parents receiving benefits to stay in 
school or keep up to date on their immunizations. Other demonstrations attempt 
to encourage work and training or to discourage women already on the rolls from 
having more children. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's waiver application, the purpose of Oklahoma's 
Learnfare program is to encourage and promote school attendance for AFDC 
children and teen-age parents from the time they reach age 13 until they turn 
18, graduate from high school or obtain a GED equivalency diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 After two warnings for missing school, children and teen-age parents whose 
attendance slips below 80% will face a reduction in their family's monthly AFDC 
check.

RADIATION TESTS STILL GO ON, O'LEARY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said Tuesday that the government continues to 
sponsor radiation experiments involving human subjects but that none is being 
done in secret or without the informed consent of participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The acknowledgment came in testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee, which is investigating radiation experiments performed by the 
government, often on unwitting participants, in the 1940s and '50s.O'Leary told 
committee members that the full extent and nature of those experiments probably 
would not be determined for at least a year. But she added that all of the 
information eventually would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said that the Energy Department now is either funding or providing 
facilities for between 200 and 260 experiments, about 40% of which are believed 
to involve radiation. Most of the current experimentation involves the use of 
low tracer doses in nuclear medicine research, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the experiments are being conducted in secret or in violation of 
ethical guidelines -- in effect since 1991 -- that govern the terms of such 
experiments on humans, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty certain that everyone is following the spirit and intent" of the 
ethics guidelines, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said that as a precautionary measure President Clinton will issue a 
directive this week ordering a halt to any classified experiments involving 
radiation and human subjects. But she said she does not believe that such 
experimentation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we have been able to ascertain, the department is not conducting 
any experiments that violate medical (or) ethical standards," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is the first in what is expected to be several congressional 
inquiries into disclosures that unsuspecting subjects were used as human guinea 
pigs for government-sponsored radiation experiments during the Cold War.

FARRAKHAN WON'T DISAVOW AIDE'S SPEECH; ANTI-SEMITISM: HE SAYS BLACK LEADERS WHO 
PROTESTED THE REMARKS WERE USED AS PAWNS. HE ACCUSES JEWISH GROUPS OF PLOTTING 
AGAINST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in a speech to his followers refused 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's call to disavow anti-Semitic statements attributed to 
a key aide, and instead accused Jewish groups of conspiring against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday threatened court action against 
Farrakhan because women were barred from the rally at a Harlem armory where 
Farrakhan spoke Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Farrakhan also charged that other black leaders were allowing 
themselves to be used as pawns when they were critical of a speech given by 
Khalid Abdul Mohammad at Kean College in Union, N.J., last Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In that address, Mohammad attacked Jews as "the blood suckers of the black 
nation," praised Hitler as "wickedly great" and attacked the Pope as "a 
cracker." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith has denounced the speech in a full 
page newspaper ad, claiming Mohammad also urged black South Africans to "kill 
everything white," including babies and children and to even kill wheelchair 
bound old white people by pushing " 'em off a cliff in Cape Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's aide also charged that Jews control the White House and the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, Jackson called on Farrakhan to repudiate Mohammad's remarks, 
labeling them "racist, anti-Semitic, divisive, untrue and chilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad's speech also was sharply criticized by Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., 
president of the NAACP and other leaders including Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), 
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and William H. Gray III, president 
of the United Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to use my brother Khalid's words against me to divide the 
house," Farrakhan told more than 8,000 supporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The members of the Jewish community are the most organized, rich and 
powerful, not only in America, but in the world," he said. "They don't want 
Farrakhan to do what he's doing. They're plotting as we speak." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy overshadowed the anti-drug, black empowerment message also 
delivered to the audience by Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 Women were barred from the meeting held on New York State property even though 
the rental agreement for the armory specified that there be no discrimination 
based on sex or race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation of Islam's press release for the event also called upon news 
organizations only to send black male reporters to cover the event, designed to 
focus on the problems of men. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Civil Liberties Union said it was considering filing complaints 
both with the city and state human rights commissions as well as going into 
court to seek to stop the Nation of Islam from holding a rally planned for next 
month on any public facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were six women prohibited from entering it (the armory)," said Norman 
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "Five were 
news reporters. . . . It is state property." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Tuesday, Abraham H. Foxman, the ADL's national director, 
charged that Farrakhan, by not rejecting Mohammad's speech and in his own 
remarks, had "reinforced his own pattern of anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
 "Farrakhan lashed out at Jews, claiming they were plotting against him and 
against the black community," Foxman said. "His bigotry and conspiratorial 
charges continue the grim and shameful pattern he has maintained for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew 
Congregations, Tuesday praised black leaders for denouncing Mohammad's remarks 
and said their actions will have "a positive effect on the repair and renewal 
of black-Jewish relations."

O.C. GOP LEADERS CRITICAL; OTHERS LIKED SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As California's Republican stronghold, Orange County is always a tough sell 
for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that many in the county's delegation to Washington were 
critical of the President's State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of attacking what he said in his speech, county Republican leaders 
largely complained that Clinton's plans did not go far enough, or said they 
doubted he would follow through on his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the vintage Clinton that we've come to know," said Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). "What that means is that I found myself 
agreeing with a great deal of the rhetoric, but knowing full well there is an 
enormous gulf between the words and the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) agreed. "What he is selling are conservative 
themes and Republican themes, but the picture is quite the opposite," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the partisan snipes, the President's speech drew praise from 
several corners of Orange County, including local business leaders, health care 
officials and Democratic leaders. In his speech, Clinton renewed his effort to 
pass a universal health care plan and he tied that program to a welfare reform 
proposal that emphasized job responsibility and disincentives for parents who 
can't afford another child. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President found the most support in Orange County with his tough call 
for new anti-crime legislation that bans assault weapons and requires any 
defendant convicted of three violent crimes to serve a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's suddenly become Ronald Reagan on crime," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove). "No Democrat has ever spoken this strongly on crime. He's 
stealing the ideas that have been kicking around here for 18 years . . . but 
better late than never." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce said that Clinton stopped just short of supporting the full package of 
anti-crime legislation he has proposed in Congress. Both Royce and Cox said the 
President should also have called for tougher sentencing laws as part of the 
crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Royce applauded the President's endorsement of the so-called "three 
strikes and you're out" legislation. And Cox also promised to support it. "I 
think we will now see it become law," Royce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also struck a chord with Orange County's lone Democrat in state or 
federal office -- Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). Umberg, a former 
federal prosecutor who is exploring a campaign for California attorney general 
this year, said he gave a speech earlier Tuesday that outlined several of the 
same crime themes as the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's talking about the things that Americans care about and he understands 
their human experience," Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Democratic Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia, who hosted about 30 people at a 
speech-watching gathering in Santa Ana on Tuesday evening, said she thought 
Clinton had put the nation's problems ahead of politics because his plan was 
not conservative or liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sets out to do what's right," she said. "We see that with the health care 
program, with the crime program and with (his advocacy of) accessible and 
affordable education," Garcia said. "I cannot see anybody in Orange County not 
agreeing with those." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the county Republicans separated most sharply with the President was on 
his call for a universal health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he thought a "key moment" in the speech came when the President 
raised his pen and threatened to veto any health care plan that fell short of 
providing universal coverage. The Garden Grove congressman, who repeated 
Tuesday that he has not decided whether to seek reelection, promised to oppose 
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're (not) going to give universal coverage to every criminal and alcoholic 
lying in an alley somewhere," he said. "He's pushing socialized medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox also criticized the President for being disingenuous in his facts about 
the problem, saying that he greatly exaggerated the number of Americans who 
don't have health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he talks about health care, he says we should have choice and let the 
market work," Cox said. "These happen to be wonderful ideas that are 
diametrically opposed to his legislation. He's going to grant government 
agencies regional monopolies. That is hardly letting the market work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who gave the President credit for 
"a very well-crafted speech," also thought Clinton overstated the nation's 
health care problem. Rohrabacher said the nation's health care system needs 
reform, but he added: "I don't believe there's a health care crisis in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 While the medical profession has criticized many of the Clinton 
Administration's initial health care proposals, Tuesday's speech drew applause 
from some in Orange County's health industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, and most physicians, support (the kind of program) he was talking about," 
said Melvyn L. Sterling, president of the Orange County Medical Assn. and an 
internal medicine specialist in Orange. "I was very encouraged that he 
reaffirmed a commitment to employer-based private insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, a Westminster obstetrician, said Clinton's health care proposals 
sounded "very realistic. Even though I'm a Republican, I am very impressed. He 
was very eloquent." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, said he has patients on 
welfare, "especially in the Vietnamese community, who are afraid to take a 
low-paying job because they are afraid of losing medical benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's words won some hearts elsewhere in the county's business community 
-- at least for one night. 
</P>
<P>
 Even critics such as career development specialist P. Anthony Burnham credited 
Clinton with a speech that will provoke a lot of thought and discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very sincere man," said Burnham, president of ProActive Institute, a 
career skills development center. "I was glad he proposed the move from an 
unemployment system to a re-employment system. But I was very disappointed that 
he didn't develop that more." 
</P>

 Aaron Lovejoy, past president of the Orange County Black Chamber of Commerce, 
said he thought the speech had some heartening news for small businesses, 
citing Clinton's commitment to community development banks and empowerment 
zones.

SUPERVISORS SEEK TRANSFER OF ORANGE COUNTY RECORDER; GOVERNMENT: BOARD ALSO 
ASKS GRAND JURY TO LOOK INTO MISCONDUCT CLAIMS. OFFICIAL HAS REFUSED TO RESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an unprecedented move, the Orange County Board of Supervisors Tuesday 
publicly condemned Recorder Lee A. Branch and asked the county grand jury to 
determine whether allegations of misconduct warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-barreled decision was met by quiet applause from more than a dozen 
recorder employees, one of whom compared Branch's treatment of workers to 
"child abuse" in testimony to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the grand jury's involvement is necessary 
because Branch has refused to resign his obscure elected office, although a 
county personnel investigation had found he mismanaged his office and sexual 
harassed employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The county investigation, which was made public last week, also found that 
Branch's romance with an office supervisor, Nancy L. Smith, created such a 
hostile work environment that nine employees sought medical treatment for 
stress and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 At home Tuesday afternoon, Branch declined comment on the board's actions. But 
Smith, who answered Branch's home phone, called the decisions unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its unanimous action, the board recommended that Smith be 
transferred from the recorder's office to another county job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just horrified by this entire thing," she said. "I don't take this as a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has said that the investigation of his office has been part of a 
political "hidden agenda" initiated by the board to remove him from office to 
make room for another candidate, County Clerk Gary Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime government observers said they could not remember any other time when 
the board had publicly condemned another elected official or sought an 
official's removal from office through the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board is justified in its action," said William Mitchell, 
director of Common Cause in Orange County. "There appears to be gross 
mismanagement in every facet of the recorder's job. I think the supervisors are 
doing the only thing they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to their vote, the supervisors heard testimony from three recorder 
employees who came to the Hall of Administration Tuesday morning on their work 
breaks to detail years of office turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been degraded, harassed, prejudged, lied to, slandered and forced to 
work in a mentally and physically unhealthy environment," said 12-year employee 
Cyndi Viall.

WILSON'S DISASTER DECLARATION DEFENDED; AID: SOME CRITICIZE GOVERNOR'S 
DESIGNATION OF ORANGE COUNTY SO THAT ANAHEIM STADIUM CAN BE REPAIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 State officials Tuesday defended Gov. Pete Wilson's decision to declare a 
state of emergency in Orange County, despite complaints that authorities 
stretched the disaster law to tap state and federal taxpayers' money for 
earthquake repairs at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's powerful temblor rattled homes and nerves throughout Orange 
County, but the most significant damage was at the city-owned stadium, where a 
17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard toppled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Eckery, a Wilson spokesman, said Administration officials "understand 
the sensitivity" of using taxpayers' money to help finance more than $4 million 
in repairs at the stadium. He said the governor was responding to a request 
from Anaheim and Orange County for disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our role was strictly administrative," Eckery said. "Given the severe damage 
that we've seen in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, how prudent would it have 
been to hold off in Orange County, when indeed there could have been more 
damage that surfaced later?" 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's request for help was criticized by some residents and 
politicians, who argued that it is inappropriate to use taxpayers money to 
repair a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only the wrong use of taxpayers' money, but it's an insult to those 
families in Los Angeles who lost their loved ones and their homes in a real 
catastrophe," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said there was nothing he or his colleagues in the Legislature could 
do to stop the governor's declaration, but expressed hope that public pressure 
would prompt Anaheim officials to look for other means to finance repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of this country are having a hard enough time without having to 
pay for the maintenance of a football stadium," Ferguson said. "They should sue 
the contractor or the insurance company or the engineer, but not use the tax 
dollars of some poor soul down in Louisiana or up in Eureka." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Shamrock, chief deputy director of the state Office of Emergency 
Services, said the toppled scoreboard does represent a disaster for the city of 
Anaheim, which faced an estimated $8-million budget deficit before the 
earthquake. As a municipally owned facility, she said, the stadium will be 
eligible for grant awards, just like a school or city hall damaged in the 
quake. Such grants do not have to be repaid.

DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY TEST SPACECRAFT LAUNCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unmanned spacecraft named Clementine 1, equipped with sensors built for 
missile defense, roared off a launch pad Tuesday on a seven-month journey to 
explore the moon and an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific data collected when Clementine points its instruments at the moon 
next month and the asteroid Geographos next summer will be a byproduct of a 
$75-million-plus mission primarily intended to test new defense technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The key instruments are five advanced sensors designed for detecting and 
tracking missiles, according to the Defense Department's Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization, which jointly sponsored the mission with NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-stage Titan 2G booster, a converted ballistic missile, lifted Clementine 
off at 8:34 a.m. and sent it southwest over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact with the spacecraft was achieved several hours later as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is designed to test the detection capabilities of the sensors at 
realistic closing velocities, using the Earth, moon and Geographos as targets. 
A small rocket motor known as the Interstage Adapter System, launched with 
Clementine, also will be targeted by the sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clementine will stay in Earth orbit for about seven days, then begin a looping 
trajectory to enter orbit around the moon on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be the first lunar exploration since the Apollo moon missions ended 
21 years ago. The last, Apollo 17, landed in December, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Clementine will spend two months in two orbit paths around the moon, mapping 
the entire surface in visible and near-infrared spectra. Laser-ranging and 
auto-navigation experiments also are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacecraft will then leave lunar orbit on a four-month trip to Geographos, 
passing within 75 miles of the asteroid on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is expected to end after seven months.

YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY: ARMING YOURSELF WITH THE FACTS ABOUT DONATING 
BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, Southern Californians have been rolling up their sleeves 
to donate blood, says Barbara Wilks, an American Red Cross spokeswoman. Some 
were responding to donation requests made when the blood supply here dropped 
dangerously low in early January; other donors thought the quake might greatly 
increase the need for blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supply is now in good shape, except for Group O, which is in chronic 
short supply," Wilks says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, some commonly asked questions about blood donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How long does it take to donate blood? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The collection process takes four to 10 minutes, says Cheryle Babbitt, 
director of donor services for the American Red Cross, Southern California 
region. Donors must first answer questions about their health and are asked to 
stay afterward for a few minutes to be sure they feel OK. "So allow an hour to 
an hour and 15 minutes," Babbitt says. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What type of blood is most in demand?  
</P>
<P>
 A: "Currently, the largest shortage is for Type O, both negative and 
positive," Babbitt says.  
</P>
<P>
 Explained simply, those with positive blood types have a particular protein in 
the bloodstream, says Dr. James Mosley, USC professor of medicine and director 
of the Transfusion Safety Study, a government-sponsored investigation. Those 
with negative blood types lack this protein. 
</P>
<P>
 Type O negative is the universal donor type, because it can be given to 
anyone. "Type O negative is also preferred for infants," Babbitt says, "because 
their blood types are not yet well developed." Those with positive blood types 
can receive negative blood, but those with negative cannot receive positive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of all people have positive blood types. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which types of blood are most common? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Here's a rough breakdown of blood types among the U.S. population, provided 
by the American Assn. of Blood Banks: 
</P>
<P>
 O positive: 37% 
</P>
<P>
 O negative: 7% 
</P>
<P>
 A positive: 36% 
</P>
<P>
 A negative: 6% 
</P>
<P>
 B positive: 9% 
</P>
<P>
 B negative: 1% 
</P>
<P>
 AB positive: 3% 
</P>
<P>
 AB negative: 1% 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What information is needed when you donate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You're asked your weight (on your honor). Your body temperature, blood 
pressure and pulse are taken. A drop of blood will be taken to test for anemia. 
You don't need to know your blood type. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should I follow any special diet before giving blood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Eating normally is best. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much does it hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To simulate what it will feel like, Babbitt says, "pinch the inside of your 
elbow for one minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much blood is taken? 
</P>
<P>
 A: About a pint. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any special advice for the squeamish? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Alert the person who will take your blood if you have a history of fainting 
or dizziness so you can be watched closely. Take along a stereo headset with 
soothing music. Tune out other people's negative talk. And remember, it's 
voluntary. You can always change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How often can I donate blood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Healthy people can donate blood every 56 days. That interval allows time 
for the blood supply to replenish itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who shouldn't donate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Pregnant women, people who weigh less than 110 pounds, people who have a 
cold or the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who can't donate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People who are HIV-positive or at risk of being HIV-positive; anyone who 
has had hepatitis B; certain other medical conditions, including a history of 
cancer, could disqualify a donor; the Red Cross requires donors to be at least 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the risk, for donors, of coming into contact with HIV-contaminated 
needles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the United States, there is no risk. A new sterile needle is used for 
each donor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to the blood after it's collected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It goes to a laboratory, where it is tested to determine type and whether 
it is negative or positive. It is tested for syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and 
for HIV. The Red Cross warns potential donors not to use donations as an 
opportunity for free HIV testing. If infected recently, donors may have a 
negative test result yet be capable of infecting others. If an infected donor 
is still in the window period -- which can be six months or even longer -- the 
virus is present but antibodies to it have not yet formed. The screening tests 
detect antibodies, not the virus, Babbitt says. 
</P>
<P>
 To further minimize the chance of contaminated blood slipping through, careful 
attention is paid to the answers each donor gives to health questions about 
risk behaviors for acquiring AIDS, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors whose sample tests positive for any of the above diseases are notified, 
says Marcia Lane, a spokeswoman for the American Assn. of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood that passes the tests is sent to a processing lab, where components such 
as red blood cells, plasma and platelets are separated out. After labeling, the 
blood is ready for distribution to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After donating, are there any special diet precautions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, although most centers offer refreshments such as juice and crackers. 
The Red Cross asks donors to relax for a few minutes. Although most people feel 
fine after donating, some may have a faint feeling, upset stomach or other 
minor problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the status of artificial blood? Will it make blood donations 
unnecessary anytime soon? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Several blood substitute products are under development, with many 
companies now involved in phase one trials, according to Biomedical Business 
International, a Santa Ana-based industry publication. But the race has been 
besieged with problems, such as some volunteers reporting high blood pressure 
and other unexpected side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some industry experts predict that artificial blood could be on the 
market in two years -- a timeline others term highly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 But artificial blood will never replace the need for human blood, says Dr. 
Robert Winslow, UC San Diego professor of medicine and a national expert on 
artificial blood. "Many blood substitutes are manufactured from human blood." 
Artificial blood will be used mainly for elective surgery, Winslow says, then 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where can I donate? Do I need an appointment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Red Cross conducts blood drives at many companies. There are also 
mobile collection units at shopping centers and other public sites. Or call 
(800) 974-2113 to find a site. Making an appointment will save you time.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FAMILIES TRANSFERRED AS SHELTERS IN SIMI, 
FILLMORE CONSOLIDATE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON and MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 For dozens of displaced Ventura County residents, Tuesday was moving day as 
American Red Cross shelters consolidated services, closing sparsely populated 
shelters in Simi Valley and Fillmore and sending earthquake victims to other 
sites in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Families that spent Monday evening at Royal High in Simi Valley to escape the 
cold and rain were moved Tuesday to Hillside Junior High to make way for 
returning students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, the shelter at Veteran's Memorial Building was closed and its 22 
occupants transferred to the shelter at Fillmore Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelters are being joined to better use the available resources," said 
Brian Bolton, director of the county chapter of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 At both shelters Tuesday, people stacked blankets, folded up cots and packed 
clothes and other belongings into plastic garbage bags and cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as long as we have a roof over our heads, I think it's OK," said Leticia 
Gonzalez, who has been at the Simi Valley shelter with her four sons since last 
week's earthquake heavily damaged the family's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials said 168 people stayed at the Fillmore shelter Tuesday 
night, compared to Monday when 134 residents -- including 15 people who moved 
from the Veteran's Memorial shelter -- were given emergency housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, 127 people sought Red Cross shelter Monday, and officials late 
Tuesday said they were anticipating a similar number. 
</P>
<P>
 And 20 people spent Tuesday night at the Red Cross shelter at the Piru School 
on Center Street, compared to 110 on Monday, when the rainstorm and a power 
outage drove many people indoors from makeshift campsites. All three shelters 
will remain open indefinitely, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they were concerned about residents who have been sleeping 
outside or in their cars, because nighttime temperatures have been dipping into 
the 30s and 40s in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hernandez, an Oxnard resident and Red Cross volunteer for three years, 
said he saw several parked cars Monday night filled with homeless earthquake 
victims near Piru and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drove over last night to Piru and saw five different vans with candles 
inside and stopped and told them that this was dangerous," he said. When 
Hernandez suggested they come with him to the shelter they declined. "They 
said, no we'll just stay right here. They're afraid. Afraid of the building 
falling down." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, at mobile home parks hard hit by the quake some people are 
remaining at the parks even though the gas was still off, leaving all of the 
coaches without heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Lial and four members of her family have been spending most nights in 
their cars parked outside of their mobile home at Simi Country Estates mobile 
home park while they wait to see if they will get federal aid to repair their 
heavily damaged coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's rain and cold temperatures led the family to seek shelter at a 
relative's house in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 60-year-old Lial said the commute from Oxnard is too far for the 
family to drive every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lial's neighbor, Dave Marwick, and his mother spent Monday night in Marwick's 
mother's unheated coach. But they didn't even try to sleep. Instead, they 
stayed up until 5 a.m. packing crystal, electronic equipment and other 
valuables to put in storage until the mobile home is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like you're camping," said Ron Reedy, a friend who had helped the 
Marwicks with the packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore native Linda Acosta, who lost her home in last week's quake and has 
been living at the Fillmore shelter, said she wants to get her two daughters 
out of the shelter and into a permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to get my kids someplace. My daughter broke down (and cried) the other 
night," she said. "There's no privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta said she was hoping to leave the shelter as soon as possible and move 
into an apartment Red Cross volunteers had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the immediate emergency needs of the earthquake victims has been met, 
Red Cross workers are focusing their efforts on helping displaced residents 
find permanent housing at the county's two Red Cross service centers, Bolton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Goth, disaster relief supervisor for the local Red Cross chapter, said 
about 250 families and individuals have sought assistance at the service 
centers to find housing and other help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage people to go to service centers if they have needs," Goth said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get assistance in finding permanent housing, earthquake victims should go 
to one of two Red Cross service centers. Care workers at the service centers 
will help determine the needs of displaced individuals and issue vouchers for 
housing and food. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Red Cross center is located at the Fillmore Senior Center, 533 
Santa Clara Ave. The Simi Valley center is at Sycamore Park Community Center, 
1692 Sycamore Drive.

JURORS TOLD OF CASH FOUND IN PRIEST'S ROOMS; COURTS: A MAID TESTIFYING IN THE 
TRIAL OF FATHER DAVID PIROLI SAYS SHE DISCOVERED STACKS AND BAGS OF BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A parish maid testified Tuesday she was shocked to find bundles of cash, 
collection envelopes and churchgoers' donation checks stashed throughout the 
rectory rooms of Father David Dean Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the second day of the Simi Valley priest's embezzlement trial, a church 
official told jurors that the cash looked as if it came straight from the 
collection baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen thousand $1 bills -- some folded, crumpled, rolled up or creased 
into paper airplanes by young parishioners -- had to be counted by hand after 
Piroli's arrest, testified Lyle Hibbs, chairman of the finance council at St. 
Peter Claver Church. 
</P>
<P>
 It took parish officers more than eight hours on June 3, 1992, to count the 
entire cache, which totaled $47,000, Hibbs testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 37, faces two counts of grand theft in the alleged skimming of $60,000 
in parishioners' donations from St. Peter Claver in Simi Valley and Sacred 
Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbs told jurors that he blamed the recession for a falloff in church 
collections early in Piroli's tenure there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was convinced at the time that the economy was going slow, and we were 
fairly well convinced (collections were down) due to the layoffs in aerospace 
and the people losing their jobs," Hibbs testified.  
</P>
<P>
 But after looking at church ledgers, he suspected theft and began spying on 
everyone who had access to the collection box where parishioners' donations 
were stored after Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared to be all right with the ushers, but I saw one person that was 
99% in control of the money at that time, and was moving it from the church" in 
a canvas bag to the rectory, Hibbs testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our associate (pastor), Father Piroli," Hibbs testified. "He seemed 
to always take care of the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations increased after Piroli left the parish in June, 1992, after his May 
29 arrest in Hollywood, Hibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police testified Monday that they found Piroli sitting in a church car 
surrounded by $10,000 in cash, some church collection envelopes and traces of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, however, Hibbs said he never saw Piroli take money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever see Father Piroli take money out of the bag and put it in his 
pocket, or put it in a box, or put it in his sock or put it in his hat?" asked 
defense attorney Richard Beada. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Hibbs replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Then parishioner Joseph Barrett gave testimony that could be used to bolster 
arguments made by Piroli's attorney, who has alleged that the money really was 
being skimmed by the church's head pastor, Father James McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett testified that he oversaw parishioners as they counted the Sunday 
morning collections in the church rectory. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, the "counters" put $125 to $150 cash into McKeon's desk for 
"housekeeping money," that was not recorded in church ledgers, Barrett 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the head pastor's instructions, they also separated special 
collection envelopes containing money for the church building fund and the poor 
and put them into McKeon's desk, Barrett testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe relations between Piroli and McKeon, Barrett answered: 
"Tense." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Piroli came into the counting room, Barrett said. "He was 
talking about Father McKeon losing things, and forgetfulness and becoming 
senile," Barrett testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the parish maid testified, saying she peered into Piroli's desk drawer at 
the request of church secretary Eileen Slavin after the priest's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of money, clipped together with paper clips," the maid, 
Dorothy Meyer, testified. "It was a number of bills clipped together and 
stacked in back of each other, like, in envelope boxes. Both drawers were full 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin joined her, and the two women searched the rest of Piroli's bedroom and 
office, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They found more bundles of money in boxes in the closet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They pried open a filing cabinet with a screwdriver and found more money -- 
bundles of cash, loose bills and parishioners' checks mixed in with green and 
yellow collection envelopes, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved on to Piroli's office, where they found grocery bags full of cash 
in a second filing cabinet, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, Meyer said, other church officials had joined the search. It 
even turned up a donation check she had written to the church two months 
earlier that had not been cashed. 
</P>
<P>
 And she told jurors she found a stack of partly burned collection envelopes in 
the fireplace -- which she had never seen used by anyone but Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is set to continue today at 9:30 a.m.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BOARD OKS ORDINANCE OUTLAWING PRICE GOUGING; 
RECOVERY: LAW APPLIES TO COSTS OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS 
FOLLOWING DISASTERS.

<P>
 Cities hard-hit by last week's earthquake moved Tuesday to smooth the road to 
reconstruction or force demolition of dangerous buildings, while the county 
Board of Supervisors approved an emergency ordinance to make price gouging 
during disasters a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints of inflated prices for food, gasoline and building 
materials in the hours after the Northridge quake, the supervisors unanimously 
approved Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's request to outlaw such practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are bad seeds out there who will take advantage of whatever they can," 
Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said. "You just cannot trust some people, and 
that's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council joined the Simi Valley council -- which acted 
Monday evening -- in waiving fees for building permits for repair of 
quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Simi Valley council members also said now is the time to consider 
building a new police station to replace the severely damaged 20-year-old one. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Thousand Oaks council members said they were considering new legal 
action against the architect of the city's 12-year-old main library, which 
suffered more damage than any other building in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, the City Council identified 14 structures to be demolished 
because they are structurally undermined and pose a public hazard. Included in 
that number are the historic Masonic Building, the Fillmore Theater and the 
Fillmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state architectural historian told the council that such demolitions 
would rob Fillmore of significant monuments to its oil and farming past. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the nation's top housing and disaster aid officials visited 
Fillmore and hailed the city's response to the 6.6-magnitude Northridge quake 
as something to be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 Although suffering an estimated $250 million in damage -- including massive 
destruction in its historic business district -- Fillmore opened its first 
emergency shelter within 90 minutes of the 4:31 a.m. quake, noted U.S. Housing 
and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros as he saw the devastation 
first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they're proud of their downtown," said Federal Emergency 
Management Agency Director James Lee Witt. "It reminds me of where I came from" 
in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttonholed by county Supervisor Vicky Howard, Cisneros promised to sign the 
$2.8-million block grant for Ventura County that he announced last week. The 
housing secretary also offered to make good on another promise for an immediate 
$1.2 million in loans to rebuild damaged houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard drove Tuesday evening to Pasadena to pick up the checks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Fillmore Mayor Linda Brewster announced that FEMA has 
promised the city trailers as emergency housing for some of the 100 families 
still seeking a place to live. The trailers should be delivered within 48 hours 
and set up on county-owned property, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt promised that federal agencies would continue what he characterized as a 
rapid response to the needs of Ventura County, which suffered $500 million to 
$1 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell, who lost his house to the quake, said he 
has been impressed with FEMA's local efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me hope," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 dwellings have been damaged countywide, including about 1,350 with 
moderate or severe damage in Fillmore and Simi Valley alone, inspectors have 
reported. About 200 businesses, mostly in Simi Valley, Fillmore and Piru, also 
were moderately or severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 While federal officials surveyed county damage, local officials responded with 
new laws and fee breaks to aid quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors voted 4 to 0 to adopt a price-gouging ordinance that makes 
it a misdemeanor to inflate prices in the county's unincorporated areas after a 
disaster. Bradbury also has proposed that all 10 local cities adopt similar 
laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new county ordinance, anyone who is caught raising prices on food, 
water and other emergency supplies by more than 10% could face a fine or jail 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 quake, Bradbury's office received about a dozen complaints 
of price gouging on essentials -- such as $8-a-gallon milk and $8 pieces of 
plywood sold for $200. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, excessive price increases were not uncommon," Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Colleen Toy White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also voted to eliminate building permit fees for quake victims 
and gave victims permission to stay on their property in trailers until houses 
are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Council, at its first meeting since the quake last Monday, 
moved to help residents and business owners repair damaged buildings, ratifying 
the city manager's emergency decision to waive building fees for quake-related 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also warned residents to watch out for fly-by-night contractors 
who are popping up in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to have someone come in, take your money, do a halfway job and 
then disappear," Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "People really need to be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Monday, Simi Valley city inspectors had plastered red or yellow tags 
signifying extreme or moderate damage on 317 homes, 108 commercial and 
industrial buildings and six churches -- deeming them unsafe or of questionable 
safety. Thousands more buildings suffered less severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Permits are required for repairing everything from fireplaces, roofs and 
foundations to gas, water and sanitation lines. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident seeking permits to replace a roof and fireplace normally would pay 
about $200 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also agreed to accelerate the permit process by allowing 
residents with engineer-certified construction plans to skip the city's plan 
review, a process that can take up to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Councilwoman Barbara Williamson called for a new police station, 
saying she feared for the safety of police officers who work at the city's 
quake-damaged Cochran Street facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real problem with our men in blue going into that building," 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake sank the southeast corner of the station several inches, ripping a 
stairwell away from the walls and snapping a water line on the second floor, 
flooding the building's lockers and gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson asked city staff to prepare a study on the possible relocation of 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and council members Bill Davis and Sandi Webb 
said they supported construction of a new station eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 For the short term, Stratton said he would favor relocation of some police 
officers to the old Simi Valley courthouse rather than rebuilding the damaged 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to do it one day, and maybe now is not a bad time to 
start the planning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its list of buildings to be demolished, the Fillmore City 
Council said that even a moderate quake could topple the 14 damaged structures 
city inspectors have decided to raze. 
</P>
<P>
 But a representative from the California Office of Historic Preservation urged 
the council to reconsider the condemnation orders. Mitch Stone said demolition 
of the Masonic Building, which lost its back wall and is leaning toward Central 
Avenue, would be a tremendous mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a key building for downtown," said Stone, a former Fillmore planner, 
in an interview. "If it were demolished, nothing equaling its importance could 
replace it. It would be missed forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone was also concerned that the owners of the Fillmore Theater, built in 
1917, and the turn-of-the-century Central Avenue Market seem intent on 
demolishing their buildings or letting the city do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city should be looking at alternatives for these owners," Stone said. "I 
don't think they understand that in most of these cases, when the building 
comes down nothing will be put up in its place and the city will have vacant 
lots." 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of the six houses and eight businesses may start this week, 
although owners can appeal to the City Council, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the City Council waived building permit fees that officials 
said could amount to $30,000 in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city did not take any formal action Tuesday night, some council 
members said the city should take a hard look at whether the architectural firm 
that designed the city's $9-million library made mistakes that led to $2 
million in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already sued Albert C. Martin & Associates of Los Angeles, 
claiming the firm is responsible for $1.8 million in alleged flaws with the 
roof, lighting and duct work. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they are waiting for investigators to determine whether 
the collapse of the 12-year-old building's metal ceiling could have been 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling ceiling panels ruptured sprinkler pipes and crashed into books and 
shelves, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they should have taken into consideration the dangers of having a 
metal ceiling," City Councilman Frank Schillo said before Tuesday night's 
meeting. "They assured us this would be the best possible ceiling, and now it 
doesn't look like that was true."

BANK ROBBERY ENDS WITH 1 SUSPECT HURT, 2 ARRESTED; VENTURA: SUSPECTS FLED TO A 
FILLMORE MOBILE HOME PARK BEFORE ONE IS HIT BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG AND THE 
OTHER TWO ARE ARRESTED.

<P>
 A Ventura bank was robbed late Tuesday morning by three bandits who briefly 
escaped to Fillmore before one of them was struck by a tractor-trailer rig and 
critically injured and the other two were arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 11 a.m. two of the three suspects burst into the Bank of America 
branch at 2698 E. Main Street brandishing at least one sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects then leaped over the bank's counter and ordered patrons 
and employees on the floor while systematically grabbing cash from each of the 
bank's teller stations. The two men then escaped to an awaiting car, said 
Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect, believed to be a woman and getaway driver, was also involved 
in the incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't injure anyone, but they sure scared the heck out of a lot of 
people at that bank," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, a vehicle matching the description of the car leaving the 
bank was spotted by a California Highway Patrol officer traveling east on 
California 126 toward Fillmore. The CHP officer followed, but did not chase the 
suspects until they turned off into the El Dorado Mobile Home Park, said FBI 
Special Agent Larry Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CHP did some excellent police work here," Dick said. "They were able to 
follow and observe the suspects' actions so that other units could converge on 
the mobile home park." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were arrested a short time later by Ventura police, CHP and 
Ventura County sheriff's deputies but not before one of them was hit by a 
tractor-trailer rig and critically injured while attempting to run across 
California 126. He was transported to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital where he 
underwent emergency surgery. He remained in critical condition Tuesday evening, 
a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although law enforcement officials would not disclose the amount of cash 
stolen during the robbery, agents and investigators said as of late Tuesday 
that not all of the money had been recovered and that a possible fourth suspect 
may have been involved. Authorities seized a late model Oldsmobile near Piru 
that may have been the fourth suspect's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In takeover robberies, it is not uncommon to have the main perpetrators hire 
a younger person to go into the back, wield a gun and abuse the tellers," Dick 
said. "They are then paid a certain amount for the task and told to get lost. 
We're not sure, but we think this is what may have happened in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick said all three of the suspects will be charged with armed robbery and 
that the two uninjured suspects are being held in Ventura County Jail. Because 
of conflicting information about the suspects' names and ages, a computerized 
statewide search of fingerprint records will be needed in order to confirm 
their true identities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours after the robbery, the suspects' abandoned 1994 Cadillac sedan 
remained parked on a quiet lane at the mobile home park, a shotgun butt still 
visible as it stuck out from underneath a floor mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents at the trailer park contacted later Tuesday said they were 
unaware that the fleeing bank robbers had dumped their getaway car there in an 
attempt to evade officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I'm a former combat veteran, I don't think that I would have 
wanted to run into these people," said Don Ostrander, 70. "Boy, we have last 
week's quake and now this. What's next?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident at the trailer park told his neighbor that one of the 
suspects casually approached him and asked for the way to the park's exit. The 
man gave the directions, never thinking that the three were suspected bank 
robbers.

CRIME RATE IN VENTURA DECREASES 6% IN 1993; POLICE: CITY REPORTS DECLINE IN 
ROBBERIES, RAPES AND ASSAULTS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE MORE HOMICIDES THAN THE YEAR 
BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime in Ventura fell slightly in 1993 for the second year in a row partly 
because of a sharp drop in robberies, according to figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, violent and property crimes reported in the city fell 6% compared with 
1992 and 9% from 1991 figures, even as the city's population increased 
slightly. But last year's figures were still higher than in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had six more homicides in 1993 than in 1992, but the number of rapes, 
robberies and aggravated assaults dropped. Robberies showed the biggest change, 
falling 25% despite a surge of holdups at gas stations and fast-food 
restaurants in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were encouraged by the drop, but noted that crime patterns 
fluctuate from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time it goes down, we're obviously pleased," said Sgt. Bob Anderson, who 
supervises the police force's major crimes unit. "But things go down and things 
go up. I don't know if you can count any particular reason or credit any 
particular effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said: "You like to see the stats go down and not up, but I 
don't think it would cause any of us to believe you've got a problem licked." 
</P>
<P>
 Buford also noted that despite the two-year decline, public perception in 
Ventura and elsewhere is that crime is worsening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things happening in society generally give people a feeling that 
we're not in control as we used to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ventura, the cities of Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Santa Paula saw 
overall decreases in the number of crimes reported in 1993. In Santa Paula, 
however, violent crime reached its highest level in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department -- which patrols Thousand 
Oaks, Ojai, Fillmore and the unincorporated areas -- are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police linked the city's decrease in robberies to an overall decline 
in bank robberies throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, bank holdups surged to a county record of 97, then dropped by 50% in 
1993. And in Ventura, bank robberies showed a similar drop from 22 holdups in 
1992 to nine last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crimes used to calculate the city's crime rate also fell a combined 
5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglaries and thefts -- the categories with the largest number of incidents 
-- declined, while auto thefts went up 6% and the number of arsons held steady 
at 58. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. John Leach, who investigates property crimes, attributed the drop in 
burglaries and thefts partly to the arrest of a handful of career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey DeBolt, for example, was arrested by Ventura police in October on 
suspicion of dealing methamphetamine to people who would steal bicycles to pay 
for the drugs. DeBolt would then strip down the bikes and sell the parts or 
rebuild the bikes and sell them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBolt is now serving time at the Sheriff Department's Honor Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a small enough agency and town that when we see certain people go to 
jail, there's a marked decrease in the crime rate," Leach said. "We can see 
that, whereas in L. A., they're not going to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Police Chief Richard Thomas could not be reached for comment, other 
city officials looked beyond the Police Department for explanations on the 
crime picture. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Greg Carson said the city's recreation department, for 
example, helps provide positive activities for youths with after-school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at public safety as just a police department," he said. Ventura

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DISPLACED SIMI PUPILS TO ATTEND RIVAL SCHOOL

 Junior Kris Williams lives right across the street from Simi Valley High 
School, but beginning today, he will have to take a bus to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earthquake damage to Simi Valley High is repaired, its students and 
faculty will attend classes 5 1/2 miles away at the home of their cross-town 
rival, Royal High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real inconvenience," 16-year-old Kris said. "Now our lives are 
disrupted, considering we have to start school at 12 and go until 5." 
</P>
<P>
 The two schools will operate on a split shift, with Royal running from 7 to 
11:35 a.m. and Simi High arriving at 12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 First-period class assignments for Simi High students will be posted on 
outside walls today. Once in their first class, the students will receive the 
rest of their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be just like the first day of school," said school board member Judy 
Barry, who helped staff an information center Tuesday in the parking lot at 
Simi High. "I'm really confident that it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Barry, a group of teachers at the information center distributed 
bus schedules and other information as parents and students stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first-period class, the students will be given their programs plus a 
map, because they won't know their way around campus," Simi High English 
teacher Marge Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The split schedule, resulting in shortened days for students at both schools, 
is not desirable, but it's better than no school at all, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing it's going to do is get us through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No food service will be provided to either group of students, but those who 
bring their lunches will be able to use the cafeteria between 11:40 a.m. and 
12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said she doesn't know how long Simi High students will 
have to attend classes at Royal, but noted that the arrangement will continue 
at least until Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, workers wearing respirators and protective clothing began removing 
asbestos found in ceiling panels at Simi High -- a discovery that forced a 
delay in the school's reopening. School officials had originally believed that 
the building would be ready this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Work to repair earthquake damage at the school cannot begin until the asbestos 
is removed by a certified contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage districtwide has been estimated at between $3 million and $5 million, 
with about $1 million at Simi High, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, all schools in the district except Simi Valley High had reopened, 
including Township School, one of the most heavily damaged by the magnitude 6.6 
quake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is people have pulled together like champions," Township 
Principal Barbara Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, some school buses will be available at Simi Valley High at 
11:45 a.m. to transport students to Royal, officials said. However, the 
district is encouraging parents to car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 City buses will operate on their regular schedules, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students predicted that the rivalry between the two schools will be 
intensified by the shared quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of fights," said Kevin McClintock, 15, a 
10th-grader at Simi High. 
</P>
<P>
 But Royal Principal Mike McConahey said staff members from the two schools 
have worked hard to ensure that things run smoothly. Officials have about half 
an hour between the departure of Royal's 1,800 students and the arrival of 
Simi's 2,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, minor glitches can be expected on the first day or two, he said. With 
its larger staff and student population, Simi will use more space than Royal, 
McConahey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some chaos, and there will be some milling around," he said. 
"But in a couple of days, everything will settle down and we'll get back to 
being a high school -- or two high schools, as the case may be."

THEATER PANEL TO VOTE ON SIGN PLANS FOR ARTS CENTER; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER THREE OPTIONS, INCLUDING A 15-FOOT-HIGH MARQUEE WITH 
MESSAGE BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reviving an ongoing debate about the city's sign standards, the Thousand Oaks 
Civic Theaters Commission will vote tonight on a proposed marquee and 
electronic message board for the performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider three options to advertise the Civic Arts Plaza's 
two theaters and government offices, scheduled to open in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The most grandiose proposal calls for a 15-foot-high rectangular sign along 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. As envisioned, the monument would cover 240 square 
feet -- roughly 60% greater than the largest sign now allowed under city codes. 
One-third of the sign would be covered by an electronic board listing upcoming 
performances and municipal meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 To follow city codes as written, the sign would have to remain 48 square feet 
and therefore could not hold a message board. The Civic Theaters Commission 
will consider that option as well as a third proposal of a 150-square-foot sign 
with a small message board. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts aficionados argue that the marquee must be highly visible and easily 
readable to the thousands of motorists who drive down Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
each day. The sign must be extra-large, they say, to balance the blocky 
building and parking structure behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a theater anywhere that doesn't have a marquee, and my eye says 
that a larger sign would look much better aesthetically," said Virginia Davis, 
who chairs the theaters commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But already, several City Council members have expressed concern about the 
size of the proposed sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the council rejected a proposed Auto Mall sign that would 
have included an electronic message board measuring 112 square feet. Worried 
that the pulsing billboard would distract motorists and mar a scenic stretch of 
the Ventura Freeway, the council allowed only a small electronic board 
displaying time and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest proposed version for the Civic Arts Plaza sign would contain an 
80-square-foot message board -- four times as large as the time-and-temperature 
board ultimately approved for the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the city should set a double standard and make exceptions for 
itself that are denied to private developers," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "It's 
not fair, it's not good government and it's not ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his unwavering support for the Civic Arts Plaza, Councilman Frank 
Schillo also voiced doubts about the biggest sign proposal. Because the 
monument will stand fairly close to Thousand Oaks Boulevard, he said, drivers 
should be able to read even a small or mid-size marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, normally a staunch defender of the city's 
strict sign ordinances, said she would approve of the largest message board. 
The sign will sit low to the ground, she noted, and therefore will not block 
mountain views or clutter the city's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scale seems appropriate for the mass of the building and the site," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski's only concern: placing the message board atop letters spelling out 
"City Hall" might create some comical juxtapositions. "We could have, 'Comedy 
of Errors Tonight! City Hall' " she said. "Or, 'The Tempest! City Hall.' Can 
you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will make the final call on the marquee design after the 
Civic Theaters Commission's advisory vote tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during tonight's 7 p.m. meeting at City Hall, the seven-member theaters 
commission will debate whether to charge for parking during shows in the 
1,800-seat auditorium. A fee of $4 would bring in roughly $200,000 a year -- 
money that could be used to subsidize lower-priced tickets for senior citizens 
and students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the cost of going out," said Everett Ascher, director of the 
Conejo Symphony. "If you have three or four people in a car, you're talking 
about just $1, $1.75 a person. You can't get more reasonable than that." 
</P>
<P>
 While discussing parking, the commissioners will also focus on how to provide 
enough spaces for every patron. The five-level garage now under construction 
contains only 735 spaces, not nearly enough to accommodate a full house. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's options include creating temporary parking on vacant land near the 
auditorium, reconfiguring the garage to add more parking stalls on the roof, or 
arranging off-site parking with a shuttle bus to carry patrons to the theater.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; WORK DELAYED ON OIL SPILL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleanup of a 168,000-gallon oil spill in the Santa Clara River east of Piru 
was delayed Tuesday as the rain-swollen stream kept most workers at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But berms built to contain the spill within a 12- to 15-mile stretch of the 
river held, and the rain did not push the sticky crude farther downstream as 
feared, California Department of Fish and Game officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about the speed of the water and the roads that were muddy 
and slippery, so we limited the number of hand crews working," said Lt. Reed 
Smith, pollution response coordinator for Southern California and supervisor of 
the cleanup effort. "We'll be back in full cleanup mode on Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil clung to willows, watercress and other vegetation along the banks and 
in the river wash. In some isolated pools of the river, a heavy sheen was 
visible. But no longer is the oil floating on the moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake ruptured a pipeline near Valencia and spilled the 
oil into the river, crews have vacuumed up about 58,000 gallons of the oil. But 
Smith said the Department of Fish and Game and Arco, parent company of 
Four-Corners Pipeline, may raise the estimated amount of oil that spilled from 
the pipeline. That figure was not available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the toll of dead and injured animals rose. Crews have found 24 dead 
birds and 23 live birds coated with oil. They also found 629 dead fish, 
including three endangered unarmored three-spined stickleback. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of river contaminated by the spill was a habitat for the 
stickleback, Smith said. He said the population there is estimated at 100 to 
200 stickleback, but no firm count exists. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 4 REAPPOINTED TO PLANNING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After doing away with two of seven positions on the Planning Commission and 
restructuring the terms of the remaining five, the Oxnard City Council on 
Tuesday reappointed four of the current members. 
</P>
<P>
 Each council member went with past experience in selecting an appointee to the 
commission, which makes planning recommendations to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel F. Lopez chose Edward Castillo, Councilman Michael A. Plisky 
named Dale Dean, Councilman Andres Herrera selected Arthur Joe Lopez, and 
Councilman Bedford Pinkard chose Albert G. Duff. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas E. Holden selected Sonny Okada, a former planning 
commissioner who applied for the job hours before Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the restructuring ordinance approved last month, each planning 
commissioner will serve on the advisory panel for as long as the council member 
who made the appointment serves on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was criticized by several former commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't figure I would be (named) simply because I've come out against the 
restructuring," said Ralph Schumacher, one-time chairman of the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also feel that if I was to serve as a commissioner, I would have to serve 
the people," Schumacher said. "I don't want to be politically attached to any 
council member." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER REBUILDING SPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will tonight consider approving plans to rebuild 
the congested Carmen Drive-Ventura Freeway interchange.  
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with Caltrans, the city would finance about 60% of the 
$11-million project, which includes a new, wider bridge spanning the Ventura 
Freeway, widened, redesigned north and south on- and off-ramps, and traffic 
signals, said Dan Greeley, city director of engineering services. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans would pick up the balance of the long-awaited project on the 
25-year-old interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the project, which involves construction of the new 
overpass, could start as early as this fall, Greeley said. Completion of the 
overpass is expected in about a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the matter during the meeting at City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive, starting at 5 p.m. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SCHOOL INVESTIGATES ALLEGED RACIAL SLURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several girls at Matilija Junior High School in Ojai have been accused of 
making racial slurs against another girl, school officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal James Berube said he was investigating a report that someone drew a 
swastika in the dirt near one girl's locker last week and that a racial epithet 
was written on her locker late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, who is black and who transferred into the district in September, 
has also received at least two threatening notes and a series of verbal 
threats, said Lonnie Stanford, the girl's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials Tuesday downplayed the incidents, with the principal saying 
it was a dispute over mutual acquaintances. The girls "had been having friend 
problems," Berube said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Principal Steve Olsen questioned whether threats were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girl said there was something spoken to her as she walked down a sidewalk 
(on campus)," said Olsen, who also is Ojai's mayor. "The other kids 
emphatically denied that it was anything racial." 
</P>
<P>
 Berube said he met with his staff Tuesday to discuss the allegations and said 
he planned to get the parents of the girls together for a meeting with school 
officials. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ART ADDS NEW DIMENSION TO SENIORS' LIVES 
</P>

<P>
 Dave Franklin didn't take up a brush and canvas until 18 months ago, when he 
was already a septuagenarian. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first two paintings he completed -- a seascape and a sunset -- were 
awarded blue ribbons at the Ventura County Fair last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That led the retired Ventura machinist to the conclusion that "maybe I started 
painting too late. Maybe I should have started a little earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin, who declined to give his precise age, is among a group of about 20 
senior citizens who meet each Tuesday to practice painting at the Senior 
Recreation Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are lifelong painters, others are beginners trying their hand at a craft 
that they only now have time for. Still others make their way each week to the 
center to chat with other artists who have become their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Miller, a painter well-known in the Ventura arts community, teaches the 
class. But the instruction is very informal, with Miller giving tips and 
demonstrations only when a student is having a problem with a particular 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
 The class is free to people aged 50 or older, Miller said. It is paid through 
a county grant for adult education, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ferreira, 68, said he has painted as a hobby for 35 years. It has always 
been the creative outlet that counterbalanced his career as an insurance 
salesman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no limits in painting," the Ventura resident said. "You can change 
the seasons with the stroke of a brush." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said he has even more time to spend on his avocation since retiring 
two years ago. On Tuesday, he was working on a beach scene that included a 
bright red lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lamp, 64, said she has been joining the painting group's weekly session 
for nearly two years. She had always wanted to paint but never had the time as 
she raised children and worked as a dance teacher at Humboldt State University, 
Lamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Painting is an absorbing process, and you can't do it if kids are in your 
face all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Editha Andrews said she has been coming to the center for six 
years. A nun with the Holy Cross order, Andrews said she paints as a way to 
express her love of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also become good friends with several of the other painters, bringing 
them gifts at Christmas and sharing stories, Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray for this group every day," she said. "They are a wonderful group." KAY

 California 33 was closed at Casitas Springs for seven hours Tuesday as utility 
crews repaired power lines that were knocked down during a hit-and-run accident 
that sent two men to the hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morning commuters between Ojai and Ventura were forced to detour around Oak 
View on Santa Ana Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 12:10 a.m. Tuesday when an unidentified driver 
lost control of his car and slammed into the utility pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fled the scene, leaving two injured passengers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Gomez Ortiz, 25, of Ojai, was taken to Ventura County Medical 
Center with moderate injuries. He was listed in good condition late Tuesday, a 
nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second passenger, Javier Francisco Sanchez, 26, of Ojai was also taken to 
Ventura County Medical Center with injuries. A nursing supervisor said he was 
in satisfactory condition Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials were still looking for the driver Tuesday night. He is wanted on 
suspicion of drunk driving and felony hit and run. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY RENAMES STREET BUT NOT AFTER CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A months-long effort to change the name of a La Colonia street was approved 
Tuesday, but not before Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and several residents tried 
to get the roadway renamed for the late Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the City Council tentatively approved a plan to change the 
street name from Camino de la Raza to Camino del Sol after residents requested 
it.But since then, Lopez said, more than 1,200 people, including many of those 
who live on the street, asked that it be named for Chavez.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200 signatures represent roughly three times as many people who lobbied 
earlier that the street be renamed Camino del Sol, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and two Oxnard residents on Tuesday urged the council to rethink 
their approval earlier this month and instead name the street in honor of 
Chavez, the late farm worker advocate whose boyhood home was in La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Cesar visited this area, many politicians wanted to be around him," said 
Carlos Aguilera. "What a way now to honor him." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the council refused the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Thomas E. Holden said he would support naming a future street 
after the United Farm Workers organizer -- most likely in the northeast part of 
the city that is now being laid out for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez voted against naming the street Camino del Sol on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Miguel Espinosa, responding to Holden's proposal, said the 
city has no business naming a street after Chavez in that area.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's baloney," he said. "It's got to be there (in La Colonia)." JEFF

 A quick-moving storm that dropped nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain in 
parts of Ventura County caused no damage to areas recently ravaged by 
earthquakes and fires, officials said Tuesday.

<P>
 The rain, which began about 6 p.m. Monday and moved out about four hours 
later, never became intense and was quickly absorbed by barren earth scorched 
by wildfires last fall, said Dolores Taylor, division engineer in the county's 
Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The hills above Newbury Park and Santa Paula, scenes of the greatest 
devastation from wildfires in Ventura County, received about half an inch of 
rain. Mountain areas received up to 0.69 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a healthy rain," Taylor said. "It should water the grass seeds that 
the Soil Conservation Corps worked so hard to spread around the fire areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, where residents have been struggling to bring order to lives 
disrupted by the 6.6 magnitude Northridge earthquake, the storm caused little 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Patrick Askren said the biggest problem caused by the rain was a 
brief outage that affected 1,000 residents on the east side of town. A 
transformer that may have been weakened by the Jan. 17 earthquake blew out 
during the storm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformer was quickly repaired by Southern California Edison workers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's blustery, cool weather will give way to sunny skies and warmer 
temperatures today, said Dennis Tussey, a technician with the National Weather 
Service in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Highs could reach into the low 60s. There is a 50% chance of more showers 
Thursday morning from another storm system that is moving toward the coast, 
Tussey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extended forecast calls for clearing skies and warmer temperatures, he 
said. County Rainfall

 Sheriff's deputies in Thousand Oaks have arrested a 27-year-old man on 
suspicion of sexually assaulting a 40-year-old woman in her motel room on New 
Year's Eve, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Franklin Goff was taken into custody Monday and booked into jail at 
the East County Sheriff's Station.He was released later that day on his promise 
to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest came after the woman told sheriff's detectives that Goff sexually 
assaulted her inside her motel room after they had attended a party in Simi 
Valley on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told deputies she had become intoxicated at the party and allowed 
Goff, with whom she was acquainted, to drive her back to her motel room in 
Thousand Oaks. She then asked him to leave and passed out on the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the woman, she later discovered that Goff undressed her and 
sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, sheriff's deputies said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; PRE-APPLICATION PLAN OKD FOR DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Oxnard City Council will decide whether to give tentative 
approval to major projects in the city before developers embark on the lengthy 
application process, under a pre-application plan approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the proposal in an effort to streamline the permit 
process and give the council a chance to study plans for significant and 
sensitive projects before applicants invest time and money in the developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will provide a much smoother flow," Councilman Michael A. Plisky said. 
"What we do is kind of brainstorm and talk out loud and give staff some 
direction about what we'd like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Macri-Ortiz of the Channel Counties Legal Services poverty law 
firm expressed concern that the effort would backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it turns into a mechanism where it's just another hoop a developer has to 
go through, it could affect affordable housing projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under review is the creation of the position of zoning administrator, who 
could approve minor permits such as variances. The administrator would not be a 
new position, however. Community Development Director Richard J. Maggio would 
be assigned the duties in addition to his present job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission and City Council would still review parcel and 
subdivision maps, and other major land-use applications. Staff workers are 
still formulating details of the zoning administrator concept. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: SIMI VALLEY; CITY AMENDS LAW ON POLITICAL SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just in time for the upcoming city and county elections, political campaign 
signs in Simi Valley will no longer be singled out for special regulation, 
under an amended temporary sign ordinance that the City Council has initially 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the change, signs bearing political messages could be posted for 45 
days before an election and 15 days after.Other types of signs, such as real 
estate ads, could be posted indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge in Los Angeles recently ruled that the limitations on 
political signs were content-based and therefore unconstitutional, because they 
restricted free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to that ruling, the council Monday altered its ordinance to set 
uniform time limits for all temporary signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revised ordinance, all temporary signs will be allowed to remain 
posted for 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
 After 120 days, a sign may be removed for one day and then replaced near its 
original posting site, City Atty. John Torrance told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance explained that the loophole was designed to allow real estate agents 
to advertise unsold properties for longer periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Greg Stratton said the provision would invite abuse of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ground is going to be like Swiss cheese," Stratton said. "Some guy is 
just going to move his sign from hole to hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton asked that the ordinance be reviewed within the next year to make 
sure that it is not being abused. SARA CATANIA

RESIDENTIAL SALES IN COUNTY INCREASE BY 5.4% FROM 1992 TO 1993; HOUSING: MOST 
OF THE RISE OCCURS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. EXPERTS SAY MANY FIRST-TIME 
BUYERS WERE LURED BY A MIX OF LOW INTEREST RATES AND LOW PRICES. 
</P>

<P>
 Residential real estate sales in Ventura County jumped 5.4% from 1992 to 1993, 
with a large chunk of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter of last 
year, according to a report by TRW-REDI Property Data, a national real estate 
information company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could mark a turn-around for Ventura County," said Nima Nattagh, an 
analyst with TRW-REDI. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh said low interest rates combined with low prices at the end of 1993 to 
make the Ventura County market irresistible to many first-time buyers. Local 
real estate agents confirmed Nattagh's observations and data. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people sitting on the fence said, 'We'd better start doing it now,' 
" said Robert Gilbert, branch manager for Prudential California Realty's 
Channel Islands office. "I live in Mandalay Bay, and this is the best pricing 
I've seen since the early '80s."  
</P>
<P>
 Local agents, however, say they are puzzled that the lower end of the market 
has begun selling at a fast clip, but sales do not seem to be "bumping up" and 
rejuvenating the middle and higher ends of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schniepp, director of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project, 
said this is because more residents are leaving Ventura County than are 
arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are cashing out and getting out of here," he said. "The main reason is 
there are no jobs. There is nothing to keep them here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs -- that's the major piece of the puzzle that's missing," Schniepp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local real estate agents hope last week's earthquake will add some stimulus to 
the county market. Already, they say, phones are ringing off the hook in east 
county realty offices, the result of San Fernando Valley homeowners looking for 
rental properties while they repair their damaged houses and condominiums in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will definitely be a move to buy, but people may have to rent 
temporarily," said Mary Hall, president-elect of the Conejo Valley Assn. of 
Realtors. "I'm not going to say for one minute that the Conejo Valley is 
earthquake-proof, but people's perception is that it is safer out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said the same rental boom occurred in the area around Santa Barbara 
after the devastating 1990 fire there but that most renters eventually moved 
back to their original neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble that still exists is jobs," he said. "If people are willing to 
commute, then yes, this earthquake could be a final straw kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County residential market, however, proved healthier last year 
than the regional residential market. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California as a whole saw its residential sales fall 1.3% from 1992 
to 1993 -- an improvement over the 11.4% drop in sales between 1991 and 1992 
but still quite a ways from the level of activity in the Ventura County market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the quality-of-life factor has something to do with it," Nattagh said 
of the difference between the local and regional markets. "There's been a big 
push out of Los Angeles in the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall in the county, 8,845 new and existing single family houses and 
condominiums were sold in 1993, up from 8,394 residential units in 1992, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's market still cannot compare with a boom market such as 1988, when 
17,312 houses sold in the county in one year, Nattagh said. "You always reach a 
base level of activity in any given market," he said, speculating that Ventura 
County reached its base level this fall and could only go up from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The average residential selling price in Ventura County in 1993 was $234,381, 
1.6% lower than in 1992. Nattagh and other analysts, however, caution against 
paying much attention to average pricing figures. Many more lower-priced houses 
and condominiums sold in 1993 than did properties on the higher end of the 
market, and that phenomenon alone can drag down the county's average selling 
price, Nattagh said.

VENTURA TAKES FIRST STEP TO CHANGE ZONING IN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR; PLANNING: CITY 
STUDIES STATUS CHANGE THAT WOULD ENABLE TWO LAND-OWNING FAMILIES AND A COPY 
SERVICE FIRM TO PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES ON 77 ACRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council is considering a proposal that could change the 
course of the city's traditional industrial area by building houses, offices 
and a public park in the northern Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Monday night, the council took the first step toward changing 
the zoning from heavy industrial to commercial and residential uses for a 
proposed project affecting about 77 acres in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the proposal would conflict with the city's longtime 
Comprehensive Plan, a legally binding planning document that has traditionally 
designated northern Ventura Avenue as a place for heavy industry. The council 
would have to amend the Comprehensive Plan before approving the proposed 
housing and office complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's -- a copy service company 
headquartered in the area -- want to develop their land and demolish a lemon 
grove to make room for 330 residential units, a park, bike trails and business 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is now a mixture of vacant lots, industrial businesses, 
storage lots for old cars and buses, and the Neel family's 20-acre lemon grove. 
It is north of Stanley Avenue and south of Seneca Street, and bounded on the 
east by Ventura Avenue and the west by California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Following public testimony late Monday, the council voted 6 to 1 to initiate 
the zone change. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action does not indicate approval of the project, only that 
council members plan to later consider changing the zoning in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, the only council member who owns a business in the 
neighborhood, cast the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan, owner of a welding company and a longtime advocate of the Ventura 
Avenue area, argued that Ventura must preserve its industrial roots. Earlier 
this century, Ventura was a booming oil town, and the Ventura Avenue area has 
been home to many oil-service businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has historically been Ventura's industrial site," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, property owners and other council members say the city has since 
departed from its roots in the oil industry and is evolving into a 
service-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to respect the fact that we're no longer an oil industry (town)," 
Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kinko's -- a service-based industry -- has a gleaming white office 
building in the middle of the traditionally gritty neighborhood. Under the 
proposal, the company would build a 60,000-square-foot addition, and city 
leaders say they are eager to accommodate the expansion plans of one of 
Ventura's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed project has drawn the opposition of some neighboring property 
owners because the Neels, Huntsingers and Kinko's are asking the council to 
change the zoning on about 25 acres of their neighbors' properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would make the industrial neighborhood more upscale and would fit 
in better with their development, said Steve Perlman, a land-use consultant 
hired by the families and Kinko's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reinvestment in the Avenue community is intended to somewhat change the 
character of the community," Perlman told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, neighboring property owners objected to the plans, arguing that 
they want their land to stay industrially zoned because such property is scarce 
in the city and has lower vacancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kinko's and the Neels and the Huntsingers plan to build, God bless them, 
but don't take away our zoning," said Beverly Olmos, who owns a little more 
than an acre of property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, who have expressed an interest in revitalizing the area, 
were swayed by arguments of private investment in one of the city's poorest 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Avenue has been neglected for the last 20 to 25 years," Carl Huntsinger 
said. "The purpose of this project is to change that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said they will begin an environmental review of the proposed 
project, and the council will consider approving the zoning changes and the 
proposed development later this year.

MAN CONVICTED IN THEFT OF COMPANY'S COMPUTER FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury on Tuesday convicted a former facilities manager of 
Camarillo-based Siemens Solar Industries in connection with a break-in at the 
company last year. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating only three hours, the Superior Court jury found George 
Stockhausen of Lancaster guilty of one count of burglary and one count of 
unlawful access of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the case appears to be the first in county history in which a 
defendant was charged with stealing confidential computer files. 
</P>
<P>
 A Siemens security guard saw Stockhausen downloading computer files in the 
company's legal office shortly after midnight on Feb. 27.  
</P>
<P>
 Stockhausen confessed to private investigators that he entered the locked, 
off-limits office from a rooftop and copied some files.  
</P>
<P>
 The break-in of the legal office occurred only hours after Siemens sued 
Atlantic Richfield Co., alleging that Arco had failed to disclose problems at 
the Camarillo plant before selling it to Siemens. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens officials speculated the burglary may have been intended to get 
information about the suit. Stockhausen, however, told private investigators 
that he was trying to retrieve information on another Siemens employee rumored 
to have failed a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna W. Thonis did not try to prove that Stockhausen 
wanted to sell the computer files that he copied. She told the jury his motive 
was irrelevant, since it is illegal to copy computer files without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kenneth B. Frank of Los Angeles, who could not be reached 
after the verdicts, did not put Stockhausen on the stand or offer any defense.

ELDERLY MAN FOUND AFTER 3-DAY DISAPPEARANCE; VENTURA: GORDON ELLIS' SON 
DISCOVERS HIM IN A FIELD, SUFFERING FROM EXPOSURE. AN AFTERSHOCK MAY HAVE 
FRIGHTENED HIM.

<P>
 An 82-year-old Ventura man, who apparently wandered outdoors barefoot for more 
than three days after an earthquake aftershock last week, was recovering 
Tuesday in a Ventura hospital, but family members said he may lose his toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Ellis, who walked away from his home early Thursday wearing only pants 
and a T-shirt, has badly bruised and swollen feet, said his son, Elwyn Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Ellis said doctors fear they may have to remove toes because of 
damage caused by prolonged exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad had been really upset with the earthquake," Ellis said. "On Wednesday 
he was upset about the aftershocks. He kept saying, 'I want to go home' " to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis found his father Sunday morning, incoherent and lying on the ground in 
an isolated field west of San Jon Road near the ocean, several blocks from his 
father's Meta Street home near downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first saw his feet and I knew it was him," Ellis said. "I said, 'Dad' and 
he raised his hand. 'I found you,' I said." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said his father's temperature had dropped to 92 degrees and he had lost 
his glasses and his false teeth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I ran for help and called the police," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Ellis was taken to Community Memorial Hospital, where he was in good 
condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elwyn Ellis said his father, a widower and retired plumber, frequently suffers 
from confusion and forgetfulness. The son has not been able to learn where the 
elderly man was during the time he was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Ellis' brother-in-law, Ernest Windham, said he last saw him at midnight 
Wednesday. When he tried to check on him again two hours later, the elderly man 
was not in the house they share. 
</P>
<P>
 Windham said he frequently checks on his brother-in-law in the middle of the 
night because the older man stays up through the night and wanders around the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very forgetful," Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Windham immediately reported his brother-in-law's disappearance to police. The 
next day Windham and other family members were out distributing flyers 
throughout Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 They feared that Gordon Ellis may have gone looking for a train station to 
return to Texas, where he lived for 30 years before coming to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police and 10 other people helped Elwyn Ellis search for his father. 
"We went everywhere looking for him, including the hobo jungle area where the 
homeless people hang around," Elwyn Ellis said, referring to the Ventura River 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the most disappointing moment came Saturday night when he got a prank 
call saying his father was at a restaurant in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Ellis was one of five elderly people reported missing after the Jan. 17 
earthquake and aftershocks, said Mary Randall, a crisis supervisor at the 
Ventura County Mental Health Department. All have been found, she said.

<P>
 Emergency hazardous waste centers are opening in Simi Valley and Fillmore to 
collect leaky cans of paint thinner, broken bottles of pesticide and other 
toxic substances that were damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection centers, approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors and 
coordinated by the county's General Services Agency and Waste Management 
Department, will be open today through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

COUNTY METROLINK RIDERSHIP UP 30% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ridership continued to grow on Ventura County's Metrolink trains to downtown 
Los Angeles and has now increased about 30% since commuters began their mass 
return to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the trend looks like it will continue at least until some of the 
earthquake damage to Los Angeles-area freeways is repaired, county 
transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day they were all buying a single round trip," said planner Steve 
DeGeorge, who assisted customers at the Simi Valley station Tuesday morning. 
"Today they were either buying 10-trip packages or monthly passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership from the Moorpark and Simi Valley stations was about 600 trips per 
day before the earthquake but is now about 780, said county transportation 
Manager Mary Travis. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes county residents who have changed their commuting habits 
will stay on trains even after quake-caused freeway snarls disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, transportation agencies Tuesday hustled to fix problems such as 
overloaded trains at the Burbank and Glendale stations that caused confusion 
during Monday's evening rush hour, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Ventura County and Santa Clarita Metrolink lines share stops in those 
two cities, and problems were created by the crush of commuters to Santa 
Clarita, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally they were crowding the platform and making it difficult for Ventura 
County commuters to get to their trains," she said. "And we were having people 
get on the wrong trains." 
</P>
<P>
 More advisers were added Tuesday to direct new passengers to the right trains, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's four morning trains into Los Angeles are still running well 
below capacity and riders getting on in Simi Valley and Moorpark get seats, 
Travis said, although it is harder to get seats for the evening return from 
Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters who stayed on the freeways said they again had surprisingly few 
problems Tuesday morning despite the full-scale return of workers to downtown 
Los Angeles and the reopening of most Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was normal. Just like it was before the earthquake," Simi Valley Mayor 
Greg Stratton said of his 20-mile, 40-minute commute to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a terrible two-hour creep home Monday evening in the rain, Thousand 
Oaks resident Ken Bauer said his Tuesday morning commute to downtown Los 
Angeles took less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Thiele, a Thousand Oaks resident and manager of the Bank of America 
transportation program in Los Angeles, said bank employees have reported few 
problems with commutes this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a horror story, and I'm quite surprised by it," said 
Thiele, whose own commutes have been quicker than normal. Workers who have 
switched from cars to trains and buses report an increase of only 10 or 15 
minutes in commuting time, he said.

FUELING AN ECONOMIC HEAD OF STEAM; HOME SALES, INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA, UP 
SHARPLY AS CONFIDENCE CLIMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pace of home sales in California rose to its highest level in nearly four 
years, while a flurry of other economic reports issued Tuesday showed that 
sales activity across the United States has climbed to record levels and 
consumer confidence in the economy is the highest it has been since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Assn. of Realtors said sales statewide were made at a 542,770 
annualized rate in December, 12.1% higher than November and 13.2% faster than a 
year ago. Sales were particularly strong in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The 524,770 figure is the number of homes that would have been sold in 
California if December's sales pace had held constant throughout the year. The 
actual sales figures for all of 1993 are expected to be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, the National Assn. of Realtors said sales nationwide 
rose to a 4.49-million rate in December, the highest level of activity ever 
recorded. About 3.8 million homes were actually sold in 1993, the best year for 
housing since 1979, the industry group said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have for the past few months, analysts attributed the upswing in 
December home sales to low mortgage rates and rising consumer confidence. The 
Conference Board said Tuesday that Americans' optimism about the economy 
climbed to 83.2 this month from 79.8 in December, the third consecutive monthly 
gain and the highest reading in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's report also shows that a large number of consumers are still 
worried about their jobs, while a separate report issued by the Labor 
Department shows that workers are barely keeping up with inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 Confidence in California's economic future was clearly shaken by last week's 
earthquake, raising yet another concern about the state's prospects for 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty safe bet that everybody's confidence in L.A. has dropped since 
the quake," said John Hekman, an economist and vice president at Economic 
Analysis Corp. in Century City. "But I think it could pick up again fairly 
quickly, because a lot of contractors and others are going back to work and 
we'll see a lot of people getting big insurance checks that will be used to 
immediately stimulate the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The median price of a Los Angeles home rose 1.4% from November to $197,730. 
Orange County's median price was $217,200, down 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to start 1994 off with such a bang-up finish for 1993," said Pat 
Neal, the California realtors group president and an Orange County real estate 
broker. "Sales might slow down a bit in the areas that were affected by the 
quake, but they're going to rebound and catch up with other parts of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some analysts say the nation's housing market must be near its peak, 
others said even more gains are in store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mortgage applications for final purchases have been rising . . . pointing to 
continued strength at least through the first half of the year," said Bruce 
Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "People seem more 
optimistic about the future, and that is boosting sales." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board's report that consumer confidence climbed again this 
month reinforces that view. The group's consumer confidence index jumped to 
83.2, up 3.4 points for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the optimistic news from the New York research group was muted by its 
finding that many consumers remained uncertain about employment prospects. More 
than a third said jobs are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of jobs and continuing layoffs by aerospace companies and other 
large businesses helped keep inflationary pressures under control last year, 
the Labor Department said in another report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said its Employment Cost Index rose a modest 3.5% in 1993, matching 
1992's record low. Labor costs are a key ingredient of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although low inflation helps millions of Americans, it was no boon for the 
typical worker last year. Wages and salaries rose just 3.1%, only slightly 
ahead of the overall inflation rate. Wages for workers in private industry will 
rise just 2% a year under the labor contracts signed in the fourth quarter of 
1993, the department said. Existing Home Sales

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; OVERCOMING THE JOLTS; RAMIFICATIONS FOR 
SOUTHLAND BUSINESS MOUNT; TOURISM REBOUND SEEN BY SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evidence continues to mount that Southern California took a hefty economic 
wallop from the Northridge earthquake that will be felt for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The local tourism industry will take an estimated $308-million hit because of 
the quake. That translates into the temporary loss of 9,240 jobs in the next 
few months, the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau projected Tuesday in 
the first detailed report on the subject. A rebound is expected by summer, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking firms, meanwhile, said the freeway closures and traffic tie-ups 
continue to add two or three hours to their trips between Southern California 
and the central and northern parts of the state -- and that those delays are 
forcing them to raise shipping prices, which could be reflected at the grocery 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the quake threatened businesses representing more than a third of 
California's manufacturing base, according to a survey by Dun & Bradstreet 
released Tuesday. Because more than half of all firms in the affected area were 
under financial strain before the quake, "this could mean a long and troubled 
recovery for these businesses, if they can recover at all," said David T. 
Kresge, an economist with the business information consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the damage estimates reported Tuesday, Pacific Bell said the toll to its 
Los Angeles offices may reach $25 million, although little harm was done to its 
telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
 The blow to tourism, one of the area's main sources of employment, is 
particularly frustrating because the sector was on the rebound from the effects 
of recession and the 1992 riots, said Michael Collins, senior vice president of 
the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake's cost to the $20-billion industry could have been worse. It is 
expected to total about half the loss in tourism revenue attributed to the 
riots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau's survey predicts a 4% to 5% annual decline in tourism business in 
Los Angeles County, mostly from declines in the number of group tours and 
convention visitors over the next three months. That is much lighter than the 
10% to 20% decrease -- or $2 billion to $4 billion -- projected last week by 
economists at Chapman University in Orange. The convention bureau study, 
conducted by PKF Consulting, included a sampling of hotels and a survey of how 
tourism fared after other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, PKF had estimated that 1994 tourism revenues would rise 
2.6%, reversing three years of decline. The convention bureau has yet to 
release a revised overall estimate for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For the people who hold the estimated 9,240 jobs that will temporarily 
disappear, "it's going to hurt," Collins said. Tourism accounts for about 
400,000 full- and part-time jobs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is pretending this is good," Collins said, "but by May, this will be 
behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 On the transportation front, some truckers have begun raising prices $250 a 
load on the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco route to cover the added fuel costs 
and drivers' extra hours behind the wheel, said David Titus of the California 
Trucking Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical charge for that 380-mile trip would be between $475 and $570, so 
the $250 price hike equals as much as a 53% increase. However, the truckers' 
alternate routes around the closed Los Angeles freeways are adding as many as 
200 miles to their trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't absorb that many miles and that many hours without increasing the 
cost of doing business," Titus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Oliver, president of Three Rivers Trucking Inc. in Long Beach, which hauls 
citrus fruit between Central and Southern California, said he is charging 
customers an extra $100 per round trip. His usual price for a shipment between 
the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles, for instance, would be $500. 
</P>
<P>
 His customers' reaction? "No problem," Oliver said. "They've made commitments 
to their customers, so we have to move this product." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the higher transportation costs reach consumers will depend largely on 
the goods involved. An extra $250 charge on a truckload of color television 
sets might not nudge the TVs' retail prices. But if the goods are vegetables, 
paper towels or cat food, the extra shipping costs could translate into a 
noticeable increase at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the delays, some transportation firms said their shipment schedules 
were not falling seriously behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a couple of loads going up to Bakersfield yesterday and didn't have 
any problems," said Steve Baldwin, a dispatcher at the Duarte-based Coastal 
Connection trucking firm. "We left early in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dun & Bradstreet survey found that businesses representing more than a 
third of California's manufacturing base are within 40 miles of the epicenter 
of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Of particular concern are high-tech manufacturers in 
areas of Canoga Park, Sylmar, Chatsworth and elsewhere that are especially 
vulnerable to the loss of physical plants and equipment and rely on good roads 
to get supplies and ship products, Kresge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because high-tech is an intensely competitive field, setbacks or delays could 
be costly, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Dun & Bradstreet's survey sets a starting point for further study of the 
quake's effects on business, expected in four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Dun & Bradstreet's other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 177,000 firms within 20 miles of the quake's epicenter employ more 
than 1.6 million people -- 200,000 of them in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 40% of the factories in the area are in high-tech manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 70% of the firms within 40 miles of Northridge have fewer than 10 
workers.

IBM CHALKS UP 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT, BUT '93 LOSS DEEPENS; COMPUTERS: COST CUTTING 
IS CREDITED, BUT SOME ANALYSTS SAY COMPANY HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO PUT ITS 
HOUSE IN ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM on Tuesday reported its first quarterly profit in more than a year, a sign 
that its cost-cutting measures are kicking in, but analysts said the computer 
giant still has a long way to go in shedding its troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. earned $382 million, or 62 cents a 
share, for the fourth quarter, a sharp improvement over the $45-million 
operating loss posted for the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that still left the company with an $8-billion loss for the year, worse 
than its 1992 loss of $6.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the quarter totaled $19.4 billion, down a fraction. For the full 
year, revenue slipped 2.8% to $62.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM has been unable to manage the rapid technological changes in the computer 
business, especially the dramatic shift away from large, expensive computers 
based on proprietary designs and toward cheap, generic and ever more powerful 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been in a crisis mode for several years. A massive 
cost-cutting campaign has eliminated 45,000 jobs over the past year, many 
through the company's first-ever layoffs. IBM's payroll now stands at 256,000, 
down from more than 400,000 in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The improved fourth-quarter performance shows that the cost-cutting program is 
beginning to bear fruit. But the results fell short of Wall Street's 
expectations, and IBM shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $58.25 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock traded as low as $55.375 Tuesday but rallied after Chief Financial 
Officer Jerome York gave analysts an upbeat assessment of prospects for the 
first quarter of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts continue to question the technology strategy being pursued by 
Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the computer industry outsider who took charge 
of the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstner, explicitly rejecting any grand "vision" and all suggestions that he 
break up the company, has focused instead on "re-engineering" the firm to make 
all its processes more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're in terrible trouble, and it's getting worse," said Charles Morris, 
co-author of Computer Wars, a book documenting IBM's decline. "Re-engineering 
is fine if you know what it is you want to do," he said, but IBM continues to 
invest heavily in dead-end products rather than remaking the company around a 
few key, cutting-edge computer designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris noted that a growing portion of IBM's business is in supplying 
components such as computer chips and disk drives, which carry far lower profit 
margins than complete computer systems. He predicted that the company will face 
a serious cash crunch next year as the bills for severance payments come due. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some bright spots. Many analysts say IBM has done a good job of 
turning its personal computer business around. Richard Shaffer, principal of 
Technologic Partners, said IBM's PCs have become price-competitive and that its 
Thinkpad portable machines are top-notch products. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Stahlman, an IBM watcher who heads New Media Associates in New York, 
calls IBM "a completely new company" that has successfully jettisoned its old 
culture and now stands poised to take advantage of strong PC and workstation 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bob Djurdjevic, a former IBM manager who heads Annex Research in Phoenix, 
gives Gerstner a "B-plus" for his overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But others note that the large-computer business continues to decline. Some 
other companies reliant on large machines -- notably Digital Equipment Corp. -- 
are still struggling despite radical turnaround efforts.

JAMES FLANIGAN: FUELING AN ECONOMIC HEAD OF STEAM; CLINTON MUST GENERATE HIS 
OWN LUCK TO HOLD A STEADY UPWARD COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If President Clinton looked relaxed while making his second State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, it was because he has been lucky with the U.S. economy, 
which is making life easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment is now falling and could be down to 5.5% of the U.S. work force 
by this summer, from 6.4% at present. Yet interest rates are low and probably 
won't be raised any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, an improving business climate could continue for the balance of 
Clinton's first term, say economists in Washington. Even Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan is reported to be satisfied with the economy's 
non-inflationary progress and to credit Clinton with making his own luck. 
</P>
<P>
 That's nice to hear, but if we are to plan our own careers and investments, we 
need to understand why Clinton has been lucky and what factors will be 
important for his luck to hold for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 We can start with business leaders who don't understand. In a survey published 
Tuesday, the heads of 280 U.S. companies credited "the natural evolution of the 
business cycle" -- and not Clinton's policies -- for the economy's generally 
good performance. But such surveys only show how narrow and dimwitted company 
bosses can be. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no "natural evolution of the business cycle." In the real world, 
economies are affected by politics, personalities and changes in world history. 
</P>
<P>
 Low interest rates are very important for the U.S. economy at present -- and 
Clinton had a role in keeping them low by fighting and winning a battle for his 
budget bill last spring. That victory demonstrated to financial markets that 
Clinton was not going to be a big-spending Democrat. So the markets allowed 
interest rates to drift lower through all of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Global markets and weak economies overseas also had an important effect on 
U.S. rates. With Western Europe and Japan in recession, there is no shortage of 
capital in the world system. Even the U.S. government's budget deficit, the 
focus of anxiety when Clinton took office, has faded from serious 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit will be below $200 billion this fiscal year, less than 3% of the 
gross domestic product. Germany and Japan, eager to sell into the U.S. market, 
want no fast action to slow down the American economy. The Clinton 
Administration plans no such action -- and doing nothing has a lot of support. 
The proposed balanced-budget amendment will face an uphill fight when it comes 
up in this session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one more factor pushing down interest rates is that U.S. banks, after 
three years of repairing balance sheets, have ample capital and are ready to 
lend again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low rates have had a powerful effect," notes economist Barry Bosworth of the 
Brookings Institution. Car sales have been strong for a year, existing home 
sales in 1993 were at their strongest in 14 years, and mortgage rates have 
declined further in early '94. 
</P>
<P>
 But how long can that last? For some time, say professional money managers who 
do not see the Fed rushing to raise interest rates. For one thing, the economy 
will look weak in the first month of '94 because of ice and cold in the East 
and Midwest and the Northridge earthquake. "Economic statistics will be skewed 
right into April," says Terry Rose, a managing director at Advisers Capital 
Management, a New York firm specializing in fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 She also thinks political pressure from Congress will slow Fed action on 
interest rates, and the inflation outlook will remain debatable, with grain 
prices rising but metal prices falling. 
</P>
<P>
 More important in the long term is the fact that inflation and interest rates 
may be low because of profound changes in world industry. Greenspan often talks 
of a new economy, based not on traditional calculations of economic value but 
on brainpower and information. The materials in a compact disc, for instance, 
are worth pennies. But the value of the information that can be put on that 
disc -- a schematic for a road or sewage system -- can be worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
 When such knowledge is shared easily worldwide, there is inherently greater 
efficiency in use of materials, which means that costs are lowered and 
inflation is not as quick to rise. Calculations about the "evolution of the 
business cycle" are somewhat out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason Greenspan is sanguine about the economy: U.S. industry has 
adapted to the new patterns of industry better than other countries -- notably 
Germany and Japan -- which are only now beginning economic restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, questions remain. Not all Americans have the skills to compete in the 
new information economy. That's why we perceive the social problems that took 
up much of Clinton's speech Tuesday night -- the need to get people off 
welfare, the need to curb crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why Clinton asked rhetorically: "Are our children learning what 
they need to know to compete in this new economy?" 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of apprenticeship programs and of streamlining "today's patchwork" of 
training programs. "The only way to get a real job with a growing income is to 
have real skills and the ability to learn new ones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has said it before. While campaigning in 1992, he spoke of expansive 
programs to educate and train Americans for "high-wage, high-tech jobs." In his 
first year in office, he abandoned such expansive -- and expensive -- talk and 
won low interest rates, which have boosted the economy in his first year and 
perhaps for the whole first term. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, he said again that we need to invest more in education and 
welfare reform for the economy to be good through the '90s. Evidently, he wants 
to be lucky in his second term too.

 USAir Group Inc. Narrows Loss: The airline parent cut its fourth-quarter loss 
roughly in half after taking a $60.2-million charge to write down airport 
facilities and implement wage concessions.Including the charge, the holding 
company for the nation's sixth-largest airline posted a net loss of $116.5 
million, or $2.29 per share, in the last quarter of 1993, on revenue of $1.8 
billion. A year earlier, the company lost $254 million, or $5.66 per share, on 
revenue of $1.6 billion. Charges in that quarter, largely tied to job cuts and 
other forms of restructuring, amounted to $143.9 million.

 Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Profit Up 21%: The company said the improved 
fourth-quarter figures reflect a strong increase in broadcasting results as the 
advertising market improved.The New York-based media concern, which owns the 
ABC Television Network as well as radio and TV stations, cable TV networks and 
newspapers, said its results were also up sharply for the year. The company 
earned $166.7 million, or $10.35 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, 
compared to $137.9 million, or $8.38 a share, a year before. Revenue for the 
quarter rose 7% to $1.76 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago.

 Congress May Balk at C-17 Settlement: Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.) raised doubts 
about whether Congress will support the settlement reached between the Pentagon 
and McDonnell Douglas on the cargo jet, saying, "I think it's to early to 
answer" whether Congress will go along. Murtha added: "I've been a big critic 
of the C-17 program, the way it was handled -- the ineptness of McDonnell 
Douglas.It's almost as if they tried to screw that program up. We had them in 
last year -- they guaranteed me the whole company was behind it. The Air Force 
tells me it's a priority. The Army tells me it's a priority. But we've got to 
look at it. I don't think there's any question you can answer until it comes 
down to the end, this year."

 FTC Attacks Hearing Aid Ads: Dahlberg Inc. was accused of falsely claiming 
that its Miracle-Ear Clarifier filters out unwanted background noise and 
focuses on voices.Acting on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, Justice 
Department lawyers filed suit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, seeking 
civil penalties for allegedly violating a 1976 agreement not to make false or 
misleading advertising claims about the performance of its hearing aids. A 
Dahlberg spokeswoman said the company "never made the claim" that the 
Miracle-Ear Clarifier separates general noise from human speech. Dahlberg, a 
subsidiary of Bausch & Lomb and located in Golden Valley, Minn., is the world's 
third-largest hearing aid manufacturer, according to the FTC.

 No Time Warner Board Seat for Seagram: Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin 
indicated that representatives from the Canadian beverage giant won't be 
invited to join the company's board even though Seagram has emerged as Time 
Warner's largest shareholder, with a stake of more than 11%. Time Warner last 
week enacted a so-called poison pill anti-takeover defense after Seagram 
disclosed it had raised its stake.Levin said the Time Warner board will be 
reduced to "10, 11 or 12" members, from about 15 now. Levin said Seagram has 
assured him that the shares were bought for investment purposes, adding that 
"we certainly take them at their word." Separately, a Time Warner shareholder 
filed a lawsuit over the takeover defense, alleging that it was put into place 
by directors and officers to protect their positions.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW LOSES MORE GROUND; YIELDS RISE DESPITE STRONG AUCTION

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market lost its upward momentum Tuesday as prices fell on profit 
taking in extremely heavy trading.  
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields increased moderately despite healthy investor demand 
for the government's auction of $17 billion in two-year notes. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market opened slightly higher despite a poor prognosis. Equity markets 
overseas were mixed, and long-term bond yields were starting to rise. Stocks 
quickly dipped into negative territory and steadily inched below the 3,900 
level the Dow reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of trading, the Dow Jones average had shed 17.45 points to close at 
3,895.34, on Big Board volume of 326.12 million shares.  
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 
to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Most analysts weren't particularly 
concerned with the decline, and the key barometer settled above its lowest 
levels despite repeated rounds of computer-triggered sell programs that dumped 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently when markets are a poke above these centennial numbers, you do get 
a pullback for a couple of days, and that shouldn't upset you too much," said 
Robert Stovall, president of Stovall-Twenty-First Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In such a short span of time, we've had a real spike up," he said. Indeed, 
the Dow had added nearly 160 points since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors pressured the market, including declines in a handful of 
leading stocks. IBM, a Dow component, plunged after reporting earnings. While 
the computer giant posted its first profit in more than a year, sales were 
disappointing and the stock plummeted more than 2 points. But IBM managed to 
recover, closing at 58 1/4, down 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooper Industries fell a whopping 9 7/8 to 41 5/8 after indicating its 1994 
performance is likely to be significantly lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Still, there were some bright spots. Eugene Peroni, an analyst with Janney 
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, characterized it as "a tug of war within 
the Dow." American Express jumped 1 1/4 to 32 3/4 after indicating it planned 
to spin off its Lehman Bros. subsidiary to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Merck added 1 to 35 3/4 after posting double-digit earnings gains. That 
helped pull up the entire drug sector. 
</P>
<P>
 * WLR Foods surged 9 1/2 to 28 1/2 after it said it received a merger proposal 
from Tyson Foods for $30 a share, in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Larger-name tech stocks were generally lower, including Apple, off 1 1/8 to 
33 7/8; Lotus, down 7/8 to 52 7/8, and Sun Microsystems, down 1/4 to 25 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Tokyo stocks shrugged off Monday's precipitous falls to 
end sharply higher Tuesday, boosted by a late flurry of index-linked buying. 
The 225-share Nikkei average gained 295.12 points, or 1.61%, to end at 
18,648.36.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index finished down 33.81 points, at 2,659.90, while 
London's Financial Times 100-share ended 37.4 points down at 3,444.0. In 
Germany, the DAX-30 share average closed at 2,126.78, up 46.77 points. However, 
prices were sharply lower in high-volume post-bourse trade, as falling futures 
pushed the index back by 32.42 to 2,094.36. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Further signs of economic strength, including the strongest sales of 
previously owned homes since 1979, worked to depress the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 The main 30-year bond yield rose to 6.34% from 6.30%, pushing its price down 
17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face value. The yield moves in the opposite 
direction from the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasuries, meanwhile, fell by 1/32 point to 3/32 point and 
intermediate maturities fell between 1/8 point and 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold the two-year notes at a high yield of 4.11%, a level within 
the range of expectations. Reflecting the decent demand, the bid-to-cover 
ratio, which measures the number of bids offered to those received, was a 
strong 2.85 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home sales figures and an important report on consumer confidence 
dampened enthusiasm ahead of the auction results. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes 
grew at a 6.7% rate in December, a monthly record. For all of 1993, sales of 
existing homes rose to a 14-year high, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, 
said its monthly index of consumer sentiment gained 3.4 points to 83.2 in 
January, following large gains in December and November. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports were viewed as negative by the market for fixed-income 
investments. Robust economic growth can aggravate inflation. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended mostly lower against most major currencies following a mixed 
performance overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in commodities trading on the New York Comex, gold for current 
delivery settled at $381.40 an ounce, up 30 cents from Monday. Silver traded at 
$5.088 an ounce, down from $5.106.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS; MCI TO PUT $450 MILLION INTO TELEPHONE VENTURE IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to cash in on Mexico's booming telecommunications market, MCI 
Communications Corp. said Tuesday that it will invest $450 million in a joint 
venture with Mexico's leading financial company to offer long-distance phone 
services south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Financiero Banamex Accival, or Banacci, which already runs Mexico's 
largest private communications network, will be MCI's partner in the venture 
with a 55% share of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the venture depends on Mexican government approval of the 
group's application to offer long-distance services beginning in 1996, when 
that market is scheduled to be opened up to competition. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI said the venture will help create a "NAFTA network" -- a reference to the 
recently approved North American Free Trade Agreement -- that will make it as 
easy to dial in and out of Mexico as it now is to call across the Canadian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 To Mexican phone users, said Eugene Eidenberg, executive vice president at 
MCI, "the U.S. will look like another Mexican province." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 13% of international calls originating in the United States go to 
Mexico, while more than 90% of international calls placed in Mexico go to the 
United States and Canada. But Mexico's telephone system, with only seven lines 
for every 100 residents, is notorious for its poor service. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by summer, as the partners expect, MCI will make an initial 
investment of $150 million to begin building a "crystal triangle" of 
fiber-optic cables linking the leading business cities of Mexico City, 
Guadalajara and Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the long-distance market opens up to competition, the new venture will 
offer private telecommunications services to large business customers in 
Mexico, expanding on Banacci's existing business. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI's venture is the latest in a string of large U.S. investments in Mexico's 
phone business. Despite its many problems, the industry's huge growth potential 
has made it a favorite among foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, since San Antonio-based Southwestern Bell helped Telephonos de 
Mexico go private in December, 1990, when it bought a 10% stake in the 
telephone monopoly for $953 million, the Mexican company's stock price has 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic announced plans last fall to spend $1.04 billion for a 42% stake 
in Iusacell, Mexico's second-largest cellular phone company. Poor land-line 
services have resulted in heavy usage of cellular phones in Mexico as a 
replacement for basic phone services. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI expects to benefit from the growing volume of telephone traffic between 
the United States and Mexico as cross-border trade flourishes under NAFTA.

GOLDSMITH TO LEAVE REPUBLIC; NATHANSON OUT AT COLUMBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russell Goldsmith is abruptly leaving as head of Republic Pictures, perhaps as 
early as this week, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate Hollywood personnel change, Michael Nathanson, a longtime 
Columbia Pictures executive who became embroiled in controversy at the peak of 
the Heidi Fleiss scandal last year, is leaving the studio. He most likely will 
join film producer New Regency Productions, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's move was prompted by the $8.4-billion merger agreement this month 
between Viacom Inc. and video giant Blockbuster Entertainment, which controls 
Republic. Sources said details of his leaving are still being worked out, and 
that Goldsmith is using the merger as an opportunity to leave voluntarily so he 
can do other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith, 43, declined to comment. Republic is on the verge of being merged 
with Spelling Entertainment Group, which is 70.5% owned by Blockbuster. 
Goldsmith was to have headed the combined entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic is known as the owner of film classics such as "High Noon" and 
certain rights to "It's a Wonderful Life."  
</P>
<P>
 As for Nathanson, neither he, Columbia nor people close to him would confirm 
his future plans, but sources said it is "99% certain" that he will join New 
Regency shortly. The company, headed by producer Arnon Milchan, has produced 
such films as "JFK" and "Under Siege" for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson's leaving had been rumored for some time, especially since he moved 
out of his post last year as head of worldwide production for Columbia and into 
a more vaguely defined executive vice president position. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, 38, was the subject of intense media attention last summer, when he 
issued through advisers a public denial of involvement with Fleiss, the alleged 
Hollywood madam. His denial startled executives at Columbia and parent Sony 
Pictures Entertainment, since Nathanson has never been accused of wrongdoing in 
the matter. He was later criticized for allowing the press to link the studio 
with the scandal.

SCULLEY DENIES REPORTS OF PROBE, DEPARTURE; SPECTRUM PLUMMETS

 John Sculley, the former boss at Apple Computer Inc. who is now chairman of 
tiny Spectrum Information Technologies, on Tuesday denied a report that he is 
leaving the wireless communications company. 
</P>
<P>
 But the television report, by columnist Dan Dorfman, also alleged that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company, and it sparked 
frenzied trading in Spectrum shares, which tumbled $1 to $6.31 on the 
Nasdaq.Spectrum, which claims basic patents on wireless communications 
technologies, has been the subject of a number of lawsuits alleging that it 
overstated the value of its patents to inflate the price of its stock. The 
lawsuits have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Sculley said he remains "committed to Spectrum." A wire 
service report said he also denied there is any SEC probe of the company.

TWA TRIGGERS ROUND OF FARE REDUCTIONS; TRAVEL: CUTS OF UP TO 35% ON DOMESTIC 
ROUTES ARE IMMEDIATELY MATCHED BY OTHER AIRLINES. 
</P>

<P>
 Airlines slashed ticket prices for domestic travel by up to 35% on Tuesday, 
marking the second major fare discounts announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Trans World Airlines kicked off the latest round of fare cuts late Monday by 
announcing it would slash ticket prices for travel by May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Continental Airlines, 
USAir and America West said they would match the TWA discounts on competing 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA said the sale covers travel in the continental United States, Hawaii and 
San Juan, Puerto Rico. But consumers must act quickly because the sale ends 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA said sample round-trip fares under the latest cuts are $408 for New 
York-Los Angeles, compared to a pre-sale price of $628; $366 for St. Louis-San 
Francisco, compared to $563, and $259 for Chicago-Dallas/Ft. Worth, compared to 
$398. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, major airlines matched a weekend 30% fare cut initiated by partners 
Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines for international travel. 
Tickets for the overseas sale cover travel between April 1 and Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest on Sunday unveiled the fares on tickets to 80 destinations in 
Europe, Africa, India and the Middle East. They must be purchased by Feb. 11 -- 
for Europe by Feb. 28 -- for travel between April 1 and Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest and TWA have both been market pacesetters in cutting fares, and most 
other carriers have typically been forced to follow their lead to be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fare discounts of 30% to 40% are not terribly detrimental to airlines' 
revenues, however, because the base fare level has crept up substantially over 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline sources said that while the latest round of discounts is unlikely to 
cut sharply into revenues, they will put more pressure on major carriers to 
slash expenses in 1994 in an effort to compete with low-cost and niche-market 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the low-cost and new entrants are driving pricing in the industry. 
Our challenge is to get our operating costs in line," said Tim Smith, spokesman 
for AMR Corp., the Dallas-based parent of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest and TWA underwent major restructurings in 1993 that set their costs 
far below those of their rivals and allow them to initiate fare discounts 
during traditionally sluggish travel periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this will stimulate spring traffic," TWA spokesman Don Fleming said.

 MTV to Test Home Shopping: MTV Networks plans in April to begin testing home 
shopping programming on its three cable TV networks: MTV, VH-1 and Nick at 
Nite. Included in the three-to-six-month test will be the direct sale of 
recorded music, concert tickets, CD-ROMs, books and "anything basically in the 
entertainment realm," said MTV Networks Chairman Tom Freston.After the test, 
MTV will decide whether to launch a separate MTV-style home shopping channel. 
The move appears partly aimed at blunting a joint venture by cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. and record company BMG that would allow people to shop 
for music industry products. Freston said MTV is negotiating for products from 
record labels in addition to contracting with a "major" fulfillment operator.

 Health Net-QualMed Merger Moves Forward: QualMed shareholders have approved a 
pending merger with HN Management Holdings, a unit of Woodland Hills-based 
Health Net, California's second-largest health maintenance 
organization.Separately, the companies said a Superior Court judge in 
Sacramento on Monday denied a request from the California Department of 
Corporations for a restraining order to block $3.3 million in payments to 
Health Net executives in connection with the merger. The funds will be placed 
in an escrow account pending further court action, the companies said. A 
spokesman for Colorado-based QualMed said the court dispute will not affect 
completion of the merger.

 Chevron Profit Plunges: The refiner reported that fourth-quarter profit fell 
73% from a year earlier, due mainly to special charges and gains.Chevron Corp., 
the nation's largest refiner of crude oil, said fourth-quarter earnings 
declined to $294 million, or 91 cents a share, from $1.088 billion, or $3.30 
per share, in 1992. The decline reflects $221 million in special-item 
reductions in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Most relate to net losses on asset 
sales, write-offs and a onetime cash bonus to employees, the company said. The 
1992 fourth-quarter earnings had been boosted by special-item benefits of $546 
million, mostly gains from the disposition of assets. Excluding the special 
charges, 1993 quarterly earnings declined 5%.

 Exxon Corp. Profit Up 7%: The company credited the gain to higher profits for 
refining and marketing efforts as well as its chemical operation, which also 
benefited from lower oil costs. Exxon said it earned $1.5 billion, or $1.20 per 
share, in the fourth quarter, up from $1.4 billion, or $1.12 a share, the year 
before. Revenue was $27.84 billion, down from the fourth quarter of 1992.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS NYSE BEING KEPT TOO COOL UNDER ITS COLLAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody agrees that too much volatility in the stock market is a bad thing. 
But can too little volatility also be a bad thing -- maybe even a worse thing 
-- in the long run? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of the New York Stock Exchange "collar" formally put in 
place in July, 1990, and now rarely discussed on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 With the continuing public uproar in the late 1980s over wide market swings, 
the NYSE decided to limit so-called program trading -- computerized, high-speed 
trading of baskets of stocks by major investors. The idea was to slow down 
those trades by cutting off program traders' access to key NYSE computers 
whenever the Dow industrial average moved 50 points up or down in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the public saw a less volatile market, the NYSE and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission reasoned, confidence in stocks would be restored. After 
all, even by 1990 memories of the Dow's 508-point, one-day crash on Oct. 19, 
1987, remained fairly fresh in the public psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after more than three years of a collared market, proponents of that 
action have declared victory. The NYSE notes with pride that the collar has 
been triggered fewer and fewer times each year since 1990. What that means, of 
course, is that the Dow is rarely rising or falling 50 points in a day anymore. 
And broader market indexes, such as the Standard & Poor's 500, have for the 
past two years moved in an extraordinarily narrow range as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Volatility, it seems, has been conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But hold the fort. When the 50-point collar was imposed in July, 1990, the Dow 
was at 2,999. Today it's at 3,895. Because the collar's parameters haven't 
changed while the market has risen substantially, the effect is to restrict 
daily market volatility to a narrower range as the bull advances. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2,999 on the Dow, a 50-point change was a 1.7% price move in the underlying 
stocks. At 3,895, a 50-point change is a 1.3% price move. At Dow 5,000, the 
collar will be imposed if the Dow stocks collectively rise 1% -- or 30 cents on 
a $30 stock. This begs a simple question: If the collar isn't widened as the 
market goes up, is this limitation on big investors' activity interfering with 
the market's ability to price stocks accurately? 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE says no. The issue of adjusting the collar point change "came up 
recently in an informal meeting we had with the SEC," said Ed Kwalwasser, the 
NYSE's regulatory chief. The outcome of that meeting, he said, was that 
"there's no reason to change" the collar. Though its percentage impact may be 
less, 50 points on the Dow "is still a substantial move" in the eyes of small 
investors, Kwalwasser argues. In fact, he said, "it would be even if the Dow 
was at 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Michael Metz, veteran market analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and no fan 
of program traders, echoes many Wall Streeters who are quite happy with the 
NYSE collar and its effects. "I personally think there's no reason to widen 
it," he said. "That would just accommodate the players in these derivative 
securities," such as options and futures, which are key to program players' 
trading games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwalwasser added another reason why the NYSE feels no pressure to adjust the 
collar: "Nobody (among major program traders) has complained that they can't do 
what they want to do" in the market because of the collar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's not entirely true. Roy Neff, whose firm Cooper Neff & Associates 
in Radnor, Pa., is one of Wall Street's hot young trading houses, argues that 
the collar has a definite restrictive effect on his ability to enter and exit 
the market at key times -- meaning when activity turns hot and buyers and-or 
sellers are massing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the public is convinced that opportunistic traders like Cooper Neff are 
a detriment, Roy Neff sees it another way: He's the risk taker willing to step 
quickly into market breaches -- when too much stock is for sale, or not enough 
is for sale -- and provide a stabilizing force by buying undervalued stocks or 
selling overvalued ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a market collar, Neff complained, "when the market gets out of line, 
we'll be less able to bring it back in line than we otherwise could, because we 
can't trade." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That argument has long been used by the big-buck traders, of course. But the 
fact is, their liquidity hasn't been needed much since 1990, because the public 
appetite for stocks has been unprecedented. Restrictions on market volatility, 
it seems, have created a sense of security about stocks: Small investors see 
less volatility, so buying more stocks is an easier decision. The steady crush 
of new money has in itself dampened volatility by pushing the market up 
relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential downside, however, is this: When the next bear market arrives, 
and today's mass buyers become mass sellers, the NYSE collar will ensure that 
the market can't quickly adjust to lowered expectations. Instead, said Merton 
Miller, the Nobel-prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago, "it 
will be death by a thousand cuts" -- just as the Japanese stock market, a 
similarly collared market, has been ratcheting lower for four painful years. 
</P>
<P>
 Is a long, slow bear market better than a crash? Certainly, average investors 
will have longer to think about the bear market, and more time to act, with the 
collar. Will that feel better? Who knows. 
</P>
<P>
 To Miller, the real danger of collars is that people may believe they can 
protect the market from the inevitable. Ultimately, a collar is just a placebo, 
he said: "It doesn't do any good. . . . As an economist, I'd get rid of the 
stupid thing." Shrinking Volatility 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was put in place in 1990, the New York Stock Exchange "collar" -- 
which limits high-speed computerized trading when the Dow index moves 50 points 
-- has been triggered fewer and fewer times each year, as market swings have 
died down.

IRS WAIVES DEADLINES FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service, deluged with calls from earthquake victims 
frantic about meeting January tax deadlines, said Tuesday that it will waive 
late-filing penalties for business victims who need extra time to file 
corporate tax returns, and for individual victims who missed estimated tax 
payments due Jan. 18.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the late returns and payments must be mailed before Feb. 28, and 
taxpayers must write "L.A. Earthquake" on the top of their returns or 
letters.Interest charges will still be levied on late payments, but onerous 
"failure to pay," "failure to file" and "failure to deposit" penalties will 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers who need extra time to file W-2 forms will also be granted 
extensions if they fill out an application by Jan. 31, said Nancy McCurley, an 
IRS spokeswoman in Los Angeles. The agency said it will continue to postpone 
enforcement actions and waive penalties for quake victims on a case-by-case 
basis. 
</P>

EARNINGS: H.F. AHMANSON SEES PROFIT AND PORTFOLIO IMPROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H.F. Ahmanson, parent of Irwindale-based Home Savings of America, reported 
fourth-quarter earnings of $28.5 million, up from $15.5 million for the 
comparable quarter in 1992. The largest U.S. thrift company also reported 
continued improvement in its loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, which has $51 billion in assets, said its loss for all of 1993 was 
$160 million, contrasted with a profit of $204 million in 1992. The full-year 
loss resulted mainly from write-offs taken to clean up some $1.3 billion in bad 
loans and foreclosures the thrift sold in bulk last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West Financial, the parent of Oakland-based World Savings, the nation's 
second-largest thrift, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $68 million, off 
from $70 million during the final three months of 1992. Full-year profit 
declined to $274 million from the $284 million reported for the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West, which has $28 billion in assets and 237 branches in seven states, 
said the profit drop was due to the ailing California economy, tax increases 
and a narrower spread, which is the difference between what the thrift pays out 
to depositors and the income it receives in loan payments and from other 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson's fourth-quarter results were negatively affected by an extraordinary 
charge of $21.6 million to retire about $325 million worth of high-interest 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Dec. 31, Ahmanson's non-performing assets totaled $960 million, or 1.89% 
of total assets, down from $2.2 billion, or 4.61% of total assets, at the end 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 31, Golden West's bad assets were $431 million, or 1.50% of total 
assets, compared to $343 million, or 1.33% of total assets, at the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson shares added $0.25 to close at $18.625 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading Tuesday, while Golden West shares slipped $0.125 to close at $43.625.

EARNINGS: GENIE GRANTS DISNEY A 34% INCREASE IN PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co., helped by the record-breaking videocassette sales of 
"Aladdin," hit films such as "Cool Runnings" and strong sales of Disney-related 
merchandise, posted a 34% jump in first-quarter profit to $368.6 million, on 
revenue of $2.73 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for the period ended Dec. 31, which amount to 68 cents a share, 
were stronger than Wall Street had expected.As a result, Salomon Bros. raised 
its estimate of Disney's earnings in all of fiscal 1994 to $2 a share from 
$1.85, and its fiscal 1995 projection to $2.30 from $2.18. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney shares Tuesday closed up 12.5 cents at $47, after trading at a 52-week 
high of $48.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous quarters, Disney's latest results weren't stained by red ink 
flowing from the Euro Disney theme park in France. The park is still losing 
money, while debt-restructuring talks with European lenders continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, which owns 49% of Euro Disney's parent company, set aside $350 million 
in November to cover its financial commitment to the park. As a result, its 
future earnings won't have to reflect Euro Disney's losses unless the company 
pumps more money into the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from Disney's filmed entertainment unit jumped 18% to $1.42 billion, 
thanks to video sales of "Aladdin" in the United States and sales of "The 
Jungle Book" videocassette overseas. The unit's operating profit soared 45% to 
$340.2 million.

 Spain Girds for General Strike: A conflict between the Socialist government 
and labor unions over measures to counter recession and rising unemployment 
will come to a head Thursday, when unions try to bring the country to a halt 
with a 24-hour general strike.At the heart of the dispute is a government bill 
to reform a rigid labor market. The government says the reforms, which make it 
easier for employers to hire and fire and encourage recruitment of apprentices, 
will give more people access to the labor market in a country where 23% of the 
work force is jobless. Unions say the reforms represent a direct attack on 
hard-won workers' rights and will undermine job security.

 GE Says Hungarian Operation Turned Profit: General Electric Co.'s Tungsram 
light bulb factory, trumpeted in flashy television ads as a symbol of 
post-communist Eastern Europe's new spirit, reversed three years of heavy 
losses and showed a slight profit in 1993, Chairman John Welch said.Welch also 
announced an investment of another $36 million in Hungary. GE has invested $550 
million in the operation since 1989, far more than it envisioned at the outset. 
But the demise of Comecon, the communist trading bloc, and the evaporation of 
purchasing power in former communist countries meant major financial losses to 
most Hungarian enterprises.

 Russia Reports Big Trade Surplus; Economists Doubtful: The government said the 
surplus for 1993 was $14.68 billion, up from $5.34 billion in 1992.The figure 
is far below earlier estimates, and Western economists said it could be grossly 
exaggerated. Interfax news agency said imports fell by more than $4 billion 
last year to $31.23 billion, while exports rose $5.3 billion to $45.91 billion. 
But senior Western economists said cross-checking with Russian trade partners 
by the International Monetary Fund showed a trade surplus of about $5 billion 
to $7 billion for 1993.

BRIEFING BOOK / CHARLES P. WALLACE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; VIETNAMESE 
OFFICIALS EAGER FOR U.S. FIRMS TO JOIN SEARCH FOR OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Vietnamese officials are optimistic that oil production will play an 
increasingly important role in their country's economy, despite disappointing 
results from early offshore exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vietnam opened its coastal waters to exploration in the 1980s, 26 major 
European, Japanese and Australian firms lunged at the chance to hunt for oil in 
what many consider to be the last part of the world where reserves are likely 
to exist and exploration has been minimal.  
</P>
<P>
 American firms were excluded because of the U.S. economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two firms, Britain's Enterprise Oil and Petro Canada, have decided 
against continuing to explore because they have not found oil in sufficient 
quantities to make the investment worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally remain very optimistic about the oil and gas potential of 
Vietnam," said Ho Si Thoang, chairman of PetroVietnam, the government oil 
monopoly. "Some blocks have not been successful so far, but many companies are 
asking for an extension." 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Oil was discovered off Vietnam in 1975, just as the war was 
ending, by Mobil Corp. Mobil's investment was lost when the South Vietnamese 
government collapsed to communist forces from Hanoi.  
</P>
<P>
 Mobil's platforms were taken over in 1986 by a joint Soviet-Vietnamese company 
called VietSovPetro -- still the only commercial oil producer in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Production at the White Tiger field has risen steadily to 176,000 barrels a 
day, about 6.3 million tons of petroleum a year. All of the oil is exported -- 
mostly to Japan -- because Vietnam still has no refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year should see commercial production starting in the Big Bear oil field, 
which lies southwest of White Tiger. Big Bear is believed to be Asia's largest 
untapped oil field, with 800 million barrels of oil and another 3 trillion 
cubic feet of natural gas, according to BHP, the Australian oil company leading 
the consortium that is exploring Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 The East-West Institute, a think tank based in Hawaii, estimates that Vietnam 
has about 1.7 billion barrels of oil reserves overall. It predicted that oil 
production could reach 350,000 barrels a day by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Although the American embargo has not been lifted, Mobil has been 
given a license to take part in a consortium looking for oil in the Blue Dragon 
field, another area believed to be rich in natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of its license from the Treasury Department, Mobil can conduct 
seismic surveys and exploratory drilling, but cannot begin commercial 
production until the embargo is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese have been eager to get American oil companies involved for two 
reasons: U.S. firms have special skills, developed for the Gulf of Mexico, to 
extract oil using deep-water platforms. And they wield considerable political 
influence in Washington, where the Clinton Administration is weighing whether 
to end the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, told the Vietnamese here 
recently, "It's a very good bet that you can do business with Americans and 
(that) by the time you find the oil, the embargo will be lifted." 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: An end to the embargo will create special opportunities for U.S. 
companies in the energy sector, not only in oil production. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is already drawing up plans for two oil refineries that will 
cost $300 million each.  
</P>
<P>
 A $350-million liquefied natural gas plant is also planned for Vung Tau, a 
small port north of Ho Chi Minh City that is the center of the country's oil 
and gas activity. Several pipelines are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Big American construction firms, such as Brown & Root and Bechtel, are well 
placed to bid on such projects, because they helped build the original port 
facilities and infrastructure at Vung Tau under contract to the United States 
and South Vietnam. They are believed to have most of the old blueprints -- lost 
long ago in Vietnam -- in their office files. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. construction companies are likely to start bidding on projects being 
financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank because the Clinton 
Administration has already exempted those projects from the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects are expected to include rebuilding the country's north-south 
highway and bringing electricity from the undeveloped north to the power-hungry 
south.

JUDGE RULES JUSTICE DEPT. CAN'T BLOCK WHISTLE-BLOWER AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a ruling that may strengthen the hand of whistle-blowers in the defense 
industry, a federal appeals court has ruled that the Justice Department does 
not have the right to block civil settlements in cases it has elected not to 
prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense industry is fighting an estimated 300 whistle-blower suits, 
brought under the federal False Claims Act, where the Justice Department is not 
involved.Even when the Justice Department elects not to intervene, it has 
asserted a right to veto settlements if the government fails to get an adequate 
share of the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Myron H. Bright, a federal appeals judge in Pasadena, ruled recently 
that the Justice Department has no such veto power, though it does have a right 
to a hearing to object to settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling arose from a case in which Northrop was sued by former company 
engineer Max Killingsworth, who alleged that the firm defrauded the Air Force 
on the MX missile guidance system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department elected not to join the case, but Killingsworth pursued 
it with private attorneys. In 1990, the Justice Department approved a 
preliminary settlement for $500,000, but the deal fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 After Killingsworth obtained a new attorney and expanded his charges, Northrop 
agreed to pay $1 million for the false claims, $1.7 million for wrongful 
termination and $1 million in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the False Claims Act, the government would get a portion of $1 million, 
and the other $2.7 million would go to Killingsworth. That allocation triggered 
the government objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's attorneys sided with Killingsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bright also ruled that a lower court judge had erred in not 
considering Justice Department objections, and he ordered the case back for a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In its appeal, the department had sought to fully reverse the judge's rulings.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; A HOTEL GUEST'S SURVIVAL KIT FOR 
DISASTER 
</P>

 The aftershocks that continue to shake up the Los Angeles area remind us all 
how vulnerable we feel in an emergency, a feeling that is all the more 
pronounced if you happen to be caught in an unfamiliar city on business. 
Although hotel staffs are trained to respond in emergencies, and staff members 
are assigned to help guests from their rooms, there are still some basic safety 
tips to keep in mind when staying in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a rundown of things to do and not do should you be caught in an 
emergency while traveling. These tips were supplied by Capt. Steve Valenzuela, 
spokesman for the L.A. County Fire Department, and Ray Ellis, safety and 
operations consultant to the Hotel and Motel Assn. in Washington. General 
Planning 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever you travel, plan ahead and have an out-of-state contact whom 
concerned family members and friends can call. It's often easier to call out of 
state than within the local area after a major catastrophe. Keep this number in 
your wallet so emergency personnel can use it if you are unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you carry a wallet card or medical identification bracelet with you 
if you have a medical condition that can be life-threatening, such as diabetes, 
a heart condition or a seizure disorder. Keep the information up-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 Always let hotel staff know if you have a disability or condition that might 
affect your ability to see, hear or move in an emergency. If you are 
hearing-impaired, for example, tell the staff so that if they need to alert 
you, they will enter the room, not just pound on the door. Fire 
</P>
<P>
 Don't panic. Panic is contagious and can lead to pandemonium among other 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Know two ways to exit your floor or building. Read the information on the back 
of the hotel room door to get this information. Know how to get out of your 
room by feel since you may not be able to see because of smoke. Count the 
number of doors to the exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Never use the elevator. During a fire or other disruption, the elevator may 
take on a life of its own and its doors could open onto a floor engulfed in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Take your key with you when you evacuate, because many doors will 
automatically lock behind you, and if your exit is blocked you may need to get 
back into your room. 
</P>
<P>
 Always put your key in the same place in the room so you can find it easily. 
If you discover a fire, report it immediately to the hotel security office and 
the fire department, then leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Use your judgment about whether to try putting out the fire with an 
extinguisher. Fire extinguishers are very effective on certain types of small 
blazes that have just started, but not on bigger ones. If you can't put it out, 
leave immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the room, feel the door. If it's hot, keep the door closed, 
seal the space under it with wet towels or sheets and wait to be rescued. If 
you don't feel heat through the door, brace your shoulder against it and open 
slowly to check for smoke. If there is a lot of smoke, close the door and seal 
it. If not, exit the building. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to evacuate and you encounter smoke, stay low. Smoke and hot 
gases rise. Put a wet towel over your head to keep cool, but remember that the 
towel won't filter toxic gases. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are trapped in your room, hang something in the window to let rescuers 
know where you are. If the fire is in the room and you can't get out, seal 
yourself in the bathroom, plug the space under the door, fill the tub with 
water and throw water on the door. There is little that is flammable in a 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 If you escape the building, be aware that there may be falling glass and 
debris as you leave. Never go back into a burning building. If you are missing 
someone, tell rescuers where you think the person might be located. Earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a small emergency preparedness kit with you when you travel. Pack a small 
flashlight, small radio, extra batteries, a pair of gloves, bottle of water and 
a couple of granola bars. Make sure you know where your kit is so you can grab 
it as you take cover. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shaking starts, follow the "duck, cover and hold" instructions. Check 
your room when you arrive to see where the safest places might be. Get under a 
heavy desk or table away from anything that might fall. Brace yourself by 
holding on. If there is no adequate shelter, get under a door frame. Arches are 
even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in a hallway during an earthquake, take cover by sitting on the 
floor with your back against the wall, head between your knees and hands over 
the back of your head. Try to get to a corner or other place that might be 
stronger structurally. Stay away from mirrors and chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ground stops shaking, proceed slowly. There may be other dangers, 
including downed electrical wires, broken glass or gas leaks. Don't 
automatically reach for the light switches or strike a match; a spark could 
ignite a gas leak. Use your flashlight instead.  
</P>
<P>
 Remember that hotel personnel are trained in emergency evacuation procedures. 
Follow orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've evacuated, let the hotel know your whereabouts. Don't just wander 
off or return home without telling them, or rescuers may waste time searching 
for you.

THE COMPANY SHE KEEPS; DRUNK DRIVING: CANDY LIGHTNER SAYS SHE STILL WANTS 
REFORMS. BUT NOW THAT THE MADD FOUNDER WORKS FOR RESTAURANTS, SOME WONDER WHOSE 
SIDE SHE'S REALLY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Candy Lightner went to work at a consulting firm that represents 
restaurants that serve alcohol, she considered the job compatible with her past 
as the crusading founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't been the media perception. In a sudden wave of publicity this 
month, Lightner has found herself portrayed in news stories and on talk shows 
as having joined the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "MADD Founder Switches Sides" was a typical headline, and "lobbyist for the 
liquor industry" the typical job description when the media discovered 
Lightner's new position. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightner, who founded MADD in Fair Oaks, Calif., in 1980 when her 13-year-old 
daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver, says she has not changed sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a government relations consultant on public policy issues, and it's 
something I have wanted to do for a long time," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightner accepted the job in November with Rick Berman, whose Washington, 
D.C.-based Berman and Co.'s clients include the American Beverage Institute, a 
4,000-member trade organization representing restaurants and other 
establishments that serve alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 She will lobby state legislatures to reject laws that lower the legal standard 
for driving under the influence to .08% blood-alcohol level because she agrees 
with the restaurant industry's position that these are not the dangerous 
drivers and it is counterproductive to waste law enforcement resources on them. 
Only a few states, including California, have .08% laws. Most use .10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lowering the level accomplishes nothing. I think we should target the repeat 
offenders -- they are the real danger on our roads," says Lightner, recalling 
that the man who killed her daughter had a long record of DUI arrests and had 
just been bailed out on a hit-and-run drunk-driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says Lightner will lobby state legislatures for laws that distinguish 
among light, moderate and heavy drinkers, and adjust the penalties accordingly. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that as a person's blood-alcohol level goes up, the penalties should 
get stiffer," Berman says. "The restaurant industry has never done this 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 "This escalated penalty plan is a new approach in our country and I'm very 
excited about it," Lightner says. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Beverage Institute maintains that the .08% standard makes 
criminals of social drinkers and weakens law enforcement by stretching it over 
a wider pool of drivers than is necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 With this position, Lightner breaks ranks with MADD and other organizations in 
the anti-drunk driving movement. 
</P>
<P>
 MADD's national president, Rebecca Brown of Tampa, Fla., says she doesn't 
criticize Lightner, who to the public personifies MADD's success. The group has 
grown to 3 million members and is credited with toughening laws against drunk 
driving in every state and with reducing alcohol-related deaths on America's 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Candy made a great difference in America and we can only be grateful," Brown 
says. "The issue here is not Candy Lightner. It's .08 and we are on different 
sides of that issue. We have a great deal of research and evidence that even 
experienced drivers are impaired at that blood-alcohol level." 
</P>
<P>
 California MADD worked on the campaign to lower the state's blood alcohol 
level to .08%. Michelle Payne at the Sacramento office says the group has 
received only a few calls about Lightner and that all comments on policy come 
from the national office. 
</P>
<P>
 MADD is lobbying for .08 because its leaders think this is an achievable goal, 
Brown says. "However, we believe that no one should drive after drinking, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lightner says she is surprised at the negative reaction to her new post, since 
much of her progress with MADD was made in conjunction with the restaurant 
industry and she was praised for the results.  
</P>
<P>
 "We got them, in some cases, to eliminate happy hours, and two-for-one drinks, 
and to initiate mandatory server training for bartenders and things like 
designated drivers and free taxi service," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lightner left MADD in 1985, she wrote a book about grieving, "Giving 
Sorrow Words," published in 1990. Last year, she turned her attention to 
Americans Against Crime, a citizens' group aimed at stemming violent crime. "We 
couldn't raise the money to keep it going," she says. "It was partly the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lightner, who has two grown children, lives in Alexandria, Va. She says she 
joined Berman's firm because she wants to continue to make a difference.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been doing this for 2 1/2 months and I'm not discouraged. I believe 
strongly in what I'm doing and I have no problem about the world knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of her relationship with MADD, she says, the disagreement is with the 
blood-alcohol level and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I oppose .08 and I advocate escalated penalties. I haven't switched to the 
'other side.' The 'other side' is being a defense attorney for drunk drivers."

PEOPLE; MAKE A DECISION TO LEARN TO DECIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to making decisions, practice makes perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decision making is an acquired skill," says Ian H. Gotlib, a Chicago 
psychologist, in a recent issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are self-sufficient tend to be better decision makers because 
they've had to be, but anyone can learn the basics." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prioritize. Make a list of all the decisions you make during the day, no 
matter how minor. At night, review them for clues to what you value most. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take time to mull your options. There is nothing wrong with consulting 
friends, family, bosses and therapists, as long as you don't cross the line 
from investigative to obsessive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Test your feelings. If you have two alternatives, "just toss a coin and see 
how you feel with the choice that comes up," Gotlib says. If you feel bad, 
realize that's a clue to your real feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just do it. Accept that the process is tough, but don't let fear paralyze 
you.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you have made your decision, you still must weather hazardous 
afterthoughts. Even the best decision makers have regrets, but they don't allow 
them to cause self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, indecision can prevent you from getting on with life.

TUNE UP AND LUBE PAYS FINE IN CONSUMER FRAUD CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tune Up and Lube Centers, which was discovered charging its customers for 
unnecessary repairs and returning cars in an unsafe condition, has paid $65,000 
to help settle a lawsuit brought by the Orange County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on consumer complaints, the state Bureau of Automotive Repair 
investigated Tune Up and Lube locations in Tustin, Cypress, Westminster and 
Anaheim.Undercover drivers were charged for repairs that were not done or were 
sold unneeded repairs, the bureau reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the undercover driver was sold new front brake pads, calipers and 
grease seals that the car did not need, the district attorney's office said 
Tuesday. The car was then released in a dangerous condition, the office said, 
with an improperly installed master cylinder and with inoperable brake lights. 
Those items had been in working order when the car was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's lawyer did not return a phone call on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said that David Kalb and Evan Bank, owners of 
Tune Up and Lube, did not admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay an undisclosed 
fine and to pay the $65,000 cost of the investigation and adhere to terms of 
the settlement. The terms include on-site inspection, notice to employees of 
the settlement and regular reports to the Bureau of Automotive Repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Tune Up and Lube Centers, which is based in Laguna Hills, has six service and 
repair shops in Orange and Los Angeles counties.

PACIFICARE SIGNS DEAL WITH WORKERS' COMP INSURER; HEALTH: AGREEMENT WITH 
LIBERTY MUTUAL, BELIEVED THE FIRST OF ITS TYPE, COULD GIVE THE HMO A BIG BOOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. and a major insurance company in Boston signed 
a deal that they said Tuesday would save employers money by allowing them to 
send injured workers to a health maintenance organization for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Mutual Insurance Group said it believes this is the first time a 
workers' compensation insurer has teamed with an HMO in this type of 
arrangement. Liberty Mutual, with more than $20 billion in assets, sells 
workers' comp and other types of insurance nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare, with headquarters in Cypress, has more than 1 million members, 
mostly in the West, and this deal could give the HMO operator a big boost, said 
an analyst who follows the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers' comp market is a huge one, and it's virtually untapped by HMOs," 
said Thomas E. Hodapp of San Francisco investment bankers Robertson, Stephens & 
Co. "This could be pretty meaningful for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations offer lower health costs but restrict 
patients' choice of a doctor to the HMO's own physicians or those with whom it 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 So injured workers whose companies elect to have an HMO would be restricted to 
the private doctors participating in this program. 
</P>
<P>
 But since it should be cheaper, the new plan will be popular with employers, 
Liberty Mutual hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer, which plans to sign similar deals soon with managed health 
providers on the East Coast, said it expects its competitors to follow with 
their own HMO deals as it becomes clear that the arrangement is profitable for 
HMOs and cuts workers' comp costs for employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' comp is insurance paid for by employers and required by the states, 
covering employees who are hurt on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement between Liberty Mutual and PacifiCare should also help reduce 
fraud in workers' comp claims, because the deal gives the HMO an incentive to 
get workers back on the job as soon as possible. California's workers' comp 
system, critics says, is rife with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement represents a new form of partnership between the 
managed-health-care community and the insurance industry," said Thomas Ramey, a 
senior vice president at Liberty Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 For PacifiCare, the deal looks like the best way into the workers' comp 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some HMOs have bought insurance companies, and some insurers have bought 
HMOs," said Vicki Merrill, president of Compremier, PacifiCare's workers' comp 
unit. "But we decided we could best use each company's strengths through this 
kind of alliance."

PRESLEY COS. STOCK PLUNGES AFTER REPORT OF LOSSES; DEBT: LENDERS WILL GET 
GREATER CONTROL OVER THE COMPANY IN RESTRUCTURING PROMPTED BY $51-MILLION 
DOWNTURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Presley Cos., a Newport Beach home builder hard hit by the slump in 
California real estate, lost a fifth of their value Tuesday after the company 
reported a $51-million annual loss and proposed a massive debt restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, Presley announced plans for a debt-for-equity swap to restructure 
a $340-million credit line. The swap would give its lenders, mostly investors 
rather than banks, greater control over the company. If approved by Presley 
shareholders, the swap would convert $95 million of debt into 43.16 million 
shares of common stock, equal to 70% of the outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are trying is what other large Orange County home builders are 
doing -- cleaning up the balance sheets," said Don Dahl, partner in the real 
estate service group at Arthur Andersen in Irvine. "This buys the company time 
to get through the current slowdown. With a cleaner balance sheet, it may be 
able to finance new construction and not be overburdened by this debt. The name 
of the game is capital." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which builds planned housing communities, said homeowners at its 
current projects will not affected by the proposed restructuring. "Any Presley 
homeowner should consider this just business as usual," said company spokesman 
Steven Stern. "In fact, it could be a positive for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Presley develops single-family homes and townhomes at the Highlands in Anaheim 
Hills; Viewpointe North, a 276-unit project in Anaheim Hills, and Horesethief 
Canyon Ranch, an 820-acre site in Riverside County.  
</P>
<P>
 Presley is the victim of its own aggressive land acquisition policy in the 
late 1980s, when most of the properties were purchased with loans. The company 
bought vacant real estate at the top of the market and since then has seen the 
value plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to raise cash, the company went public in October, 1991, at $10 
per share, raising $70 million. Stock reached a high of $17.25 a share before 
dropping to its current level. Presley shares fell 87.5 cents a share in heavy 
trading Monday, closing at $3.125 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 If the debt swap is completed, Foothill Capital Corp., a lender and money 
manager in Los Angeles, would become the company's major shareholder, as it 
controls the two limited partnerships that are now the company's major 
creditors. Foothill holds at least 40% of the outstanding debt through the 
partnerships, which are mostly composed of major corporate pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 After the restructuring, Presley's current leading shareholder, Newport Beach 
builder William Lyon, would see his estimated 32% company stake reduced to 
about 8% to 10%, according to John Nickoll, president of the Foothill Group, 
parent company of Foothill Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, Lyon pledged his Presley shares as security for loans for his 
other businesses. Lyon, owner and chairman of the financially troubled William 
Lyon Co., is involved in numerous other building and development ventures and 
owns an aircraft services firm called Air/Lyon Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Tuesday whether the proposed restructuring of Presley would 
affect Lyon's other financial arrangements. Officials at the William Lyon Co. 
on Tuesday referred calls to Presley, and Presley officials referred calls to 
the Lyon Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this restructuring would be in the best interests of Presley," 
Nickoll said. "We also think it's very positive for current shareholders in the 
long run because the company is now losing money." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the debt-for-equity swap, the company also announced a 
$20-million write-down in certain real estate assets for the fourth quarter. 
Nickoll said another $70 million in real estate write-downs could be completed 
this year as part of the debt-for-equity swap.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Presley said it had hired the investment banking firm of 
Bear, Stearns & Co. to act as a financial adviser for the proposed 
restructuring. At the same time, the company announced that Foothill and Pearl 
Street L.P. in New York had bought Bank of America's share in the $340-million 
credit line.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts such as Barbara Allen, with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, hailed that 
purchase because finance companies, unlike banks, are not under pressure from 
federal regulators to resolve large loans to troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, they had to give away a lot of the company to get out from 
under the banks and create a lot of dilution to current shareholders, which is 
always a bad thing," Jim Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco, said Tuesday. "It's too bad they had to give away that much of the 
company. But now they have a lot of opportunities -- they can try to diversify 
and maybe buy some cheap land that's out there."  
</P>
<P>
 In the proposed restructuring, the remaining $245 million in Presley's line of 
credit would become a three-year, $95-million revolving credit line and a 
$150-million term loan, each with two one-year renewal options. Presley said 
its plans also call for it to sell a $100-million junk bond issue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin Arjomand, vice president of distressed real estate with Dabney/Resnick 
Inc., a Beverly Hills brokerage firm, predicted the proposed restructuring and 
junk bond offering could provide a boost for Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restructuring gives them a chance to get to ground zero and then move 
forward," said Arjomand. "The high-yield offering could he highly attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jim Schmitt, an analyst with Westcountry Financial, a securities 
research company in Ventura County, suggested Presley shares were not a good 
investment, even with the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is just too high of a risk. It's a pimple of equity with a 
mountain of debt," Schmitt said. "I think this earthquake is going to put 
California's recovery on hold and that will hurt home builders." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the company announced preliminary financial figures that show its 
loss from operations will be about $29 million for the fourth quarter, 
contrasted with a $921,000 profit a year ago. Its annual loss is pegged at $51 
million, equal to $2.76 per share, compared to a loss of $10.48 million, or 57 
cents a share, just a year ago.

 The company, Irvine's defunct FundAmerica Inc., must pay a $200,000 fine but 
avoids a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's attorney general contended that FundAmerica was a pyramid scheme -- 
a company that spent more time signing up new members for a fee than actually 
selling products. The Florida courts, however, would not let prosecutors 
introduce a key part of their case -- what prosecutors said was evidence that 
company founder Robert T. Edwards had run pyramid scams on three continents. 
(He was never convicted.) 
</P>
<P>
 So prosecutors agreed to let FundAmerica plead no contest last week to a 
charge of misrepresenting investors' odds of success, a less harsh charge than 
stock fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 criminal charges helped push FundAmerica into bankruptcy. The company 
was shut down and its assets sold off to repay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, there is a new incarnation of FundAmerica, Irvine's FundAmerica 
2000 Inc., which says that the new company has made changes even though though 
the Florida case proves that its predecessor didn't do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "After more than three years of legal fees, a trial was just going to add 
more," said Robert C. Gilman, the new company's executive vice president. "By 
pleading guilty to an innocuous Florida law, the case goes away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never changed the company name because we feel we never did anything wrong 
in the first place. And we feel we've been completely exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal with prosecutors, in fact, clears the way for Edwards to take over 
the successor company, FundAmerica 2000 Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold the old company's name and marketing plan to one of his lawyers, but 
the deal allowed him to buy a majority stake in the new company if he beat the 
Florida charges. Edwards is already a consultant to the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea deal even allows FundAmerica and Edwards to operate in Florida again 
in a year. Under the plea bargain, the charges against Edwards will be dropped 
in a year if he doesn't violate any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Edwards has stayed out of trouble in Florida, said David J. Audlin 
Jr., one of the state attorney general's chief assistant statewide prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 FundAmerica offered members rebates on long-distance phone calls, airline 
tickets and other products and services. But prosecutors said its real mission 
was a classic pyramid scam: Early investors make big commissions selling 
memberships, but later investors are left holding the bag when the company 
inevitably runs out of buyers for its memberships and the scheme collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 FundAmerica says the new company focuses more on selling products and less on 
commissions from selling memberships. 
</P>
<P>
 It has moved into 18 states and has 150,000 members, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' lawyer, Neal R. Sonnet of Miami, said in a statement, "While we were 
always confident that we would prevail at trial, we believe the settlement . . 
. is fair to both sides."

 George Hyman Construction Co. in Irvine has won a $70-million contract to 
expand the Las Vegas Flamingo Hilton, a famous casino hotel built by gangster 
Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel in 1946.

 After years of slow sales, home sales have gradually picked up steam since 
last summer. The trend toward lower prices continued in December, as the 
average price of all homes sold dropped about $5,000, or 2%, from December 
1992. The highest average price in Orange County in December: nearly $650,000, 
in Corona del Mar. 06,25,07,07,12,07,12 *2*DECEMBER 1992 *2*DECEMBER 1993 ZIP

 Beachfront Property: The Holiday Inn Express, a 30-room Capistrano Beach hotel 
built in 1985, will be auctioned off Friday as part of National Hotel Auction 
in Beverly Hills, where $100 million worth of hotel properties are expected to 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel, the only Orange County property in the sale, is on Pacific Coast 
Highway near Doheny State Park.Formerly called the Edgewater Inn, the hotel, 
which includes a sauna and spa, is the world's smallest Holiday Inn. Selling 
price is expected to be about $2 million, said Bob Perlman, a hotel broker with 
Grubb & Ellis in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the hotel suffered no earthquake damage from the Jan. 17 quake that 
rocked Los Angeles, Perlman said, the jolt may have scared off potential buyers 
in other areas of the nation. The auction is being held by Grubb & Ellis and 
Ross-Dove Auction Co. in San Francisco.

 Building a Network: Anne Armstrong and her husband, Robert, have started a new 
service in Orange County called Contractors Referral Network.The idea is to 
protect consumers against scam contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is free to residential and commercial consumers, while contractors 
pay a $300 fee to belong. The 6-month-old company, based in Laguna Hills, does 
on-site inspections at 12 work sites completed by a firm and checks the 
contractor's license with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing some estimates for people with earthquake damage, but we 
specialize in Orange County. But some of our contractors are willing to go to 
Los Angeles," Armstrong said.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: ALLERGAN PROFIT, SALES FOR 1993 SHOW INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allergan Inc., a maker of eye- and skin-care products, Tuesday reported 1993 
earnings from continuing operations of $104.5 million, or $1.58 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That compared to a profit of $95.8 million, or $1.42 a share, for the previous 
year.Annual sales were $858.9 million, up from 1992's $830.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company's earnings from continuing operations were 
$30.5 million, or 47 cents a share, compared to $28.1 million, or 42 cents a 
share, for the same period a year earlier. Three-month sales were $231.3 
million, up from $223.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan, based in Irvine, also said it will repurchase as many as 1 million 
shares of the company's common stock for its treasury. And the company declared 
a fourth-quarter dividend of 10 cents a share, payable March 10 to holders of 
record on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Shepherd, Allergan's president and chief executive, said that 1993 
"showed positive results in all areas" and that "looking forward, our emphasis 
will be on three core areas": eye care, contact-lens care and skin care. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan sold its contact lens-making business during the year as part of its 
program to concentrate on just a few businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Including results from making contact lenses, profit for the year was $108.9 
million, or $1.65 a share, compared to 1992 earnings of $103.6 million, or 
$1.53 a share. Fourth-quarter profit was $30.5 million, or 47 cents a share, 
compared to $33 million, or 49 cents a share, for the same period a year 
earlier.

REGULATORS LIFT A SET OF RESTRICTIONS ON WESTCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westcorp Inc., the holding company for Western Financial Savings Bank, said 
Tuesday that federal regulators have lifted a set of management and investment 
restrictions imposed more than 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, affecting Westcorp's thrift subsidiary and the thrift's mortgage 
banking, automobile finance and home improvement loan centers, was imposed May 
14, 1992, when regulators ruled that the company needed to improve the manner 
in which it documented its accounting reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the so-called supervisory agreement with the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, Western Financial agreed to maintain its capital at a level well 
above the minimums typically required of thrifts, to set a goal for reducing 
its problem loans and to improve internal record-keeping systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift raised $157 million through stock and other debt issues last year 
and added $150 million of that to its capital, nearly doubling the amount 
required by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcorp President Stephen W. Prough said in June that the company had rid 
itself of most bad loans, improved its record-keeping and was in compliance 
with the regulatory order.

EMULEX PLANS SPECIAL SPINOFF MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emulex Corp., a maker of computer components and networking software, said 
Tuesday it will hold a special stockholders meeting as part of the process of 
spinning off its QLogic subsidiary as a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will take place at 10 a.m. Feb. 24 at the company's headquarters 
in Costa Mesa, 3535 Harbor Blvd.Stockholders will be asked to vote on a 
transaction known as a one-for-two reverse stock split and a tax-free 
distribution of QLogic Corp. shares. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, each shareholder of 100 shares outstanding of Emulex stock would 
end up with 50 shares of Emulex stock and 50 shares of QLogic stock if the deal 
is approved. QLogic would then be spun off as a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
 While Emulex provides products that connect computer networks together, QLogic 
focuses on making products such as computer chips based on the small computer 
system interface, or SCSI standard, which allows computers to be hooked with 
ease to peripherals such as printers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockholders of record as of Jan. 14 will be allowed to vote at the special 
meeting.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: UNION FEDERAL BANK PARENT BLAMES 2ND-QUARTER LOSS ON BAD 
LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent company of Union Federal Bank on Tuesday reported a loss of $7.2 
million for its second fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That compared to a loss of $5.8 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended Dec. 31, UnionFed Financial Corp. reported losing 
$11.3 million, compared to a loss of $11.7 million a year earlier -- which 
included an income tax benefit of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank blamed much of the losses on bad real estate loans. It said it set 
aside $4.8 million during the latest quarter to cover bad loans, especially 
loans on apartments. The bank said it lost $3 million on a single transaction: 
the sale of its largest foreclosed property. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the half, the bank said, bad loans totaled $48 million, down 
from $84 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's chairman, David S. Engelman, said the bank expects to clean up 
more bad loans this year. Now, however, the Northridge earthquake may bring 
more losses or hurt the region's economic recovery, Engelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the half, the bank had assets of $942 million, down from $1.2 billion in 
June, at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, based in Brea, has 14 branches in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a recapitalization in September, the bank has enough capital to comply 
with federal regulations.

LAW FIRM PARTNER WIECHERT LEAVING TO START OWN PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David W. Wiechert, who has represented such white-collar criminal defendants 
as a former Lincoln Savings & Loan president and a former Carl Karcher 
Enterprises executive, will leave his Irvine law firm next week to open his own 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert, a former federal prosecutor who has been a partner at the Irvine law 
firm of Layman, Jones & Dye since 1988, will continue to specialize in 
white-collar criminal defense work and also will handle trial work in civil 
business cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He currently is defending Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen W. Polak, one 
of six Los Angeles County narcotics officers accused of corruption in a case 
involving accusations of drug money skimming, beating drug dealers and planting 
cocaine on suspects. A jury acquitted the defendants of several charges but 
deadlocked on others. A retrial is scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert, 38, a University of Michigan Law School graduate, defended Raymond 
C. Fidel, a former president of the Irvine thrift, and Alvin DeShano, a former 
accounting director for the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped Fidel win a lenient probation term last month in federal court. 
Fidel pleaded guilty to two securities fraud charges and testified against the 
S&L's operator, Charles H. Keating Jr., at two trials in which Keating was 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert won an acquittal for DeShano in a 1989 federal trial. DeShano had 
been accused of using inside information to trade Karcher Enterprises stock and 
avoid a $7,107 loss. He and others testified that he had planned to sell shares 
of the Anaheim company's stock before the price fell drastically.

 Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.: The restaurateur has been sued by a Ventura 
County couple who said the Anaheim company misled them about the viability of 
its restaurants three years ago when they agreed to purchase eight franchise 
locations in Central California for $4.4 million. The lawsuit, filed Monday in 
Orange County Superior Court, accuses Karcher Enterprises of fraud, violating 
state franchise investment regulations and of breaching its fiduciary duty to a 
franchisee. Plaintiffs Sabrina and Alexander Shin, who said the eight 
restaurants have yet to operate at a profit, have asked for restitution and an 
unspecified amount of damages.
