 Diane Pfeifer dedicates "Stand by Your Pan Country Cookbook" (Strawberry 
Patch, Atlanta: 1994) to her husband and daughter "for enduring my endless 
puns," and we soon know why; the former Nashville songwriter and backup singer 
is a positively giddy punstress, who has given every recipe in the book a name 
based on a C&W hit: e.g., "I Fall to Peaches," "Have You Navy Bean Mellow?," 
"All My Eggs-es Live in Texas." A number of names came to her before their 
recipes, and she even lists 70-odd she couldn't think of a way to use 
("Rind-Scone Cowboy" would seem to pose a challenge). However, the recipes -- 
all, by the way, vegetarian -- aren't necessarily as corny as they sound; "Oh 
Lonesome Brie" is a fettuccine salad with Brie, sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata 
olives, basil and garlic. In bookstores, or call (800) 875-7242. Straight or

COOKBOOK TROUBLE; RIGHTING RECIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first Rick Rodgers thought it was a joke. How could anyone possibly test 
200 recipes in two weeks? But the editor was desperate. A cookbook was ready to 
go to press and some of the recipes didn't look right to her. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rodgers put his life on hold and agreed to take on the task of testing 
every last one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked in shifts," he says. "I had a full-time dishwasher, a full-time 
grocery shopper and two full-time typists." As it turns out, the savvy editor 
had good reason to panic; there were real problems with the recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who has written six of his own cookbooks and has another two due out 
this fall, anonymously tests, retests and often writes recipes for much 
better-known cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can work more by being anonymous instead of bragging who my clients have 
been," says Rodgers. "It's like being a celebrity hairdresser. You just don't 
talk about whose roots you've retouched." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won't name names, you get an idea who some of them are by glancing 
at the acknowledgments page of recent cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big thank you and sigh of relief to Rick Rodgers, who took the final 
recipes and whipped them into perfect shape," writes Daniel Leader in "Bread 
Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Three cheers for Rick Rodgers, cook and food tester extraordinaire. . . . 
I'll never be able to thank him enough," Eric V. Copage notes in his book 
"Kwanzaa." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers is also profusely thanked in Rose Levy Beranbaum's "Christmas Cookies" 
and "Melting Pot" books, and in both of the Mr. Bread Man books. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is as generous with their praise. Some cooking stars prefer 
to ignore the fact that Rodgers has had a hand in their books. "Books I've 
totally rewritten have won awards," he says, "but my name wasn't even mentioned 
during the 'I want to thank the little people' speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's happy for the chance to work with some of the best cooks in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, however, when the former "Silver Palate" cookbook team Sheila 
Lukins and Julee Rosso asked Rodgers to help write the recipes for their "The 
New Basics" cookbook, Rodgers turned them down. They were only paying about $50 
per recipe, including ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bupkis," he says. "I mean I wanted to get into the food business, but I 
didn't want to get in on my hands and knees." 
</P>
<P>
 About a year later, Rose Levy Beranbaum had a close deadline to meet for her 
"Christmas Cookies" book and asked Rodgers, a former caterer, to help her test 
the recipes and make the methods more concise. The two had worked together at 
Chocolatier Magazine. Maria Guarnaschelli, Beranbaum's editor at the time, was 
happy to find someone who would take the back seat and began asking Rodgers to 
help some of her other authors. Suddenly, Rodgers had a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 A good cook is not always a good recipe writer and often needs help making his 
or her thoughts clear. "I'm a cookbook doctor," says Rodgers. "I'm just another 
step in the editing process. Unfortunately, due to the financial constrictions 
on most cookbooks, it's a step that many editors choose to skip." 
</P>
<P>
 Precise instructions, Rodgers says, mean the differences between success and 
failure in a recipe. "I still get books from experienced cookbook writers that 
say 'cook until done' or 'bake for 30 minutes.' Yeah, what? Bake for 30 minutes 
until the top is golden brown? Or bake until the edges are brown?"  
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers also makes the assumption that many cookbook readers are not 
experienced cooks. Instead of "saute," he writes "cook over high heat" or 
"fry." He never uses "puree," "julienne" or "deglaze," either. 
</P>
<P>
 "(A lot of) Americans don't know what these words mean," he says. "But if I 
say 'pour liquid into the pan and scrape up the drippings with a spoon,' they 
know what that means." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers uses the same sort of equipment as most home cooks -- he cooks on a 
Magic Chef stove and uses Revere Ware. "A lot of professional cooks have these 
big expensive stoves and use their $500 pot," he says. "Three minutes over high 
heat on my Magic Chef is a lot different than three minutes on a professional 
range with professional-gauge equipment."  
</P>
<P>
 Authors also often call for ingredients that are almost impossible to find, 
Rodgers complains. Certain types of wild game or mushrooms or exotic fruit are 
not necessarily available in Lawndale, much less Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often joke that I'm Mr. Smith and I live in the middle of Iowa, and that's 
who I cook for," says Rodgers. "So if Mr. Smith wants to make wild boar poivre 
, I'll provide him with addresses to order green peppercorns and the wild boar, 
and I'll also tell him it will be just as good with pork. That way he won't 
feel left out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the care he takes, Rodgers knows very few cookbooks are 
mistake-free, including his own "The Turkey Cookbook." He left the turkey out 
of his recipe for turkey lasagna.  
</P>
<P>
 But, Rodgers says, "There are cookbooks where recipe after recipe after recipe 
doesn't work -- those are the big boo-boos that I'm trying to avoid."

COOKBOOK TROUBLE; CAN THIS RECIPE BE SAVED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the course of researching this story, a lot people were only too happy 
to tell us about recipes that don't work. Some gleefully bad-mouthed entire 
cookbooks. We took it all in and then eagerly went off to check things out. 
During the last six weeks, The Times Test Kitchen tested and retested some 50 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we had some real losers. The microwaved date and olive wrap-arounds from 
Sheila Lukins' and Julie Rosso's "New Basics Cookbook" came out looking like 
something dug up at the La Brea tar pits. And the two lemon pies from Martha 
Stewart's "Pies & Tarts" book were both duds. Martha's mile-high pie ran all 
over the plate, while the Marsha Harris version she offers as an alternative 
would have made excellent wallpaper paste. Besides neglecting to tell us to 
cook the lemon in a non-reactive saucepan, the cornstarch added to boiling 
water and lemon never completely dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the flavorless pinto bean soup from John Sedlar's "Modern 
Southwest Cuisine." The recipe, which calls for one cup of pinto beans to three 
cups of half and half, comes out as weak-tasting as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But surprisingly, many of the reportedly faulty recipes not only worked but 
tasted wonderful. One award-winning cookbook author griped that he never could 
get Rose Levy Beranbaum's genoise to work. We did. Another complained of far 
too much chile oil in the spicy soba noodles in Mary Sue Milliken and Susan 
Feniger's "City Cuisine" book. The noodles were delicious. Someone grumbled 
that there was way too much pepper in Paul Prudhomme's recipes. Well, that's 
his style of cooking. And Marion Cunningham's gingerbread did not run all over 
the oven the way one authority claimed it would. 
</P>
<P>
 So many things affect how well a recipe works -- equipment, weather, 
ingredients, personal taste. So what's a cookbook author to do? Vigilance and 
thorough working knowledge of one's recipes are probably the best insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 When well-known radio homemaker Evelyn Birkby was first going on the air in 
Iowa in 1950, her boss gave her good advice: "Think about the recipes. . . . Be 
conscious of what they should include. Test them so you are familiar with the 
way they go together and with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never relax -- recipes will clobber you if you do." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Several people, including an important cookbook editor, complained that the 
seven-hour leg of lamb from Patricia Wells' "Bistro Cooking" (Workman 
Publishing) didn't work. "Cooking a leg of lamb at 425 degrees for seven hours 
is insane, not to mention it will blow up your oven," griped one of the 
critics. We thought the method sounded ridiculous too -- it seemed that if you 
were going to cook a lamb for seven hours, at least you should do it at a lower 
temperature. We knew we had a sure-fire loser.  
</P>
<P>
 We were wrong. The recipe turned out to be one of the best we've tested so far 
this year. And we never had to turn the oven temperature down once. The lamb 
was tender and full of flavor, and the tasters in The Times Test Kitchen 
couldn't get enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the method described in Wells' book is somewhat confusing. After 
cooking the lamb for one hour, she tells us to add the wine and cook the lamb 
four to five more hours. After that, one hour before serving, she goes on to 
say, bury the potatoes and tomatoes in the liquid, cover and roast the lamb for 
another hour or so. But is that after the fourth or the fifth hour of 
additional cooking? Yes, she tells us the time will vary according to the size 
and age of the lamb, but it would help if we knew what the cooked lamb is 
supposed to look like at that point, or whether it would ruin the vegetables to 
cook them the full two hours.  
</P>
<P>
 We added the vegetables during the sixth hour of the total process, choosing 
the longest cooking time, so our recipe did end up being a true seven-hour leg 
of lamb.  
</P>
<P>
 AMBASSADE D' AUVERGNE'S SEVEN-HOUR LEG OF LAMB 6 medium onions, quartered 6 
carrots, peeled and quartered 1 head garlic, separated into cloves, each peeled 
and halved 6 bay leaves 1 bunch fresh thyme or 3 to 4 teaspoons dried 1 lamb 
leg, bone-in, 6 to 7 pounds Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 
(750-milliliter) bottles dry white wine, such as Aligote 5 pounds large boiling 
potatoes, peeled and quartered 5 tomatoes, peeled, cored, seeded and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Layer onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves and thyme on bottom of nonreactive 
roaster (with cover) large enough to hold lamb. Place lamb on top of onion and 
carrot mixture and roast, uncovered, at 425 degrees 30 minutes. Remove roaster 
from oven and generously season lamb with salt and pepper to taste. Return to 
oven and roast 30 minutes more. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove roaster from oven, leaving oven on. Place roaster on top of stove, 
slowly pour wine over lamb, cover, and bring liquid to boil. Return roaster, 
covered, to oven and roast 4 to 5 additional hours until lamb is fork tender, 
but not yet falling off the bone. (Timing will very according to size and age 
of lamb and type of roasting pan used.) Check on lamb from time to time, 
reducing oven heat if lamb begins to burn or liquid begins to evaporate too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 When lamb is fork tender, bury potatoes and tomatoes in liquid. Cover and 
roast until potatoes are cooked through, about 1 hour more. Lamb should now be 
very tender, still juicy and falling off bone. Makes 12 servings.

 We agreed with Tracy Templeton Jackson: Lee Bailey's wimpy baked crab cakes 
bear little resemblance to the crusty fried ones, full of the taste of crab, 
that you find on the East Coast. There's a whole stick of butter in the recipe, 
so it wasn't as if Bailey chose to bake them in order to cut down on fat. 
(Supposedly it was for convenience, but it's not exactly a big deal to saute a 
few crab cakes. ) 
</P>
<P>
 Because the crab cakes are baked, rather than fried, they have a strange, 
wobbly texture. But even if you could get past their wobbliness, there's so 
much filler and binder, the mushy cakes taste like something you'd find on a 
hospital tray.  
</P>
<P>
 We didn't even bother to try to fix Bailey's recipe. Instead, we found this 
example of Maryland crab cakes in Jane and Michael Stern's "Real American Food" 
(Alfred A. Knopf). Filled with hunks of crab meat, an egg and some cracker 
crumbs for binding, and then fried in butter, the crab cakes are light and 
crusty and really quite delicious.  
</P>
<P>
 BEAUTIFUL SWIMMER CRAB CAKES 1/2 cup crushed cracker crumbs 1 pound lump crab 
meat, free of shell 1 tablespoon mayonnaise 1 tablespoon whipping cream 1 
tablespoon mustard 1 egg, beaten 1 tablespoon minced parsley 1 teaspoon white 
pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Butter 
</P>
<P>
 Mix crumbs into crab meat. Combine mayonnaise, whipping cream, mustard, egg, 
parsley, pepper, salt and Worcestershire. Add to crab meat and stir only enough 
to blend. Shape mixture between your hands into 6 hamburger-like patties, 
taking care not to crush hunks of crab meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 4 to 6 tablespoons of butter in large skillet. Set crab cakes in hot 
butter and saute until crisp and brown all over, about 3 minutes on each side. 
If cooking crab cakes in batches, add more butter for second batch. Makes 6 
servings.

 In his book "The New Texas Cuisine" (Doubleday), Stephen Pyles writes that if 
he had to choose one last meal, it would be this fried chicken. Craig Claiborne 
liked it so much when he tasted it at Routh Street Cafe, the Dallas restaurant 
Pyles once owned, that he included the recipe in his book "Craig Claiborne's 
Southern Cooking" (without crediting Pyles).  
</P>
<P>
 While the recipes in both books are practically identical, the methods the two 
authors use are very different. Pyles calls for frying the chicken in vegetable 
oil at 300 degrees, a low temperature, to prevent the honey from caramelizing 
too quickly and burning. Claiborne cooks the chicken in half lard and half oil 
at a temperature of 360 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 We tried both methods. Pyles', listed below, worked perfectly -- the chicken 
came out with a sweet, crisp, golden-brown skin. Claiborne's method failed. His 
honey-coated chicken blackened almost as soon as it hit the hot oil, and by the 
time it was thoroughly cooked inside, the skin was charred and inedible.  
</P>
<P>
 HONEY-FRIED CHICKEN WITH THYME-MINT CREAM SAUCE 1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) chicken 
1/2 cup honey 2 tablespoons raspberry or other fruit vinegar 1/2 cup flour 2 
tablespoons whole-wheat flour 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 eggs 1/4 cup 
buttermilk 1 cup vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Cut chicken into 6 serving pieces and place in mixing bowl, reserving 
backbone, neck and wings for stock. Stir honey and vinegar together and pour 
over chicken. Marinate at least 2 hours, mixing occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate mixing bowl, combine flour, whole-wheat flour and cayenne. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In another mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and buttermilk. 
</P>
<P>
 In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat to exactly 300 degrees. (Be 
sure to use reliable cooking thermometer. Honey coating on chicken will burn if 
oil is too hot. If too cool, chicken will be greasy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Remove chicken from marinade and drain on paper towels. Dip chicken pieces in 
egg wash, season with salt and pepper to taste and dredge in flour-cayenne 
mixture, coating thoroughly. When all chicken pieces are coated, strain 
marinade and reserve 1 tablespoon for sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently drop dark meat chicken pieces in hot oil and cook until browned on 1 
side, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn pieces over. Add white meat pieces and continue 
cooking, adjusting heat so chicken browns evenly without burning. Turn pieces 
again. Remove pieces as they become browned on both sides and tender when 
pierced with fork. Dark meat should cook 15 to 18 minutes total, white meat 10 
to 12 minutes. Transfer chicken to 200-degree oven and keep warm while making 
sauce. Serve with Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, with sauce, contains about:

<P>
 1,094 calories; 246 mg sodium; 237 mg cholesterol; 85 grams fat; 51 grams 
carbohydrates; 38 grams protein; 0.35 gram fiber. Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce 1/2 
cup dry white wine 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 
tablespoons chopped mint 1 tablespoon chopped thyme 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 
tablespoon reserved marinade Salt and freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Pour off oil from skillet used to fry chicken. Deglaze pan with white wine and 
add chicken stock, scraping bottom and sides of pan to free any browned bits 
that may have stuck during frying. Add cream, mint, thyme, lemon zest and 
reserved marinade, and reduce over high heat until sauce is thick enough to 
coat back of spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. Strain sauce and season to taste with salt 
and pepper.

 When The Times Food section ran a recipe for chocolate chip cookies from "The 
Wolfgang Puck Cookbook," angry readers called for weeks complaining that the 
recipe didn't work. Although we test most recipes, this one got past us. Even 
after reducing the amount of flour by half, the cookies still weren't right. 
They looked like pale little golf balls -- and that was after they were baked.  
</P>

 We figured it might be the weird method Puck uses: creaming the butter, then 
slowly adding the rest of the ingredients, one at a time. So we made the 
cookies the usual way, by creaming the butter with sugar, adding the egg, the 
vanilla and then the dry mixture, but they still came out in a golf ball mode.  
</P>
<P>
 Then we increased the butter. That got the cookies to spread a bit, but they 
still didn't taste very good. Finally, we gave up and developed our own recipe. 
Our cookies, which all our tasters approved, are made only with brown sugar 
instead of the half white and half brown that most versions call for .  
</P>
<P>
 BETTER THAN WOLF'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES 2 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 
1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup butter 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon 
vanilla extract 1 (12-ounce) package chocolate chips 1 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 In medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. Mix and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In large bowl, using electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and 
fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs 1 at time, beating well after each addition. 
Add vanilla extract. With mixer speed on low, slowly add flour mixture just 
until blended. Add chocolate chips and walnuts and mix until blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Chill cookie mixture until stiff, about 1 hour. Drop dough by rounded 
teaspoons onto ungreased baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake cookies at 350 degrees until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. When done, 
immediately transfer cookies from baking sheet to rack. When cool, cookies may 
be stored in airtight container. Makes about 36 cookies.

 It was John Taylor, owner of a culinary bookstore in South Carolina and author 
of "Hoppin' John's Lowcountry Cooking," who first alerted us to this recipe, so 
we'll let him tell the story: "The banana cream pie at Emeril Lagasse's 
restaurant in New Orleans was the best thing I've ever eaten, so I asked him to 
give me the recipe for my book. He told me it was his signature dish and that 
it would be in his new book ('Emeril's New New Orleans Cooking'), so all I 
needed to do was get permission (from the publisher to use the recipe).  
</P>
<P>
 "The book came out and I tried the recipe. It was horrible. It wasn't anything 
like the banana cream pie I ate at his restaurant. I felt like I had been 
cheated. It was too sweet, it never set up and it called for mounds and mounds 
of whipped cream. I wrote Emeril and told him that although the crust was 
perfect and putting the banana in the crust was a brilliant touch, I was 
disappointed. I asked him to please send me the corrected recipe, but I never 
heard from him."  
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was right on both accounts. The mashed banana in the crust is a swell 
idea, but the pastry cream filling is all wrong. Not only are the proportions 
way off (it's as if someone with bad math skills tried to break down a 
restaurant-size recipe -- to 3 cups of cream, Lagasse adds 2 1/2 cups of sugar, 
3/4 cup of cornstarch and 5 large egg yolks), we had problems with the method, 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 So we tried to rebuild the recipe using a simpler technique. It wasn't easy. 
We made the pastry cream at least 10 times, varying the amount of cornstarch, 
the egg yolks, the sugar, the method. Sometimes the pastry cream was too runny, 
other times too firm. Then we tried the simple method given in Helen Myhre's 
"Farm Recipes and Food Secrets from the Norske Nook." Myhre, known as 
Wisconsin's pie queen, combines sugar, flour and cornstarch, stirs it together, 
then adds egg yolks and a bit of liquid before stirring again, gradually adding 
more liquid while stirring. Her method worked, but the hot, silky mixture still 
turned grainy when it cooled.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it dawned on us that the butterfat from all of that cream might be 
causing the problem. Continuing to use Myhre's method, we switched to half milk 
and half cream, and the pie turned out perfectly. BANANA CREAM PIE WITH BANANA 
CRUST AND CARAMEL DRIZZLES 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 3 egg yolks 1 1/2 cups milk 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 
small vanilla bean, split and scraped 1 tablespoon butter Banana Pie Crust 2 
ripe bananas Caramel Drizzle Sauce 1 cup heavy cream whipped with 1/2 teaspoon 
vanilla Shaved chocolate 
</P>
<P>
 In heavy saucepan, whisk together sugar, flour and cornstarch. Add egg yolks 
but do not mix in yet. Gradually add milk and cream to saucepan, mixing 
contents thoroughly as you do, using whisk. Stir in vanilla bean pod and paste 
scraped from inside bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Place saucepan over medium heat and cook until thick and smooth, about 12 to 
15 minutes, stirring constantly with rubber spatula. Remove from heat. Remove 
vanilla pod. Add butter and stir well. Cover saucepan with plastic wrap to 
prevent skin from forming and let pastry cream mixture cool to lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
 When cool, spread about 1/3 of pastry cream in bottom of Banana Piecrust. Peel 
bananas and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange 1/2 of banana slices 
over pastry cream. Spread 1/3 of pastry cream on banana slices. Arrange 
remaining 1/2 of banana slices over that. Cover with remaining 1/3 of pastry 
cream and smooth out top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 
about 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, cut pie into wedges and drizzle warm Caramel Drizzle Sauce over. Top 
with whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 760 calories; 172 mg sodium; 274 mg cholesterol; 52 grams fat; 71 grams 
carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 0.38 gram fiber. Banana Piecrust 1 1/4 cups 
graham cracker crumbs 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 1/3 cup unsalted butter, 
at room temperature 1 small very ripe banana, mashed 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl, cream graham crackers, sugar, butter and mashed banana. Press into 
buttered 10-inch pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees until crust begins to smell of 
bananas, about 15 minutes. Caramel Drizzle Sauce up sugar cup water 1 cup heavy 
cream 
</P>
<P>
 In saucepan, combine sugar and water and bring to boil, stirring often. Cook, 
stirring occasionally, until mixture is deep nutty-brown color and consistency 
of thin syrup, about 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off heat. Stir in cream, turn heat 
back on high and boil sauce 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Use immediately.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: DREAM PIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last ten years or so, the rage for Caribbean food has sputtered into 
life, exploded into ubiquitousness and faded away, only to be reborn as Florida 
cuisine, which means, roughly, grilled things, plantains with everything and a 
certain predilection for mango-tamarind salsa. If you've ever eaten three 
consecutive non-Cuban meals in South Florida, especially at the famous places, 
you may wonder why anyone would want to export the stuff any farther than the 
bottom of Lake Okeechobee, but that's a different story altogether. I have just 
one thing to say about the new Florida cooking: fried conch in a sort of thin 
vanilla custard . . . from a James Beard Award-winning chef. 
</P>
<P>
 The defining dish of the Miami-influenced menu -- just, come to think of it, 
as it was to most of the neo-Caribbean menus the first time around -- seems to 
be Jamaican jerk chicken, a preparation that can remind you of the world's best 
barbecue when correctly executed, and political-benefit rubber chicken in a 
sweet, slightly spicy brown sauce when it is not. Good jerk chicken, rubbed 
with dry spice and grilled over fragrant hardwood, is as crisp-skinned and 
juicy as any chicken you've ever eaten. Good jerk chicken, strictly speaking, 
needs no sauce -- though the sauce, thin, vinegary, heated almost to the 
blister point with capsaicin-rich Scotch bonnet chiles, is always somewhere on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 And though island cuisine has been bubbling for more than a decade in Los 
Angeles, though there are half a dozen decent Jamaican restaurants and almost 
as many good neo-Caribbean joints, most of them called Cha Cha Cha, there is 
still only one jerk-chicken place worth going to: Janet's Original Jerk Chicken 
Pit, almost immediately at the midpoint on King Boulevard between USC and 
Leimert Park, which sizzles to life the barbecue of dreams. Through the 
judicious use of bamboo curtains and a slowly whirring ceiling fan, the 
brightly colored dining room of Janet's feels like a screened island porch even 
though the place is next door to a bail bondsman and across the street from the 
local police station. When the wind is right, you can smell Janet's from three 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 What you get at Janet's is, of course, jerk chicken on a Styrofoam plate, 
grilled to order, with a piece of festival bread alongside and a mound of beans 
and rice that tastes as if it has been simmered with a little coconut milk. 
(Perhaps you will be liberal enough to consider festival bread -- a sort of 
unsweetened cruller -- a vegetable; perhaps you will also order a sweet, 
roasted yam.) The chicken is crackly-crisp, moist, with crunchy bits of burnt 
skin and an appealingly gritty coating of allspice and cracked black pepper 
that sometimes fills the room with a scent more like Christmas cookies than 
like garlicky grilled bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerk pork is kind of the same idea applied to chewy chunks of boneless pig: 
very nice. Jerk fish is highly seasoned if on the dry side; jerk ribs, a 
Jamaican take on the leathery, almost jerky-like consistency of the Mexican 
tasajo ; jerk burgers, just what you'd expect, but not bad doused with a jolt 
of Janet's pitch-black jerk sauce, which can singe your esophagus if you're not 
careful but has tropical-fruit flavor for days.

COOKBOOK TROUBLE; WHO'S TO BLAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MENDELSON, Mendelson is currently at work on a history of The Joy of 
Cooking. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overheard years ago in the cookbook section of a large bookstore: "If you make 
any recipe from a cookbook and it doesn't work, they should give you your money 
back."  
</P>
<P>
 I have to sympathize with this disgruntled browser (a man, by the way, and one 
who seemed pretty handy with a categorical imperative). Who hasn't stood in 
front of some kitchen disaster and cursed the recipe? But I also have to say 
that I bet he was a victim of some badly skewed ideas about what recipes can 
and can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who pays attention to friends' experiences knows that the same recipe 
may come out like a mess or a masterpiece at the hands of two different people, 
both absolutely convinced that they followed every direction to the letter. The 
number of hidden banana peels involved is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, every few decades (or years) the experts in the field sharply 
lower their estimates of what normally intelligent men and women know about 
cooking. It's not surprising that the kind of kitchen instruction most people 
would consider adequate has undergone wild shifts in the two centuries of 
American cookbooks -- or even within the memory of cooks born 60 or 70 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest American recipes mirror an age when few cooks got their knowledge 
from reading. Most of the formulas in Amelia Simmons' 1796 "American Cookery," 
a work liberally plagiarized from an earlier work by the English author 
Susannah Carter, were far less detailed than this entry: 
</P>
<P>
 "To preserve Cherries. Take two pounds of cherries, one pound and a half of 
sugar, half a pint of fair water, melt some sugar in it; when it is melted, put 
in your other sugar and your cherries; then boil them softly, till all the 
sugar be melted; then boil them fast, and skim them; take them off two or three 
times and shake them, and put them on again, and let them boil fast; and when 
they are of a good color, and the sirrup will stand, they are boiled enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The things left out by Susannah Carter and her American cribber -- stoning or 
not stoning the cherries, how large a pan to use, how much sugar to add earlier 
or later -- needed no telling. Even today a cook with experience in preserving 
could follow the idea. Recipe-writers of the Carter-Simmons era didn't provide 
detailed blueprints but handy memos summarizing what a woman was likely to have 
absorbed already. 
</P>
<P>
 How did she absorb it? Mostly from having spent much time since toddlerhood in 
a kitchen where several women, often both servants and mistresses, split up the 
labor of meal-making -- which was too much for a single pair of hands until 
later advances in household technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1796, women didn't automatically judge a cookbook by how well it "covered 
basics." The basics could fend for themselves, and the most common dishes often 
didn't make it into print. (This leads to awful misconceptions about nobody 
eating certain dishes at a particular time because they don't happen to show up 
in printed recipes.) People were more likely to go to a cookbook for what they 
couldn't find or afford every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Methods of recipe-writing would eventually change -- but only when people's 
lives changed. The main causes were the spread of literacy (along with cheaper 
paper) and upheavals in household organization after domestic servants began 
following the American dream to independent employment. A woman running a 
middle-class household was likely to be more isolated in it, and to rely on the 
printed word, rather than live examples, for a general idea of what she was 
supposed to be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, more cookbooks full of supposedly infallible recipes did not 
mean an improved public knowledge of cooking. Domestic how-to books became 
really necessary only when the woman of the house became justifiably convinced 
of her ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 This growing vacuum provided a raison d'etre for female "service" journalists 
and writers of household manuals -- professions hardly known until the 1830s or 
'40s. It also spurred formal courses in cooking, a la algebra or French. 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar lobbyists' theme of the post-Civil War period was the need to do 
something about the terrible state of American food by adding cooking classes 
to school curricula. In 1879, the then-Commissioner of Education passed on to 
his boss, Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, a plea to encourage "training 
schools of cookery" gotten up by persons concerned about "the extent and 
serious character of the evils caused by bad cookery." It was not a trivial bit 
of moralizing but a response to the miseries of the 1873 to 1878 economic 
slump, when well-meaning philanthropists had seen hungry families sit down to 
meals worse than mere poverty could have created. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody could have a field day arguing that more cookbooks and teachers make 
cooking worse, not better. But more likely -- at least in this case -- both the 
bad cooking and the push for more instruction reflected some of this country's 
demographic growing pains. Many poor immigrants were marooned in the kitchen 
with no knowledge of how to produce edible and affordable meals from American 
ingredients, while middle-class housewives were similarly up the creek from 
lack of the childhood training that had come automatically when mistresses and 
servants ran the household together. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools and cookbooks may have helped women on an individual basis. But on 
the whole Americans became steadily more ignorant of cooking, and more inclined 
to try teaching themselves from a book. Pictures of women at work in kitchens 
toward the beginning of the 19th Century usually show them handling 
ingredients, or minding hearth or stove. By the end of the century they are 
routinely drawn poring over a cookbook. Unfortunately, they had more and more 
trouble understanding what the recipe said. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't floundering for lack of cheerleading. Instructors and authors 
were busy vaunting their absolutely foolproof directions. Cooking, they liked 
to think, was a branch of "domestic science," and the ideal recipe was as 
precise as a lab formula. You ticked off items on a checklist of ingredients at 
the head of the recipe, then you executed one step at a time. Photographs of 
cooking classes circa 1910 or 1920 tell the story: calibrated measuring cups 
and spoons lined up as for a chemistry experiment, aproned students lined up to 
act on the same command at the same moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The written recipe of these teachers worked hard to eliminate little sources 
of individual variation, which might have made one person's result taste 
different from another's. Fannie Farmer, who took over the Boston 
Cooking-School in 1893 and soon produced the main kitchen bible of the early 
20th Century, perfected an especially rigorous version of this recipe-approach. 
For instance: Sauce a l'Italienne 2 tablespoons onion, finely chopped 2 
tablespoons carrot, finely chopped 2 tablespoons lean raw ham, finely chopped 
12 peppercorns 2 cloves Sprig marjoram 2 tablespoons butter 2 1/2 tablespoons 
flour 1 cup Brown Stock 1 1/2 cups white wine 1/2 tablespoon finely chopped 
parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook first six ingredients with butter five minutes, add flour, and stir until 
well browned; then add gradually stock and wine. Strain, reheat, and after 
pouring around fish, sprinkle with parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a carefully condensed script, broken down into one piece of information 
at a time, with all the unnecessary baggage of the English language -- like "A 
sprig of marjoram" -- eliminated to avoid distraction from the task at hand 
(and save printing costs). Nothing was left to the student's or reader's 
judgment, not even a tiny amount of flavorings. Instead of mincing a little 
onion with a little carrot and ham, Miss Farmer's pupils or readers of the 1896 
"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" were to take the ingredients separately and 
mince enough of each to obtain two tablespoons, thus frustrating the whole idea 
of the Italian battuto (aromatics chopped together to help marry the flavors). 
Instead of grabbing a bit of parsley and chopping enough for a garnish, they 
had to maneuver the pesky stuff into a measuring spoon after it was chopped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Refinement followed refinement as the century progressed. In the 1930s the way 
to be the model of a modern recipe-writer was to give exact oven temperatures 
(not possible in Miss Farmer's day) and cake or pie pan sizes. Irma Rombauer, 
no fan of lab-manual recipes, nonetheless filled her 1936 "Joy of Cooking" with 
directions for adjustments of stove-burners ("Reduce the heat to a low flame"; 
"Do not permit the water to boil as that robs the fish of its delicate flavor") 
that Miss Farmer -- if she used one of the old firebox ranges -- hadn't had at 
her command. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually even the Farmer or Rombauer idea of precision wasn't precise enough 
for a new breed of recipe-writer. Around the time of the gourmet revolution in 
the early 1960s, books like "Michael Field's Cooking School" replaced 
directions such as "Brown the chicken in a skillet" with "Choose a large, heavy 
frying pan, preferably enamel, which can be covered securely later, and in it 
heat the 4 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil, until they fairly 
sizzle. Over high heat brown the chicken pieces, a few at a time, starting them 
skin side down and turning them with kitchen tongs." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ever browned chicken pieces for a braised dish like Field's "Chicken 
Vallee d'Auge ," you certainly can see the point of every detail. On the other 
hand, do five pages spent breathlessly dissecting this one recipe help a new 
cook more than the three matter-of-fact lines the French writer Curnonsky 
devoted to Poulet Vallee d'Auge in "Recettes des Provinces de France" -- or do 
they intimidate? Some of both, I suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Field book, one of the standbys of "serious" cooks when I started, was 
primitive compared to Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck's 
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking," with its double-column recipe format 
spread out over stunningly spacious one-detail-at-a-time page layouts. 
</P>
<P>
 To the standard checklist of ingredients it added pieces of necessary 
equipment ("A 2-quart mixing bowl"; "A 2 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed, enameled 
saucepan" -- heaven help you if you just had a nice Farberware saucepan). The 
directions might include something like "Measure out ingredients" or -- in the 
second volume, which had organizational refinements beyond the first -- "Note 
that there is also a sauce base in Step 6, which you may prepare now if you 
wish." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Farmer herself might have quailed under such onslaughts of exactitude. It 
was like being talked through performing an emergency appendectomy on the 
kitchen table with shortwave radio instructions from the bush hospital. Did all 
the vaunted precision of the gourmet-revolution recipes indicate that American 
cookbooks had gotten more sophisticated, or that the intended user couldn't 
tell her hind end from her elbow? Just whose fault was it if a recipe "didn't 
work?" 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, folks. There are strong limitations on the written word's 
ability to convey knowledge to people who lack a minimum shared frame of 
reference. That frame has been shrinking all the time that recipe-writing has 
been getting more "precise" and "sophisticated." This is probably one reason 
some observers see cooking videos as the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll have cooks who aren't thrown by recipes when Americans start spending 
more time in the kitchen actually getting their hands on knives and saucepans 
and ingredients. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it.

BACK TO BASICS: TINY BUBBLES IN THE EGG WHITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many recipes call for beating egg whites either until they are soft or form 
stiff peaks. This assumes that the cook is familiar with this technique, which 
may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 For beating egg whites, use a bowl made of glass, stainless steel, ceramic or 
unlined copper. Not recommended are aluminum, which will tint the egg whites 
gray, or plastic, which tends to retain traces of fat from previous uses (fat 
keeps the whites from reaching full volume). 
</P>
<P>
 A deep, round-bottomed bowl is best. It needs to be large enough for the egg 
whites to expand six or seven times their original volume. The bowls and 
beaters must be absolutely clean and free of fat and moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Care also needs to be taken in separating the eggs because the whites won't 
whip to full volume if even a speck of yolk is present, because of the fat in 
egg yolk. The egg whites should be at room temperature (65 to 75 degrees) to 
ensure they will incorporate the most air possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An electric mixer or balloon whisk may be used to beat the egg whites. In "How 
Cooking Works" (Macmillan: 1981), authors Sylvia Rosenthal and Fran Shinagel 
state: "There has been continuing controversy over the relative merits of 
beating egg whites with a balloon whisk in an unlined copper bowl, where the 
acidity of the metal helps the whites to rise and keep their stability after 
they have risen, versus beating them in a stainless-steel or glass bowl, where 
you need to add a pinch of cream of tartar to supply the acidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's lay the controversy to rest. We have yet to meet anybody (ourselves 
included) who could spot the difference in a properly made souffle regardless 
of how the egg whites were beaten. A hand beater or an electric one works just 
as well as a whisk, and certainly an electric appliance produces less wear and 
tear on the cook." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Marion Cunningham has tested the two methods and reports 
that the copper bowl gives a clearly superior result. The volume of a souffle 
made with whites beaten in copper is no greater than one made with cream of 
tartar, but it has a better texture because the bubbles in the whites are 
smaller. ELECTRIC MIXER METHOD 
</P>
<P>
 It takes only a few seconds of beating egg whites at low speed to reach the 
foamy stage (Step 1), where they lose the yellowish translucence and appear 
bubbly, but are still very fluid. This is the point where cream of tartar may 
be added to stabilize the whites, if desired or called for in recipes. Use 1/4 
teaspoon cream of tartar for each four egg whites. A dash of salt may also be 
added. Keep in mind, though, that adding either cream of tartar or salt too 
early will delay the foaming action. 
</P>
<P>
 Increase the mixer speed and continue beating until egg whites reach the soft 
peak stage (Step 2), at which peaks form when you lift the beaters, but then 
fold over. At this point the egg whites are moist and shiny. If preparing 
meringue, this is when you begin to add sugar; when making a souffle, this is 
the time to fold in the beaten egg yolks. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue beating until whites stand upright in peaks when the beaters are 
removed (Step 3). They should have a shiny, glossy surface and be stiff but not 
dry. Egg whites beaten to this stage are used for chiffon cakes and hard 
meringues. 
</P>
<P>
 If egg whites are overbeaten (Step 4), they become dry, appear curdled, don't 
combine well with other ingredients and can't perform their leavening function 
when heated. Remedy the problem by adding another egg white and beating again 
to the correct stage. CLASSIC METHOD 
</P>
<P>
 Before each use, a copper bowl needs to be cleaned with salt slightly 
moistened with vinegar. Scrub the bowl thoroughly with this mixture, using a 
sponge or soft cloth. Rinse with hot water and dry thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bowl cools to room temperature, add the egg whites and begin beating 
with a balloon whisk in a slow circular motion. Bring the whisk down on the far 
side of the bowl and up toward you. Some sources also recommend giving the bowl 
a quarter turn each time. 
</P>
<P>
 As whites begin to whip, increase speed and beat in a figure-8 motion -- down 
the middle of the bowl, under and up one side, then down and away toward the 
opposite side. Continue beating until either soft or stiff peaks form.

COOKBOOK TROUBLE; A SOUP IS BORN

 How do you create a recipe from the first spark of an idea? It's a combination 
of the mystical and the downright practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipes should not exist in a vacuum. Yes, it's exciting to taste new 
combinations of flavors and master techniques. But for me, the deeper goal is 
in making some kind of contribution beyond these momentary sensations. Though 
flavor brings joy to eating, there must be meaning beyond that. Does the recipe 
just involve measurements and flavors or does it speak to larger issues? 
</P>
<P>
 To begin writing, you must understand the mechanics of a recipe. When I was 
about to start work on my first book, I met with a cookbook editor. During my 
college years, I had cooked my way through all the cookbooks in the Berkeley 
Public Library and had a budding cookbook collection of my own, but I didn't 
know some of the most obvious things about how to write a recipe. She 
explained, for example, that you must list the ingredients in the order in 
which they appear in the method, the step-by-step part of the recipe. I 
remember thinking that couldn't possibly be the way they're listed. It must be 
in order of importance or quantity. At home, I looked in a cookbook and sure 
enough, she was right. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing that appears before the list of ingredients and method is called a 
headnote. But what goes into a headnote? 
</P>
<P>
 Should it simply describe the dish? The headnote is a very important part of 
the whole. It lures you into the recipe. You can explain why you find the idea 
so intriguing, point out an unusual technique, point out a slightly tricky 
part, make menu suggestions, or write about a specific ingredient, such as what 
to look for when buying Swiss chard, or the importance of buying organic lemons 
when using the rind. A headnote can also evoke a time and place or a mood. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate what goes into selecting an idea and writing a recipe, here is a 
look at the steps I took in writing a recipe for my upcoming book. 
</P>
<P>
 Because my family is from Sicily, where wild fennel grows abundantly, fennel 
holds a special place in my heart. When I was growing up in a Southern 
California suburb, my grandmother grew wild fennel in the back yard, probably 
purely for sentimental and ornamental reasons, since I can't remember tasting 
it as a child. Now, Florentine fennel, the fresh fennel variety sold in 
markets, has a tasty bulb, but its feathery tops do not possess much flavor. 
Wild fennel does grow along the California coast, but its availability is 
pretty restricted, meaning it would be unrealistic to call for it in a recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been intrigued for some time by a rustic bread soup from the Italian 
island of Sardinia that features wild fennel and sun-dried tomato. I thought 
that using the bulb of Florentine fennel and a sprinkling of fennel seeds might 
impart a flavor similar to the taste of wild fennel. Further, I thought I would 
finely chop the fennel tops of the Florentine fennel and add them to the soup 
for color. I would add the fibrous stalks to the broth for flavor, but remove 
them after the initial cooking of the soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of sun-dried tomatoes in this dish could be instructive, illustrating 
their traditional use as a cold-weather substitute for fresh tomatoes, as 
opposed to their more arbitrary -- and often inappropriate -- use as just 
another trendy ingredient. I'm interested in simple vegetable broths, and I 
thought the combination of fennel and sun-dried tomato would create a 
wonderfully full-flavored and richly colored broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also interesting is the second cooking of the soup, where it is layered with 
country bread and fresh cheeses and baked in the oven, creating a satisfying 
one-dish meal. The recipe also illustrates the importance of the quality of 
bread needed for a soup such as this one. And I could point out how this sort 
of soup was a way of extending the life of stale bread and increasing the 
nutritional value of a dish. Dried bread could be used, since the broth would 
soften its texture. 
</P>
<P>
 I began testing the recipe by gathering the ingredients. I first checked to 
make sure the fennel seeds I had were fresh and strongly perfumed. I bought two 
fragrant, pearly white fennel bulbs with fresh feathery tops. I bought a 
high-quality brand of sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil (any other oil 
would spoil the taste of the soup). I bought a crusty loaf of bread from one of 
the many bread bakeries in my area. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted the soup to have some of its original green color, so I bought 
bunches of Italian parsley and basil. Since the original dish has parsley and 
basil as part of the aromi -- or background flavors -- increasing their amounts 
keeps the spirit of the dish still intact, as long as the fennel flavor 
dominates. I purchased a dripping fresh mozzarella cheese. The original zuppa 
uses a combination of cheeses, some mild, some strong. I decided to start with 
a mild cheese so the flavor would not compete with the fennel. 
</P>
<P>
 I was pleased with the ingredients; they formed a beautiful still life. As I 
began the cooking process I had to make a hundred little decisions and 
faithfully record every measurement and every step. When I removed the 
steaming, aromatic soup from the oven and saw the beautiful broth, deeply 
colored and flavored, I was pleased, but not entirely satisfied with the 
results. A zuppa traditionally is a soup that features bread; it is thick, and 
not too brothy. The soup fit the description -- the bread had absorbed the 
juices and softened, but enough broth remained to keep the soup moist. There 
was a nice, light licorice flavor. The cheese was melted and, although the 
mozzarella clumped up a little, it enriched the soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I'm not sure this is the finished version. The next time I make this 
soup I'll drive along the coast to collect wild fennel. I will experiment with 
different cheeses that might provide more flavor and melt more effectively. 
Pecorino Sardo, a grating cheese, is becoming more available here and would 
provide more of the tangy flavor of the original cheeses. Also, I might shred 
the mozzarella instead of slicing it thinly to make it melt better. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time I might try slicing rather than dicing the Florentine fennel for 
a different texture and to see if it brings out more fennel flavor. I might 
soak the bread in a little milk to moisten it and to enrich the soup. Next time 
I'll let the bread dry naturally, instead of toasting it, and use it in its 
more authentic form. As you can see, all kinds of subtle changes can make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The final step is to write it all down. At my word processor, as soon as 
possible after actually testing the recipe, I write, revise and refine the 
recipe. How will I describe the size of the chopped fennel pieces -- small 
chunks or medium dice? How much sun-dried tomatoes? Are they best measured by 
the piece or by the cup? Should I give the exact size of the cooking vessel or 
just an approximation? 
</P>
<P>
 For certain recipes, most notably in baking, exactitude is everything and no 
leaps of faith are admissible. But I know that with my style of cooking, a 
little leeway is desirable. I try to give as much information as needed while 
allowing the reader to make some personal choices. I think this helps promote 
real learning, since my goal is to teach someone how to cook, not just how to 
follow recipes. Some cookbook authors follow a paint-by-numbers method, 
detailing everything. I prefer a connect-the-dots approach where a few little 
leaps are allowed, and there is some room to breath. The balancing act is to 
supply all the crucial information and measurements necessary, yet give the 
recipe a living, breathing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 As the project takes shape, I might decide this recipe doesn't fit, or that it 
conflicts with the overall feeling. But the process of experimenting with this 
idea was a learning experience and the finished book will be better for it, 
whether the recipe is actually included or not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the baking dish is important, since it controls the degree of 
evaporation of the stock. In the method I also wanted to make sure the steps 
were efficient. For example, while the onion sautes, the fennel is trimmed, and 
while the soup simmers, the cheese is sliced and the bread toasted.  
</P>
<P>
 FENNEL AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO SOUP 1 onion, cut into small dice 1/4 cup chopped 
Italian parsley 8 basil leaves, chopped 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds 2 tablespoons 
extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for garnish 1 1/2 pounds fennel, about 2 
medium bulbs 1/4 cup drained chopped sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil Finely 
ground sea salt and coarsely ground black pepper 5 cups water 1/2 pound drained 
mozzarella in water 15 (1/2-inch thick) slices sturdy Italian bread, or enough 
bread to make (3 1/2-inch thick) layers that fit baking dish 
</P>
<P>
 In medium soup pot, saute onion, parsley, basil and fennel seeds in olive oil 
over low heat for about 12 minutes, or until onion is tender and lightly 
golden. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, trim fennel, reserving feathery tops and stalks. Remove tough 
strings and bruised areas on surface of fennel bulbs. Chop fennel bulbs into 
small chunks. Finely chop feathery tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Add chopped fennel bulb and tops, and sun-dried tomatoes to pot. Saute over 
medium heat for 5 minutes, adding salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 5 cups water and fennel stalks and bring to boil. Simmer for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinly slice mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange bread slices on cookie sheet and toast at 400 degrees until bread is 
crisp and light gold. about 5 minutes on each side. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove fennel stalks from soup. Ladle 1/4 of soup into oven-proof pot or 
baking dish about 8 inches in diameter and 5 1/2 inches deep. Arrange 5 slices 
of bread in 1 layer over top, and 1/3 of cheese slices. Season with salt and 
pepper. Continue layering, ending with soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake soup uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Only small amount of 
broth will remain since bread will absorb most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladle soup into individual soup bowls, distributing broth evenly. Pour thin 
thread of olive oil over each. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 Are you chopping that onion or dicing it? Or maybe even mincing it? When a 
recipe tells you to deglaze, do you start searching for paint thinner? Over 
centuries, the language of cooking has built up a dictionary worth of 
frequently used words with very specific definitions that mean little or 
nothing to non-cooks. Here are just a few of the most common. METHODS Blanch -- 
To boil vegetables, fruits or meats briefly to tenderize or set color, usually 
a preparation step rather than a final cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Braise -- To cook in a moderate amount of flavored liquid that will then be 
used as part of the finished dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruise -- To crush an aromatic food to release flavor, such as in garlic or 
ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiffonnade -- To cut a leafy vegetable in thin strips. The easiest method is 
to stack the leaves one atop the other, roll them in a cigar-shape and then cut 
them in thin strips width-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Chop -- To cut roughly in chunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarify -- To remove milky sediment from butter by melting, then pouring off 
liquid fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cream -- To beat butter and sugar together until the mixture turns white, 
smooth and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deglaze -- To pour flavored liquid (wine, stock, etc.) into a hot pan in which 
something has been browned, freeing any flavorful bits that might have stuck to 
the bottom of the pan and establishing the base for a quick sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Dice -- To cut in uniformly sized cubes.  
</P>
<P>
 Dredge -- To dip lightly in flour before frying. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold -- To combine a dry ingredient with whipped egg whites or cream in such a 
way that the air bubbles in the egg white or cream are not deflated. 
</P>
<P>
 Julienne -- To cut in long thin, matchstick-size strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Knead -- To work a dough in order to develop the flour's gluten. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinate -- To flavor by surrounding meats or vegetables with flavoring 
compounds -- either wet or dry -- and leaving to set. 
</P>
<P>
 Mince -- To finely chop. 
</P>
<P>
 Plump -- To soak a dried ingredient (especially fruits, such as raisins) in 
liquid to rehydrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Poach -- To cook in water at low heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree -- Essentially, to turn something that is more or less solid into 
something more or less liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce -- To boil a flavored liquid until a significant portion (usually at 
least one-third) has evaporated, concentrating the flavor and -- in some cases 
-- thickening the texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Saute -- Sometimes known as pan-frying, to cook something in a small amount of 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer -- To cook in liquid that is very hot, but not fully boiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir-Fry -- Akin to sauteeing, but done over extremely high heat in a very 
short time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat -- To cook flavoring vegetables (onions, garlic, carrots, celery) very 
slowly in a small amount of fat to release flavors without browning. 
INGREDIENTS Creme Fraiche -- Ripened cream, in texture and flavor somewhere 
between whipping cream and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Demiglace -- Stock (usually veal) that has been reduced to the point that it 
jellies when cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Roux -- Combination of flour and fat used to thicken sauces, stews or soups. 
</P>
<P>
 Zest -- Aromatic colored part of a citrus rind. NOT the thick, white bitter 
pith just below it. TERMS Al Dente -- The point of done-ness at which noodles, 
rice or vegetables are well-cooked but still resistant to the bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Bain-Marie -- Water bath used to bake delicate puddings and certain types of 
cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-reactive bowl or pan -- A bowl or pan made from a material that will not 
interact with acidic ingredients, most usually stainless steel or glass. NOT 
aluminum. 
</P>
<P>

IN THE KITCHEN; A TOMATO TUNE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The air is all aswelter and downtown smells like somebody's old sock. But I'm 
happy. My tomatoes are finally coming around. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a long summer. Until last week, where I live in Long Beach -- about 
as close to the ocean as you can be and still remain unfashionable -- has been 
under daily cloud cover until noon. 
</P>
<P>
 We did have a brief shot of hot weather a couple of weeks ago, which sent the 
tomatoes sprinting toward perfection. But along came the clouds, cooling them 
off at the last minute. The result was tomatoes that may have looked great -- 
deep red and shiny -- but were pink inside, with the particular cottony texture 
of grocery store produce and a vague taste that is kind of like catching a 
glimpse of a really ripe tomato that has just turned a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think: All the work of home-grown, but none of the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help matters that one of my co-workers, who lives in the desert, 
keeps bringing in absolutely delicious cherry tomatoes. He has so many that he 
carries them in plastic shopping bags and leaves them on a central table where 
anyone can grab as many as they want. I eat my fill and then take some home. 
Lightly sauteed with a little olive oil, garlic and basil, they are perfect 
when served with grilled meat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to be a good cook when you have good produce. That's one of the main 
reasons for starting a vegetable garden in the first place. But take away the 
raw materials -- for whatever reason -- and you've just got to work a little 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the things I've learned in the last couple of weeks of harvesting 
sub-standard tomatoes, is how to make the most of every scrap of flavor. Along 
the way, I've picked up a couple of tricks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that tomatoes thrive in heat and hate cold. That applies not only 
to fruit on the vine, but also those that have been picked. If you need to be 
told again: DON'T PUT TOMATOES IN THE REFRIGERATOR. The cold stunts their 
flavor. At the same time, warming tomatoes in the oven improves the taste of 
even fairly pallid specimens. In fact, you can make a pretty good pasta sauce 
from not-very-good tomatoes by simply roasting whole tomatoes in a 350-degree 
oven until they collapse of their own weight. Then run them through a food mill 
to remove skin and seeds. That will beat all but the best canned tomatoes you 
can find. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just as cooks once reflexively added a bit of sugar to tomato dishes to make 
up for the lack of sweetness in inferior produce, I add a bit of balsamic 
vinegar. Not only does the trace of sweetness help, but I find the tang is much 
more important in giving a full, bursting flavor to these half-acid tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 You can use these tricks by themselves or in concert with other techniques. 
One of the most common, of course, is stuffing tomatoes full of flavoring. 
These can be either hot or cold, as simple as bread crumbs and garlic or 
extremely complicated. The Italian food magazine A Tavola, for example, ran a 
story listing 22 different recipes for stuffed tomatoes, including everything 
from fried fish and quail's egg (for some reason called a hamburger) to wild 
rice and mussels, salmon eggs and whipped cream, and even cold crab souffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the shape of the tomato makes it a perfectly handy receptacle. But 
beyond that, the stuffing also serves as flavoring. And heating stuffed 
tomatoes melds flavors together, making the sum much greater than the parts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a curious way, this dish is inside-out. I love melted mozzarella and think 
it goes wonderfully with the earthy, briny flavors of a tomato sauce made with 
anchovies, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. All we're doing in this recipe, is 
putting the cheese inside the sauce rather than under it. Wow. Think about that 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Just try not to break a sweat. STUFFED TOMATOES 6 medium-sized tomatoes 
Balsamic vinegar Salt Freshly ground pepper 6 anchovy fillets, preferably 
salt-packed, rinsed well and cut in half (about 2 ounces) 6 balls fresh 
mozzarella (about 7 3/4 ounces) 1/2 cup bread crumbs 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 
tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil Extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Slice 1/4 off top of each tomato. Using melon baller, remove most of seeds and 
pulp, being careful not to damage sides of tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle inside of each tomato with few drops balsamic vinegar, dash salt and 
dash pepper. Do not over-salt as anchovies are naturally salty. Cross halves of 
anchovy fillets in bottom of tomato. Place ball of fresh mozzarella in each 
tomato. Place tomatoes on baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees until mozzarella 
softens (do not let tomato collapse), about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 While tomatoes are baking, combine bread crumbs, garlic and basil in small 
bowl. When mozzarella has begun to melt, spoon bread crumb mixture over top of 
each tomato. Drizzle with olive oil and broil until brown. Makes 6 servings.

WINE: A WHITE WINE REFRESHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade ago, some California winemakers referred to their Sauvignon Blancs as 
"poor man's Chardonnay," a sobriquet that was inappropriate at the time, 
because the two wines were different in a number of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more and more Sauvignon Blanc is made to taste like Chardonnay. 
Recently a caller even asked why there was so little difference between the two 
wines. She also asked where she could find out how the basic wine types are 
supposed to smell and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 While the answer to the first question is fairly straightforward (marketing), 
there is no simple answer to the second. Winemakers use all sorts of tricks to 
make the fruit in grapes smell and taste like things other than fruit. So 
explaining the basic wine types requires also a description of various styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief overview of the basic white wine types, what they should smell 
and taste like, why they might not and how they often are rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chardonnay: The basis for almost all French white Burgundy is Chardonnay, 
the most popular white wine in this country today. It is a delicate grape 
variety that makes wine with the aroma of tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, 
even banana) and citrus (grapefruit or lime) when grown in cool climates. In 
warmer regions, the aroma approaches apple, pear and peach. 
</P>
<P>
 In inexpensive Chardonnays, however, the aroma often is radically different. 
By law all varietal wines must be composed of at least 75% of the named 
variety, permitting 25% of something less expensive. So as much as a fourth of 
cheap Chardonnays can be cheaper grapes such as Muscat or Riesling. It is 
aromas from these grapes that dominate cheap Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, though, even expensive Chardonnay may smell little like the grape. Many 
winemakers tinker with Chardonnay by putting it through a malolactic 
fermentation that converts the wine's malic acid (which is apple-scented) to 
lactic acid (more like milk), producing an artificial buttery scent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They also age the wine on the spent yeast cells (lees), which adds an 
oniony/earthy note. And they also age the wine in barrels, the insides of which 
are charred, giving the wine an aroma of vanilla (from the oak) and toast (from 
the char). 
</P>
<P>
 These days even cheaper Chardonnays that aren't aged in oak barrels can have 
an oak flavor. Winemakers have discovered the trick of dipping giant "tea bags" 
of oak chips into tanks of wine for flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many California wineries use these techniques to rob the wine of its 
fruit. Napa Valley wine author Bob Thompson calls these oaky monsters "me too" 
Chardonnays. "They all want the smell of trees more than they do of grapes," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 This syndrome is even affecting some French Chardonnays aimed at the American 
market, such as certain versions of Pouilly-Fuisse or Macon Blanc. In the past, 
the best of these would be very crisp white wines, but a number of these wines 
are becoming clumsy too. 
</P>
<P>
 One added problem for many cheap Chardonnays is residual sugar in the wine. It 
may be more palatable to novice tasters who grew up drinking soda, but it 
doesn't offer the crispness one needs for accompanying food. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of the big, rich, oaky, buttery style of Chardonnay is 1992 Sanford 
Winery, "Barrel Select" ($20). Chardonnay like this is fun to sip on a patio as 
an aperitif, but the oak, butter, vanilla, toast and other non-fruit elements 
make it awkward to match with food. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few delicate yet flavorful Chardonnays that use oak deftly, I like 
the crisp acidity of the 1992 St. Clement Vineyards ($16), an excellent food 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Few California Chardonnays age very well these days -- far fewer than the 
white Burgundies from such regions as Meursault, Montrachet, or 
Corton-Charlemagne.

 * Sauvignon Blanc (also called Fume Blanc): The basic aromas of this grape are 
more herbal than fruity, with tarragon and sage overlaying melons, pears, lemon 
peel and even -- to some tasters -- to weeds and chile peppers. The aroma of 
some cold-climate Sauvignon Blancs of the past, such as those from Monterey 
County, once was compared to boiled asparagus, but recent advances in the 
vineyard have weeded out the vegetal odor and replaced it with a milder "green 
melon" or mild bell pepper character. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a few wineries do make Sauvignon Blanc with residual sugar and oak 
aging, this grape is generally not put through as many contortions as 
Chardonnay. With less oak and rarely any malolactic fermentation, it often 
smells more like the fruit and thus is more predictable and food-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 France's Loire Valley makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc. For me, the classic 
American Sauvignon Blanc is from Dry Creek Vineyards in Sonoma County. Those 
from Kunde Estate, Ferrari-Carano Winery, Buena Vista Winery "Lake County" and 
Kenwood Vineyards all are exceptional wines that show off the delicate herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sauvignon Blanc goes through malolactic fermentation and is aged in new 
oak casks, the aroma can approach that of Chardonnay, making it "poor man's 
Chardonnay," but distinctiveness is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting thing about Sauvignon Blanc for me is the great tastes I 
have found in aging them. Conventional wisdom says you drink Sauvignon Blanc 
young, yet well-stored, older Sauvignon Blancs have proven far more interesting 
and tasty than almost any other white wine (except Semillon). Even the cheapest 
of these wines can take on fine, mature character that I find more rewarding 
than most of the aged Chardonnays I've tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Riesling: The greatest Rieslings of all are from Germany. These range from 
the delicate Mosels (bottled in green bottles) to the richer, aromatic Rhines 
(in brown bottles). They are made in styles that range from steely dry to 
unctuously sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The aromas I associate with Riesling most are of apples and pears, but many 
Rieslings also have a note of petroleum (some call it kerosene). That, to the 
uninitiated, may seems like an odd thing to like, but as long as it's not out 
of balance with the more fruity and spicy elements, it actually can be 
engaging. In fact, lovers of German Rieslings say the oily aroma is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Equal to the Germans and different in many ways are Rieslings from France's 
Alsace, whose aromas include such fascinating elements as basil, kumquat and 
pine. 
</P>
<P>
 Riesling, perhaps the greatest wine grape of them all, is not a big seller in 
the United States, but a number of California wineries make fine Rieslings, 
notably Trefethen Vineyards, Geyser Peak Vineyards and Claiborne and Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gewurztraminer: A marvelous wine to match with Asian foods when made dry or 
off-dry, Gewurztraminer grown in cooler climates makes a wine that smells like 
litchi nuts, gardenias, carnations and pine, with hints of pear and allspice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely is the wine aged in new oak barrels, so the only textural element 
beyond the alcohol is the amount of sugar left in the wine. In the Alsace, the 
sugar is almost entirely absent; in California, it's usually about 1%, though 
the most widely marketed version, from Fetzer Vineyards, is about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The best are from the Alsace (Domaine Weinbach, Zind Humbrecht and Trimbach 
are reliable producers). Californians who do well with it are Navarro 
Vineyards, Thomas Fogarty Winery, Z Moore, Hop Kiln Winery and Bouchaine 
Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chenin Blanc: When made dry, this wine, with its melony, leafy aroma, is a 
wonderful alternative to Chardonnay. When off-dry (such as from Dry Creek 
Vineyards) or even a bit sweeter (from Pine Ridge Winery) the wine has broader 
appeal than most Chardonnays. One of the state's best, from Simi Winery in 
Sonoma County, has inexplicably been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semillon: An aroma more of figs, hay and (from colder climates) pears sets 
this wine apart from its cousin Sauvignon Blanc. The wine can be fresh and 
appealing when young (versions from Washington State are especially nice), but 
the best take on marvelous bottle bouquet. Cold-climate versions can have a 
distinct asparagus-y aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Crest and Hogue Cellars of Washington make 
splendid Semillons, along with California wineries Alderbrook Winery, Clos du 
Val and Wente Bros.

LOW FAT; SPRUCING UP CORN CHOWDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hot soups are usually thought of as cool weather cooking. But this soup is so 
fresh and light-tasting that you'll want to serve it even as the first course 
for an outdoor summer barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's low in fat. The lightness comes from the vegetable broth used 
for the soup base, combined with chicken bouillon cubes for richness. Canned 
cream-style corn is stirred in along with cornstarch for thickening. If 
possible, use only very fresh shrimp rather then frozen. The flavor of the 
fresh is far superior to that of frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 A wonderfully flavorful cilantro pistou is spooned atop the soup just before 
serving. Oil is not used in this low-fat pistou -- only fresh cilantro, garlic 
and Parmesan, with lemon juice for the liquid. If you are really watching the 
fat, sprinkle the soup with chopped cilantro instead of the pistou and you will 
save three grams of fat. SHRIMP AND CORN SOUP WITH CILANTRO PISTOU 1 teaspoon 
butter 2 tablespoons minced onion 2 (14-1/2 ounce) cans vegetable broth 2 
chicken bouillon cubes, crushed 2 (8 3/4-ounce) cans cream-style corn 2 
tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water 1 ear corn, roasted, 
cut into 1-inch chunks 1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined Cilantro Pistou 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in large saucepan and saute onion until tender. Stir in vegetable 
broth and bouillon cubes. Stir in cream-style corn and heat to boiling. Stir 
cornstarch slurry into soup. Boil and stir until thickened and clear, 1 to 2 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in cut-up corn and shrimp and continue to simmer until corn is hot and 
shrimp is opaque. Serve with about 1 tablespoon Cilantro Pistou per serving. 
Makes 6 servings.

GOVERNOR'S RACE -- TOUGHER THAN THOU; POINTED CAMPAIGN SOUND BITES ABOUT 
RAPISTS DO NOT MAKE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week both Gov. Pete Wilson and his democratic challenger, Kathleen Brown, 
have pushed the issue of sex crimes to the front and center of their campaigns. 
In this state where "three strikes and you're out" sped through the Legislature 
earlier this year, it is hardly surprising that the tough-on-crime ante is 
easily upped. If "three strikes" is good, wouldn't "one strike" be better, 
especially for such indisputably heinous crimes as rape and child molestation? 
</P>
<P>
 Thus both Brown and Wilson are vowing to get tougher on first-time sex 
offenders. The governor has proposed that first-time convicted rapists be 
sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Brown supports a bill that would 
double the length of sentences for a first offense, which now ranges from three 
to eight years, and imprison for 25 years to life a first-time rapist who used 
a deadly weapon or caused serious injury. That legislation, introduced by Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), passed the Senate in June and now moves to 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of heated press conferences, statements and television commercials 
this week, Brown and Wilson have each accused the other of distortions and 
weakness on this issue. But while the candidates' tougher-than-thou positions 
on first-time rapists make for pointed campaign sound bites, the public policy 
gains such mandatory stiffer sentences for these sex crimes would bring are 
considerably more opaque. Besides, the three-strikes law enacted in March 
counts convictions for rape and child molestation as strikes. Thus California 
has already gotten much tougher on these sex crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 But the three-strikes law, which takes so much discretion away from judges, is 
moving into the criminal justice system the way a mouse moves through a snake. 
District attorneys are already inundated with criminal defendants who, facing 
life imprisonment on a third-strike charge, are requesting a jury trial. Some 
courts are so overloaded with these trials that pending civil matters are being 
postponed. And still, the state has not nearly enough public funds or prison 
space to house convicted third-strike felons for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we add to this one-strike for rapists and sex offenders? Some fear the 
mandatory sentences in such a law would make juries balk at convicting accused 
rapists or, far worse, prompt rapists to kill their victims so as to leave no 
witnesses. We share these concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 Aren't these two highly intelligent candidates running for a job that's far 
broader than sheriff? California has so many other pressing problems; Wilson 
and Brown should be debating them.

MARATHON MAN COMES TO A PERSONAL CROSSROAD; ALTMAN SURVIVES GRUELING 10-HOUR 
HEARING SESSION, BUT . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary -- and the star witness at the 
marathon Senate hearing on Whitewater that went on until the wee hours 
Wednesday morning -- did shave the truth in his previous testimony, he is not 
the first government official appearing before Congress to have done so. Nor 
did many of his inquisitors have very high ground to stand on. Washington 
itself is a caldron of half-truths and compromises where selective use of facts 
and partisan conclusions are often mixed together and presented as 
disinterested findings -- or even as sworn congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) of course is a special case; this 
self-appointed ethics sleuth walks around with his very own ethics cloud 
hovering over him. And Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), while a skilled inquisitor, 
all too clearly relished the opportunity to grill this high-ranking Democrat 
with all those klieg lights and TV cameras illuminating the star witness' 
anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. Such is politics. Altman's real problem is not with overeager 
Republicans but with uncomfortably embarrassed Democrats. They rightly praise 
Altman for all the expertise and talent he brings to government service. But 
several of them have obvious misgivings about his statements on Tuesday, as 
well as his previous testimony in February. The issue is whether the Treasury 
Department improperly conveyed to the White House confidential information 
about the Whitewater probe and what Altman's role in that was. Altman himself 
now acknowledges that his testimony on this score may have been misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Altman now acknowledges that, as a close friend of President Bill 
Clinton, he should have quickly withdrawn as acting head of the Resolution 
Trust Corp. as soon as federal investigators there began their probe into the 
failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, putting both the No. 2 Treasury job and the RTC oversight job into 
the hands of the same public official was bad public policy. Now it is turning 
into a serious political problem for Altman and fellow Democrats. Congress as 
an institution has the easiest part to play here. A new RTC head needs to be 
confirmed. John Ryan, the agency's deputy head and now the acting chief 
executive officer, should be formally nominated to head the RTC, even though it 
is scheduled to go out of business on Dec. 31, 1995. Until then it still needs 
a full-time head. Treasury officials, by law, have an oversight role over the 
RTC; that should be confined to basic oversight -- not turned into day-to-day 
supervision. Senate confirmation of the new RTC director should occur quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 For Altman's part, evidence of a real crime is just not there -- or at least 
no one has found it yet. But as Altman now admits, his earlier testimony to 
Congress had been "too narrow and perhaps incomplete." He had to endure a 
grueling 10-hour hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee, and he did that with some aplomb, considering the circumstances. But 
it may be that Altman will conclude that his ability to relate to Congress has 
been compromised by its perception that he has been, at best, less than candid; 
and that an impaired deputy Treasury secretary is of marginal utility to the 
President and the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If Altman does reach this conclusion, President Clinton should have little 
trouble finding another important assignment for this talented man -- nor 
should private industry, should he wish to return to it.

ISLAM AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Milton Viorst's column, "A Witch Hunt in the Name of Allah" (Commentary, 
July 19), is so filled with ill-defined terms, misstatements of fact and 
distortions about Islam it is hard to know where to begin in reply. Viorst 
throws around the usual terms, such as "fundamentalist," "fanatic" and 
"extremist," often used by those in opposition to Islamic participation in 
political decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure that if pressed, Viorst would have a hard time defining these terms 
without defining practicing Muslims. That lack of definition is at the heart of 
most attacks on Islam. Pundits such as Viorst divide the Islamic world into two 
camps. "Moderate" Muslims are those who shut up, accept the wholesale 
Westernization of their societies, and acquiesce to the perpetual authoritarian 
rule of Western-oriented regimes. The "fundamentalist" Muslims are those who 
speak out against this process and try to do something about it. Since peaceful 
dissent of the type Americans take for granted is largely banned in these 
areas, a frustrated and misguided minority of Muslim activists react with 
un-Islamic acts of violence, giving writers like Viorst more ammunition for 
their smear campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Viorst and his fellow alarmists also like to claim that "fundamentalist" 
Muslims are only using religion as a path to political power. They say this as 
if there were any Muslim scholars or thinkers throughout the 14 centuries since 
the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) who advised separating Islamic 
principles and morality from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the rise of repressive post-colonial regimes, even the most corrupt 
rulers of Muslim peoples did not advocate this separation. It was only with the 
power and support of the Western and former Eastern blocs that this division 
began to take place. Those groups and individuals who adopted some form of 
foreign ideology were promoted as proxies in the Muslim world. Those who wished 
to hold on to their cultural and religious traditions were suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic reawakening's aim is not, as Viorst claims, "to stifle any 
challenge to orthodoxy, any loosening of the cultural status quo." Instead, 
committed Muslims, who have witnessed the tragic consequences of secularism, 
communism and materialism in Muslim lands, seek to re-establish a society based 
on the unchanging Islamic values of justice, equality and mutual consultation. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of Islam's supposed hostility to democracy is also a favorite of 
writers like Viorst who claim Islamists will "suppress democracy as soon as 
they take over." In fact, when Muslim groups have been given the chance to take 
part in multi-party politics in places like Jordan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Yemen 
and Turkey, they proved to be able campaigners who accept the outcome of 
elections. It is only when Islam is locked out of the political system that 
problems occur.

 * I was exceedingly pleased to read the comments of four randomly selected men 
and women on the Platform topic of "South-Central: Are Whites' Fears 
Justified?" (Voices, July 18). 
</P>
<P>
 They all agreed in their responses that there is a false perception of our

</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the Los Angeles Police Department statistics show that there 
is no safer place in the city than the Exposition Park area when there is an 
event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or Sports Arena. Fans can expect 
significant law enforcement personnel and customer assistance personnel on duty 
at Raiders and USC football at the Coliseum, Clippers and USC basketball at the 
Sports Arena and special events at those facilities and in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 With the forthcoming reopening of a virtually new Los Angeles Coliseum, we 
encourage people from all over the Los Angeles area to come to our sports and 
entertainment facilities and museums in Exposition Park and see for themselves 
that it's a safe and exciting place to be.

<P>
 * Re "Jackson Calls TV Racist, Urges Action," July 26: 
</P>
<P>
 As I sometimes play the "channel game" when seeking what I consider to be the 
most interesting among the networks at the 5 p.m. news hour, I have been very 
much aware of the absence of African American anchors on all of them. As a 
matter of fact, except for the weekend, there is only one news anchor and that 
is the award-winning Pat Harvey on Channel 5.This fact is clearly noticeable to 
anyone who is observant, and to me, an African American, it fairly jumps out. I 
confess to being not only insulted by this lack of sensitivity on the part of 
television news, but to finding it altogether incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to protest the cancellation of some black-oriented sitcoms seems 
without any logical or legitimate foundation. Even I know that the name of the 
game is money. Do those programs that are being canceled generate enough 
revenue to satisfy the sponsors? Do they generate enough revenue to pay the 
salaries of the actors, writers, crew, et al.? Probably not, I'm sure. Should 
the sponsors continue to carry those shows for charitable reasons? Perish the 
thought! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be fair. I believe the object is recognition for the products 
represented, which most certainly translates into money.

 * Regarding the Rev. Jesse Jackson's press conference charging racism in the 
media: Nothing was mentioned about the very low ratings of the discontinued 
black-oriented TV shows. They were canceled because too few people were 
watching! Plenty of "white" shows have suffered the same fate when they did not 
generate enough income for their networks.

TEACHING CREATIONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial, "Teach Science as Science" (July 27), concerning John 
Peloza's attempt to teach creationism to biology students, was excellent, but 
it overlooked a critical point. Peloza and his ilk would have everyone believe 
that evolution and creationism are competing scientific theories. But, while 
refusing in the face of overwhelming evidence to acknowledge that evolution is 
a fact, they offer no evidence that creationism is even a theory. 
</P>
<P>
 A theory is a proposition for which there may be insufficient proof but which 
nonetheless has a functional scientific application. There is no evidence 
whatsoever for creationism and it has no such application. The authority for 
the creationist's belief is the Bible, and the Bible is not a science text. The 
place in the public schools for creationism, if indeed it deserves a place at 
all, is in a lesson on world religions and their concomitant myths. 
</P>
<P>
 MAGGIE DOUGLAS 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield 
</P>
<P>
 * I object to your premise that evolution as an explanation for the origin of 
man is more than theory. Since no "missing link" has been found, science has 
offered no proof of its validity. And new discoveries in Asia have once again 
challenged existing theories of evolution. Science is not infallible. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion may not belong in schools. But creationism has its evidence, and as 
the belief of millions of people of faith it deserves more than dismissal as 
merely another "wild-card idea" as you suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 The two theories may not even be mutually exclusive. Until we have proof, I 
suggest we keep our minds open to both possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDICE CETRONE

</P>
<P>
 * I want to take exception to your editorial. I think your side as stated 
smacks of dogma just as much as much as John Peloza's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists admit that evolution is a theory and not a proven fact. Also, 
science is always changing. If the theory of relativity had not changed 
Newton's laws of motion, we would never had gotten to the moon. 
</P>

 The point in this should not be evolution versus creationism, but whether the

students there are other theories that are not as well accepted as evolution as 
long as he doesn't try to convert them to a religion.

 In her letter of July 20, Brenda R. Martin chastises Gov. Wilson, accusing him 
of being a "closet liberal."She bases this charge solely on the fact that 
Wilson opposes an anti-abortion plank for the Republican Party platform. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a perfect example of what is wrong with politics nowadays. We are more 
concerned with slapping labels on people based on one position, one vote, one 
speech, or one issue, than we are with honestly examining the whole package. 
</P>
<P>
 I am still not supporting Pete Wilson, but it is certainly not due to his 
stance on abortion.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH-CARE REFORM; THE ODD JARGON OF THE 95% PROMISE; THE NEW 
BUZZWORD IS TRIGGER, A DEVICE TO FORCE FULL COVERAGE AT SOME LATER DATE, 
LETTING THIS CONGRESS OFF THE HOOK.

<P>
 The health-care reform plan proposed Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell reflects Mitchell's political dilemmas. He knows he can't muster 
enough votes in the Senate to approve either the President's original bill or 
the bill likely to pass the House of Representatives. And he believes, sadly 
but accurately, that if he doesn't get a bill out of the Senate, the reform 
process will expire for this year or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, he has looked for mechanisms that balance his desire for 
universal coverage and cost containment with political reality -- and hopes his 
package can be strengthened on the Senate floor or in conference with the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the mechanisms he has turned to is -- in the jargon of the moment -- a 
"trigger." The debate about health care reform has in fact been filled with 
enough jargon to make a tax lawyer jealous. Lexicological inventions arise, 
briefly take center stage and then are struck from the script. Recall, for 
instance, "health insurance purchasing cooperatives" (renamed "health 
alliances"), "mandatory health alliances" (made voluntary) and "premium caps" 
(doffed). "Trigger" is the latest term of art, and lurking behind it is an 
important but little noted paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic notion of a trigger is this: If some specified outcome is not 
achieved by a particular date (for example, health-insurance coverage for 95% 
of Americans by 2000) as a result of modest steps (say, reforms of insurance 
practices), then some other measure -- presumably with a better chance of 
achieving the desired outcome -- would kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 If that measure is tough (imposition of an employer mandate or a payroll tax), 
the provision is a "hard trigger." This is a clear decision to do something 
later, subject to a firm and quantified condition. If carefully crafted, it can 
be a credible means to a desired end. 
</P>
<P>
 If the triggered measure is less forceful (say, the creation of a commission 
to make some future recommendations to Congress), we are looking at a "soft 
trigger." This is the legislative equivalent of a mirage. Of what use is it to 
say that Congress might decide to do something unspecified five years from now? 
Such a trigger is a trick that doesn't bind a future Congress to anything of 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of variants have already been invented, leading one congressional 
aide last week to refer to a provision as a "semi-soft trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills that will be debated in Congress beginning next week -- Mitchell's 
in the Senate and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's in the House -- include 
triggers of mixed lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Senate bill, if by 2000 a combination of incremental measures and 
subsidies has not produced 95% coverage, an employer mandate would be triggered 
-- unless Congress approved other steps recommended by a national commission. 
In the case of the House bill, a trigger would apply to the achievement of cost 
control. If in the year 2000 spending targets were exceeded in any state, a 
system of cost containment modeled on current Medicare payment methods would go 
into effect for that state -- unless Congress approved some other strategy 
conceived by a commission. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what their particulars, triggers generate a political paradox. 
Consider the Mitchell trigger: If the various reforms and subsidies that the 
bill envisions were successful in achieving their objective of 95% coverage, 
there would be no employer mandate. If, on the other hand, coverage did not 
reach 95%, a mandate could be imposed. Hence, advocates of universal coverage 
have an incentive to weaken the bill's initial measures: The less effective 
they are, the greater the likelihood of a mandate (and universal coverage). 
Those who oppose an employer mandate could be motivated to pass the strongest 
possible measures short of a mandate, to reduce the probability that a mandate 
would be triggered. All of this should make for fascinating political 
maneuvering in the next fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, why 95%? It is, of course, the level of coverage that President 
Clinton recently told the governors would satisfy his insistence on universal 
coverage -- even though it falls short of universality. And now it is the level 
of coverage that is apparently emerging, at least in the Senate, as an 
acceptable approximation of universality. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any reason to suppose that 95% is about the best we can do? 
Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
 When we look at the experience of other advanced industrialized countries that 
have aimed at universal coverage -- which is to say, virtually all of them -- 
what we find is that most of them come so close that the shortfall is little 
more than a rounding error. Those that come up shorter still achieve coverage 
of at least 98% (for example 99.5% in France, 98% in Germany, 99.9% in the 
Netherlands, 99% in Spain, 98% in Switzerland and 99.5% in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 What these numbers ought to make clear is that the United States, where less 
than 85% of the population has health coverage, ought to be more ambitious. We 
ought to try to do at least as well as the least successful of our peers -- and 
if we can do it without the artifice of a trigger, so much the better.

COLUMN LEFT/ ERIC MANN: THE WORKERS DIDN'T UNITE AND MTA WON; BY KEEPING SILENT 
ABOUT FARE HIKES, THE UNIONS LOST BUS-RIDING WORKING PEOPLE AS ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MANN, Eric Mann, who spent 12 years as a member of the Service 
Employees International Union and the United Auto Workers, is director of the 
Labor/Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The MTA strike was a tragic example of a labor movement in free-fall, with 
union goals no more lofty than "keeping our jobs," no strategy to transform 
union self-interest into a community concern and a return to work on 
management's terms. The strike was provoked by an MTA board dominated by the 
privatizing, union-busting agendas of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, with the support of alleged liberals and 
advocates for working people. 
</P>
<P>
 Management's short-term objectives were to paint union workers as overpaid 
featherbedders and to divert more bus lines to the lower-wage privateer, 
Foothill Transit. The long-term goal is to turn the MTA into a $3 
billion-a-year dispenser of contracts to private firms and to turn Los Angeles 
into an even lower-wage company town in which everything -- from bus contracts 
to the library to the airport -- is for sale to the corporate rich. 
</P>
<P>
 This naked class interest was clothed in moralizing about "saving the 
taxpayers' money" by a board that routinely costs the public hundreds of 
millions a year with costly rail projects built by their campaign contributors 
and business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's privatization strategy demanded an ideological response from the 
transit unions, arguing that an expanded public sector can subsidize beneficial 
goals, from higher wages that create an upward pull on wage rates for all 
workers to lower bus fares that increase working people's mobility and 
disposable income. But that assumes that the unions embrace the rudiments of 
class struggle, whereas at the MTA and throughout the country, it is only the 
wealthy who understand class and struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the strike, the MTA board handed the unions a golden opportunity 
by raising bus fares and eliminating bus passes for working people. Since the 
MTA's ads argued that $18 an hour for a worker was somewhere between a 
misdemeanor and a felony, the unions could have taken a stand against the fare 
increases and allied with an overwhelmingly Latino, black and Asian bus 
ridership that earns an average of less than $15,000 a year. Instead, the 
unions were virtually silent, a calculated decision to avoid further 
antagonizing the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine our dilemma on the first day of the strike as more than 50 activists 
from the Strategy Center's Bus Riders Union tried to explain "labor solidarity" 
to stranded riders who asked how we could support the unions after they had 
sold out the passengers. We replied that we could not abandon the fight for the 
principle of no contracting out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unions were not fighting for the principle; their contracts already 
allowed it. The real "fight" was over 26 privatized bus lines versus 13 and how 
many mechanics' jobs would be affected. Worse, the contract establishes a 
chilling precedent in which graffiti removal from buses can be done "by 
governmental agencies such as a youth project, probation or sentencing program 
or court referral." Why didn't the unions portray the specter of the MTA 
subcontracting to the sheriff to replace $15-an-hour graffiti removers with 
court-remanded work gangs -- perhaps followed by mechanics and, someday, bus 
drivers?  
</P>
<P>
 Even the union's "victory" in getting the MTA to rehire the 63 mechanics laid 
off just before the strike is Pyrrhic. The MTA agreed to hire back those 
mechanics by July, 1996, when the attrition rate for the almost 1,900 mechanics 
will be far higher. Meanwhile, the strike will permanently reduce ridership by 
at least 5%, and the September fare hikes will reduce ridership by another 7%. 
By not working with transit-advocacy groups against the fare increases, the 
unions have essentially granted the MTA a license for a spiraling reduction of 
ridership and work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The final balance sheet: a two-tiered wage system in which new hires come in 
at 80% of past wages, 13 newly contracted-out bus lines, court remanded workers 
cleaning the buses and reduced bus ridership and union jobs. It's a major 
victory for the MTA board; a painful defeat for labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bus Riders' Union is trying to reverse the proposed $1.35 fare and replace 
it with a permanent 50-cent fare and $20-per-month bus pass. (The 50-cent fare 
was enacted temporarily by the MTA during the strike.) A 50-cent fare would 
dramatically increase bus ridership, generate new jobs for union members and 
provide better access to jobs for the working class. Will the MTA workers learn 
from the strike and embrace a labor/community strategy for the entire working 
class? Or will they regress to narrow craft unionism while Riordan and Co. are 
planning the next round of privatization?

MUSIC REVIEW; A SURPRISE DEBUT WITH PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Jahja Ling. Remember it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, local concert-goers with a dauntless penchant for distant trivia may 
already know the name. Ling was one of the conducting students -- they called 
them fellows -- at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute back in 1982. As part 
of that worthy program, now a thing of the lamented past, he led his youthful 
colleagues in some Mahler and Brahms at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After further education at Yale and Juilliard, the maestro -- an Indonesian of 
Chinese descent -- moved to a secondary position under Christoph von Dohnanyi 
with the mighty Cleveland Orchestra. For the past six seasons he also has led 
the Florida Orchestra in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected to see him conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the 
first time at Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday. But our orchestra, which no longer 
deems an assistant- or associate-conductor a necessity, found itself in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo Rizzi was supposed to make his podium debut on this occasion. According 
to the official explanation, however, he was "unable to appear for family 
reasons." Translation: Back in Italy, his wife was about to give birth; 
understandably, Rizzi didn't want to leave her side. 
</P>
<P>
 Ling, now 42, flew in to save the night, even though tight summer-scheduling 
allowed only one rehearsal. He saved the night calmly, and with honor. 
</P>
<P>
 He retained the first half of the program as set up for Rizzi, conducting 
Bizet's Petite Suite from "Jeux d'enfants" and accompanying Alexander Treger in 
Saint-Saens' Third Violin Concerto. After intermission, he took the liberty -- 
a liberty both pardonable and gratifying -- of substituting Tchaikovsky's 
"Little Russian" Symphony (No. 2) for his "Winter Dreams" (No. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 It will take further exposure in extrovert repertory to ascertain whether Ling 
is a bona-fide personality conductor or just a tasteful stylist and a highly 
competent technician. With the somewhat limited, relatively unhackneyed 
challenges at hand, one had to be grateful for his obvious and considerable 
virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgetting fuss and fanfare, he outlined Bizet's fragile caractere pieces with 
charm and elegance, even with subtle wit that somehow failed to evaporate in 
vast open spaces and the cool night air. In the Tchaikovsky symphony -- 
possibly the composer's least gooey -- Ling capitalized on expressive 
restraint, crisp articulation, dynamic variety and rhythmic propulsion. It was 
lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 In the potentially sugary Saint-Saens concerto, he provided a suitably 
radiant, properly pliant orchestral frame, breathing with the admirably 
long-winded soloist while avoiding any traps of sentimental excess. Treger, a 
Philharmonic concertmaster since 1985, made much of his moment in the moon, 
playing with extraordinary ease, elastic grace, purity of tone and security of 
intonation. This was the sort of performance that makes second-rate music sound 
first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The busy Philharmonic players, who always seem to perform best under difficult 
conditions, sounded as if they had been doing nothing for weeks but preparing 
for this particular concert. Ling was lucky to have them, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Someone must have been been twiddling the knobs and shuffling the 
microphones, because the amplified sound was vastly improved on this occasion: 
better presence, heightened brilliance, more realistic balances. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those in the audience willing to pay 50 cents for a program magazine were 
informed via an insert slip that there would be a change in conductor and 
symphony. The management did not deem it worthwhile to impart this information 
to the others in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concert attracted a comparatively modest crowd officially tabulated at 
7,092, and a comparatively modest number of aeronautical intrusions: three. But 
what happened to those vaunted warning beacons? 
</P>
<P>
 * George Cleve, music-director laureate of the San Jose Symphony, is scheduled 
to make his Philharmonic debut tonight in place of Rizzi. Andre Watts will play 
the Second Rachmaninoff Concerto as scheduled. The remainder of the program 
will be changed to include Mozart's "Zauberflote" overture and Brahms' Fourth 
Symphony.

'GIN GAME' DISTILLS WRY HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D.L. Coburn's "The Gin Game" belongs in a small theater. It needs an intimacy 
that brings the viewer right next to the table at which Weller Martin and 
Fonsia Dorsey play out their unremarkable lives through the game of Hollywood 
gin, in the garden of Bentley Manor, an early-'30s old-folks home in Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 The game echoes their lives, their lives echo the game, and the closer one is, 
the clearer is the playwright's metaphor. And his intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Closeness is one of the advantages in the Ensemble Theatre production of 
Coburn's play. Weller's anger is in your face; his desperation over a life 
wasted, for which he accepts no responsibility, is on your lap. Fonsia's prim 
self-righteousness is there too, as near as if you were sitting at the card 
table with them. So is her own anger as her facade crumbles under the heavy 
blows of Weller's irascibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Herman Boodman takes advantage of the space to keep his actors of a 
size that is realistic while still allowing them room to expand when the script 
calls for it. He also knows that Weller and Fonsia's bittersweet battle has 
more laughs than two Neil Simon plays put together, and that they all are built 
out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Jordan LaRue is very good as Fonsia, but one never gets past the fact 
that she is acting. Her slight Southern accent seems just a bit like a coat 
she's put on, and there are moments when her actions play at elderly rather 
than being elderly. When LaRue forgets these trappings and gets into Fonsia's 
soul, she is effective and touching. 
</P>
<P>
 James Dolan is much more solid with his intricate and beautifully shaded 
performance as Weller. Dolan measures the size and force of Weller's vulgarity 
with care, and at the same time never lets the viewer free of sympathy for the 
man's plight. He also knows how to build a laugh and how to surprise an 
audience while doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting, designed by Boodman and Roosevelt Blankenship Jr., places the 
action where it should be without intruding on the attention the drama 
requires. The uncredited period costumes are just right, particularly one of 
Fonsia's dresses, a leftover from the '20s but still her best dress.

 New 'Romeo' Production: The San Francisco Ballet will make its first Southern 
California appearance since 1991 when it performs Helgi Tomasson's new 
production of "Romeo & Juliet" at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
Nov. 30 through Dec. 4. The company's last local stand was a "Nutcracker" 
holiday engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The group 
announced a self-presented engagement at the Music Center in 1993 but withdrew 
for financial reasons. Dance impresario James A. Doolittle will present the 
upcoming "Romeo & Juliet" performances, which will mark the company's first 
appearance at the Music Center since 1984.

 Cliburn Tour Plans in Doubt: The death Wednesday morning of Van Cliburn's 
97-year-old mother has placed the remainder of the pianist's cross-country tour 
in doubt. Cliburn, 60, whose tour with the Moscow Philharmonic had already been 
plagued by sickness, program changes and cancellations, appeared with the 
orchestra at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City Tuesday night, 
winning applause and giving two encores. Then he flew immediately to his ailing 
mother's home in Fort Worth, reaching Rildia Bee Cliburn's bedside in time to 
see her before she died. Meanwhile, Cliburn still has several tour stops 
scheduled -- outside Rochester, N.Y.; in Pittsburgh, Detroit, Minneapolis, 
Milwaukee, Atlanta, and at the Wolf Trap Farm in Virginia. As of Wednesday, no 
decision had been made whether Cliburn will finish the tour, his first in 16 
years. TV & RADIO

 Stern Ruling: New York's State Supreme Court has refused to grant raunchy 
radio host Howard Stern a preliminary injunction against a law requiring 
political candidates to file a detailed financial disclosure form with the 
state to determine possible conflicts of interest. Stern, who is running for 
governor on the Libertarian ticket, has sued the Ethics Commission that 
enforces the law, contending it is unconstitutional to require disclosure 
before someone is elected. "It is especially invasive to someone like me who 
lives a highly visible life," he said in court papers. Stern plans to hold an 
on-air "news conference" on his radio show this morning to discuss the ruling.

 Reward Offered: German insurers have offered a $250,000 reward for two 
paintings by 19th-Century English artist J.M.W. Turner and one by German 
painter Caspar David Friedrich that were stolen from a Frankfurt gallery last 
week. The paintings, snatched by two masked men who overpowered a security 
guard just after the gallery closed, were insured for $42 million. The two 
Turners were on loan from London's Tate Gallery, which termed the robbery a 
"major loss" for European art. The works had been on display since May in an 
exhibition of 19th-Century painters who influenced the great German writer 
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. QUICK TAKES

THEATER REVIEW; 'TEXAS TRINITY' CAPTURES NUANCES OF A SMALL TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor, raconteur, dancer and chatterbox extraordinaire, Paul Bonin-Rodriguez 
displays many talents in "The Texas Trinity," his anthology of three solo 
performance pieces about a repressed, isolated homosexual growing up in a small 
Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
 But he makes his deepest impression as a writer with a keen eye for the quirks 
and incidentals that evoke the fabric of life in a parochial, narrow-minded 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 His mythical Cedar Springs abounds with lively, eccentric personalities, not 
the least of which is his fictional alter ego, Johnny Hobson -- an effeminate 
loner who spends his youth enduring the taunts of the local townsfolk, working 
at the local Dairy Queen and dreaming of a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 In less capable hands, the premise could easily become a recipe for the 
self-pity and elitism to which gay-themed performance art, saddled with the 
built-in hyper defensiveness of a reviled minority, can be particularly 
susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonin-Rodriguez understands the difference between a stage and a soapbox, 
serving as narrator rather than commentator and allowing his perceptions and 
insights into homophobia, religious dogma, sexuality, friendship and racial 
intolerance to emerge organically from his often hilarious and sometimes 
heartbreaking stories. 
</P>
<P>
 His protagonist Johnny is an appealing combination of sensitivity, 
intelligence and goofy naivete, and Bonin-Rodriguez isn't afraid to let him 
make a fool of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny cluelessly wrestles with the implications of his sexual orientation 
throughout much of the first piece, "Talk of the Town." The narrative pivots on 
a fifth-grade incident in which his compassion for a troubled friend leads to a 
playground embrace, making him the butt of malicious gossip. In a fierce 
confrontation with his mother, the accusation that her boyfriend pastor called 
things off because "he didn't want you for a son" provokes a defining moment of 
self-assertion for Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling further down that road toward accepting his own nature in Part II, 
"Bible Belt," Johnny joins forces with two fellow social outcasts -- his rowdy 
Chicana high school classmate and their feisty home economics teacher. The two 
main stories about Johnny's discovery of his hidden talents as a designer and 
the increasingly bullying tactics of a religious fundamentalist group converge 
marvelously in Johnny's unique act of defiance, arriving at school wearing the 
combined political and fashion statement that gives the segment its title. 
</P>
<P>
 In Part III, "Love in the Time of College," Johnny leaves Cedar Springs for 
the sprawling university in Austin. His country-mouse-in-the-city odyssey takes 
some disturbing turns before he links up with a community of other gays and 
finds true love. This sequence is the most tightly focused on the homosexual 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout "The Texas Trilogy," Bonin-Rodriguez struggles with the insularity 
of his gay-themed focus, at his best broadening the playing field to embrace a 
universal support for the courage to stand up for one's identity despite 
enormous social pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most effective are the reflective passages of extraordinary poetic clarity 
that weave the disparate fragments of episodic details into a summing-up of 
life processes. In this regard, Part III is the least successful, perhaps 
because the author hasn't yet found the distance to present that stage of life 
in a context. Part II, on the other hand, is the best written and also has the 
broadest appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its accomplishments, the breadth and depth of the entire opus doesn't 
measure up to its six-hour length. Audiences get much of the same experience 
from each installment, and, after sitting through all three, Highways starts to 
seem a lot like Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Texas Trinity," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. Part I: tonight 
at 8:30; Part II: tomorrow, 8:30 p.m.; Part III: Saturday, 8:30 p.m.; Parts

'FRAGILE ECOLOGIES': A TOUCH OF GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Humankind has made a mess of the planet. It's so bad some artists feel they 
can't go on doing business as usual. Working as individuals or in teams they 
blend aesthetic insight with the sensitivity of landscape architects and the 
conservationists' conviction that the real world must be acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of this dedication to Mother Earth can be seen in "Fragile Ecologies: 
Contemporary Artists' Interpretations and Solutions" at the Laguna Museum of 
Art. Organized by the Queens Museum of Art, it's on national tour under the 
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the show may give some art lovers a headache. These days they go 
to galleries to get in touch with the higher muse and find themselves faced 
with callow preachments on the evils of society. They can rest assured that 
this exhibition doesn't work like that. Somehow the idealism that drives it 
makes it feel as sweetly pastoral as a Claude Lorrain landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it's sentimental. One of the nicest bits in it is a meandering row of 
television sets. Resting on the floor, their screens face upward filled with 
the waters of a babbling river. The sound is soothing, the reflections 
enchanting even if the whole thing is made of videotape. Where can this lovely 
place be?  
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, it's the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 video artist Cheri Gaulke teamed up with Susan Barron who heads a 
special program for seniors at Wilson High School. Working with students they 
launched "L.A. River Project." The kids found patches of thriving life along 
the course of the famously dry bed. They came up with visionary but workable 
plans to turn this sinkhole into an Edenic park. They learned that sometimes a 
drawing is a thing of beauty in itself, sometimes a plan to improve reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison is certainly the best 
known of Eco-Art practitioners. As far back as the '70s they combined the 
growing fashion for conceptual art with earthworks projects like those of 
Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer) and, of course, Christo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971 their ideas were so new they got the artists in trouble. As part of an 
exhibition at London's Hayward Gallery they intended to celebrate nature by 
cooking up some real catfish that were part of their piece. The tabloid press 
exploited the idea. English animal lovers panicked. A scandal ensued. It was 
finally sorted out, but the incident was traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their present piece is mellower. Titled "Breathing Space for the Sava River," 
it follows the course of a Yugoslavian stream using maps, text and particularly 
lovely color photographs. The combination makes the waterway seem like a living 
thing. It's a world in itself, supporting aquatic life. It's also on a journey, 
dispensing goodness along the route, nourishment for land and people, power for 
dams and beauty for all. It's also a great place for people to dump stuff. 
That's how we repay its kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Buster Simpson is as worried as everybody else but he tries to lighten 
up a bit. In one project he tried to help the Hudson River by giving it giant 
Tums. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that when we are not polluting nature we are smothering it. Who needs 
a park when you can build a nice parking lot? 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Alan Sonfist tried to convince New Yorkers that all the trees in town 
shouldn't be imprisoned in Central Park. He planted a nice little urban forest 
of native trees in Greenwich Village. Mierle Laderman Ukeles took another tack. 
She accepted the unlikely post of artist-in-residence at the New York City 
Department of Sanitation to push her ideas on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, all of this sounds rather familiar. Assemblage artists have been 
reclaiming the effluvium of American consumerism for decades. There is a 
wonderful, dippy, quixotic, utopianism about this work and the way it flies so 
cheerfully and earnestly in the face of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Johanson managed to save a sick lagoon in Dallas. Nancy Holt thinks 
urban life, packaged food and artificial light have made us forget the crucial 
role of the sun. To remedy this she's building Dark Star Park in Virginia. Its 
centerpiece will be a pyramid-style mound on a 57-acre site made of 10 million 
tons of garbage. Artist Mel Chin uses plants to clean up toxic wastes. Up in 
central California, Heather McGill and John Roloff are hard at work on a shrine 
and habitat for indigenous hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these notions are poetically appealing on paper. Artists being 
notoriously reclusive and anti-authoritarian by stereotype could not be blamed 
for leaving them as conceptual fantasies. But all try to make them real. They 
talk to experts. They joust with bureaucrats. Anyone who's ever tried to get a 
simple building permit knows that takes a lot of courage. 
</P>

ART REVIEWS; MANN CAPTURES THE IMAGES OF CHILDHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sally Mann's photographs of her three, pre-teen - age kids vividly describe 
what it's like to be a child. In a dozen black-and- white pictures at G. Ray 
Hawkins Gallery, contradictions run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Playful games of dress-up contrast with touching images of absolute 
unself-consciousness. A solitary child's rich fantasy life reverberates against 
utter alienation. A little girl's absorption in the present plays off another's 
isolation from the world, which appears to be an inhospitable, adult place that 
is impossible to join and futile to try to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the emotions that accompany and define childhood are given crisp 
visual form in Mann's accomplished photographs. The bliss of sleep, the pain of 
fisticuffs, the fear of rejection, the comfort of a warm lap and the 
self-consuming rage over nothing in particular take shape in her highly 
perceptive, carefully composed and meticulously printed images. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's art also offers a sensitive study of what it's like to be a mother. The 
expanded subject of her exquisite family pictures is her own evolving 
relationship with Emmett, Jessie and Virginia, accompanied by all the 
expectations and trepidation a mother brings to the lives of her kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy shared between Mann and her children is clearest in "The New 
Mothers," which depicts her daughters taking their dolls for a walk. Having 
just had their role-playing interrupted by their nosy, intrusive mother, the 
older girl throws a powerfully contemptuous and prematurely jaded look back at 
Mann. Jessie's expression and body language seem to say, "Cut the dumb fantasy 
stuff, Mom. We've got more important things to do than be your cute little 
playthings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's strongest photographs lack the saccharine sentimentality that sometimes 
suffuses her sweet, overly romanticized and painstakingly staged images. The 
pictures that emphasize the autonomy of the kids and the unbridgeable distance 
that separates their interior lives from their mother's control are the most 
psychologically charged. "Damaged Child," "Jessie at Six" and "At the 
Preacher's House" are exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they open the issue of the innate sexuality of children. 
Mann's most memorable photographs fly in the face of the outdated adult fantasy 
that pre-pubescent kids are angelic, asexual creatures. These images are 
remarkable because they beautifully demonstrate that being pure and innocent 
has nothing to do with being sexless. 
</P>
<P>
 An undertow of animal sensuality tugs at "Hayhook," in which a group of adults 
is oblivious to the nude girl using the hook as a trapeze. Mann's pictures, in 
which her nude children strike grown-up poses, recall the role reversals in 
"The New Mothers." Her precocious kids imitate adults not to be more like us, 
but to emphasize that their own world is no more naive or sheltered than ours. 
</P>
<P>
 * G. Ray Hawkins Gallery, 908 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, (310) 394-5558, 
through Sept. 3. Closed Sundays and Mondays. * 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Diversions: "The Green Show," a hit-or-miss group exhibition at the 
Bradbury Building (which occasionally hosts exhibits) proposes that art is like 
a city park. Both provide momentary respite from the hustle-and-bustle of 
downtown life, injecting some natural color and a bit of cultivated landscaping 
into an environment of smog, steel, glass and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Adest, Lynn Aldrich and Laura Cooper use plants to make temporary 
sculptures. Adest's two, 60-foot strips of wheat grass border a path that runs 
from the lobby to the rear courtyard. Her miniature hedges entice passersby to 
depart from their walk to the parking structure and to relax among the other, 
color-coordinated works. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hammett's labyrinth of creamy cake frosting slathered over stretcher bars 
echoes the idea that falling off-track -- or getting lost -- is as worthwhile 
as traveling directly to your destination. His aggressively decorative icing 
smells as good as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's most mesmerizing works short-circuit your ability to locate their 
surfaces. Pae White's thick, shiny slab of forest green plexiglass laid on the 
floor pulls your body toward its illusory depths. Fandra Chang's multi-part, 
multilayered screen print maddeningly prevents you from knowing where one plane 
ends and the next begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither subtle nor reticent, John Millei's "Wall Flower" is a juicy offshoot 
of culture's collision with nature. His compact painting looks like a cross 
between Warhol's silk-screened floral arrangements and a colorful submarine's 
propellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Goldwhite, Nick Taggart and Paul Tzanetopoulos each contribute quirky, 
playful pieces, while the paintings, sculptures and photographs by Richard 
Haga, Daniel Marlos, Steve Roden and Barbara Strasen are too illustrative to be 
engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 In curating the show for Myth, a Los Angeles artists' collective, Wendy Adest 
and Dagmar Demming wisely did not attempt to compete with the Bradbury 
Building's magnificent interior, whose ornate metalwork, handsome balustrades 
and exposed elevators are splendid works of art themselves. This summery show 
plays along with Art Nouveau's love of artifice, mixing nature and culture in 
tasteful hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bradbury Building, 304 S. Broadway, Biddy Mason Park Entrance, (213) 
222-0013, through Aug. 20. Closed Saturdays and Sundays. * 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle Pleasures: Maturity and freshness dovetail in a group exhibition at 
Kiyo Higashi Gallery. The show's checklist, a grab bag of gallery regulars and 
one newcomer, sounds like more-of-the-same but provides a few little twists to 
make the familiar look different. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bell, who designed the gallery, is represented by one of his trademark 
glass cubes from 1967. Measuring only four inches on a side, it's more 
precious, jewel-like and endearing than his typical high-tech conflations of 
opacity, transparency, shifting reflections and penetrating clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of 18 wide-angle photographs of Bell's friends playing poker 
humorously casts the formal issues for which his sculptures are known in terms 
of a card game: Bluffing and luck raise the same questions about illusions and 
reality that Bell's semitranslucent works address. 
</P>
<P>
 Lies Kraal's modestly scaled, powdery blue painting is the high point of the 
show. Its deep azure surface seems to burn into the gallery wall and to 
emblazon itself on your retinas. Like an after-image, Kraal's potent monochrome 
commands your attention by appearing to dematerialize before your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two strong paintings on wood by New York-based Michael Rouillard mark his L.A. 
debut. Like Kraal's time-consuming abstraction, Rouillard's bare images forgo 
eye-grabbing theatrics in favor of slow visual seduction. Their quiet pleasures 
accumulate -- and intensify -- over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Cole's dark painting is a densely knitted web of thousands of threadlike 
brush strokes. Its palpable tension contrasts radically with William Dwyer's 
open steel bands, welded to form an empty, 3-D grid. This odd pair of hard-edge 
abstractions rounds out a standard summer show in which slight surprises 
satisfy. 
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEWS; A PAIR OF CBS PREMIERES: A CASE OF PURE SUMMER LITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a top-flight forensics examiner, Cheryl Ladd immediately distinguishes 
herself from her less leggy TV predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't even mention my dead body," she assures her date after a hard day's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your body looks anything but dead to me!" quips he. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Klugman, eat -- or maybe that should be carve -- your heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 With "One West Waikiki," writer-producer Glen A. Larson rather transparently 
looks to combine the premises of two of his most successful shows, "Quincy" and 
the Hawaii-set "Magnum, P.I." It's a male-female antagonistic-romantic buddy 
movie of a series, with Ladd examining the corpses that wash up on the Hawaiian 
beaches and her partner-in-crime-solving, Honolulu cop Richard Burgi, helping 
investigate who was at the giving end of the homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's two-hour premiere is ludicrous from the hula girls and car 
explosions in the opening credits to the start of a beautiful friendship 
implied in the final freeze frame. But before she meets her match, Dr. Dawn 
(Holli) Holliday (Ladd) is introduced visiting Hawaii to strike up an old 
romance with a lieutenant boyfriend who's working on a mysterious case. (She 
even gets buck naked with him in the opening scene: Make that "One West 
Ooh-la-la!"). 
</P>
<P>
 When the former flame turns up a "suicide" mere hours after admiring her live 
body, she unofficially takes up his case, with the very begrudging help of Mack 
Wolfe (Burgi). 
</P>
<P>
 And you haven't lived till you've heard the case: Military jets are used to 
fly in young Asian women who were fathered by American servicemen during the 
war; these gals get beautifying plastic surgery and sugar daddies in return for 
donating healthy kidneys to the black market, but are turning up dead in 
droves. Perpetrating this scheme is the owner of an all-female bodyguard 
service, Laura (Julia Nickson), a dragon lady whose sinister haughtiness could 
be straight out of a World War II propaganda picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Asian stereotypes are at least laughable, which can't be said for 
the gratingly jocular, adversarial banter between the two leads. Creator 
Larson, who ought to have known better, has gone foolishly overboard in setting 
Burgi up as a slick, loutish, sexist rogue cop for sensible Ladd to butt heads 
with. Early on Ladd calls Burgi "an arrogant jerk"; by premiere's end, she's 
changed her tune, and we haven't.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I saw Donna Mills do this on 'Knots Landing,' " says one of the fetching 
females in tonight's premiere of "Hotel Malibu," a CBS summer pickup series 
that aspires toward being Aaron Spelling Lite. There's no pier in sight along 
this stretch of beach, but this is definitely Knucklehead's Landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our show opens with three gals in various levels of distress, all of whom will 
soon end up at the titular Best Western wanna-be: There's Stevie (Cheryl 
Pollak), a strong-willed redhead who quits her New York ad agency job to head 
back to L.A. and work at her family-owned hotel. There's Nancy (Romy Walthall), 
the enterprising blonde -- and the aforementioned Donna Mills admirer -- who'll 
scam or sleep with anybody to get a break. And there's Melinda (Jennifer 
Lopez), a wholesome Latina who'd like to get ahead on something besides her 
frequently admired legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for this fresh blood to arrive at the Hotel Malibu are Stevie's 
virtuous mom (Joanna Cassidy, fair-haired these days) and scheming brother 
(John Dye), who together are planning to sell the hotel, for very opposite 
reasons. Also on board is earnest bartender Harry (Harry O'Reilly), who strikes 
a romantic spark with Stevie in a broken-down service elevator and lets loose 
hint of the dastardly reasons behind the hotel's imminent sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Few among the cast bring much in the way of credibility to their exceptionally 
thin roles (with the exception, maybe, of Harry as Harry). And having a Latina 
as one of the three female leads doesn't seem like such a breakthrough once you 
realize that she, too, veers comfortably close to stereotype, albeit relatively 
positive stereotype -- the fiery yet virginal Latina at proud odds with her 
macho, overly protective papa. Such progress. 
</P>
<P>
 As the premiere gets sillier and sillier -- especially with a comic 
bait-and-switch subplot involving the corpse of a corrupt city commissioner 
killed by hot sex -- the undemanding summer viewer may find it all about as 
unenrichingly painless as a watered-down daiquiri around dusk, going down 
easier than it ought to. Just so long as it's out by checkout time -- that is, 
the beginning of the fall season.

 * "One West Waikiki" premieres tonight at 8, followed at 10 by "Hotel Malibu," 
both on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

DAUGHTER OF PIONEER COUPLE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH DIES AT 88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vanona Esther (Worthy) Carl, youngest daughter of a pioneer couple who settled 
in Huntington Beach at the turn of the century, has died at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
 A service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday in the main chapel at Westminster 
Memorial Park.Burial will follow.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Carl's parents, James and Sarah Worthy, came to the seaside town, known 
then as "Shell Beach," in November, 1897, from Ozark, Ark. James Worthy spent 
40 years ranching lima beans, celery and sugar beets. The couple had seven 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Carl was born in Santa Ana on Feb. 4, 1906. Known as "Nonie" to family 
and friends, she attended Ocean View Elementary School and graduated from 
Huntington Beach High School. She earned a bachelor's degree from UCLA and 
became a junior high school teacher. She worked in Los Angeles area schools and 
taught home economics and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 18, 1937, she married Jack Carl. The couple made their home in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, when Mrs. Carl's father died, she and her husband moved back to the 
family farmhouse in Huntington Beach and she retired from teaching. The couple 
loved to travel the country and visited 38 states and Canada with their trailer 
in tow.  
</P>
<P>
 After her husband died in 1992, Mrs. Carl moved to Minnesota to live with her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a down-to-earth kind of person -- I never saw that woman get mad," 
said Susan Worthy of Huntington Beach, Mrs. Carl's cousin. "She was very calm 
and always friendly. I loved hearing family stories from her. It's kind of sad. 
It's the last of her generation -- that whole era is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by daughter Sharon Stephens and her husband, Dale, of 
Minneapolis. She is also survived by three grandchildren, also of Minneapolis.

BASEBALL STRIKE PLANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I agree with your editorial "Doesn't Anyone Care About the Fans? (July 
30)."After the last (baseball) strike I ceased spending my money to help pay 
salaries and club expenses. Instead, I have saved it for trips and cruises. 
Believe it or not, it doesn't take very many bypassed games to enjoy something 
far more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gripes me when I hear someone object to a doctor making $100,000 after 
15 years of school. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the average salary of a baseball player? Could it be $1.5 million for 
playing a game that in the end really means nothing?

GOODWILL GAMES; DAY BRINGS ELEMENTS OF A FARCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No ice, no wind. What next? 
</P>
<P>
 The Goodwill Games teetered on the edge of farce Wednesday as the showpiece 
figure skating competition was postponed until tonight because of a shortage of 
ice at the main rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Games officials said they planned to move to another venue. Later, they said 
they might stick with the original site. By the end of the day, the figure 
skating situation was as confused as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed at the latest mix-up, American Goodwill Games officials broke from 
their diplomatic niceties and said they had been misled by incompetent Russian 
rink managers -- and suggested they should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure skaters practiced without any certainty of when, where or if they 
will compete. One Russian pair went through their routine in a parking lot. 
Other skaters looked up in surprise when a sputtering Zamboni suddenly lurched 
onto the ice during the middle of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been dealing with so many things this past week -- starting over here, 
switching over there," said U.S. skater Todd Eldredge. "It's kind of been one 
thing after another. I guess you could say it's an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other headaches Wednesday. All three yachting events were abandoned 
because of a lack of wind on the Gulf of Finland. Weather permitting, the races 
will be added to today's program. 
</P>
<P>
 In events that did take place Wednesday, Russians swept the top three places 
in the men's all-around gymnastics; Chinese diver Chen Sheng won gold in the 
1-meter springboard, with Kevin McMahon of the United States finishing third; 
the U.S. women's basketball team routed Italy, 92-37, in a first-round game; 
and the U.S. women's volleyball team defeated China, 3-0, to advance to the 
final against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main subject of conversation Wednesday concerned the Yubileiny Sports 
Palace, where the boxing competition was held until last Saturday. Since then, 
a heat wave, a brownout and other problems have combined to thwart the 
ice-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to find that a number of people at Yubileiny may not be 
employed at Yubileiny in another day or two," said Goodwill Games President 
Jack Kelly.

APELL'S MANEUVERS SUCCEED YET AGAIN; TENNIS: MOST TALK CENTERS ON SWEDE'S 
RECENT LIFE-SAVING HEROICS DESPITE 6-4, 6-2 ROUT OF 27TH-RANKED VOLKOV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan Apell took advantage of a struggling Alexander Volkov to score a 6-4, 6-2 
victory Wednesday in the second round of the Los Angeles Open at the L.A. 
Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Volkov began the match by double faulting, and things got 
steadily worse for the Russian, who appeared to give up in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell, ranked 102nd and better known for his doubles prowess, is playing his 
first season on the ATP pro tour in singles. In a postmatch news conference, 
however, reporters were more interested in hearing about the last choking 
victim he faced than the progress of his singles career. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell was preparing for a doubles match at the Manchester Open in June when he 
noticed one of the locker room stewards choking. 
</P>
<P>
 John Monaghan, 69, was gasping for air and waving frantically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and I thought he had problems," Apell said. "I came to him and he 
couldn't say anything. He had something stuck in his throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Apell struck Monaghan on the back to try to dislodge the object. When that 
didn't work, Apell ran outside to get help. "We need a doctor in here, it's 
urgent," he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell returned to Monaghan's side and, although he had no formal training in 
life-saving techniques, performed the Heimlich maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize that the name was Heimlich, but I did it," Apell said. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Apell, who is from Sweden, know the maneuver? 
</P>
<P>
 "Swedish instinct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell eventually dislodged the object, and Monaghan was left stunned but 
thankful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was a goner," Monaghan said in a news release. "I would have been 
but for Jan's quick thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Against a frustrated Volkov Wednesday, the left-handed Apell won four of six 
break points and concentrated on executing his game plan, which he said was "to 
mix it up a little bit, to get him confused." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan worked. With Apell leading, 4-2, in the second set, the 27th-ranked 
Volkov apparently decided to pack it in. He hit two volleys lamely into the net 
and one wide to hand Apell his last break point. The crowd made its 
disappointment known. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell won the last eight points, capped by an ace that Volkov didn't even move 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov grabbed his tennis bag and left the stadium, eventually returning to 
speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made too many mistakes on unforced errors," he said. "(Apell) just tried to 
mix and keep the ball in play as long as possible from the baseline, and I was 
not ready to play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Apell said he wasn't surprised when Volkov gave up, but empathized with 
Volkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he didn't play his best tennis," Apell said. "Sometimes when you feel 
like you are not playing well, sometimes, you don't know what to do and you 
just give it away. . . . It has happened to me as well. I have done the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Apell, who also defeated Volkov in the second round of the Lipton 
Championships at Key Biscayne, Fla., in March, the victory increased his 
confidence in his singles game. He played only ATP Challenger tournaments in 
singles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell, 24, is ranked fifth in doubles with partner Jonas Bjorkman, also of 
Sweden. The pair has had a successful season, losing in the French Open final 
to top-ranked Byron Black and Jonathan Stark, then defeating fourth-ranked Todd 
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde of Australia in the final of the Stella Artois 
tournament in London. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was all before Apell became a hero in England, where he and Bjorkman 
lost to Scott Davis and Trevor Kronemann in the semifinals at Manchester.

 Under pressure from international donors, Ghana instituted strict austerity 
measures in the late 1980s to restructure its economy, including removing most 
price and currency controls. The reform measures attracted additional foreign 
aid, which is responsible for Ghana's healthy annual rate of growth during the 
1990s.

USING THE OLD BEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every week I cook a bag of cannellini beans. Also known as white kidney beans, 
cannellini beans are large in size (like lima beans) but oval in shape (like 
great northern beans).  
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing debate among my fellow cooks is whether it is necessary to soak 
dried beans before cooking. Sometimes I soak them, and sometimes I don't. 
Cannellini beans take about 30 minutes longer to cook if they are not soaked 
first -- but the alternative, of course, requires extended preparation before 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Not eating beans is as foreign to me as -- well, not eating. Beans are a 
delicious food, and they just happen to be low in fat, loaded with vitamins and 
minerals and an excellent source of fiber and complex carbohydrates. They are 
very inexpensive, and the perfect food for a creative cook. WHITE BEAN SALAD

 Ratatouille, an aromatic casserole of eggplant, zucchini, peppers, onions and 
tomatoes, is a classic that has withstood the test of time. Originally from 
Nice on the French Riviera, this luscious vegetable stew is often made at home 
in France and is popular in restaurants and charcuteries throughout the 
country. Vegetarians make a meal of ratatouille with bread, rice or pasta, or 
roll it in a crepe. Meat-eaters serve it with grilled or roast chicken, lamb, 
beef or veal. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for ratatouille's popularity is that the recipe is very 
forgiving. If you cook ratatouille a little too long, nothing bad will happen; 
the vegetables are supposed to be tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cooks prefer to use roughly equal amounts of each vegetable; others 
recommend doubling the tomatoes. Green beans, potatoes and mushrooms also find 
their way into some ratatouille pots. Garlic and olive oil are the essential 
flavorings, and any herbs in season, especially thyme and fresh basil, can be 
incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 I have met French chefs who insist that you fry each vegetable separately. 
This is time-consuming, however, and tends to make the ratatouille rather oily. 
To simplify the preparation, I stew the onions, peppers and zucchini together. 
I cook the eggplant separately, but usually with a combination of sauteing and 
steaming, because it's easier than frying and requires less oil. When I use 
fresh tomatoes, I peel them and cook them briefly before combining them with 
the other vegetables. For a shortcut, I substitute diced canned tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Balkan countries, there's a similar vegetable casserole that takes its 
name from the Turkish earthenware pot it's traditionally cooked in, the guvec . 
In Bulgarian it's called givetch ; in Romanian, ghiveciu ; in Greek, youvetsi . 
Givetch starts out with sauteed eggplant, tomatoes, peppers and onions, but 
then these vegetables are layered with uncooked vegetables -- any combination 
of carrots, okra, zucchini, celery, green beans and potatoes -- and baked. 
During winter, givetch takes on a different tone; mushrooms, cauliflower, 
turnips, parsnips or dried beans might enter the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot pepper flakes, garlic and parsley are customary seasonings for givetch ; 
paprika, dill, thyme or rosemary might also be used. Givetch can be vegetarian 
or can be cooked with beef or lamb cubes or spicy sausages. Some versions are 
garnished at the last moment with green grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither of these casseroles cooks quickly, both are very convenient. 
Prepare them in large amounts and keep them in the freezer, ready to pop into 
the microwave to reheat. You can serve them with baked or fried eggs on top; an 
English friend of mine does this with Ratatouille and calls the dish "ratty 
eggs." Tarte a la ratatouille is a fairly recent use of the stew in Paris, in 
which it becomes a filling for a savory pastry shell. Or try other 
nontraditional uses: Turn ratatouille into a topping for pizza, toss 
ratatouille or givetch with spaghetti or rice, or use either stew as a filling 
for tortillas or pita breads. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ratatouille and givetch are delicious cold, and can be served as a salad, 
antipasto or side dish. Either can be a cool, light summer meal if served on a 
bed of lettuce and accompanied by a little feta or goat cheese, hard-cooked 
eggs or thin slices of smoked turkey breast. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This aromatic vegetable stew with garlic and herbs is one of the glories of 
Provencal cooking. It's wonderful hot or cold as a main dish or as a partner 
for grilled fish, chicken or steak. Naturally it's at its best in summer, when 
tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and zucchini are at their peak. You might like to 
garnish it with fresh basil.

WESTSIDE WATCH: BANNER SALES FOR SOCCER FLAGS FROM BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who don't want to forget the World Cup just yet, get to Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is selling its teal-green, 6-foot "Beverly Hills Salutes the World" 
banners that hung over Wilshire Boulevard during the world championship soccer 
tournament last month. More than a dozen flags have been sold, and 85 remain, 
said Beverly Hills Visitor's Bureau spokeswoman Catherine Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 The banners' designer, Tim Schwartz, 25, is surprised by their popularity. 
"I'm baffled by it," he said. "No one has ever really wanted any of the other 
banners we've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Churchill said fans from as far away as Georgia and Alaska have been inquiring 
about the banners, which are priced at $100.  
</P>
<P>
 What exactly will these people do with the double-sided silk and vinyl 
banners? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a keepsake for the World Cup Games," said Sally Haynie of Laurenceville, 
Ga., who came to Los Angeles with her family for the soccer final at the Rose 
Bowl in which Brazil defeated Italy 3-2. The banner will be hanging in the 
Haynies' downstairs game room.

 MAMA MIA: We see a lot of groups demonstrate over a lot of things at a lot of 
places here on the Westside, but this announcement really caught our eye: About 
100 mothers will hold a "breast-feeding sit-in" at the Westside Pavilion on 
Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Surely, this must be one of the highlights of World Breastfeeding Week (that's 
this week, in case you forgot), organized by the La Leche League, an 
organization that discourages bottle-feeding as unnatural and unhealthful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother's milk is nature's fast food, arrives always at the perfect 
temperature and is at two convenient locations near you," the group said in 
announcing the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Local breast-feeding advocate Shanda Lear says there is a stigma attached to 
mothers who breast-feed in public. To show that it can be done discreetly and 
tastefully, she helped organize the event at the Gymboree Playcenter in the 
Pico Boulevard mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a protest or a demonstration, but a celebration," Lear said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is an interesting way to milk publicity. 
</P>

 FROM THE MAN-BITES-DOG FILE: It was a reversal of the 
automobile-hits-pedestrian accident. Or so it seemed. Beverly Hills police have 
arrested a man who allegedly flung himself against a parked car and then 
pretended to have been hit by the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said officers watched last week as Walter Leroy Moore III leaped out at 
a white 1991 Jaguar that had stopped moments before at the end of a Beverly 
Hills alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore then limped up to the surprised and shaken driver and claimed that 
although he was unhurt, the collision had broken a bottle of expensive 
prescription medicine he had been carrying in a brown paper bag that hit the 
fender, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly showed the unidentified elderly driver the bag containing pills 
and a broken bottle with a $14 price tag. Moore added that there were actually 
two bottles in the bag, and police said the woman gave him $30 to pay for the 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore then walked away without a limp, the officers said. In fact, he began to 
run when police attempted to stop him, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Frank 
Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 29, of Los Angeles, was arrested for defrauding under false pretenses, 
resisting arrest and for an outstanding warrant. He was being held at the 
county jail in lieu of $28,500 bail.

SPACE-AGE ROLE MODEL FOR GIRLS; CAREERS: JUDITH COHEN, WHO WORKED ON THE APOLLO 
12 LUNAR MISSION, HOPES HER BOOKS INSPIRE FEMALE STUDENTS TO PURSUE CHALLENGING 
FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Judith Cohen was growing up in the 1930s and '40s, she excelled in math, 
and danced well enough to gain an audition with New York's Metropolitan Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's mother made no secret of what path she preferred for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My) mother always told me that I should be using my head, and not my feet," 
said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cohen used her head. She studied engineering at Brooklyn College in New 
York for two years, and then went to work at North American Aviation (now 
Rockwell) while attending USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period in which she got married and had three children, Cohen 
worked on the country's first satellite and on the guidance system for the 
Apollo 12 lunar excursion module. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 60, Cohen is a part-time author. Two years ago, she wrote "You Can Be a 
Woman Engineer." In 35 pages written for elementary school students, Cohen 
tells how she loved looking at the universe through a telescope, and of her 
realization that she could be an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has co-written a series with other women in fields 
traditionally dominated by males. The series, colorfully illustrated by husband 
David Katz, includes the titles "You Can Be a Woman Architect," "You Can Be a 
Woman Marine Biologist" and other books dealing with Egyptology, paleontology, 
zoology and oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is intended to address a problem pointed out in study after study: 
that girls are overlooked and undervalued in most coeducational classes, 
especially in math and science. Cohen and oceanographer Florence McAlary will 
read excerpts from their books at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Barnes & Noble 
bookstore in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the series grew out of a monthly column Cohen wrote for Engineer 
of California magazine while she was working for TRW. In 1990, she wrote a 
piece about her life as an engineer. Her husband, a part-time teacher in the 
Los Angeles school district, saw a need for more of that kind of writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband would talk to girls at the schools, and ask what they wanted to be 
when they grew up," said Cohen. "They'd always say, 'I don't know.' So he 
decided there was a need for something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz encouraged his wife to write her story for girls. When they completed the 
book, their distributor asked them also to do a Spanish version. And he 
suggested they do a series. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first book, which Cohen and her husband published from their home in 
Culver City, she wrote about the excitement and challenges of nearly 30 years 
as a pioneering female in aerospace engineering -- in about 900 words. 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated from USC with a degree in electrical engineering in 1957. Two 
years later, she went to work for TRW, where she worked on the first 
communications satellites sent into space. She earned a master's degree in 
electrical engineering from USC in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on the backup guidance system for the Apollo 12 lunar excursion 
module, the capsule that landed on the moon, and then watching the historic 
moon landing was memorable, she said. But her proudest moment came during the 
next lunar mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The astronauts couldn't land (on the moon) because of a system malfunction. A 
fuel tank blew up. So they had to turn off the power on the main system to get 
back to Earth," said Cohen. "I worked on the backup guidance system, and that 
is what got them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she met an astronaut who told her that the guidance system saved the 
lives of the astronauts aboard Apollo 13. "I always thought that was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the 1980s, she worked on the satellite that NASA uses to send data 
back and forth from the Hubble Space Telescope.  
</P>
<P>
 Explaining physics and advanced biology to a 10-year-old, said Cohen, was one 
of the biggest challenges of the series. "The scientists get frustrated because 
I want to limit the book to 900 words, and they have thousands of words they 
want to use," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The books reached a wider market than she expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marine biologist book has been out two years, and high school girls are 
the biggest customers," said Cohen. Adults like the books because they make 
sophisticated scientific concepts easy to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 The books were initially sold at museums, including the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. The Museum of Contemporary Art bought copies of the architect's 
book, while the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla sells the 
oceanographer's book. Teachers in the Los Angeles school district have bought 
about 1,000 of the books, which sell for $6, and sales have increased by word 
of mouth. So far, Cohen said, about 18,000 have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Caroline Saleh and her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah, drove to 
the Marina del Rey bookstore from Redlands to buy Cohen's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had heard about her before, and we had seen the books," said Saleh. She 
said her daughter is interested in a science career. They bought "You Can Be a 
Woman Oceanographer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good to encourage the girls to get into those fields. So I came 
all the way out here just for these books." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's next project will be a biography for children on the pioneer 
environmentalist and author Rachel Carson. Cohen then hopes to find a woman 
astronomer to help her write a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen retired from TRW in 1990 and works as a consulting engineer for 
companies including Litton Data Systems in the San Fernando Valley and Logicom 
in San Pedro. She's also learning LOTUS to help people set up their own 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent book reading, Cohen said she handed out paper to the younger 
children to draw on. While she was reading her book on being a woman engineer, 
Cohen said, a 6-year-old girl was busily sketching a rocket ship carrying a 
woman astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was so exciting, that a 6-year-old could see herself in the spaceship," 
Cohen said. "And it's great that I can take part in helping someone take away 
this message."

TOPICS / LANDMARKS; HIGH-OCTANE HISTORY

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, the tiny red-and-white gas station looks like a movie set for 
a period film about small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
 There are just three pumps, with a small, hand-painted "full-service" sign 
propped atop the middle one. Not one electronic-payment machine is in sight. 
And attendants, with aim-to-please faces, actually speak to and dote on drivers 
who pull into the station: wiping their car windows clean, looking under the 
hood and sending them off with "Thanks . . . Have a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no Hollywood illusion. There is gas in them there pumps and Canyon 
Service, a 70-year-old institution that local historians believe is the oldest, 
continuously operating gas station in Los Angeles, has survived the self-serve 
gas revolution unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of full-service gas stations is a nationwide trend. In 1972, more 
than 226,000 traditional full-service stations existed in the country, 
according to industry observers. Today, fewer than half are still in business, 
although there are more than 70,000 self-serve mega-stations and about 70,000 
stores that peddle gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canyon Service has carved a specialty market out of the intensely 
competitive gas business by carrying 100-octane gas, a cleaner, slower burning 
premium fuel that is preferred by drivers of high-end European sports cars, 
Harley Davidsons and dirt motorcycles. Only a handful of stations in Los 
Angeles carry such gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few little niches left in this modernized world," said Dennis 
Kahn, who sat on his Honda Nighthawk motorcycle while one of the attendants 
filled the tank with the high-octane fuel. "It's like an antique gas station . 
. . sort of 1950-ish. And there is nothing within a 20-mile radius of here that 
carries 100 octane." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Peterson, manager of the business at Entrada and Amalfi drives, said 
Canyon Service has become a sort of gas station to the stars. Santa Monica 
Canyon, thick with celebrity residents who inhabit sprawling mansions, supplies 
a steady stream of Porsches, Jaguars, BMWs and Mercedes. Not to mention 
Harleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaime Lee Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Goldie Hawn, Ted Danson and Eddie Van Halen -- 
he comes for gas here too," said Peterson, who has leased the station since 
January from the owner, Angelina Marquez Olivera. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the 100-octane gas and occasional star sightings, the station, 
which was used as a backdrop in such feature films as "Lawnmower Man" and 
"Calendar Girl," offers an even rarer product: service.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to find a full-service gas station in L.A. -- period," said 
Peterson, who runs the station with three employees. "We do the whole thing. 
Check the oil, wash the windows, check all the fluids, check the air in the 
tires, look under the hood. Just like the old days." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Service's Spanish Colonial revival building was built in 1926 by 
Perfecto Marquez, who raised his family in a tiny Craftsman-style house that 
sits behind the station. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny building next to the gas station, no longer in use, housed a fruit and 
vegetable market that, in its heyday, bustled with shoppers.  
</P>
<P>
 The land was passed down to Perfecto Marquez and his siblings from his 
great-great-grandfather, Francisco Marquez, and Ysidro Reyes, his 
great-great-uncle. The two men had settled in the scenic coastal canyons with 
their families when California was still under Mexican rule, receiving 6,656 
acres of land from Santa Monica Canyon to Topanga Canyon through a Mexican land 
grant known as Rancho Boca de Santa Monica in 1839. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the land were sold off beginning in 1979. What remains of the 
original land grant belongs to Marquez Olivera, believed to be the oldest 
living descendant of Francisco Marquez and the daughter of Perfecto Marquez. 
The 77-year-old woman still lives in the house that she was born in behind the 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old-timers like my dad must have used the best material because . . . 
it's still good for at least another 20 years," Olivera said. "It's like a part 
of a Raymond Chandler novel, who lived in the Palisades and very well could 
have used this gas station," said amateur historian Randy Young. "It really is 
kind of amazing that the structure is the only remaining original portion of 
the land grant days." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said that when Perfecto Marquez established the station, there was no 
other development in the area. The business was sustained by the heavy beach 
traffic, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the station was nearly run out of town by homeowners who lived on the 
last remaining tract of land that Olivera sold to a developer in the 1980s. The 
station's right to be there was challenged primarily on the basis of a zoning 
ordinance that prohibited gas stations in residential neighborhoods, said 
Young.  
</P>
<P>
 City zoning officials decided that the gas station was "grandfathered" because 
it had been in the canyon long before zoning existed. Olivera said that she was 
told the station can continue to operate as long as the property is owned by 
the descendants of the Marquez family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was one of the early Mexican families who founded L.A. getting pitched 
off their land. No one wanted to touch it," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Swanson, who has pumped gas at the station part-time for 10 years, 
marvels at Canyon Service's endurance. A studio musician, he has gotten 
occasional work from celebrities passing through. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as customers keep coming in . . . and because of this little 
community it serves and their support of small business, it will survive."

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; RECREATION: GOLF PROGRAM ALSO OFFERS ACADEMIC AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new program offered by two golf associations, inner-city youths in Los 
Angeles can learn to play golf and also meet career and college counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Junior Golf Program, a joint project that the American Golf Corp. and the 
Western States Golf Assn. recently launched in Los Angeles, offers minority 
youths free lessons from professional golfers, career development assistance 
and college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the nationwide program was launched in 1987, more than 5,000 inner-city 
youths have learned to play golf, according to American Golf spokesman Kevin 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to providing these children with a healthy and fun activity, golf 
provides them with a number of positive social skills including 
self-discipline, self-control and commitment," said Roberts.  
</P>
<P>
 Similar programs exist in New York, Virginia, Florida and Arizona.

 They were unlikely crime fighters: young children waving "No Drugs" signs, 
young couples pushing babies in strollers, and older men and women wearing 
matching Neighborhood Watch T-shirts. But they were typical of the thousands of 
Westside residents who turned out Tuesday night to express their commitment to 
fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In parks and neighborhoods throughout the Westside, residents and law 
enforcement authorities gathered for block parties, marches and rallies as part 
of the "National Night Out" anti-crime campaign sponsored annually by the U.S. 
Department of Justice. An estimated 26 million people nationwide participated 
in the event last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a night where we can do something, not just talk," said Linda 
Lockwood, chairwoman for Hollywood National Night Out. "We the people can help 
take back parks and streets from criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred people in Hollywood marched past alleged places of 
prostitution and drug dealing. Some of the littlest marchers, like 10-year-old 
Angelique Bermudez of the Ivar Hill section of Hollywood, chanted "crack kills" 
as they walked the mile-plus route, surrounded by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangs make you scared and drugs make you crazy," said Bermudez, explaining 
why she and about 20 other children from Ivar Hill joined the rally at De 
Longpre Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of each community's events reflected their concerns. In Hollywood, 
the attitude was clearly less a celebration of past accomplishments and more a 
signal to gang members that residents are tired of being frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in opposition to the way gangs run our streets," said Joe Shea, 
leader of the Ivar Hawks Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations of K-9 patrols and other police displays drew about 2,000 
people to five Santa Monica parks, said Sgt. Gary Gallinot, Santa Monica police 
spokesman. The activities were aimed at getting neighbors to meet each other 
and providing information on how neighborhoods can be proactive in stopping 
crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of West Hollywood hosted more than a dozen events, including marches 
and neighborhood get-togethers to promote Neighborhood Watch programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City, Beverly Hills and Malibu did not participate in National Night 
Out. Officials in those cities said they either did not know about the event or 
decided not to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the community is less focused on crime, and more on fire prevention 
and rebuilding" after the November wildfires, said sheriff's Deputy Joe Graffo 
in Malibu. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; BUSINESS ASSESSMENT WOULD HELP REVITALIZE VILLAGE, 
CONSULTANT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemingly is the last thing the people who own and operate businesses in 
the economically pressed Westwood Village would need or want: an additional 
levy on their business licenses of as much as several thousand dollars 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the opinion of the management team brought in to spearhead the 
revitalization of the once-prosperous shopping district near UCLA, a new 
assessment is exactly what the area needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mailing sent out Monday by the Westwood Village Management Corp., 1,200 
merchants and business people in Westwood Village are being asked to consider 
implementing what would be Los Angeles' second "business improvement district," 
known as a BID. In such a district, fees are collected and put into a general 
fund that is used to promote local businesses and improve the maintenance and 
security of the area, among other things. The city's first BID was created a 
year ago for Downtown merchants along Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This empowers people by giving them money to control their local areas," said 
Tom Carroll, executive director of the management corporation, who estimated 
that a BID would net nearly $1 million annually. "With it, you can have a 
managed environment and shared promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 The amount each merchant would pay would depend on the location and type of 
business, Carroll said. For example, a merchant in the heart of the village 
might be assessed a few thousand dollars annually, because such a business 
would receive direct benefit from BID money spent on advertising and promotion. 
Conversely, a Wilshire Boulevard corporation on the periphery would likely be 
assessed less -- perhaps only a few hundred dollars -- because it would receive 
only indirect benefits, such as a better, safer business environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money would be collected by the city, the fund would be 
controlled by a newly established association made up of businesses that have 
paid into the BID. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the proposal so far has been favorable. Derek Chasin, owner and 
manager of Chasin Chicken, said such a district could help attract more 
business and visitors to Westwood Village, and do so without the interference 
of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do it right, it could be excellent," said Chasin, who opened his 
restaurant in March. "We may be able to do something because it's our money. We 
want to see things get done." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Stan Berman, owner of the popular Stan's Donuts shop on the corner 
of Broxton and Weyburn avenues, called the BID a "terrific" idea, though he 
added that it wouldn't solve all of the village's problems. The larger needs, 
he said, have to be addressed by the relative handful of people who own most of 
the land and businesses in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big landlords have to give us a step in the right direction," Berman 
said. "They really should set an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said that the proposed BID might be put to a City Council vote as 
early as late October. Although it is too soon to gauge the feelings of most of 
the village's merchants, he said that executives who have created other BIDs 
have told him that despite the added money, business people in many cases 
generally favor the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worse times are, the more people feel they have to pull together in a 
cooperative way to make things work," said Carroll, who noted that BIDs now 
exist in 2,000 cities nationwide, including 200 in California. "Obviously, this 
area has got to come up; it's just a question of how." SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; MAN CHARGED WITH BREAK-IN AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal charges were filed Tuesday against a man accused of breaking into the 
Hollywood High School library over the weekend and causing more than $1,000 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Douglas Jensen, 32, who lists Torrance as his hometown but is believed 
to be a transient in the Hollywood area, was charged with trespassing and 
vandalism in a complaint filed in Hollywood Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The trespassing charge could result in a six-month jail term and $1,000 fine, 
said Deputy City Atty. Bill Sterling. The vandalism charge carries a special 
allegation that the damage caused was between $1,000 and $5,000, which enhances 
the maximum penalty to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials estimated the damage at $1,070.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTCHESTER; INTERCHANGE OPENS 6 MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE

<P>
 The Howard Hughes Parkway interchange on the San Diego (405) Freeway has 
opened, providing Westchester commuters direct access to the freeway's 
northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15-million ramp, inaugurated last week by public figures including Gayle 
Wilson, wife of Gov. Pete Wilson, had been under construction for two years and 
was completed six months ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was built by Caltrans with funds from the Summa Corp. real estate 
company, which developed the Howard Hughes Center office park adjacent to the 
interchange. The interchange allows commuters to bypass the busy Centinela 
Avenue interchange in Culver City and was designed to alleviate traffic 
congestion from the business center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ramp was privately funded, and that was really wonderful," said Caltrans 
spokeswoman Pat Reed. "Because of limited funding, public/private partnership 
building is the quickest way of getting projects done." LORENZA MUNOZ

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; HOME AWAY FROM HOME; OVERNIGHT CHILD CARE PROVIDES 
PARENTS NEW FREEDOM ON THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG and DIANE SEO , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE DAY IS TURNING to evening as 5-year-old Zachary and 3-year-old Jonathan 
Witherspoon arrive at Debi Magdaleno's West Los Angeles home, each boy toting a 
Ninja Turtle backpack containing a toothbrush, pajamas and a favorite toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm late, I'm late. Give me a kiss goodby," Denise Witherspoon tells 
Jonathan, her son, and Zachary, her nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys clamber out of the car and Jonathan dutifully kisses his mother. 
Zachary runs to greet Magdaleno and her 7-year-old daughter, Marina, who are 
waiting to welcome the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving farewell, Witherspoon rushes off to begin her 7 p.m.-to-7 a.m. shift as 
a bone marrow transplant nurse at UCLA Medical Center, while Magdaleno takes 
the children in the back yard to play for a few minutes in the fading light. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is a typical slice of day care life -- except, of course, that this 
day care starts at dusk. The Magdaleno house, which has been a family child 
care facility for two years, is soon full of activity: As Magdaleno prepares a 
dinner of pizza, fruit and milk, Zachary, Jonathan and Marina are busy coloring 
and playing with their Play-Doh. After eating every slice of pizza, the 
children change into their pajamas, brush their teeth, and snuggle in bed for 
story time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern is familiar to the children; the boys usually spend two nights a 
week with Magdaleno, a licensed child care provider. When bedtime comes, they 
settle down to sleep with a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of employees working irregular hours grows, many parents -- 
particularly single parents -- are turning to late-night and overnight child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it's having to work late hours or meet with clients in the evenings. 
For others, the traditional hours of child care must be extended because of 
graveyard and swing-shift work in the manufacturing or service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I benefit from working at night, because I get paid more than I would during 
the day," said Witherspoon, a single parent who has been working late shifts 
since 1988. "And the boys have a stable place like Debi's to go. It's a home 
atmosphere, so they go from our home during the day to another home at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Although few child care centers provide late-night and overnight care, many 
family care providers in and near the Westside offer such services out of their 
homes and apartments. In the area bounded by Malibu in the north, Redondo Beach 
to the south and Silver Lake on the east, there are more than 200 licensed 
family care providers that offer 24-hour service, according to child care 
referral agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are increasingly seeking after-hours child care for a range of 
reasons, said Tracey Dickson of Connections for Children, a Santa Monica child 
care referral agency that serves much of the Westside. Some parents use 
overnight care service regularly while they work or periodically while they 
attend evening meetings. Prominent among the customers are single parents, 
whose numbers are growing nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 27% of children under 18 lived with only one parent, up from 12% in 
1970, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. On the job front, 14 million 
full-time employees -- 18% of the nation's full-time work force -- worked 
something other than a daytime shift in 1991. This represents an addition of 2 
million such workers over the previous six years, according to the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor bureau also estimates that the top five growth occupations in the 
1990s will be waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, janitors and cleaners, 
managers and cashiers -- all of which will require long hours and some off-hour 
shift work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents only need care that extends a few hours past the traditional, 
end-of-the-workday pickup time. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Charles of West Los Angeles said she has taken care of little Stefano 
Lazano for almost a year, six days a week. Lazano, who is almost 3 years old, 
stays with Charles and her three children from morning to almost 9 p.m. while 
his father works late as a store manager and his mother holds down her job as a 
flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money-wise, there is no advantage to (taking) children at night, and it is 
more responsibility," Charles said. "But I try and help those parents out there 
who need the help, because I'm a parent, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents seek all-night care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of low-income mothers who truly care about their kids, but have 
no choice but to take a night job," said Pat Onuorah, who offers 24-hour family 
care at her Ladera Heights home. "Every night, I have at least one child who 
stays over." 
</P>
<P>
 Onuorah is licensed to care for 12 children at any given time, a typical 
number for family care providers. And like most providers, Onuorah, who works 
at the Watts Health Foundation during the day, hires assistants to help her 
watch children and prepare meals. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, about a dozen children were sprawled on her living room 
floor, playing games, eating spaghetti and watching the video "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 One baby in the room was scheduled to stay with Onuorah for four days. "He's 
very adaptable and independent," Onuorah said of the 15-month-old boy, whose 
mother is a flight attendant. "He's been going to baby-sitters ever since he 
was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Family care providers sometimes charge by the hour, from $5 to $9, or on a 
weekly basis from $50 to $125 -- prices that are comparable to those for 
daytime care. Some licensed providers may charge extra for overnight or weekend 
care, however. To be licensed by the state Department of Social Services, 
family providers must meet certain requirements, which include attending a 
licensing seminar, being fingerprinted and having their homes deemed safe for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While many family care providers are willing to offer late-night and overnight 
care, few, if any, child care centers in Los Angeles provide 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to find many child care centers willing to provide that type 
of care because it's not profitable at all," said Tammy Baker of Child and 
Family Services, a child care referral agency that serves Beverly Hills, 
Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire and downtown areas. "You need to pay your workers 
overtime and it's hard to maintain a steady clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 And many parents with non-traditional work schedules prefer leaving their 
children in a home setting rather than an institutionalized child care 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to drop your child off at night in their pajamas, would you want 
to take them to a place where the person who answers the door is wearing 
pajamas and your child can snuggle up in a bed in their home?" Baker asked. "Or 
would you want to go to a place with fluorescent lights, where they put your 
child on a cot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Cannon, a single parent raising a 15-month-old daughter, Shanice, said 
she would have had to leave her swing-shift job at the U.S. Post Office if she 
hadn't been referred to Agnes Lewis' child care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every afternoon, when Cannon drops Shanice off at Lewis' Inglewood home at 
about 3:15 p.m., Lewis makes it a point to tell the baby, "Your mommy's going 
to work now. She'll be back tonight to pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon then kisses her baby goodby, and waves to her as she walks to her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important for them to wave to each other," Lewis said. "That way 
Shanice knows she's coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching her mother's car drive away, Shanice goes inside to play with 
the seven other children under Lewis' care. A few hours later, after most of 
the other children have gone home, Lewis and Shanice have dinner. Shanice is 
then tucked into bed, only to be stirred out of sleep shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ready to see Mama?" Lewis asks Shanice, as she lifts the sleepy but 
smiling child from her crib. "It's time to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewis first started watching Shanice early this year, Shanice would cry 
and hold on tight to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mother would sit in her car and hear her screaming inside," Lewis said. 
"That made her feel so bad. She kept saying, 'Hopefully, one of these days, I 
won't have to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Cannon packs up Shanice, says good night to Lewis, and 
drives to her home in the Ladera Heights area. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reluctance of some parents to leave their children in overnight 
care, many have no other options. Few companies, even those with employees 
working irregular hours, have considered round-the-clock child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of 24-hour care has been brought up from time to time, and the 
unions have asked about it," said Sylvia Woodside, a human services manager for 
the U.S. Postal Service in Los Angeles. "But we've held off because of the lack 
of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles used to offer 24-hour child care to its 
employees, but the program was discontinued because the hospital couldn't 
maintain a steady enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there's a hesitancy to put kids in a center at night," said Darcy 
Williams, who runs the hospital's child care program. "All the guilt that women 
feel about leaving their child at a center is compounded at night. We're 
considering bringing back 24-hour care, but we would only do so with trained 
people and lots of planning. It's a very distant thought." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is one of the rare Westside employers that responds to its employees' 
off-hour child care needs. Magdaleno's family child care facility, Debicare, is 
run through the university's child care services, and was contracted to provide 
overnight home care specifically for UCLA Medical Center employees who must 
work late shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing child care in a home is often the most feasible way, since the 
number of children is usually small and the children can be in a home 
environment, said UCLA child services outreach coordinator Judy Bencivengo. 
"And, in a home setting, there can be a feeling of an extended family that 
comforts the child after a long day." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that sort of family atmosphere that Ivonne Gonek said she and her 
husband, Steven, have tried to foster during their one-year stint as family 
care providers at their Mar Vista home. "Parents feel like their kids have a 
good time with us, so they like to leave them with us," said Ivonne Gonek, who 
is licensed to take care of six children. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekday evening, the Goneks' big back yard was full of toys, some 
being used by the three Gonek children, and others by 4-year-old Becky Scheer 
and 5-year-old Keira Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Scheer explained he was dropping off his daughter at the Goneks' house 
while he attended a martial arts class and his wife, a psychotherapist, was 
seeing clients. "Becky likes going over there very much. Ivonne's kids are her 
playmates," Scheer said later, adding that Becky stays at the Goneks' home one 
or two evenings a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Holmes, a service representative for Sony, picked up Keira from day 
care and took her to the Goneks', so her daughter could be watched and fed 
dinner while she attended a weekly meeting. Holmes, a single mother living in 
Palms, said she had no relatives who could care for Keira in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real lifesaver for me, after the separation with my husband," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday, Eric Scaraglino, 3, spends the night at Elizabeth Wolf's 
Hollywood home, while his mother, Rose, attends a parents' support group 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time he stayed over, I cried and cried," said Scaraglino, a single 
parent from Palms whose son is hearing-impaired. "It was the first time he had 
been away from me, and I was devastated. Now, (Wolfe) is part of our family. I 
don't have any family in California, so she's like Eric's grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Wolfe said she was willing to offer 24-hour child care in her 
home because she enjoys the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my husband passed away, it just made sense for me to do this," said 
Wolfe, who has provided family care for the past 10 years. "It's like therapy 
for me to have the kids around. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has studied the effect of overnight care on children, some 
child care professionals express concern about the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward F. Zigler, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a national 
child care expert, said waking a child in the middle of the night disrupts the 
child's sleep patterns. Unfamiliar nighttime environments can also upset 
children, Zigler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can adapt themselves to everything, but children want to sleep in 
their own beds," he said. "They get frightened of strange people and places." 
</P>
<P>
 But the first time Keira spent a night away from her mom, sleeping at the 
Goneks' house, everything went smoothly and the then-3-year-old Keira did not 
make a fuss, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd been in bed since about 8:30 or 9 p.m., and she woke up only once 
around 10," Holmes said. "She started asking for me, so Ivonne said I was 
probably at home in bed, but if she really needed to talk to me, they could 
call. Keira just said, 'O.K.,' and went right back to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said: "Now the only trouble I have when I take her over there is she 
doesn't want to come home."

REGION; PICO RIVERA; COUNCIL MEMBERS LOCKED IN DISPUTE OVER KEYS TO CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen O'Hara didn't expect a key to the city after her shocking election to 
the Pico Rivera City Council four months ago. After all, she admits, she was a 
political outsider with no friends in city government.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, she contends, she doesn't even have a key to City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 A fuming O'Hara accused her colleagues of changing the locks because they 
suspected her of snooping around desks on evenings and weekends, a charge she 
heatedly denies. O'Hara and her council colleagues have been given new keys 
that allow them to use their council offices, but make other city offices 
off-limits after-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara now has moved out of the building in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no reason to change the locks," she said. "Supposedly, we're the 
bosses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Beatrice Proo said she ordered the change in locks after cleaning crews 
reported O'Hara lingering around city employees' desks after-hours.  
</P>
<P>
 "Janitors were concerned that she was going through desks at night," Proo 
said. "I thought the best thing to do was to restrict access to the whole City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
 When Proo asked the council members to turn in their old keys for new ones 
giving them access only to their council offices, O'Hara refused. O'Hara said 
she now works on city business out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The key flap is just the latest sign that things haven't changed much for 
O'Hara, a longtime council critic who lobbied tirelessly -- and generally 
futilely -- for a variety of causes before she was elected four months ago. She 
stunned politicians and even some of her own supporters by topping a field of 
11 candidates vying for three council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara never had a honeymoon with fellow council members. Shortly after her 
election, she antagonized the council by supporting an unsuccessful legal 
challenge to Councilman Gil De La Rosa's election. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, O'Hara's pet proposals to expand homeless services and create more 
committees were soundly rejected by council members, who said her ideas were 
unworkable. The council also turned down her proposal to televise council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at the last meeting, she voted against the other council members on 
nearly every item, giving little explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fed up," De La Rosa said. "She doesn't want to work with any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said he often finds O'Hara suspicious of city 
staff and uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been nothing but professional and polite," he said. "I've been in the 
business for 30 years, and I've never encountered this situation before. It's 
been bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Even O'Hara's supporters admit her political style can be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to call her a 'bull in a china shop,' " said Adriane Jepson, a 
longtime friend. "She can do a lot of damage if she doesn't think. She has a 
lot of heart, but she's not polished." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara was considered a long shot in the April council election. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old businesswoman had never run for political office. She decided 
to run after she, her husband and two sons were evicted last year from a mobile 
home park in Pico Rivera and forced to spend three months living in a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Garcia, manager of the Westland Estates mobile home park, said O'Hara was 
evicted because she failed to pay $5,000 in back rent and frequently feuded 
with neighbors. Garcia said one neighbor accused O'Hara of throwing a can of 
dog food through her front window during a dispute, a charge that O'Hara 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara ran a low-budget campaign that emphasized her long history of 
challenging the city. Two years ago, for example, she participated in 
unsuccessful recall efforts against Councilmen John G. Chavez and Garth Gardner 
after they voted for an unpopular utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ballots were counted in April, O'Hara led with 1,949 votes, 324 more 
than second-place finisher Chavez. De La Rosa, a former council member who had 
lost four years earlier, captured the third seat. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara said she won't change her style. After the dispute over office keys, 
she fired off letters to local newspapers accusing fellow council members of 
"mindless leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been called a 'gadfly' and 'rabble-rouser,' " she said. "I still wear 
those names like badges of honor."

PROSTITUTION: EFFORTS TO COMBAT IT, IDEAS ON LEGALIZING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was disappointed in your recent article, "Crackdown in West Hollywood." 
Unfortunately, the article painted an incomplete picture of the efforts to stop 
prostitution in our community. The article failed to mention the aggressive 
efforts that have been under way over the last year to eradicate this problem 
in West Hollywood. Prostitution is not unique to our city, as your article 
infers. It is a regional problem in which the resources needed to fight street 
prostitution are limited and insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, city officials have launched an intense effort to rid West 
Hollywood of prostitution and the related crimes that often follow. Some of the 
initiatives that have been under way include: 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted prostitution stings on Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard. 
Since January, 1993, more than 500 prostitutes have been arrested and 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing foot and bike patrols in the area to discourage loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the judges at the Beverly Hills court to ensure that repeat 
offenders received maximum jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding local social service agencies to help youths get off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengthening the city's Neighborhood Watch programs and providing residents 
with the tools to effect change in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing pedestrian-oriented street lighting and increasing lighting 
intensity in the residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with local businesses to educate them about commercial crime 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing the city's Prostitution Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most promising initiatives under way is the recently established 
Prostitution Task Force. This interdisciplinary group, which includes 
representatives from the city, Sheriff's Department, LAPD, Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office, residents and local businesses, will work together 
to identify and implement multifaceted and effective solutions for getting 
prostitutes off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving the quality of life for the residents throughout West Hollywood is 
the city's highest priority. Many West Hollywood residents and business owners 
feel that prostitution has had a negative effect in their neighborhoods. City 
officials and the Sheriff's Department are committed to continue our 
initiatives against prostitution. To be successful, we need the help and 
support of everyone who works, lives and visits West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 ABBE LAND 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor, West Hollywood  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As was reported in the article, "Red-Blight District," illegal street 
prostitution degrades the east end of West Hollywood. Few would doubt the 
problems of illegal prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if one is open-minded and really studies the issue, there are many good 
reasons to make prostitution legal in a controlled and regulated fashion. If 
legalized and restricted to regulated and taxed houses of prostitution in 
specific commercial areas, it would be a benefit to tourism, raise revenues and 
reduce crime. It would promote safe sex through prostitution's regulation, and 
would allow for health maintenance by giving us the ability to write 
regulations demanding safe sex practices and medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 Street prostitution has been a problem on the streets of West Hollywood for 
many decades, long before West Hollywood was a city. It will not go away with 
law enforcement if it has not by now disappeared. Like any prohibition, it only 
encourages undesirable criminals to skirt the laws. There are, conversely, many 
good reasons to legalize prostitution now in a regulated and organized way.

CIVIC CENTER: A REQUEST TO CUT HEIGHT OF RAND BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 23, 1993, the Santa Monica City Council approved the Civic Center 
Specific Plan with a unanimous vote, ending a four-year struggle between the 
RAND developers and controlled-growth advocates. The plan had been in a 
constant state of revision, culminating in a 17-page Errata Report which was 
distributed to the council as the item was being introduced at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among his colleagues, Councilman Kelly Olsen said that he thought the 
development was too big (at 1.9 million square feet), but that he felt 
obligated to add his approval because, at a meeting the previous day, the RAND 
developers had agreed to his request that they cut the height of their 
buildings. He repeated this explanation at a Santa Monicans for Renters Rights 
City Council candidate-review meeting, where he sought the SMRR endorsement, 
adding that RAND would not have agreed to the height reduction unless he 
complied with their wish for unanimous approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the now-defunct Civic Center Specific Plan Advisory Committee 
for that long four years, and a retired urban planner and transportation 
analyst, it is not surprising that I read the Errata Report with some care 
after the Nov. 23 council meeting, to see what changes had been incorporated 
into the now-approved final version. I'm sorry to report that the maximum 
allowed height of the RAND buildings was not reduced as Councilman Olsen had 
reported, but had actually been increased by 14 feet over the maximum agreed 
upon in the latest version. 
</P>
<P>
 I telephoned Councilman Olsen and, as gently as I could, told him that he had 
been hoodwinked by the developers. He assured me that if my information was 
correct, he would ask for reconsideration of the issue and would change his 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 I never heard back from Councilman Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been puzzled by Councilman Olsen's failure to get back to me on this, 
but I did not pursue it since it was apparently another done deal by the 
council. However, now Councilman Olsen is again calling himself a slow-growth 
candidate, and is again taking credit for getting RAND to reduce the height 
limit in the Civic Center -- which never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves the question -- why did this happen? I can only surmise that the 
RAND-Council-Planning Commission-city staff pro-development team decided to 
stonewall on this issue and persuaded Councilman Olsen to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 As he said at SMRR's candidate review meeting, the result would have been the 
same whether it was a 7-0 or a 6-1 vote. The Specific Plan would have been 
approved in either case. But with his vote, the pro-plan campaign could flaunt 
the "unanimous approval by City Council -- which never agrees on anything" tag 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Even sadder, another good man, who has tried his best to do the right, caring 
thing for this city, has been convinced that there are times when it is prudent 
to vote against his principles. Saddest of all, perhaps, he couldn't even 
collect on his part of this horse trade.

OUT AND ABOUT / THE GATE: THE COMFORT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, The Gate looks like almost any other trendy La Cienega 
Boulevard nightclub. But once you step under the wrought-iron archway and into 
the reception area, it's a place more akin to an English country estate than a 
Westside club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gate opened three years ago where the La Cage Aux Folles nightclub used to 
be, and is its antithesis in every way. The carpets are thick Turkish throw 
rugs, hand-painted frescoes decorate the ceilings and books line the walls. 
Deep sofas and overstuffed chairs provide the ultimate in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10,000-square-foot club has a dining area, two seating areas, two outdoor 
patios with gas fireplaces and a dance floor that serves as the club's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the Gallery, a roped-off VIP section where patrons can socialize 
and drink $300 bottles of champagne, conveniently placed in buckets next to 
every seating area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been built and designed to be a nightclub," said co-owner Mario Oliver, 
who has created such hot spots as Tryst and Club Vertigo. "This is the kind of 
place we want people to feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 It has become one of the trendiest clubs in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good feeling of what people want," said Oliver, a former model and 
native of Paris, who also manages the day-to-day operations of the club. "Each 
night, I come to the club as a customer." 
</P>
<P>
 Things start to hop after 11 p.m. when the disc jockey starts spinning tunes 
from disco to hip hop and techno. 
</P>
<P>
 Nightclubs generally don't have the best reputation for food but you may want 
to try the fare at The Gate. Under the direction of new chef David McMilan, 
formerly of the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, a menu has been prepared that 
is certain to attract a loyal crowd. House specials include lobster quesadilla, 
grilled Ahi tuna and an assortment of pasta dishes. And if you prefer something 
light, there are a number of hot and cold appetizers. Prices range from $8 for 
appetizers to $24 for entrees. Dinner is served from 8:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
Reservations are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gate, 643 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles. Open Wednesday through 
Saturday from 8:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Admission is $10 on weekdays; $15 on 
weekends. Entry to the Gallery VIP section is $75 a person and reservations are 
required. Information: (310) 859-5568. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

SPORTS; HE HAS THE TRIP TO OMAHA DOWN PAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Pepperdine baseball Coach Pat Harrison knows the way to Omaha and the 
College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, 48, also knows how to win at Omaha. He has been associated with four 
College World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Harrison was the starting second baseman for USC, which won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973 and '74, Harrison helped guide the Trojans to the championship as a 
member of the USC coaching staff under Rod Dedeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, as an assistant under Oklahoma's Larry Cochell, Harrison had a 
hand in a fourth national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Pepperdine began its search to replace Andy Lopez, who resigned June 
20 to become coach at Florida, the first person it turned to was Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to have a business or a school show interest and pursue you," 
Harrison said. "I think Pepperdine has a great baseball tradition, even better 
than some people realize, and I hope to continue that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 After he was hired, Harrison brought in former Dodger and Angel pitcher Geoff 
Zahn, who will coach the Wave pitchers. Zahn was the athletic director at The 
Master's College in Newhall, where Harrison was coach from 1987-90. The 
Master's competes in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with the experience I bring from the major leagues, I have a lot to 
add to this program," said Zahn, who had a 18-year professional career. "We're 
going to try and maintain what Andy started and put in a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four seasons, Harrison has been a hitting and fielding coach with 
the Sooners. Last season, Oklahoma finished 50-17 with a 13-4 victory over 
Georgia Tech in the College World Series title game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Harrison was studying to become a Presbyterian minister at Fuller 
Seminary in Pasadena when he received an invitation from Dedeaux to be an 
assistant at USC. He has also coached at Washington State and Oral Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard nothing but good things about the guy from friends in Orange 
County who played at Oklahoma," said Pepperdine infielder David Newhan, who 
spent the summer playing in the Cape Cod League in Massachusetts. "We have 
three Oklahoma kids on our team and they were saying they would be real 
disappointed if he left because he is a good coach and a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Harrison became USC's first two-time All-American. During his 
senior season, he batted .278 and led the Trojans in runs batted in with 47 to 
help USC win the national championship. He was selected by the Dodgers in the 
first round of the secondary phase of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first day in major league training camp, Harrison tore his left 
hamstring. He quit as a player after 2 1/2 seasons in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has been a college hitting instructor to several major league 
players, most notably John Olerud of Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my main strengths is teaching hitting. I also understand the struggles 
a fielder can have in a ballgame. I consider myself a players' coach because of 
the positive feedback I have received over the years from my former players." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison will be pressed to match Lopez's record. In six seasons as coach, 
Lopez guided the Waves to four NCAA playoff appearances and the 1992 national 
championship. His record was 241-107. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Pepperdine players enjoyed playing for Lopez, some say he did 
not handle internal problems that existed last season between veteran players 
and community college transfers. The Waves finished 33-20 and failed to make 
the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt some of the players had a difficult time getting adjusted to the 
program coming from junior colleges," Pepperdine starting first baseman Ruben 
Gamboa said. "Hopefully, that will change." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Treul, who played left field after transferring from Rancho 
Santiago: "We were not getting along as a team. We were not jelling well. We 
were treated like intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear Coach Harrison is a good guy. I just hope he is not timid and takes 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Matt Wise, who will be a sophomore, looks forward to working with 
Zahn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do whatever it takes to win," Wise said. "I just want to get to 
Omaha." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison believes he can lead Pepperdine to another national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to the top of Division I with a variety of different players," he 
said. "I know how to get there and how to win. I'm realistic to know you need 
to win a few games you probably don't deserve to win and you need lucky breaks. 
But Pepperdine has been there before and I believe I can take them there 
again."

 Former Santa Monica High receiver Michael Jackson tore ligaments in his right 
knee during a July 20 practice for the 43rd annual California Shrine All-Star 
Football Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was among 64 of the state's best recently graduated high school 
players selected to play in the game, underwent surgery July 27 and is expected 
to be sidelined seven to eight months. Jackson, who will attend Washington 
State on a scholarship, is expected to apply for a redshirt freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing a (pass) pattern when the quarterback threw the ball short," 
Jackson said. "I came back to try and catch it. I turned quickly and my cleats 
got caught in the grass." 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, Jackson caught 30 passes for 563 yards and four touchdowns and 
rushed 25 times for 461 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back," Jackson said.

 Santa Monica High is looking for girls' basketball and girls' swimming 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Overseer, who was the Viking girls' basketball coach, resigned to become 
coach at Chadwick. Teri Mueller, the girls' swimming coach, went to China on a 
two-year sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested candidates should contact Santa Monica Athletic Director Frank 
Nishimura at (310) 395-3204. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishimura also announced that the school is trying to reinstate its 
freshmen-sophomore baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key problem is always money," Nishimura said about the program, which was 
dropped in 1990. "We have only one or two underclassmen on a junior varsity 
team and the whole baseball program is suffering because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The school is planning several fund-raisers in an attempt to reinstate the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Santa Monica College baseball team program was recently 
eliminated, six Corsairs received scholarships to four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are pitcher Chris Brennan (Cal State Sacramento), pitcher Tony 
Palka (Cal State Dominguez Hills), outfielders Martin Schmidt and Mark Walker 
(San Francisco State), pitcher Dean Davidson and shortstop Dylan Sugar (Texas 
Pan American).

 The folks at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus are showing 
uncharacteristic restraint -- make that, an Amazing Deficit of Hyperbolic 
Hoopla -- in marketing this year's show, which opens today and runs through 
Aug. 14 at the Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters are billing headliners Romeo and Juliette, the show's 20-month-old 
Asian elephants, as "the babies all America wants to see." Not "thrill to," not 
"idolize," not even "admire." Just "see." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at a recent show in Long Beach, the pair's performance probably didn't 
raise anybody's heart rate. Heralded by a gaudy, pre-intermission revue and 
attended by their trainers and mothers, the twosome briefly intertwined trunks 
and later stood on one foot, staring curiously at the audience while ringmaster 
Jim Ragona literally sang their praises. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are showier animal acts in this 2 1/2-hour show, including 
Graham Thomas Chipperfield's teeterboard stunts with three elephants and the 
Boulibekov Riders' daring acrobatics aboard galloping horses. But as R & J's 
primary trainer, Patricia Zerbini, stressed, it's what these 1,500-pound babies 
are , not what they do , that's so impressive.

 Born just 11 days apart, Romeo and Juliette are the first Asian elephants 
conceived and delivered on the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Elephant 
Farm, a 20-acre research and breeding facility operated by the company outside 
of Gainesville, Fla. They were sired by a common father.  
</P>
<P>
 Zerbini, 30, who managed the facility with husband Theodore Svertesky until 
she went on the road with the babies this year, said the animals represent a 
milestone in the circus's efforts to replenish the dwindling Asian elephant 
population in the United States and, hopefully, abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preservation of the species is the main goal of the farm," said Zerbini in a 
phone interview between shows at the L.A. Sports Arena. In addition to 
dwindling habitat, ivory-poaching continues to shrink the elephant population 
in Asia and Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 "A male elephant typically won't start breeding successfully until age 30 or 
35," she explained. "That's also when they have the heaviest ivory, so that's 
when they get poached off."  
</P>
<P>
 The farm, established in 1985, is participating in an artificial insemination 
program that Zerbini said will soon be introduced on game preserves in Asia. 
Typical gestation for an Asian elephant is 22 months, and it can take several 
tries to achieve a fruitful pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Romeo and Juliette's birth mothers -- Zerbini said she considers herself their 
"surrogate mom" -- are Icky and Alana, who are in their late teens and two of 
the younger elephants of Ringling Bros. 60-member herd. (Most Ringling Bros.' 
performing elephants in the two touring companies are in their 30s and 40s; the 
7.3-ton King Tusk, "The Largest Land Mammal Traveling the Face of the World 
Today" say the circus promotions, is 49). Former circus performers Icky and 
Alana will travel with the babies until they wean them at about the age of 2, 
then will be returned to the farm, where they join a small breeding herd that 
the trainer hopes will ultimately produce one or two babies per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on their temperaments and the success of their training, Romeo and 
Juliette will probably perform with the show for about 15 years before settling 
down as breeders on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the road, the babies and their mothers travel apart from the other 
elephant performers in a customized 100-foot rail car. While their moms consume 
a typical daily menu of three to five bales of hay, 25 pounds each of sweet 
feed, Elephant Chow (a mineral and vitamin supplement), fruits and vegetables 
and a half dozen or so loaves of bread, the babies have just started to try 
solid food. They've already developed a sweet tooth, though. Their favorite 
snack: marshmallows -- by the bagful, please. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elephants are kind of like kids; they like that special treat once in a 
while," explained Zerbini, laughing as she recalled how the babies let their 
tastes be known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, they didn't have teeth, so we were trying to come up with a treat 
for them that they didn't have to chew. One day, we were having a family 
barbecue and we had these marshmallows. My kids gave them one, and they just 
slurped them down. Now, some of the bears and even a lion in the show like 
them."

POP; THE BEAT OF TRADITION; KING SUNNY ADE STAYS CLOSE TO HIS LOVE -- AND LIFE 
-- NIGERIA'S RELIGIOUS AND COURT MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Edition staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buried in the press release announcing the new live album from King Sunny Ade 
is a line to chill the heart of any fan of African music: A few years ago, the 
Nigerian juju star was all but ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ade laughs warmly when asked about it and says he's sorry he ever 
mentioned it. Besides, he adds, it was only half-true: "I wanted to retire from 
the stage, but not from the music. But the people in Nigeria and all over the 
world didn't want me even to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk up a victory for the fan club. Ade has released some brilliant albums 
over his 30-year career, but it is on stage that his music really comes to 
life. His voice and guitar lead an 18-piece touring band -- talking drums, 
pedal steel, keyboards, guitars, bass and more -- through hypnotically 
percolating rhythms that build to considerable power. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only imagine what it would be like to hear him on his own turf, with 
his full orchestra of 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I can think of, I get from my music," he says. Recently, however, 
music has had to make room for a new interest. About five years ago Ade started 
making movies, writing, producing and directing films for Nigerian television 
and theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has acted in some, but being in front of a camera is nothing new for 
Ade. He has been making music videos for 12 years, full-length projects that 
are sold in Nigerian stores alongside his albums. He also has acted in other 
people's films, including one U.S. release, Robert Altman's offbeat "O.C. and 
Stiggs," filmed in 1984 but not released until '87. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his new involvement in all aspects of film grew out of a national 
movement to provide Nigeria's 120 million people with an alternative on TV and 
in theaters to the U.S. and European product that has dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ade believes that many of the imported films and TV shows are too violent. 
Just as his music draws from traditional sources, so do most of his films, 
relying on traditional African settings and themes. He considers it to be 
important work, and it was a desire to devote more time to it that led to his 
short-lived "retirement" announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as he says, he always intended to continue recording (he makes two studio 
albums a year in Nigeria) and making music videos. For Ade, life without music 
in some form is unimaginable. "It's what I love most. It is part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 His love of music started early. In Nigeria, as in most of sub-Saharan Africa, 
music is more than entertainment; it is an integral part of daily life, "like 
sugar to your tea," Ade says. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in the '60s, he heard some U.S. musicians, such as James Brown and 
B.B. King, and he professes an admiration to this day: "I love them and the way 
they sing, the way they handle their instruments." But his inspiration and his 
model always has been juju music. 
</P>
<P>
 Juju is an extension of the Yoruba religious and court music that has been 
played in Africa for hundreds of years. Modern juju retains the rhythmic 
patterns and call-and-response vocals of pre-colonial times. The 
instrumentation has changed, first with the introduction of the acoustic guitar 
in the '30s and later with other alterations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my generation, we went from accordion to keyboards, from African violin to 
pedal steel, from African thumb piano to bass guitar," Ade says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such traditional rhythm instruments as talking drums and gourd 
shakers are used, drum kits and even electronic drums have been added. Modern 
juju was made complete by the introduction of electric guitar. Still, Ade 
insists that the music "sticks to the roots," and he and most other juju 
musicians continue to sing in Yoruba. 
</P>
<P>
 The "King" in his name is no idle claim. Ade was born into royalty, which only 
complicated his decision to pursue a career in music. In grade school, he 
enlisted in a "boys' brigade" band, playing school instruments. When he decided 
to drop out of school in 1963 to play music full time, he was terrified of his 
family's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult for me to tell them I want to play. I was scared and 
afraid, so I ran away." In fact, he ran more than 300 miles away; he told his 
family he was in university when actually he had changed his name (to his 
current moniker) and was playing in semi-professional juju bands in Lagos, the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 He became so successful that his family saw his picture on a poster and 
tracked him down. But by then his decision was firm: "I don't mind what people 
will do to me," he told them. "I want to be a musician." Eventually he won 
their approval. "Everything is OK now," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, he formed his own band, calling it the Green Spots, a cheeky 
challenge to the leading juju band of the day, I.K. Dairo and the Blue Spots. 
As it turned out, Green Spot also was a cigarette brand, which led to some 
confusion. "I don't smoke, I don't drink, so we turned it into the African 
Beats," Ade says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the '70s, Ade and Ebenezer Obey had eclipsed Dairo as the foremost 
practitioner of juju music in Nigeria (other forms popular there included 
"highlife," a calypso-flavored, mostly horn-driven dance music, and "Afrobeat," 
pioneered by the fiercely political Fela Anikulapo-Kuti). 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ade and Obey eventually were signed to major Western labels, but it was 
Ade who emerged as the prime international force. In the early '80s, it was 
predicted that he would do for African music what Bob Marley had done for 
reggae, and Island Records released two albums in the United States ("Juju 
Music" and "Synchro-System") that remain the high points of his recorded output 
outside Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he built a loyal following with regular tours and became perhaps the 
best-known African pop musician of the decade, Ade never quite achieved the 
mainstream success in the United States that some had hoped for. For several 
years, his profile has been decidedly low. A tour announced earlier this year, 
which was to have been his first since 1990, was canceled abruptly. His 
recorded output since 1987 has been limited to a rarely played live album 
released three years ago by Rykodisc. 
</P>
<P>
 So his extensive current tour -- some 50 dates -- marks a welcome return. 
What's more, I.R.S. has released a new live album, recorded in 1990 at the 
Palace in Hollywood. While he's in the States, Ade is putting the finishing 
touches on a new studio album he recorded in Seattle and hopes to release here 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He is happy to be back on the road: "We've had beautiful, beautiful, nice 
audiences. All the time I'm glad." 
</P>
<P>
 That he can be so glad at a time when Africa faces myriad problems (his own 
Nigeria has been paralyzed in recent weeks by widespread strikes aimed at the 
military government) indicates that King Sunny's disposition lives up to his 
name. Ade always has stayed away from politics in his music, and said he is not 
about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided not to (write about politics), because if every musician is 
singing political songs, nobody is singing the other songs."  
</P>
<P>
 His music concentrates instead on "sharing the happiness between me and the 
people, between the instrument and the player, the dancer and drummer. The 
major thing is the love. I want to say, let's make friends today, because we 
may not have tomorrow."

 IN CAPISTRANO: SWEETHEARTS OF THE RODEO 
</P>
<P>
 These two harmonizing sisters recently stepped off the ladder to big-time 
country stardom and made a bluegrass-flavored, highly traditional album for an 
independent label. The Sweethearts play the Coach House on Tuesday, Aug. 9. 
Gina Quartaro, a promising local, will open. (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 IN CAPISTRANO: MICHAEL BEEN 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly the singer/songwriter with the Call, Been recently went on his own 
with "On the Verge of a Nervous Breakthrough," a strong album that offers 
swirling psychedelia and hard-edged rock. He plays the Coach House on Saturday, 
Aug. 6. The Vigilantes of Love open. (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 IN CAPISTRANO: THE PROCLAIMERS 
</P>
<P>
 You might not want to walk 500 miles to hear Scottish twins Craig and Charlie 
Reid sing their robust, Everlys-with-a-thick-burr folk-rock, but a half-hour's 
drive shouldn't be out of the question. They're at the Coach House Sunday, Aug. 
7. Beatles-esque Greenberry Woods will open. (714) 496-8930.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Everly Brothers 
</P>
<P>
 "Walk Right Back: The Everly Brothers on Warner Bros. 1960-1969" 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Archives  
</P>
<P>
 This is the Everlys compilation to get after you've picked up the A-list 
late-'50s recordings that established them as the premiere vocal duo of the 
rock era, if not in all of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 In switching labels from Cadence to Warner Bros., which offered them one of 
the richest contracts of the era, Phil and Don continued the hit streak they'd 
had with the likes of "Bye Bye Love," "Wake Up Little Susie," "All I Have to Do 
Is Dream" and "When Will I Be Loved."The first single for the new label was 
"Cathy's Clown," which quickly went to No. 1. On the five albums encompassed on 
this bargain-priced double-CD, they continued their remarkable string with the 
country classic "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)," "Walk Right Back," "Love 
Hurts," "Lucille," "Ebony Eyes" and "Crying in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 What's particularly fascinating to students of rock history about this set is 
watching their recordings evolve over the next decade, at times seamlessly 
adapting to shifting styles in rock ("The Price of Love"), other times 
straining to sound hip ("Love of the Common People"). But no matter what the 
year, their singing remained rooted strongly in country music, and they 
delivered some of their best work at the end of the '60s, nearly a decade after 
their commercial peak, in such hauntingly beautiful records as "Bowling Green" 
and "Sing Me Back Home." RANDY LEWIS

COMEDY; ALL THE RIGHT MOVES; BOBBY COLLINS IS LEARNING HOW TO KEEP HIS STAR 
RISING AND HIS STANDARDS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julio came calling. The Certs people came back. And the ratings came up two 
points. Comedian Bobby Collins is having a pretty good year. The kind of year, 
in fact, that many entertainers would consider a career year. So will such 
success spoil the New York native? 
</P>
<P>
 Not if a recent phone interview from his Santa Monica home is any indication. 
He remains down to earth, personable and highly professional and loves to flap. 
</P>
<P>
 "My career has been on a steady incline. I'd rather take my time and be there 
for a long time," he said, pausing a moment. "But you have to have a good time 
getting there. It's the journey, not the destination. You can afford to say no. 
It doesn't begin and end with Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins admits, however, that it's tempting to grab the first sitcom or talk 
show that comes along. He has turned down two sitcom ideas and is looking at 
two more. But he's seen snap decisions go sour too many times; for every Jerry 
Seinfeld and Tim Allen, he points out, there are legions of now nameless 
relics. 
</P>
<P>
 "These other guys go big and then you never hear from them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins credits opening for Cher and Frank Sinatra and especially this 
summer's world tour with Julio Iglesias with showing him how to keep his career 
moving and his standards high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work with the best and you learn. (Julio's) taught me to be a star. It's 
really an honor. This guy is like Mr. International. And the women love him. I 
don't understand a word he says, but he's putting my kids through college. He 
has 11 people on his security force, but he's like a guy me and you would hang 
out with. He took me on his jet." 
</P>
<P>
 Tour stops include London, Dublin, Montreal, Belgium and Australia. Collins, 
however, only opens at the English-speaking venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty-nine down, 33 to go," he said. "In between, I have to go back to the 
comedy clubs to work on new material." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Collins will visit Fullerton's Standing Room Only on Friday and 
Saturday. "I'm kind of nervous. I'll be breaking in some new stuff. We have to 
talk about O.J., my new baby, Clinton, soccer, summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins landed the Iglesias gig when the global pop star saw the comic on 
VH-1's "Stand-Up Spotlight," which he started hosting in January, after Rosie 
O'Donnell's 3 1/2 years in the slot.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, 'It has nothing to do with me. I think they just needed a new 
host,' " Collins said, referring to the two-point popularity hike. He quickly 
added, though, that they're good friends and he can say things like that. "I'm 
real happy with VH-1. I'm proud of it. Whether it's me or not, it's doing real 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Other chores he has tackled at VH-1 included being host of "Top 21 Countdown" 
and the "VH-1/Cystic Fibrosis Annual Celebrity Ski Special." On Showtime he 
co-starred with Margaret Cho in "A Pair of Jokers," and additional TV credits 
include parts on NBC's "L.A. Law" and "Sisters" as well as Fox's "Herman's 
Head."  
</P>
<P>
 His recent film work includes appearances in "Hero" and "Indecent Proposal."  
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into all this is an upcoming photo spread in GQ magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming out in September. I got it because I got voted a good dresser in 
US magazine. It's four pages. To me, I should've gotten 10," he said, laughing 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for someone who was hardly a household face until he took his bad 
breath national a couple of years ago. And now, the Certs people are back with 
another ad campaign idea, which can only mean more recognition for the 
performer already widely known as "The Certs Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 39, accepts that the ads launched his popularity, and says thanks for 
good fortune's many flavors, especially spearmint and wintergreen. Certs has 
been very, very good to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But his success as a breath-mints pitchman is by no means the engine for his 
career. His comedy provides that power. And Collins has no illusions about 
himself, labeling himself a glorified teller of tales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a guy who can tell a story and add the salt, pepper and paprika to make 
it interesting and fun to laugh at because it's all true. It's funny. It's the 
simple things. My dog bought me a new house," Collins said, launching into one 
of his more popular bits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Bobby, can I have some salsa?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You like that stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I love that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'll give you some because I love you ." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year stand-up veteran pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know that if you give a dog salsa, its butt shoots across a room." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the success and recognition, The Certs Guy does harbor one little 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't I be known as the Large-Loins Guy?" 
</P>

WANNA DANCE?: EMPIRE BALLROOM: '80S SUN HASN'T SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Empire Ballroom is among the more attractive nightclubs in the region. And 
it's definitely among the best designs by Rick McCormick of Hatch Design, whose 
credits also include the Shark Club in Costa Mesa and Metropolis in Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 But as a club choice among the county's hot spots, it's a moldy one. Six 
months after a flashy opening, the Costa Mesa nightclub is in need of a 
promoter with a clue. Its designed slickness, combined with its even slicker 
crowd, makes an evening here like a return to the tawdry '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Three words describe this glorified Red Onion crowd: pumps, perms and pecs. 
Beepers are optional. The scene comes right out of the film "Less Than Zero." 
On a couple of recent evenings, there was a constant urge among at least five 
visitors to search out Robert Downey Jr., Judd Nelson or some other brat 
packer.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the bar seems right out of the previous decade with its pricey drinks. 
Domestic draft beer, bottled water and sodas are safe bets at $2. Even bottled 
imports and domestics are OK at $3. But value eludes everything else: cocktails 
(weak, watered down or too sweet every time) are $4 to $6; a glass of wine is 
$4. And orders of Newcastle, Guinness or Bass for $3 barely fill up a half-pint 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam patrol is working overtime here. It seems everyone is looking for 
someone, and they are tireless in their prowl. Roses are bought and passed out 
like business cards. Don't be surprised at the frequency with which the same 
lines are tossed out (are they written on the bathroom walls?). Regulars take 
reaching out and touching someone literally. It's difficult for anyone -- male 
or female -- to squeeze through the crowd and not get handled.  
</P>
<P>
 And if that's not enough touchy behavior for you, try the loft. No other VIP 
room can boast such "efficient" security. The tough guy at the top of the 
stairs brings literal meaning to the word pushy, evidently believing actions 
speak louder than courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Business at the Empire Ballroom, limited to three nights a week, 
isn't hurting. Management says the club draws an average of about 800 patrons 
each weekend night, and this seems true most of the time. The dance floor and 
its surrounding area is thick with revelers, and the bartenders rarely get a 
moment to rest. The red velvet couches stay warm with dancers sitting one out 
and couples making out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lower cover charge, Fridays have been less consistent than 
Saturdays. That could change with the recent installation of Johnny's Joint, 
hosted by promoter Johnny Drummond (of Mocambo fame, which floated around Costa 
Mesa and Newport Beach a few years ago). Johnny's Joint will alternate between 
the Empire Ballroom and John Dominis in Newport Beach every other week, 
beginning the first Friday of the month at Empire. You'll know it's there 
because of the banners that go up over the Empire signs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the turntable on Drummond's nights is deejay Priest, who rotates a diverse 
musical menu including selections by Dr. Dre, AC/DC, the Pointer Sisters, Van 
Morrison, Culture Club and Elvis. It's a formula copied from deejay Gary, who 
held a highly successful club night at Night Moves in Huntington Beach (now 
Club 5902) in the late '80s. Apparently the format peaked back then, because 
Priest can't drive the crowds to the dance floor like Gary used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejay Tony Largo sits in on Friday nights when Johnny's Joint is not in the 
house, offering a danceable selection of hip-hop and disco. Ditto the grooves 
on Saturdays with deejay Gio.  
</P>
<P>
 Largo delivers straight '70s hits on Wednesdays with Dance Fever, as the night 
is called. While Thursdays have unofficially become the disco night at most 
county nightclubs, Empire is apparently trying to catch those who can't wait 
another day for their dose of Donna Summer.  
</P>
<P>
 The front entrance is closed that night, so patrons must use the side door, 
which leads directly to the dance floor. A partition shuts off the foyer and 
one of the small bars near the five pool tables, keeping things cozy for the 
fewer than 300 folks in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night, "appropriate club attire" is the dress code. That means no 
tattered jeans, no grunge or gang-type attire. White undershirts are apparently 
OK as long as they hug a fine physique. 
</P>
<P>
 Valet parking is $3, or hit the self parking in the Standard Brands parking 
lot next door and pay only $2.

TRIED & TRUE; POOL POINTERS RACK UP POCKET CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If cue balls were people, I'd be considered equal to Joe Frazier by now. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been pounding on them since I was a kid, punching, flailing, hammering, 
poking, ramming at them in a frustrated effort to get them to do something 
other than roll aimlessly around the green felt. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd marveled at such wizards as Willie Mosconi and Steve Mizerak, who could 
make the cue ball sing four arias from "Aida," win the Indy 500 and, by the 
way, still pocket the shot. They were effortless and smooth and very, very 
cool. Heck, if they wanted to, they could draw the ball backward into the 
parking lot with a shot so silky-looking it would barely make a sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But all I could do was pound on the stupid thing, and the best I'd been able 
to do was to stop the ball dead after the cue ball struck the object ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But at this writing, one day after spending an hour shooting pool with a woman 
who looks about as much like Willie Mosconi as Elle MacPherson looks like Yogi 
Berra, I can yank the ball all the way back to San Diego. And, oh yeah -- I can 
probably make the shot too. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's the very, very cool part: I can do it without beating the ball like 
a dirty rug. Now it's more like Zorro casually carving up Sgt. Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong; most serious pool players will still eviscerate me. But I 
know at least two or three guys who have regularly beaten me silly at 
eight-ball over the years who are about to lose their beer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, Robin Bell. You're my hero. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a two-time Women's Pool and Billiards Assn. world champion, and she 
can make the cue ball dance "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, cheerful and patient, agreed to provide me with a one-hour tutorial 
last week at Danny K's Cafe and Billiards in Orange in the hope (mine) that it 
would prove that even the most cloddish cue handler can learn a couple of 
basics and at least look more confident. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence turned out to be a kind of buzzword in our session. After watching 
me jerkily shove a table full of balls around without much result, Robin 
stopped me and announced that she had spotted -- immediately -- my two most 
glaring errors. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she said, I was hitting every shot using the same bridge -- that is, 
holding the cue in my forward hand exactly the same way on every stroke. I was 
using what she called a "follow" bridge, essential when you want the cue ball 
to continue rolling after it strikes the object ball but worse than useless if 
you want to draw the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, "you don't have any confidence," she said. "You're hitting the ball as 
if you don't believe you're going to make the shot. You're poking at it and 
then jumping right back." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sure. I've never figured on making a shot. That's why I like to play 
pool: Every good shot is such a nice surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Robin said, that sort of thinking is pure death to serious players. You 
have to get down over the ball with all the icy cockiness of a safecracker.  
</P>
<P>
 We worked on it. Robin lined up four balls across the table about a third of 
the way from my nearest rail and told me to shoot them into the far corner 
pocket -- using not my old "follow" bridge, but one she showed me, a "draw" 
bridge. The draw bridge involves flattening your bridge hand tightly on the 
felt, lowering the cue and striking the cue ball below center. 
</P>
<P>
 But that alone wasn't enough. I must, Robin said, "stroke through" the cue 
ball and remain hunched over the table after the stroke, not merely poke it and 
leap out of the way. I must not give the ball a big whack. Stroke it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first couple of tries found me back in my old pattern: I couldn't seem to 
resist backing off immediately to see if the ball was headed for the pocket. 
Forget that, Robin said. Take a few seconds to line up, then, when you're 
satisfied, get down over the ball, settle in and make the shot. Stay down. 
Stroke through the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to my enormous delight, the cue ball drew back so cleanly and smoothly 
that I was still watching it when the object ball rattled into the far corner 
pocket. Robin smiled, pleased. I was still in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Back the ball came, again and again. Soon Robin had me drawing it back to 
specific points on the table, a bit of precision I had only dreamed about. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the follow shot. I already knew the bridge. Robin showed me how to 
position the tip of the cue on the ball and reminded me that I was still to use 
the same long, smooth stroke. Into the pockets rolled the balls, and the cue 
ball was following and stopping almost exactly where Robin indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like unwrapping a really terrific present. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried a few breaks, a bit of business I had never been good at. Same follow 
technique, she said, only with a stronger stroke. The cue ball struck with a 
completely satisfying whip-crack sound, and the rack of balls scattered 
gloriously all over the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin reminded me that it's actually impossible to achieve any kind of 
continuity with a single hour lesson for $50 (she usually teaches them at Danny 
K's in packages of six and is much in demand), but I smelled blood anyway. 
There were clocks to be cleaned, old humiliations to avenge, adversaries to be 
dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe even a nickname to be adopted. "Fast Eddie" is very, very cool, but 
it's taken. 
</P>
<P>
 How does "Half-Fast Pat" sound?

SURFING: PAST, PRESENT CELEBRITIES SWELL ACTION AT OP PRO CONTEST, PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how organized professional surfing contests are, surprises still 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Tom Curren, the immensely popular three-time world champion 
who showed up but didn't compete in last week's Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Were promoters dissed? 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a dog-and-pony show to find Curren and have him (compete)," said Allan 
Seymour, special-events director for the Op Pro. "And he didn't even have the 
courtesy to tell us he wasn't going to be in it. We found this bit of news out 
when Curren was seen signing autographs on Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Curren told organizers (after the contest had started) that he 
couldn't compete because he had to attend his mother's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Curren, who is semi-retired and living in France, attend your contest 
is like seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger out in public. People hoot, they cheer. 
Women get antsy over Tom's good looks, while men sit back and enjoy watching a 
master work the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig knows of Curren's celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 There's always that expectation, the hope that some day Tommy will come back 
and surf in competition. After all, if he ever returns, a lot of people believe 
he will take that fourth world championship to tie Australia's Mark Richards.  
</P>
<P>
 Also under the surprise category, our own Rockin' Fig got his 15 minutes in 
the limelight (well, actually more like several 15-hour days) when the 
contest's backup announcer failed to appear. Yep, Fig, who, as a grommet, hung 
around the announcer's booth at major surfing contests just to get a second or 
two behind the microphone, went to bat and joined Portugal's multilingual Nuno 
Jonet, the World Tour's main announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Fig if there was also a chance of his announcing the U.S. Open of 
Surfing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 I am doing it, Fig said, with no doubt in his voice, indignant that the 
question was even asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, excuuuuuse me! 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Cairns, U.S. Open of Surfing contest director, said of Fig: "He doesn't 
complain, he's always on time and he does a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Fig says the Open, which continues through Sunday, is going to be quite the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not big. It's BIG! They're gonna have that big surf expo with lots of 
people glassing and shaping boards right on the sand near the pier. Plus, 
forecasters are expecting a big swell, possibly mid-week. PIER SIGHTS AND 
SOUNDS: 
</P>
<P>
 Party Time: Seymour, surfing's unofficial historian, also helped organize last 
week's soiree at the Waterfront Hilton hosted by Ocean Pacific Apparel Corp., 
which featured a string of former Op Pro winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had fun digging up some of the names of these former champions," 
Seymour said. "I even got Jack Haley, owner of Captain Jack's Restaurant in 
Sunset Beach, who in 1959 won the inaugural men's contest." 
</P>
<P>
 Former winners included Louie Tarter, winner of the Op Pro Juniors from Laguna 
Beach in the early 1960s. Seymour said that in attendance was Ron Sizemore, who 
won in 1961, Linda Benson, who in 1959 won the inaugural event for women, and 
Joyce Hoffman, the contest's five-time women's champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also enjoying themselves at the party were Robert August, of "Endless Summer" 
movie fame; Sunny Garcia, who won the Op last year, and Frieda Zamba, who the 
day after the party killed her heat and went on to win the Op's women's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Stuff: Two top juniors, Tim Curran of Oxnard and Hawaii's Kalani Robb, 
were smokin' at the Op Pro contest. Fig said Robb made it to the main event -- 
round three of the men's division -- and also won the juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw Kalani pull a floater 360! The finals for the juniors was insane because 
all those guys were doing futuristic moves. They weren't sticking quite as much 
to the criteria as the surfing you see in the men's category.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Welcome: Robb was cited by Huntington Beach police, who said he, ahem, 
jaywalked PCH. Welcome to Surf City, Kalani. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mood: Paul Johnson, who performed the national anthem on electric guitar "surf 
style," got heavy raves and helped kick off the Op Pro's tandem event Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Roots: In the Op Pro's celebrity invitational, surfing celebrities 
included L. J. Richards, a heavy Huntington Beach Pier rider in the '60s, San 
Clemente lifeguard Richard Chew and Robert (Wingnut) Weaver, one of the stars 
from Bruce Brown's movie "Endless Summer II." Interesting story on Chew, a 
lifeguard who still competes on longboards. I talk to him on the phone from 
time to time, but he never mentioned his Seal Beach roots. Seymour says Chew 
was the factory rider for Rich Harbour of Harbour Surfboards in Seal Beach and 
was like a god in that beach community. "Oh, yeah," Seymour continued, "Chew 
was a major player there in Seal Beach, though he now is in San Clemente." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Signing of the Times: The two most popular people at the Op Pro? According to 
some, Kelly Slater and Weaver. Both spent time signing autographs as they 
finished surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel: To Huntington Beach lifeguards, especially Lt. Bill Richardson, whose 
attitude for contest organizers was, "Hey, what can we do for you?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dart: To Longboarder magazine for describing Cardiff's Rob Machado as "that 
grommet." C'mon guys. Machado is the reigning U.S. Bud Tour champion and Sunday 
won the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big Footsteps: The Walk of Fame inauguration is at 10 a.m. today in Huntington 
Beach, Main Street and PCH. Expected celebrities include Joyce Hoffman, Bruce 
Brown and August. Prime Ticket, which is producing the U.S. Open, will tape the 
event for later airing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's Swell: Prime Ticket is co-hosting, with the national Surfrider 
Foundation and the Hard Rock Cafe, a benefit tonight at 5:30 p.m. at the Hard 
Rock in Newport Beach. Chris Isaak provides the music. For $100, you'll be 
having fun and helping clean up the ocean. Meanwhile, Gordon LaBedz says the 
foundations' Seal Beach chapter will hold a fund-raising barbecue Aug. 20 
(national Clean Water Day) at the Shore Shop, 321 Seal Beach Blvd. In 
conjunction with this, Hennessey's Tavern in Seal Beach is selling Buy-a-Wave 
raffle ticket. For $1, you get a chance at a trip to Cabo for two, and the 
money helps with environmental projects, LaBedz said.

DO IT!: UJENA 5,000 PROMISES TO BE A MODEL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On hand Sunday morning for the running of the Ujena 5,000 in Dana Point will 
be KNBC, "Entertainment Tonight" and probably an army of still photographers. 
ESPN will also be there, filming for a planned half-hour special. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed isn't the media draw; no one is expecting this field to break any 
records. The attention-getter is a group of more than 200 women sports models 
who are running the 5K race as part of a series of events, the prize being a 
chance to be on the cover of Swimwear Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time event, the Ujena 5,000 is the only part of the competition that's 
open to public participation, and organizers are hoping for a large field with 
more than just models. 
</P>
<P>
 The run starts at Salt Creek Beach, next to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and 
promises scenic views of the Pacific as it skirts the Links at Monarch Beach 
and finishes on a park-like bluff overlooking the water. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be separate start times for men and women, not because of the 
presence of the models but "mainly because of the course constraints," said 
Scott Muirhead of Dana Point-based Race Pace Promotions, organizers of the run. 
Breaking up the field by gender has been an increasingly popular way of cutting 
down on crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 For the models, other events include a volleyball tournament, an aerobics 
contest and a swimsuit competition. The top 10 finishers will then duel in a 
"power aerobics" contest for cover-photo privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing that we're trying to do is tell people that models (aren't) 
just bimbos," said Bob Anderson, founder and publisher of the Sunnyvale-based 
magazine. "Models take care of themselves, and some of them can put in a pretty 
decent time in the 5K." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Runners who can live without putting that claim to the test have another 
seaside run they can opt for Sunday morning. The seventh annual Fiesta 5000 in 
San Clemente kicks off a one-day street festival that will include 
entertainment, food and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration starts at 6 a.m., and the 5K run/walk begins at 8 a.m. Entry is 
$20, including T-shirt. Information: (714) 492-1131. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Ujena 5,000 running race. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Sunday, Aug. 7, 8 a.m. men's race, 9 a.m. women's race. Registration 
opens at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Salt Creek Beach, Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Crown Valley Parkway 
and go south to Pacific Coast Highway, then turn left. Salt Creek Beach will be 
on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $20, including T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 661-6547.

VIDEO REWIND; SYMBOLISM HAUNTS 'FOURTH MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen years before he cashed in with the slick "Basic Instinct," Dutch 
director Paul Verhoeven created a similar but far more disturbing exploration 
of sexual obsession and murder with "The Fourth Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Author Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe) is fascinated with death and haunted by 
nightmares and delusions.He used to be able to tame the dark visions and use 
them as inspiration for his novels, but now he senses they may signal his own 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Christine (Renee Soutendijk), a beautician who tempts the bisexual 
Gerard first with her androgynous glamour, then with her money and young 
boyfriend. The writer uses the romance as a refuge from his ominous visions, 
but then he learns about his lover's past. Three marriages, three dead 
husbands. Will there be a fourth man? 
</P>
<P>
 The film, like "Basic Instinct," takes on a breakneck pace once the flawed 
hero is caught by the femme fatale's irresistible sexual gravity. Verhoeven and 
cinematographer Jan de Bont (director of "Speed") are master storytellers, 
especially with thrillers, and the viewer finds it hard to turn away, even as 
the explicit images grow more lurid. This is not a movie for the faint of 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie has an ambivalent yet satisfying finale, but even after the credits 
roll, the movie's bizarre imagery sticks with the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiders, dead birds, coffins, crucifixes and a bloody slaughterhouses are some 
of the gruesome symbols that taunt the increasingly desperate Gerard and 
consume his thoughts. "Thinking of death, I cannot sleep," the tortured writer 
says, quoting poet Boehm Bloem to describe his descent into delusion. "And not 
sleeping, I must think of death." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fourth Man" (1979), directed by Paul Verhoeven. 104 minutes. Not rated. 
Dutch with English subtitles.

KIDS ON FILM: LASSIE COMES HOME TO THE HEARTS OF YOUNGSTERS ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a frequent contributor to The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wandering Lassie is rescued from a car wreck by the Turner family, but the 
bonding and family values don't bloom until the collie survives a wolf fight 
and rich kids on tractors, among other things. (Rated PG).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OK, collie breeders, you can start making plans for that luxury condo in 
Hawaii. Your champion has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a result, kids of the latest generation are forming a mental image of 
their ideal smartest, bravest, best friend, and it looks a lot like a dog. 
Specifically, the dog, the most famous sidekick with four paws, Lassie. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest film of the same name isn't exactly a nail-biting, car chase-loaded 
action picture with loads of gunplay (actually, one shot is fired) and dazzling 
techno-glitz, but there's apparently something about Lassie that can transcend 
all that in the minds of the smaller fry. 
</P>
<P>
 That younger segment of the young set made up a good portion of the audience 
at a recent "Lassie" screening, and a few of them seemed ready to start 
pestering their parents for a collie as soon as the end credits began to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, maybe," said 10-year-old Michael Ettefagh of Yorba Linda, adding that 
he came away from the film with a sense that a genuine friendship between man 
and beast can be formed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very emotional and exciting and dramatic. I liked the part where Matt 
(the Turners' son) jumped up and tried to keep the other boy from shooting 
Lassie. It showed that he was trying to save his best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other kids who saw the film, Michael had a nodding acquaintance with 
Lassie. He recalled seeing an episode of the old television show.  
</P>
<P>
 Even 3-year-old Christina Chambers of Anaheim said she had seen Lassie films 
before going to the latest incarnation of the classic dog story. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina, with some prodding from her mother Lily, said she most vividly 
recalled Lassie's fight with a wolf in a dark cave. However, she added, "It 
wasn't too scary." 
</P>
<P>
 (Some things never change. What would a Lassie movie be without a battle with 
a wolf?) 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Ray and Andrew Aivazian of Chino Hills, ages 5 and 3, respectively, 
both said they loved the film, although Ray did most of the speaking on behalf 
of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it best," he said, "when the boy hugged Lassie at the end and that he 
was happy that he was alive." 
</P>
<P>
 This brings up yet another classic bit of canine filmmaking: the fight for 
life in the rushing river followed by the joyful reunion between boy and dog. 
Vintage Lassie at its most heart-tugging. 
</P>
<P>
 That scene also stuck in the mind of 4-year-old Jeremy Miles of Orange, who 
said the film lived up to his expectations. It was left to his brother 
Nathaniel, however, to bring up one fairly obvious reason for his entire family 
to go to see "Lassie." 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the movie," said Nathaniel, 8, "because Lassie looked just like our 
dog Miss Murphy." 
</P>
<P>
 A collie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Nathaniel, "only she's not as smart as Lassie."

SPECIAL SCREENING: HAPPY AGAIN WITH 'SINGIN' IN THE RAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor Art Museum celebrated Fred Astaire a couple of weeks ago 
with "Top Hat." Now, its mini-tribute to movie musicals spotlights Gene Kelly 
-- the dancer who so often during his career seemed to be spinning in Fred's 
elegant shadow -- in "Singin' in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who would argue that Kelly deserved equal room on the same 
pedestal with Astaire, but I'm reluctant. Astaire was class, Kelly was brass. 
Astaire was a prodigy with Old World style, Kelly was a first-rate hoofer with 
all-American appeal. Fred was better, but Gene could still be a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 He proved that in "Singin' in the Rain," one of the most popular 
song-and-dance extravaganzas ever to come out of Hollywood. The 1952 movie will 
be shown Friday as the finale in the museum's series. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a silent-screen star making the uneasy transition to 
talkies. It's probably Kelly's finest, most defining role, even more closely 
associated with him than "An American in Paris" made a year earlier, also for 
MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lockwood, who approaches every travail of his anxious future with a loopy 
determination, Kelly is irrepressibly upbeat. This taps right into his greatest 
talent as a dancer, his athleticism. It also lets Kelly emphasize the most 
prominent feature of his acting, the ability to seem joyfully boyish at just 
about every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, co-directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, features perhaps Kelly's 
most popular dance sequence, one that gave the movie its title. There he is, 
after expressing love for bit actress Kathy Selden (an exhaustingly perky 
Debbie Reynolds), zinging all over a Hollywood back lot done up as a 
rain-slickened street as the drops keep falling. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is playful yet demanding, and Kelly throws his compact 
halfback's body (such a contrast to Astaire's skinny litheness) through all the 
paces. One thing you could say about Kelly, he always worked hard to please an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singin' in the Rain" has, in part, become such a favorite because of its 
hyperactive comedy, much of it generated by Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont. Lina, 
Don's co-star in the silents, has a harder time adjusting to sound because of 
her screechy voice, turned into a loud running gag by Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald O'Connor also made an impact as Cosmo Brown, Don's rubber-legged 
sidekick. O'Connor's eccentric dancing (every move seems to be made on top of a 
banana peel) proved a giddy counterpoint to Kelly's more controlled, powerful 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Taussig, an Orange Coast College film instructor and author of The Film 
Analyst newsletter, will discuss "Singin' in the Rain" before and after the 
screening.

RESTAURANTS: DECOR PACKS MORE PUNCH THAN THE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 P.F. Chang's China Bistro is alluring. It has taken over a prime Fashion 
Island location once home to Michael Kang's Five Feet Too, right next door to 
the wildly popular Cheesecake Factory, and remodeled it spectacularly. As the 
friendly hostesses lead you into the main seating area, you can't help but be 
drawn by the restaurant's centerpiece, an enormously colorful overhead mural 
depicting 12th-Century Chinese life. The menu will tell you it's a full 40 feet 
across. The menu also explains that the two impressive sculptures standing 
guard over the attractively curved bar are interpretations of terra-cotta 
statuary unearthed in the legendary city of Xi'an. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are a soft beige, the floors handsomely inlaid with hardwood. The 
exposed ceiling ducts may clash a bit with the neoclassical decor, but they do 
add a casual note, and the huge, south-facing panoramic windows extend the 
restaurant's space magically. Lighting comes from several giant, off-white 
canvas disks suspended overhead, looking like gravity-defying trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
 You sit at free-standing tables on comfortable leather-backed chairs. The 
handsomely upholstered banquettes, clustered in a partially separated room just 
behind the front podium, have luxurious leather cushions. A lot of people like 
to dine at the bar, where the entire menu is available. (This is an especially 
good idea at peak hours -- P.F. Chang's has a no-reservation policy, and waits 
can be long.) 
</P>
<P>
 In short, this is a knockout room, and the restaurant's concept is a sound 
one: the glories of Chinese cooking combined with the service and amenities of 
the best Western restaurants. To that end, owner Paul Fleming (who also has the 
original P.F. Chang's in Scottsdale, Ariz.,) employed the services of Philip 
Chiang of Beverly Hills as menu consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang's mother, Cecilia, owned the Mandarin restaurants in both San Francisco 
and Beverly Hills, two places where I ate several memorable meals. He also 
operated a small, high-quality Chinese bistro in West Hollywood called the 
Mandarette, so there is no doubt in my mind that his knowledge of this cuisine 
is extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, at this restaurant Chiang and Fleming have taken a safe road to 
nowhere, offering mostly bland, sanitized dishes from all over the Chinese map. 
The lack of passion and focus in the menu is problematic enough, but the real 
problem is in the kitchen: Even simple dishes are erratically cooked and only 
sometimes pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying everything is bland. Our crispy chicken salad was overwhelmed 
with hot Chinese mustard. (The waitress did warn us the dish was mustardy, but 
no one imagined it would be like eating straight out of a mustard jar.) 
Furthermore, a few of these dishes are saltier than potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's catfish is one of the chief culprits in the salt category. It is fried 
catfish fillets in a black bean sauce; a fine idea, except that there is far 
too much bean sauce, a super-salty condiment made from fermented soy. Another 
is something they call Malaysian chicken, which you doctor with condiments like 
raisins, coconut, peanuts and plum sauce from little side dishes. It looks 
appealing, but the main component is chopped chicken and onions in an unctuous, 
and terribly oversalted, yellow curry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers are probably what this restaurant does best, though most are rather 
pricey for what you get. Peking ravioli -- known as pot stickers at your local 
mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant -- enclose a delicious pork and vegetable 
filling in crisp noodle dough. But at your local Chinese restaurant, you'd get 
six for $4.95, not four, and they probably wouldn't be this small. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern-style spare ribs is another dish you'll want more of. They're 
dry-style marinated ribs served with a tempting spiced salt dip normally found 
only in the most Chinese of circumstances, a tender and tangy dish. Scallion 
pancake, however, is an insipid, doughy disk that looks and tastes like a wheat 
flour version of a Salvadoran pupusa. You can't taste the scallions, and there 
are none of the flaky layers the pancake should have. 
</P>
<P>
 Most main dishes depend on vegetables, chicken or shrimp, with pork, scallops 
and beef making occasional forays into the woks. Chived chicken -- thinly 
sliced chicken sauteed with bean curd, yellow chives and cloud mushrooms -- is 
one of the lighter and better choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect squid or lamb, but you will see duck. Cantonese duck, says the 
menu, is "slow-roasted with Chiang's secret ingredients." The reality is a 
plate of boned, finely chopped duck with the minimum of fat and skin, squeaky 
clean and amazingly flavorless. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, spicy ground pork with eggplant (you can substitute ground chicken 
for the pork) has been cleaned up considerably for our palates. The skin has 
been removed from the eggplant, and the kitchen is excessively squeamish about 
using red pepper, an essential part of this Northern Chinese dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is performed by a young, enthusiastic team, whose table-side manner 
verges on the pedantic. On all three of my meals at this restaurant, the 
waiters explained the dishes as if my guests were eating in a real Chinese 
restaurant for the first time, telling us which condiments to put on which 
dishes and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't object to this approach if the kitchen were really offering 
something new or radically interesting. Perhaps there's still a chance that 
will happen. When that times comes, I'll be the first in line for a table. 
</P>
<P>
 P.F. Chang's China Bistro is high-end moderate. Appetizers are 95 cents to 
$5.95. Main dishes are $5.95 to $12.95.

PARKER'S PLACE: PARDON US, BUT WE PAID TO HEAR A MOVIE

<P>
 At a recent screening of the movie "Speed" at Edwards Island Cinemas in 
Newport Beach, my buddy and I had the misfortune to sit in front of three 
couples who carried on conversations during the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend could only take about five minutes of this; he finally turned and 
asked the chatterboxes to be quiet. They grumbled, talked a little quieter for 
half an hour or so, then resumed their full-volume discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the loudness of their talk, you must realize that "Speed" is 
about a crashing elevator full of people, then about a bomb-rigged bus 
careening through Los Angeles. There isn't much dialogue, but there's the 
constant high-decibel shear and torsion of the action movies, pounding away at 
you from the theater's prodigious sound system. To be heard over that, you 
really have to exert. 
</P>
<P>
 But the braying behind us continued, and midway through the movie I couldn't 
take it. After some deliberation I turned to the sociopaths behind me. They 
were three young couples -- in their 20s, maybe -- slumped back in their seats 
and exercising their First Amendment rights with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you guys please be quiet?" I asked. "This is a movie. This is not talk 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
 The young man directly behind me stared at me blankly for a moment, then said, 
"Turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 I stared blankly back at him for a moment and came this close to reaching over 
my seat back and popping him a good one. I imagined it to be like the pop that 
Muhammad Ali gave George Foreman in Zaire, a perfect right cross that would 
leave my foe dazed and defeated, or, as Norman Mailer described Foreman after 
the punch, looking "like a butler who has just heard tragic news." 
</P>
<P>
 My heart was pounding hard, and I had visions of fleeing through Fashion 
Island while his girlfriend screamed and pointed and Newport's kindly policemen 
drew down on me. I even wondered if the money in my wallet that night -- 40 
bucks -- was enough to post bail on an aggravated assault charge. Likely not. I 
tried out my explanation to the judge: "They wouldn't stop talking, so I 
punched him in the face." Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 A begrudging silence issued from behind us for another five minutes, after 
which their conversations were held to a slightly more muted level. The movie 
ended (mercifully), and after the credits I turned to confront the morons 
behind me, but they were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week later, I was invited by a friend and her 3-year-old son to 
see "The Lion King." I smiled in true horror, the blood draining from my face. 
The prospect of watching a Disney cartoon with a theater full of moms, dads and 
brats was so drear I couldn't express myself, which my friend took for a "Yes, 
I'd be happy to go." 
</P>
<P>
 So I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeling myself against the tribulation to come, I packed a pair of earplugs 
in my shirt pocket. I thought of smuggling in some airline bottles of gin, but 
it was a noonish "family" matinee, and I do have principles.  
</P>
<P>
 As a sociological note, I should point out that the theater was in Riverside 
County, and that -- to my mild surprise -- there was a sign right on the ticket 
window that said something like: 
</P>
<P>
 SILENCE IS GOLDEN 
</P>
<P>
 PLEASE REFRAIN FROM 
</P>
<P>
 TALKING DURING THE SHOW 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you! Too bad 3-year-olds can't read, I thought, consoling myself with 
the fact that it was 103 degrees by now, and the air-conditioned theater -- 
chaotic and ear-splitting as it was sure to be -- could only be an improvement 
over the Stage 10 smog-alert atmosphere prevailing outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as nervous shock can overtake you without your being aware of it, so can 
a pleasant experience simply sweep you up, ignorant, and carry you away with 
it. Fifteen minutes into "The Lion King" I was hooked on a story that promised 
to deliver (and did) growth, pride, decline, redemption and triumph, along with 
one really good lion fight. 
</P>
<P>
 I found myself laughing out loud -- something I love to do but am rarely moved 
to by a movie -- at some of the expressions and lines of the meerkat. I found 
myself noting some of the classical story elements so effectively employed by 
the writers, who had borrowed from the Old Testament, the Greeks, Shakespeare, 
and, of course, Hollywood. I was truly dumbfounded to find myself in the middle 
of a good movie, and a cartoon at that! 
</P>
<P>
 But that was nothing compared to my stunned realization that this theater full 
of 3- to 10-year-olds was actually . . . quiet. I reached up to remove my 
earplugs, but they were still in my pocket. Had I in fact imported some Bombay 
Sapphire Blue and slipped into a pleasant coma? No. I looked around me left and 
right, behind, up ahead. Yes, an ocean of children watching a movie without 
talking ! I rubbed my eyes, then slapped myself smartly on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "You OK?" inquired my adult friend sitting next to me.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mosquito. Don't talk please." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking back outside into the scorching, apocalyptic haze of the Inland 
Empire, I realized that the "Silence Is Golden" signs are probably a large part 
of what draws people to this challenging climate. 
</P>
<P>
 I also theorized that bad manners mark the decline of a civilization, as 
suggested by historians from Seneca to Francis Fukuyama. Truly, I postulated, 
what are war, murder, robbery, violence and rap music other than the ultimate 
expressions of impoliteness? How thin must be the dividing line between a movie 
talker and a serial killer! 
</P>
<P>
 If a person can sit in a theater and give voice to every stupidity that arcs 
through his tiny brain, what's to keep him from rigging a bomb under the 
carousel at South Coast Plaza? Precious little, I can assure you.

 What can be done? Unfortunately, we can't ask law enforcement to do much about 
bad manners until they erupt into felonies. Schoolteachers are handcuffed when 
it comes to discipline, so don't expect much from them. Parents are the real 
hope for the future, unless they happen to be the people sitting behind me at 
the Island Cinemas, in which case one can only stay home, rent videos and face 
the fall of our republic with whatever grace and politeness one can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage Mr. Edwards to post "Silence Is Golden" signs for all movies 
adults are likely to see and to employ large, hairy ushers to remove scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 That aside, it is each individual's responsibility to do his or her tiny part 
for politeness. I will try my best to do mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for reading.

3-HOUR TOUR: GET HISTORY LESSON AND DOGGIE BREATH MEDICINE ON SAME STROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mary Newland of Huntington Beach used to visit her daughter in Palm Springs, 
traveling by horse and buggy. Now, a few doors from the Newland House and less 
than a century later, 2-year-olds are playing on computers at Futurekids. Chew 
on the wonder of it all over kung pao tofu. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1 p.m.: The Newland House Museum is the site of the first house in 
Huntington Beach, built in 1898. William and Mary Newland raised 10 children in 
the turreted Victorian farmhouse. When William, "the barley king," died in 
1933, his wife continued to operate the ranch until the mid-'40s; the family 
occupied the property until Mary's death in 1952, at 93. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, now owned by the city, originally had no inside plumbing; water was 
carted in, from the water tower out back, until the 1920s. According to docent 
Lelene Smith, Mary did all the cooking, for her family and up to 70 employees, 
on the wood-burning stove, delivering lunches to the fields and dinners to the 
bunkhouse. The kids took turns in one big tub. Said Smith, "We always ask the 
schoolchildren, 'Would you want to go in the tub first, or last?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen are such artifacts as a mustache cup and a cherry-pitter. 
Upstairs in the master bedroom are a scissors-like contraption used to melt wax 
for mustaches, a curling iron actually made of iron and heated over the fire, 
and, for dressy occasions, elaborate headpieces crocheted from the Newland 
women's own hair. Many of the children's clothes are displayed.  
</P>
<P>
 "All the little boys wore dresses," Smith said. "They were babies, whether 
they were girls or boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Back downstairs in the parlor, Smith cranked up the Victrola; the familiar 
Victor Talking Machine logo depicts a dog listening to "His Master's Voice." 
"Now here's your volume," she said, opening the cabinet doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $2, children $1, and tour duration varies. Said Smith, "People 
come in and wind up telling me stories. 'Oh, my grandmother had a shawl like 
that on the piano. . .!' " 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:30: For many of us, Mother's Market & Kitchen is a staple of our 
existence, if not a complex carbohydrate. Who can resist such recently posted 
specials as Royal Jelly -- "the concentrated super food responsible for turning 
an ordinary worker bee into a long-lived reproductive dynamo -- the queen!" -- 
or maximum-strength water pills at 50 for $4.99, or the non-dairy drink called 
Soy Moo? 
</P>
<P>
 The store carries pine tar shampoo and "cruelty-free" cosmetics. Pet products 
alone are worth a visit. Newton Homeopathic Medicines for Pets, for instance, 
are variously labeled Nervousness, Doggie Breath and Leukemia; books include 
"The Complete Herbal Handbook for the Dog and Cat" and, by Swami Beyondananda, 
"When You See a Sacred Cow . . . Milk It for All It's Worth." Nearby in the 
people section is "Sharks Don't Get Cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 There's PMS.O.S. for women, and for men, Vital Male Support -- with wild oat 
extract, of course. Golf Pro is a nutrition bar specially formulated for 
concentration, calmness and energy. I'd need Fuel for Thought just to think 
about trying it. But can that Power Punch concoction (99 cents) really be good 
for you? "Aeeeee, no comment," said the checker. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2:30: You can take out lunch from Mother's, or you can eat in: Set out 
a blanket and picnic beneath the huge pine tree planted by the Newlands next 
door, or ask to be seated near the window, which looks right out onto the 
Newland property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deli are buffalo tempeh ($4.75 per pound) and Bulgar wheat tabouli 
($3.75). On the restaurant menu are energy salad ($4.75); kung pao tofu, 
sauteed tofu in a spicy peanut sauce with broccoli flowerettes and other 
vegetables; and bleu pasta, with chunks of cheese served over udon noodles with 
walnut garnish (both $6.25). Sandwiches include tofu dogs ($3.95) and a 
no-threat-to-dolphins tuna melt ($4.75). Corn bread and chapati -- a 
whole-wheat tortilla -- are 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then blow the benefits of all that healthful eating with something from the 
freezer section. The store carries Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream made with 
Belgian chocolate and almonds, which proves that Mother's is more than just a 
health food store. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 to 3: According to director Michelle Rauch, Futurekids computer learning 
center offers classes for students "ages 3 to 103," but in fact she's had 
students as young as 2 1/2. Summer camps (starting at $139 for two-week 
sessions) include Cartoon Camp, for ages 3 to 5, Storybook Maker, 3 to 7, and 
Robotics, 8 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 You can watch one of the sessions or bring by the kids for a free "learning 
adventure" demo. I watched a robotics session, where children program computers 
to move Lego pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting people on a conveyor belt," said Chris Gravell, 13. "They're 
crash dummies." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going too fast when we first did it," clarified Chase Stopnik, 9. How 
long had the pair been at the project? "A few minutes," Stopnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group had already programmed a carousel, complete with musical tones, 
and were now tackling a Lego washing machine. 
</P>

2 DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION AS THIRD AWAITS IN ARKANSAS; PENALTY: INMATES SAY THE 
TRIPLE EXECUTION IS LIKE TAKING 'HOGS TO THE SLAUGHTER.' BUT PRISON OFFICIALS 
SAY IT MAKES IT EASIER ON THEIR STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first two of three killers scheduled to be put to death Wednesday night in 
the nation's first triple execution in 32 years received fatal injections after 
refusing to offer final words. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men had all argued in a late-hour appeal to the Supreme Court that 
they were being reduced to "hogs at the slaughter," but the last execution was 
expected to follow the first two within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," was all Hoyt Clines and Darryl Richley said when asked if they had any 
last words. Then they were strapped to gurneys, about an hour apart, and the 
lethal doses of drugs were injected. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before Clines' execution, a federal appeals court lifted a stay of 
execution granted for James Holmes. He had been scheduled for execution after 
Clines, but at the last minute prison officials dropped him to the third spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, 37; Clines, 37; and Richley, 43, were scheduled to die one by one 
beginning at 5 p.m. PDT for killing a businessman in front of his family during 
a 1981 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Clines was pronounced dead at 5:11 p.m. and Richley died at 6:07 p.m., a state 
prison official announced. An appeal for Clines was denied at 4:55 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other appeals -- one on behalf of all three men, the other for Richley -- 
were also denied by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel of the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals had stayed 
Holmes' execution Wednesday so he could have more time to pursue a separate 
appeal. But that stay was dissolved less than three hours later by an 8-3 
decision of the full 8th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel had said Holmes should be granted additional time to 
appeal his conviction and death sentence on the basis of a new argument that 
his trial counsel was ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the last-minute change, the order of their executions was to have been 
determined by their prison serial numbers -- Clines SK886; Holmes SK887; 
Richley SK888. Prison officials didn't immediately say why they moved Holmes to 
the third spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison planned for 45 to 60 minutes between executions -- enough time to 
carry the body out in a bag, wipe down the gurney and change the needle before 
the next man was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This scheduled mass execution, by reducing human beings to hogs at the 
slaughter, will exponentially increase the level of fear, uncertainty and 
psychological stress that someone condemned normally experiences in the usual 
course of death," the inmates said in their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that it is unconstitutional for the state to "assess who they 
think is worthy of another hour or two of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The state has said that multiple executions reduce overtime and stress on 
employees. "Nobody wants to get up in the morning and go kill somebody," 
Correction Department spokesman Alan Ables said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diann Rust-Tierney, director of the Capital Punishment Project for the 
American Civil Liberties Union, said: "To take mass execution as a model of 
efficiency only underscores how out of step we are with the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder victim, Don Lehman, was beaten with a motorcycle chain and shot in 
the chest and head by four masked men who forced their way into his home, 
chased him down and held him on a bed. His wife was on the bedroom floor at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth man convicted in the murder had his death sentence commuted to life 
in prison after a court ruled that hypnosis-induced testimony from the victim's 
daughter may have affected his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's last triple execution was Aug. 8, 1962, when three men went to 
the gas chamber in California. Arkansas put two prisoners to death for 
unrelated crimes on May 11 in the first double execution since the Supreme 
Court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1-2, 1951, Virginia sent eight men to the electric chair. Before that, 
at least 17 states executed four or more people in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1862, federal officials in Mankato, Minn., hanged 38 Dakota Indians after 
the tribe declared war on the United States for failing to honor treaties. 
</P>
<P>
 Six inmates have been executed in Arkansas, and 246 nationwide, since capital 
punishment resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're about to witness in Arkansas is a shocking spectacle," 
Rust-Tierney said. "The notion that Arkansas is getting into this assembly-line 
mentality doesn't fit in with our societal respect for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ables' response to the opponents: "If anybody is going to be criticizing us, 
it's nice to be criticized for being efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that are involved in this are very concerned that what they do is 
proper, (done) professionally and with decorum," he said. "They want this to go 
well."

</P>
<P>
 He made his stage debut at 12 as a newsboy in F. Scott Fitzgerald's play "The 
Vegetable" in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Roebling appeared on Broadway in "The Dark Is Light Enough" and "The Lark" and 
off-Broadway in "This Side of Paradise," for which he won an Obie in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the role of Christopher Flanders in the first Broadway production of 
Tennessee Williams' "The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More" in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Roebling's films included "Prince of the City" and "Blue Thunder." 
</P>
<P>
 For television, he acted in productions of "Mrs. Miniver," "Romeo and Juliet" 
and "Carolina Skeletons" as well as "The Civil War." 
</P>

JANIS CARTER; ACTRESS HOSTED TV QUIZ SHOW 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janis Carter, Broadway and movie actress who later became co-host of the 1950s 
quiz show "Feather Your Nest," has died. She was believed to be 80, although 
various references indicate she may have been 73 or 77. 
</P>
<P>
 She died at her Durham home of a heart attack Saturday, her husband, Julius 
Stulman, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cleveland, Miss Carter earned bachelor's degrees in English and music 
at Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University. She later 
moved to New York to train as an opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
 But she quickly moved into show business instead, at first writing radio 
scripts for "Gangbusters" and supporting herself as a saleswoman at 
Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Carter appeared in Broadway musicals that included "DuBarry Was a Lady," 
starring Bert Lahr and Ethel Merman, and "Panama Hattie." 
</P>
<P>
 Those roles led to a contract with 20th Century Fox, where producer Darryl F. 
Zanuck had her change her name from Dremann to Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared in several B pictures of the 1940s, often cast as the other 
woman. Among about 30 films she made for Fox, RKO and Columbia in the 1940s and 
into the 1950s were "Cadet Girl" in 1941, "Lady of Burlesque" in 1943, "Framed" 
in 1947, the Lucille Ball comedy "Miss Grant Takes Richmond" in 1949, and the 
John Wayne-Robert Ryan war story "Flying Leathernecks" in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1950s, Miss Carter appeared with Bud Collyer as host on "Feather 
Your Nest," a daytime game show in which couples got the chance to win home 
furnishings.

BERNARD R. CALDWELL; CREDITED WITH MODERNIZING THE CHP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernard R. Caldwell, a former Los Angeles police traffic director credited 
with modernizing the California Highway Patrol during his six years as its 
chief, has died. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell, who died Friday in San Diego, was appointed CHP commissioner by 
then-Gov. Earl Warren in 1953 and served until 1959. Under his tenure, the 
department grew from 800 officers to 2,600, more than doubled its vehicle fleet 
and built its training academy in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Caldwell's appointment, about 600 friends and civic leaders 
attended a testimonial dinner in honor of his 28 years with the Los Angeles 
Police Department. The National Safety Council and 13 other organizations 
presented citations for his work as head of the Los Angeles Police Traffic 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell was born in Calico Rock, Ark., on Dec. 3, 1900, and came to 
California in 1920 to attend Santa Ana Junior College. He joined the Los 
Angeles Police Department in 1926 and rose to captain in charge of traffic 
bureaus in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell attended Northwestern University's Traffic Institute for a year in 
1937 to study new methods of traffic policing. In 1940, he was appointed deputy 
chief of the LAPD and director of traffic. His staff developed staffing and 
equipment standards, training curricula, planning and statistical bureaus, an 
operations policy and criteria for selecting officers. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from the CHP in 1959, Caldwell served as the director of 
Northwestern University's Traffic Institute from 1960 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Wanda.

gory novels set in London's criminal underworld. His best work was considered

CLUB REVIEW; HELL'S GATE: DEVILISH REBIRTH OF A HOT SPOT FOR BRAVE SOULS 
</P>

<P>
 At Hell's Gate, the new and appropriate moniker for Hollywood's Club Maxx, 
even the fish look ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 As the steel-gray creatures circle slowly around in two 60-gallon tanks (a 
third one merely has bones in it), you can't help but draw a parallel to the 
18th Street gang that has a visible, veritable stronghold in the 
neighborhood.Their presence, according to the club's former owners, had kept 
many would-be patrons away. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, the beleaguered venue has used this situation to its 
advantage. Rather than being spruced up when new owners came aboard three 
months ago, Hell's Gate has actually been deconstructed -- stripped down in a 
bare-bones fashion. Adorned mostly with skulls and shrunken heads -- really -- 
the 150-capacity club has created a Hades-like environment for the not-so-weak 
at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell's Gate is offering tough bands in a tough environment, with the sound man 
and equipment actually residing in a locked cage. (Call the vibe "voodoo 
chic.") The club is now luring people with free and low-cover shows, focusing 
on "psycho-alternative" groups and bar bands, averaging four or five a night. 
After a recent set by the Charlie Daniels-esque Freehead (the latest 
incarnation of the Screamin' Lederhosen), people were tapping their toes to 
"the devil went down to Yucca" as they fled into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hell's Gate, 6423 Yucca St., Hollywood, (213) 463-9661, cover varies.

 CRIME FIGHTER: San Juan Capistrano Mayor Collene Campbell hasn't abandoned her 
other role as a state crime victims leader. Campbell's son was murdered in 1982 
and her brother and sister-in-law were murdered in 1988. . . . Campbell 
recently sent letters to every city in the state asking that the cities "become 
a team" in lobbying the Legislature for tougher crime bills. In Orange County, 
La Palma and Irvine this week passed resolutions supporting her anti-crime 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY DAY: Sacramento legislators who meet in committee next Tuesday are 
going to find themselves facing not just Mayor Campbell, but about 200 victims 
of crime who are scheduled to join her in a lobbying effort. Among those 
testifying: Cheryl Bess of San Clemente. In 1984, when she was 15, Bess was 
left blind, disfigured, and lost part of her hearing after being kidnaped and 
attacked with acid. . . . "It's her first time to testify, but she 
volunteered," Campbell says. "The lawmakers will get a lesson in reality about 
what crime does." 
</P>
<P>
 COBB REDUX: Al Stump's 1961 True magazine piece on the last days of Ty Cobb's 
life is often touted as the greatest sports story ever written. Now Stump, who 
lives in Huntington Beach, has made it the first chapter of his new biography 
on Cobb. . . . That chapter is also the basis for a new movie on Cobb, due in 
the fall, starring Tommy Lee Jones. Stump is recovering from an illness and 
could not be interviewed. But baseball historian Roger Kahn calls the new book 
"the most powerful baseball biography I have read." 
</P>
<P>
 PERFECT FORMULA: Maybe you already knew this, but Margie Deutsch is trying to 
make parents aware that breast milk is better for infants than formula. This 
week, she should get some special attention. . . . It's "Breast-Feeding 
Awareness Week," and her group, the Orange County Lactation Consultants Assn., 
is sponsoring a seminar about it Saturday at Irvine Medical Center. "We are 
working to make breast-feeding the cultural norm," says Deutsch.

 LOVE HIM TENDER: Everyone has something to say about the Jackson-Presley 
marriage, but how would the King have felt? . . . Well, he wouldn't have turned 
over in his grave, as some have suggested, says Santa Clarita's Steve Williams, 
an Elvis impersonator who has performed all over the Southland. "Lisa Marie was 
his pride and joy," he says, "and if she was happy, he would have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
 LA BAMBA: Speaking of musical legends, the Valley produced Ritchie Valens. 
Valens died in the same 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, and his 
native Pacoima has never forgotten him. The latest honor: a park in his name 
(B1). . . . Bob Keane, the producer who signed Valens, hasn't forgotten him 
either. "I still miss him," said Keane, head of Del-Fi Records in Hollywood. 
"He was like a son to me." 
</P>
<P>
 LESSONS: They never won any national basketball championships at UCLA, but Don 
MacLean, Trevor Wilson (above) and Mitchell Butler won plenty of respect. And 
now it's their turn to give tips to the next generation of dreamers (C10). . . 
. Wilson, who played for Cleveland High in Reseda, knows how to rebound, on and 
off the court. He played in Europe before returning to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 WRONG KATZ: Politicians and dentists don't usually get confused with each 
other, but it does happen with Los Angeles dentist Richard Katz, who is 
sometimes mistaken for Richard Katz, the assemblyman from Sylmar. He gets calls 
from people looking for the politician. . . . Said the dentist's wife, Ellen 
Katz: "They even look a little alike." 
</P>
<P>
 LIMBO: To rebuild or to tear down, that is the question. And residents of the 
quake-damaged Sherman Court condo complex in Reseda have been waiting months 
for an answer from the primary lender (B2). . . . "It's very frustrating," said 
Teri Feld, head of the homeowners association. "Sherman Court is just sitting 
there." Michael Arkush

 POLITICAL PICTURE: At their best, public opinion polls offer snapshots of the 
mood of the voters at a specific point in time. And, as of the Field Poll in 
July, neither of Ventura County's candidates for statewide office was making 
much progress. In the race for lieutenant governor, state Sen. Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) had only 19% of voters compared with Democratic Controller Gray 
Davis' 49%. In the race for controller, former Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
(R-Thousand Oaks) had 26% compared with Democrat Kathleen Connell's 31%. A 
whopping 43% were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT SEATS: At most theatrical and musical performances, the best seats in the 
house often go to generous patrons of the arts or those with political pull. 
And with the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's tantalizing lineup of big-name 
acts, those groups have been tussling over who will control the action. . . . 
Behind-the-scenes maneuvering ended this week as the City Council agreed to 
power-share (B4). Now, five big donors can join the Civic Arts Plaza's Board of 
Governors. 
</P>
<P>
 OCEAN MYSTERY: Veteran watermen give the Santa Barbara Channel the respect 
afforded a junkyard dog. The islands and the mainland act like a wind tunnel, 
strengthening winds until they whip the sea into a frenzy. . . . It's been 16 
months since seven crewmen and the commercial trawler Vil Vana disappeared off 
Santa Cruz Island (Ventura County Life, Page 8). The Coast Guard cannot figure 
out what happened. And the mystery haunts families left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 GOT A GRIP: At 6-foot-3, Tony Jelso of Ventura was an aggressive, intimidating 
presence on the racquetball court. He was on a winning streak, capped by a gold 
medal at last summer's U. S. Olympic Festival in San Antonio (C10). . . . Then, 
at his coach's urging, the 24-year-old tried a more conventional grip, 
abandoning the one he has used since he was 10. Suddenly, he lost his 
confidence and started losing. . . . Now, Jelso has settled on a hybrid of his 
new and old grips. And he's winning again.

SOUTHLAND LEADS U.S. IN BEACH CLOSINGS, WARNINGS; ENVIRONMENT: IN VENTURA 
COUNTY, COASTAL AREAS WERE DESIGNATED UNSAFE FOR ONLY FOUR DAYS. BUT THE COUNTY 
DOES NOT ROUTINELY MONITOR WATER QUALITY, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>

 Beaches across the United States were closed to swimmers or posted with health 
warnings more than 2,400 times last year, with one-third of them occurring in 
Southern California, according to an annual report released Wednesday by a 
national environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, beach closures and advisories due to high bacteria counts more 
than doubled to 1,397 in 1993, compared to 609 the year before, according to 
the Natural Resources Defense Council report. 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of health advisories in California does not mean that the 
region has the nation's most contaminated beaches. Instead, most of the 
disparity is attributed to local health agencies that test more frequently and 
are quicker to warn the public than their counterparts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, beaches were closed or posted unsafe for only four days in 
1993 due to an 85,000-gallon oil spill near McGrath State Beach. But the group 
points out that Ventura County is the only Southern California county that does 
not routinely test its beaches for bacteria. Instead, the county monitors 
beaches for pollution only after a complaint or spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the Ventura County Environmental Health Division developed a 
proposal for routine ocean water-quality monitoring, there is no funding, so it 
has not been implemented," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of California's increase was due to numerous health advisories in 
San Diego County, where heavy winter storms caused sewer system breakdowns or 
washed large volumes of runoff to sea. San Diego County posted 727 warnings 
last year -- by far the most in the nation -- including some in January and 
February that lasted several weeks and encompassed much of the county's 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blame should not lie with those whose numbers are high," said NRDC 
attorney Everett DeLano in Los Angeles. "This does not mean that San Diego 
beaches are more heavily polluted than Los Angeles County's, rather that San 
Diego is doing a better job of protecting the public and closing the beaches 
when they should be closed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, beaches were closed or posted with warnings 59 times -- 
an increase from 37 in 1992, according to the report. About half were along a 
20-mile stretch of Santa Monica Bay from Topanga Canyon Boulevard to the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the warnings were triggered by high coliform bacteria counts, 
which indicate that the water has been contaminated by human sewage or animal 
waste from spills or river runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But since there are no national standards, how frequently beaches are tested 
for coliform bacteria and under what conditions they are closed to the public 
varies widely from state to state -- even county to county -- and from year to 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, eight states, including Oregon, Washington and most of the Gulf 
Coast, do not monitor coastal water and issue no public warnings. But health 
agencies in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties sample a large number of 
beaches weekly and issue public advisories because of strong interest from 
swimmers, surfers and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Avero, deputy environmental health director for San Diego County, said the 
county's high number of advisories is at least partially due to its frequency 
of water tests and its policy of posting warnings after rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some jurisdictions don't have the funding to do routine monitoring. We 
probably do more sampling and monitoring than any other jurisdiction," he said. 
"We take a cautious approach in deciding to go out with the advisories. Our 
priority is to protect public health and we want to make sure the water is safe 
for people to swim in." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of San Diego County's health warnings -- 187 last year -- were triggered 
at Imperial Beach by persistent problems with sewage flowing up the Tijuana 
River from Mexico. Frequent storm-related sewage spills also occurred near 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day that a beach was posted with an advisory is counted as one occasion. 
At Del Mar Beach on Camp Pendleton, for example, health warnings were issued 
from Jan. 16 through March 6, amounting to 50 advisories. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to San Diego County's 727 warnings, two beaches at the mouth of 
Tijuana River have been permanently closed to swimming because of sewage from 
Mexico, while two others nearby, Coronado and Loma Alta Lagoon, experienced 
health advisories that lasted more than six weeks last year. These were counted 
separately in the report because they lasted for such extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The coliform tests used by most counties to determine whether to post warnings 
are not considered a highly accurate way to measure the real health risks to 
swimmers and surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 While coliform can indicate the presence of raw human sewage, which could 
spread diseases such as hepatitis and dysentery, it also may point to bird 
droppings or other animal wastes that are not considered a serious disease 
threat. But since no reliable means exist to determine the source of the 
coliform, most health departments in Southern California close beaches as a 
precaution until the counts are normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, beach closings and advisories decreased slightly in 1993 -- from 
2,619 in 1992 to 2,438, the report said. The national decrease was largely due 
to below-average rainfall in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists say their report is evidence that Congress, which is 
debating reauthorization of the Clean Water Act, should incorporate more 
stringent controls on urban runoff and set uniform standards for when states 
monitor and close beaches.

<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: The City Council approved plans to provide police helicopter 
services to neighboring cities, including West Covina, Covina, Glendora, Azusa 
and Irwindale. Contracts for the agreements are under review by attorneys for 
the various cities. If the plans go forward, the city will offer helicopter 
service on an emergency basis, charging $55 for an 18-minute call and $18.50 
for every additional six-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: The City Council voted not to put a proposed 8.25% utility tax and 
card club proposal on the November ballot. They may hold public hearings on 
these topics, as well as a proposed fire assessment district, within the next 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 IRWINDALE: The council decided not to place a proposal to build a card club on 
the Nov. 8 ballot. Instead, the matter will be included in a special election 
after that date. The city voted to delay the vote because it will be unable to 
meet an Aug. 12 deadline to adopt all resolutions related to the proposal. The 
council also appropriated $10,000 to hire a consultant to study the proposed 
club's financial impact on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: The council voted to continue a landscaping assessment tax, but 
decided against reforming the rate base. Rates, which range from $106 to $1,038 
per year, will remain the same. The reform would have raised rates for some 
residents of the assessment district and lowered it for others. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: In response to a lawsuit by four neighboring cities, the City Council 
decided to conduct a full environmental impact report on two proposed card 
clubs. Officials are also considering a request by a Pomona citizens group to 
place the card club proposal on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 WALNUT: The city is seeking senior volunteers to assist law enforcement 
agencies by patrolling parks, construction sites and vacation homes in marked 
city vehicles. Applicants must be at least 50 years old and have a California 
driver's license. An introductory meeting will be held Tuesday. Information: 
Deputy Frank Girard, (909) 595-2264.  
</P>
<P>
 REGION: The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission will hold a 
meeting to receive comments from county residents regarding housing, social 
services, the homeless and other issues. The CDC administers the Los Angeles 
County Urban Block Grant program for small cities and unincorporated areas of 
Los Angeles. Public comment will help the agency allocate funds for 1995-96. 
The meeting is at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at the Altadena Senior Center, 560 E. 
Mariposa St.

DEALERS WARN AGAINST DOCTORED JADE; GEMS: MERCHANTS HAVE FOUND A NEARLY 
UNDETECTABLE WAY OF MAKING LOW-GRADE STONES APPEAR TO BE EXPENSIVE JEWELS. 
</P>

<P>
 Jade is one of the most rare and revered stones in traditional Asian cultures, 
commanding up to $180,000 in San Gabriel Valley jewelry stores for a thin 
bangle of clear green. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as all that glitters is not gold, leaders of the local jade trade are 
warning the public to be skeptical of stones, even those beaming that most 
desirable shade of deep, translucent green. 
</P>
<P>
 Unscrupulous jade dealers in the Far East recently perfected a method of 
making lower quality jade look so much like its top quality counterpart that it 
takes a sophisticated and expensive machine test to tell them apart. The 
problem is so widespread that up to half of what's being tested today in the 
United States is found to be adulterated, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 This has special implications in the San Gabriel Valley, where a large and 
affluent Chinese community is at risk for fraud. A bracelet sold for $30,000 as 
grade A jade, for example, is worth only $2,000 if made of grade B jade. 
Dealers worry that the cheaper imitations masquerading as grade A, or imperial 
jade, could blow the bottom out of the high-end market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a major problem for us," said Hing Wa Lee, owner of the Hing Wa 
Lee Jewelry Store in the fashionable San Gabriel Square Shopping Center on 
Valley Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is president of the Jade & Gemstone Assn. of America, a group of 30 
merchants who want to preserve the market for grade A jade and have launched a 
campaign to educate consumers about the differences via flyers printed in 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterfeiting method involves using acid to bleach out mineral impurities 
in lower quality jade. A high-pressure machine then injects a plastic polymer 
resin into the stone to conceal the tampering. A second way to enhance the 
jade's color -- and thus its value -- is to shoot a marred stone full of 
plastic to make it look more translucent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem's come over here now that we have more Chinese living here," said 
David Lee, Hing Wa Lee's son and partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lee flyer, which is distributed on bright yellow paper to shoppers and 
browsers who wander near the jewelry store, begins: "Please Beware of 
Purchasing 'Fake' Jades." It says that a tampered-with stone loses its 
translucent look within three years and becomes worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer encourages prospective buyers to patronize only merchants with a 
trusted name and a permanent shop location, to inquire about the quality of the 
gem they are buying and to warn merchants that it is against the law to 
misrepresent impregnated stones as grade A jade. The flyer also recommends that 
buyers ask merchants to supply a certificate of authenticity from the 
Gemological Institute of America, an organization that authenticates precious 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard one story about a guy who got into a (hot tub) wearing a clear green 
jade ring and when he got out, the color had become milky," recalled David Lee, 
a third-generation jade merchant, explaining the pitfalls of buying impregnated 
jade. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of jade dates to at least 4000 BC. The stone, thought to have magic 
powers, was placed in the earth at planting time to bring good harvests and was 
buried with the dead to prevent the decomposition of bodies and assure passage 
to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Hong Kong, more than 400 licensed jade dealers work in the city's 
jade market, located in Kowloon. The giant auction house Sotheby's has 
organized two auctions on jade carvings each year in Hong Kong since the 1980s. 
Dealers recall a 12-millimeter bracelet carved out of a single piece of jade 
that sold for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, nobody from a Western background cares about jade; it's a very small 
market. But it's a very important and traditional gem in China. That's 
basically all they know," says Emmanuel Fritsch, who heads the Gemological 
Institute's research office. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with adulterated jade became so severe in Hong Kong last year that 
the government passed a law saying dealers who knowingly misrepresent jade to 
customers can be jailed, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, sales of jade fell by 50% in 1991 after the media reported that 
altered jade was going undetected, according to an article in Gems & Gemology, 
a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 While the counterfeiting is common knowledge among Asian dealers on both sides 
of the Pacific, many Caucasian dealers and gem experts here say they have heard 
no complaints and were unaware of it. "We have not had one call on this," said 
a spokesman for the California Jewelers Assn. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What scares gem merchants most about the new high-tech fraud methods is that 
they cannot be detected by a naked eye or by traditional methods such as a 
light meter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a wholesaler who's buying a bunch can't always tell," Fritsch said. "The 
jewelers, in good faith, sometimes don't know what they have. These guys are 
basically merchants, they're not gemologists, so this is new and 
disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
 The only sure test is to put the stones through infrared spectroscopy, a 
process that requires a machine that costs up to $100,000 and experienced 
technical staff both to obtain an accurate reading and to assess the results. 
</P>
<P>
 The price was worth it for the Hong Kong Stone and Jade Manufacturers Assn., 
which last year pooled its funds and bought one of the machines to test all 
jade they handled in Hong Kong, Fritsch said. Those who cannot afford the costs 
associated with buying a machine must go to a lab such as the Gemological 
Institute's and pay about $200 for each piece tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gemological Institute of America, based in Santa Monica, says it receives 
at least two faxes a day from around the world from jade wholesalers and 
dealers who need help in determining whether they have grade A jade. Most of 
the jade handled by large auction houses is first authenticated through the 
Gemological Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers always ask me, 'Is this real or is this altered?' " said Lee, who 
gets his jade from the Burmese jungle -- the only place imperial jade is found 
-- and cuts the stones in a Hong Kong factory, selling them to jade wholesalers 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritsch says low-tech methods of altering jade have been around for decades 
but were usually discernible to trained dealers. One common method involved 
dying the jade with green plant extracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989, Fritsch saw his first plastic-impregnated jade. Today, he has 
documented five plastic polymers being used by dozens of jade traffickers in 
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. Between one-fourth and one-half the jade that his 
lab is asked to test turns out to be impregnated, Fritsch says.

 In a decision cheered by neither side, a Superior Court jury agreed last week 
that Pasadena City College violated civil rights law by hiring a Japanese 
American professor over a white man. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury refused to award any monetary damages, rejecting the contention 
that race was directly involved in the employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon J. Waszak, 39, contended that if race had not been a factor, he would 
have been chosen from four finalists for a job teaching American and European 
history when he applied in late 1990. His suit asked for $300,000 in back pay 
and benefits he would have received if he had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra jury disagreed. But it decided that the college should pay 
Waszak's legal fees, which displeased college officials. They are considering 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the result was positive insofar as we were not forced to hire Dr. 
Waszak or pay him any back pay," said Jack A. Scott, president of Pasadena City 
College. "But certainly it was a mixed message." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the jury's decision may have been swayed by evidence that a PCC 
selection committee member wrote on a rating sheet that a candidate's Asian 
background was an extra qualification. That member, Enrique Orozco, testified 
that his comment meant it was good to have a minority candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-time history instructor position eventually went to Richard Imon, who 
was younger and less experienced than Waszak. According to news reports, PCC 
terminated Imon in 1992, a short time after he was hired.  
</P>
<P>
 Waszak said he is also considering filing an appeal.

TOPICS / MEDICINE; FIRM'S NEW DEVICE MAY EASE CATARACT SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A laser device that could allow for safer, simpler cataract surgery may be on 
the market by 1996, a Claremont medical equipment company announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe would enable eye surgeons to remove the cataract through a smaller 
incision, with less risk of complications than is possible with current 
equipment, the company claims. 
</P>
<P>
 IOLAB Corp., a Johnson & Johnson company, announced that a patent for the 
device was awarded to Jack Dodick, chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology, 
Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. Dodick developed the laser, to which 
IOLAB holds marketing rights, after 30 years of cataract surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I focused my thoughts on how the technique could be made safer and easier . . 
. by removing (the cataract) through a smaller wound," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He created a laser probe that is smaller and lighter than current devices that 
use ultrasound to break up the opaque, hardened lens for removal from the eye. 
It requires an incision of only 2.4 millimeters compared with 3.0 to 3.2. A 
plastic lens is then inserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the current probe, which vibrates more than 54,000 times per second, a 
laser beam strikes a titanium target on the wand tip, emitting shock waves that 
break up the lens. Then an aspirator sucks up the shattered fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodick said the new device, which destroys and aspirates cataracts, could 
eventually be used for surgery on the brain, herniated discs, injured joints 
and even to clear clogged arteries.  
</P>
<P>
 Dodick has used the device to remove cataracts from seven patients -- all 
successfully.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; OFFICE REVOKES LICENSE OF ELECTRONICS SERVICE DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The business license of a Covina electronics service dealer was recently 
revoked after investigators from the Department of Consumer Affairs' Bureau of 
Electronic and Appliance Repair discovered that the dealer billed them for 
unnecessary parts and was operating with an expired license. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor O. Santana, owner of Ontario Video Repair at 983 W. San Bernardino 
Road, had his license revoked on June 28.Santana had not paid his licensing 
fees for two years, said bureau chief Curt Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine said his office began investigating Santana's business after 
receiving complaints from customers who said Santana was incompetent. The state 
bureau also had warned Santana repeatedly to renew his license, Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
 When undercover investigators went to Santana's store to monitor his business 
practices, the dealer billed them for unnecessary parts, Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santana was charged with two petty theft counts in August, 1993. He pleaded 
guilty to both counts and was fined $1,080 and placed on two years' probation.

 The Hacienda La Puente Unified School Board has bounded back quickly from the 
resignation of its superintendent and appointed a longtime administrator to 
lead the 21,762-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kramar, 58, who previously served as assistant superintendent for 
business in the district, was appointed in late July to a three-year term at an 
annual salary of $101,500, plus use of a district car. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramar replaces Andrew Cazares, who resigned after 1 1/2 years on the job, 
reportedly to return to the Los Angeles Unified School District, where he 
worked for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a spokesman, Cazares said he preferred not to comment on his 
departure. He referred questions to Hacienda La Puente board President Norman 
Hsu, who said Cazares left voluntarily and in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles school district spokesman said Cazares met with LAUSD officials 
last week to discuss various jobs, including a position as one of 27 "cluster" 
leaders with the district. Under a massive reorganization, the Los Angeles 
district divided its schools into 27 geographic clusters made up of elementary, 
junior and senior high schools.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; DIVERSITY AMID DEVOTION; MORMON MISSIONARIES 
SEEK ASIAN AMERICANS AS CHURCH SHEDS ITS ALL-WHITE IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Steve Richardson recalls feeling more puzzled than excited when he opened his 
missions service letter from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Texan had no qualms about his assignment -- telling Chinese 
people in the San Gabriel Valley about the Mormon gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 What perplexed him was the language he had to speak: Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know what Mandarin was," Richardson said. "I knew what Chinese 
was but I didn't know the dialects. The whole thing was pretty new (to me)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen months into his two-year mission, the boy who grew up learning 
Spanish in Alvin, Tex., now speaks, reads and studies Mandarin daily in his 
Alhambra apartment. He and his partner, David Wells, 20, of Utah, know enough 
of the language to share their beliefs about Jesus Christ and the Book of 
Mormon with much of the Chinese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in the standard Mormon missionary outfit -- white short-sleeve shirt 
and plain-print tie -- the two spend six days each week roaming through 
Alhambra and Monterey Park, looking for Chinese homes to visit and hoping to 
win some souls for the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, you just figure out which doors are Chinese or not," 
Richardson said. "You look for shoes, Chinese signs on the door, characters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- a once-homogenous entity 
best known outside its ranks for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Brigham Young 
University and the Osmond family -- is expanding and diversifying at a rapid 
pace in Southern California and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon church membership grew by 22% in the United States between 1982 and 
1991, while some mainstream Protestant denominations reported declines of up to 
40%, according to the National Council of Churches. Mormon church membership 
worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million currently, according 
to church figures. And for the first time in the church's 164-year history, 
half of the world's Mormons now live outside the United States, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the trends have been mixed. The church has seen some 
of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country. But in 
the San Gabriel Valley and other areas, the church has reached out to replace 
its departing white members with Latinos, Chinese, Koreans and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Such demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that 
the Mormon church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that 
way. After all, the church denied its priesthood to blacks for more than a 
century until a "divine revelation" in 1978 ended such discrimination and 
opened the door to "every faithful, worthy man in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley has about 26,000 members among its seven Mormon 
"stakes," which are based in Pasadena, Arcadia, Glendora, La Verne, Covina, 
Hacienda Heights and Walnut. Stakes are regional units made up of congregations 
called wards, which typically have 400 to 600 members, and branches, which 
range from a dozen members to several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although whites still make up a majority of Mormon membership in the valley at 
78%, the proportion of Spanish-speaking followers has climbed to 20% and 
speakers of Asian languages to 2%, said Brad Foster, president of the Arcadia 
Mission, and Reid Gunnell, Foster's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 A more significant figure that Foster and Gunnell turn to is the ratio of 
converts. Just two years ago, 70% of new converts in the valley were white, 25% 
Latino and 5% Asian, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now whites make up half of those converted, 35% or 40% are Latino and the rest 
are Asian, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 And among Asian Mormons, those of Chinese origin lead the flock. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no Chinese-language services in the valley 13 years ago. But in the 
summer of 1981, church leaders commissioned Chinese American members to form 
the first branch in Rosemead, where services and programs are held in Mandarin. 
Two others have since sprung up in Hacienda Heights and Arcadia; Koreans also 
have a branch in Hacienda Heights. Vietnamese Mormons join the Chinese in 
Rosemead for Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, they saw a need," recalled Charles Chen, who served as 
president of the Chinese branch in Rosemead when it first opened. "Regardless 
of how many members . . . they just told me to go ahead and organize one. After 
the second meeting, we had 20-some people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have grown quite a lot. Every time we have 100 members, we split out to a 
different branch." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunnell also sees potential growth among the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese people, a lot of them are interested in our message," Gunnell 
said. "They come from a very different background, from the standpoint of 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with growth, the church has poured millions of dollars into its 
Southern California facilities, erecting a new chapel in Duarte and renovating 
other buildings in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1990, the 15,600-square-foot Duarte chapel at 1452 Royal Oaks Drive 
features a connecting hall for sports activities, banquets and dances. It also 
accommodates services for 200 Spanish-speaking and 400 English-speaking 
members, said Mel Reeves, president of the Arcadia stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley's Chinese branches, which range from 40 to 170 members, 
share facilities with English-speaking branches, though they eventually would 
like to acquire a building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have talked about it many years," Chen said. "The qualifications to have 
your own building are tougher" than in Taiwan or other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The local changes are only part of an increasingly diverse Mormon church. 
Almost from its inception, the church began sending missionaries to Europe and 
Mexico. Since then, the church has ventured into 149 countries, "every country 
that allows it to come in," said J. Gordon Melton, director of the Santa 
Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Today, Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and 
culturally diverse churches going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Book of Mormon, the pillar of the church's faith, tells the story of 
immigrants from the Middle East who founded elaborate civilizations in the 
Americas. Visited by Jesus after the Resurrection, they prospered for 
centuries, only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting 
among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story, inscribed on golden tablets, was said to have been found by 
Joseph Smith in New York in 1823, guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni. 
It is an image of Moroni, covered in gold leaf, that can be seen holding a 
trumpet atop the church's temples around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith established for the church a strict code of conduct that has been 
modified over the years but continues to place a large number of demands on its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church, wear 
special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a covenant with 
God, and follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom, which bans alcohol, 
coffee, tea and tobacco, and urges that meat be consumed "sparingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Families gather one night each week for a "home evening" devoted to prayer, 
study and activities from board games to night skiing. The church teaches that 
it is important for families to get along because they will spend eternity 
together in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Devout Mormons pray, study and socialize every Sunday at chapels, or meeting 
houses, scattered across Southern California. Classes, worship and meetings can 
fill up to 10 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American converts in the valley say they were drawn to the church's 
commitment to traditional family values and stringent moral guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of love at home. The parents and the kids seem to be very harmonious -- 
and that's very important," said Jiin-Jen Lee, reflecting on what drew him to 
the Mormon faith 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a civil engineering professor at USC, was a student at Utah State 
University in 1964 when Mormon missionaries introduced him to the religion. His 
parents practiced ancestral worship -- a popular Asian religion -- but 
Mormonism offered answers to Lee's questions about life and family. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent convert, Carry Tan of Duarte, had been a Buddhist for 40 years. 
But when her husband died of cancer 3 1/2 years ago, she could not find solace 
in Buddhism. Rather, solace came knocking on her door in the form of two 
Bible-carrying missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Buddhists always tell you you're poor because you're no good," said Tan, 
a part-time housekeeper and the mother of three. "Who will judge you for being 
good or bad? You'll never get the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in our church, they are very clear. Jesus will judge you," she said. "If 
you have a poor life, you can learn Mormonism. If you do your best, eventually 
your life will be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most effective conversion mechanism is the church's missionary 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon children are groomed for missionary work early on. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they are 19, the age at which they are eligible to serve, few 
Mormon men consider doing anything else. They send letters to Salt Lake City 
stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders. Women are 
eligible at 21 and now constitute 22% of the missionary roster, church 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 If a foreign language is required, missionaries are trained at the Missionary 
Training Center in Provo, Utah, which offers courses in 44 languages and trains 
about 3,300 missionaries each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually all their missionary counterparts, the Alhambra-based 
Richardson and Wells team receives no financial support from the church during 
their assignments. Instead, they and their parents set aside $8,400 to cover 
missionary expenses for two years, which include room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving their missions, Richardson and Wells are expected to abide by 
rules of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed: no dating, 
no television, no radio, no movies, no family visits and no more than three 
phone calls home per year -- on Mother's Day, Father's Day and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 They rise at 6:30 a.m., study religion for a few hours and hit the sidewalk by 
10:30 a.m. Aside from lunch or dinner breaks, they are not permitted to return 
to their apartment until 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson and Wells are two of 184 missionaries in the Arcadia mission, which 
stretches from Pomona to Glendale. Of those, six are assigned to bring in 
Chinese converts, another six to Koreans, two to Vietnamese, 70 to Latinos and 
100 to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 One Latino convert was brought up by her parents as a Catholic, became a 
Pentecostal Christian in 1992 and abandoned her Assembly of God church in 
Orange County after her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met the missionaries," said Dorothy Marie Bustamante Bandy, 30, of 
Monrovia. "They were visiting my sister, and they were very helpful to me." 
</P>
<P>
 After tasting aspects of each religion, Bandy said she's confident that the 
Mormon faith stands out above the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no structure in the Pentecostal church," said Bandy, the mother of 
a 6-year-old boy. "Anyone can walk in and serve in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Latter-day Saints church, you need to be in attendance and you pray 
about it -- there is a procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 Church members are helping Bandy find employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure of the (Mormon) church is not to take and take," she said. 
"They give and give." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of other local religious leaders to Mormonism's tenacious 
campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon missionary activity is "far more aggressive than anything we're 
doing," says Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. "I don't want to say being aggressive is bad. Maybe we should be 
saying we're not aggressive enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities 
of Southern California, he said. The St. Thomas Aquinas parish in Monterey 
Park, for example, was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical 
center. The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region's Chinese 
population, though the decision angered a large segment of the parish's 
predominantly Latino membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic church's Latino stronghold is 
being eroded by the Mormon church. The Mormon church is "one of the many 
religions, sects and cults that are out there trying to attract people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the church's efforts within the Asian community caused problems among 
Buddhist leaders in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not concerned about other religions," said the Rev. Man Tau of Hsi Lai 
Temple in Hacienda Heights. Since its opening in 1988, the temple at 3456 S. 
Glenmark Drive has amassed 10,000 Chinese, Japanese and Korean members. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Mormon creed of spreading the Gospel, Buddhists refrain from 
evangelizing the world and instead encourage individuals to seek their own 
paths to Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go out for family visits," Tau said. "We are strictly forbidden to 
convert people to believe. This is not the right way." 
</P>

BIG 9TH STRANDS DODGERS; BASEBALL: VALDES SURRENDERS TWO RUNS IN THE NINTH 
INNING OF 4-2 LOSS AS STRIKE ATMOSPHERE TAKES HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everywhere you turned at Dodger Stadium Wednesday night, the talk was of 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the catacombs -- before the next-to-last-game-of-1994? -- players hunkered 
down with their union representative and restated their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mound, pitchers threw like there was no tomorrow. Three Dodgers struck 
out 12 San Diego Padres in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Ashby, the luckless Padres' starter, struck out eight Dodgers in eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Might as well go out swinging, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that became less important as new battle lines were being formed 
between players and owners, the Padres scored two runs in the ninth inning off 
reliever Ismael Valdes to defeat the Dodgers, 4-2, before 43,270. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dodgers tied the game in the eighth inning on Eric Karros' 12th home 
run, the Padres took advantage of a leaky Valdes. Tony Gwynn, no surprise, led 
the Padre rally and scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn opened the ninth with a double into the right-field corner. After Valdes 
struck out Derek Bell, Eddie Williams tripled home Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
 After Omar Daal replaced Valdes, Phil Plantier executed a perfect squeeze to 
score Williams from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby (5-11) gave up eight hits in eight innings and picked up the victory. 
Trevor Hoffman retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth to pick up his 17th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes, 2-1, took the loss in relief of starter Pedro Astacio, who allowed two 
runs and struck out nine in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the Dodgers below the .500 mark, but they retained their 
two-game lead over the San Francisco Giants, who were pounded by Cincinnati, 
17-4, earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 So now what? 
</P>
<P>
 Taking no chances with a possible work stoppage looming, Butler led off the 
game with a base hit to center and promptly stole his 500th career base. 
</P>
<P>
 With the theft of second, Butler became the 21st major league player with at 
least 2,000 hits, 500 steals and 1,200 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 With his feat, and feet, Butler, 37, joined a select group that includes Honus 
Wagner, Ty Cobb, Lou Brock Joe Morgan, Rickey Henderson and Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowly Padres scored in the top of the first. Bip Roberts opened the game 
with a double off Astacio, moved to third on Gwynn's fly out and scored on 
Bell's sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no further scoring until the fifth, when Craig Shipley made it 
2-0 when he opened the inning with his third home run of the season off 
Astacio, ramming a 2-2 pitch over the 360-foot sign in left. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio bailed himself out of more trouble in the sixth when, with one out, he 
allowed a single to Gwynn and walked Derek Bell. But he escaped when Eddie 
Williams grounded into a 5-4-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers cut the lead to 2-1 in their half of the sixth, but exited 
frustrated. Mike Piazza doubled to right-center to open the inning and moved to 
third on Tim Wallach's ground out. After Karros struck out, Henry Rodriguez 
drove Piazza home with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 After working the count to 3-1, however, Raul Mondesi eventually took a third 
strike to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Padre seventh, Dodger coach Reggie Smith was ejected by Bruce 
Froemming, the home plate umpire. Smith charged from the dugout to challenge 
Froemming and eventually had to be restrained by Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's outburst did not inspire the troops. Chris Gwynn opened the seventh 
with a pinch-single off shortstop Luis Lopez' glove, was sacrificed to second 
by another pinch-hitter, Jeff Treadway, but was stranded when Butler flied out 
and Delino DeShields grounded out.

 Ruthie Bolton-Holifield is a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army reserve, but 
that's not where she learned to be tough. That came growing up in a family of

ANGELS APPEAR SET TO GO ON STRIKE; BASEBALL: MAYBE THEY ALREADY HAVE, AS THEY 
LOSE FOR 10TH TIME IN 12 GAMES, FALLING TO MARINERS, 8-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels secretly voted Wednesday to authorize an early strike, and 
according to several players, they might be playing their final game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston, Angel player representative, is scheduled to be on a conference 
call this morning with the executive board and inform Don Fehr, director of the 
Major League Players Assn., of their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be walking after (tonight)," one player said, "unless this gets 
cleared up real quick. It's gonna happen in the next couple of days, there's no 
doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just lucky we didn't walk tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, considering the way the Angels performed Wednesday, losing, 8-4, 
to the Seattle Mariners, who can blame the crowd of 15,549 at Anaheim Stadium 
for wondering if the Angels jumped the gun? 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who arrived early to the ballpark to inform his teammates of the 
urgency to strike earlier than Aug. 12, was racked for a season-high 11 hits 
and eight runs in 5 2/3 innings. It was the most runs he has yielded since Aug. 
12, 1990, and only one fewer than his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Angels (44-64) with their 10th defeat in the last 12 games, and 
mathematically eliminated them from the American League West race if a strike 
ends the season by Aug. 12. The Angels are 7 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers 
with only seven games remaining before the original strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody wants to strike," Angel designated hitter Chili Davis 
said, "although I think this ballclub would welcome it right now the way we're 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the possible early strike is that the Players Assn. became 
furious when they discovered that baseball owners did not make a $7.8-million 
payment to the players' pension plan that was due Aug. 1. Richard Ravitch, 
president of the Player Relations Committee, said the owners felt they have no 
contractual obligation to make the pension payment because the Basic Agreement 
has expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had known that," Davis said, "there wouldn't have been an All-Star 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Langston: "This puts more fuel on the fire to step it up and let them 
know we're very disappointed. It's very unfortunate the owners decided to make 
such an aggressive move. If everybody's united about it, we could be walking 
out (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels knew that something was wrong about three hours before game time 
when Langston walked onto the field in his street clothes and called them 
together. It was Langston's day to pitch, and he usually doesn't even step onto 
the field until he takes the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him walking toward us," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said, "I 
thought, 'This is it. We're walking. We're walking right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Langston briefed the Angels on the latest news, and later took an 
informal poll. The vote was unanimous, according to one player, to strike 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels now are on verge of being left with the bitter taste of yet another 
rotten season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still cursing the antics Tuesday of Mariner starter Randy Johnson, the Angels 
had vowed to take their revenge on Dave Fleming (7-11). Instead, they were 
limited to two hits through the first five innings, and trailed 8-0 when they 
batted in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy Johnson tried to show up some of our hitters by walking up to home 
plate and staring them down," Davis said. "That's not the way the game is 
played." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, it may not be matter.

MORNING BRIEFING: VAN SLYKE'S POOR SEASON IS NO JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Brian O'Neill has had enough of the Pirates' 
Andy Van Slyke's poor season . . . and his fat salary. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy Van Slump. What a stiff. Here it is, the end of July and the 
Four-Million-Dollar Man has 27 RBIs. Mickey Mantle could have knocked in that 
many with one of his swizzle sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Tony Dorsett became the sixth Heisman Trophy winner inducted into 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame last week. Name the other five. 
</P>
<P>
 Scooter line: In his Hall of Fame induction address the other day, Phil 
Rizzuto broke everyone up with an account of how he nearly jumped to the 
Mexican League one year for a $10,000 salary and a Cadillac.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said his wife, Cora, told him: "You go to Mexico, you go without me." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rizzuto: "It was a time when you couldn't get butter, you couldn't get 
stockings, you couldn't get a girdle. Not that she needed a girdle. . . . she 
was pretty well built." 
</P>
<P>
 O's-bound? The Baltimore Sun's Tom Keegan, forecasting perfect-game pitcher 
Kenny Rogers' value in the free-agent market, wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never been on the disabled list with an arm injury, he's 22-10 and has a 
3.61 ERA since July 1, 1993, and has more wins since then than Roger Clemens, 
Jack McDowell, Mike Mussina, Randy Johnson and David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Durable, experienced and a winner, he's exactly what the Orioles need." 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth: A man walked around Yankee Stadium Sunday carrying a sign 
that on one side said: "Connie, will you divorce me?" The flip side: "Angel, 
will you marry me?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the stars: The Amateur Athletic Foundation points out that four of the 14 
men who have hit 500 home runs were born in 1931: Willie Mays (660), Mickey

a month."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This should be the year of the strike in the Pacific 10 Conference -- strikes 
thrown by some of the most accurate passers in the nation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Barr of California set a Pac-10 passing efficiency record last season, 
meaning that he is rated as high as, oh, third among the conference's returning 
quarterbacks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stenstrom of Stanford and Rob Johnson of USC generally are ranked ahead 
of Barr, with Danny O'Neil of Oregon and Wayne Cook of UCLA not too far behind. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We have, I believe, the best quarterback in college football in Steve 
Stenstrom," said his coach, Bill Walsh, at the Pac-10 preseason media session 
Wednesday. "He's ahead, mechanically and skillwise, of 75% of the quarterbacks 
in the NFL." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell does Walsh know about quarterbacks?" cracked an old coaching 
rival, John Robinson of USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA probably has the toughest schedule, one that includes games at Nebraska, 
Washington, California, Arizona and Arizona State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This league is a minefield every week," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said. "Every 
game will be a death march." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise was that both UCLA wide receiver J.J. Stokes and Washington 
running back Napoleon Kaufman chose to return for their senior seasons instead 
of opting for the NFL draft. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I made a commitment to Coach (Terry) Donahue and I promised my father that I 
would get my degree," Stokes said. "I'm enjoying myself and want to continue to 
do so." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Washington Coach Jim Lambright said: "We open at USC, come home for Ohio 
State, go to Miami, and come home for UCLA. If Napoleon's any damn good, you'll 
be able to tell after those four games." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that every coach mentioned USC or Washington as the conference 
favorite. Wednesday, it was Arizona. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, coming off a 29-0 victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 
1, should be very strong defensively again, and have an improving quarterback 
in Dan White. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Big game: Arizona vs. USC on Nov. 12 at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA junior wide receiver Kevin Jordan caught 45 passes last season but 
remains a well-kept secret because he plays on the same team with Stokes. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to repeat, go to the Rose Bowl and win it this time," Donahue said. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 This is the final season for artificial turf at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, 
where a grass field will be installed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best defender in the league is Bear inside linebacker Jerrott Willard, who was 
a semifinalist for the Dick Butkus Award last year and is described by Coach 
Keith Gilbertson as the best player he has ever coached. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be more physical," said Robinson, who is beginning the second year 
of his second tour of duty at USC. "We didn't dominate games physically." . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is counting on some junior college transfers to add bulk and 
aggressiveness to his roster. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since Mazio Royster in 1990. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State won twice as many games last year, four, as in Jerry Pettibone's 
first two years combined. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we feel we will be competitive week in and week out in 
the Pac-10," Pettibone said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities" rates Corvallis, Ore. 
(pop. 45,000), home of the Beavers, second in overall livability. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Washington State and defense are not synonymous, but the Cougars ranked second 
in the nation against the run and eighth in total defense last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has 19 returning starters, including kickers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After two consecutive 6-5 seasons at Arizona State, Coach Bruce Snyder said: 
"We haven't quite reached the over-the- hump business. We have to get started 
faster. We've been a hot team late when we've been out of the running." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10's .551 winning record in bowl games is the highest of any major 
conference that has played in at least 30, followed by the Atlantic Coast 
Conference at .534 and the Southeastern Conference at .502. Lowest is the 
Western Athletic Conference at .434. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' Johnson on his Heisman Trophy candidacy: "It's like a no-hitter. 
You don't want to talk about it until it happens." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the sportswriters and sportscasters see the conference race: 1 -- 
Arizona, 2 -- USC, 3 -- UCLA, 4 -- Stanford, 5 -- California, 6 -- Washington, 
7 -- Arizona State, 8 -- Oregon, 9 -- Oregon State, 10 -- Washington State.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; HOBERT THRILLED WITH EXHIBITION OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might have been an exhibition game, but to quarterback Billy Joe Hobert it 
was the highlight of his football career. 
</P>
<P>
 Better even than leading the Washington Huskies to 17 victories in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobert was accustomed to being a star when he joined the Raiders last season 
as a third-round draft choice. But he quickly had to learn to accept that his 
star had, temporarily at least, dimmed because he became the second backup 
behind starter Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Coach Art Shell put Hobert into last Sunday's exhibition opener 
against Denver in the third quarter and left him there through overtime -- even 
though the Broncos had their defensive starters back in the game -- Hobert was 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most fun I've ever had in football," he said of his march to Jeff 
Jaeger's game-winning 39-yard field goal. "I can't remember having as much fun. 
It was nice to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Aaron Wallace, who sat out Sunday's game in Barcelona because of a 
knee injury, was on the field Wednesday and reported no tightness in the knee. 
Shell said he will start Wallace Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys in Texas if 
he has totally recovered. . . . Defensive lineman Scott Davis sat out 
Wednesday's drills as a precaution. He suffered a leg injury Sunday but missed 
only one play. . . . James Folston, who filled in for Wallace, said the ankle 
he sprained against the Broncos has responded well. STEVE SPRINGER

ROLLER HOCKEY; BLADES TAKE CHARGE EARLY, WIN, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. Blades, whose habit has been to give up early leads and fight back, 
got their defense in gear early in an 8-5 victory over the Anaheim Bullfrogs 
Wednesday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades held off the Bullfrogs for 21 seconds of a 4-on-2 power play early 
in the first quarter, and the momentum of that defensive stand led to goals 11 
seconds apart from Mike Callahan and Brett Kurtz for a 2-0 lead that later 
became 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade goalie Max Mikhailovsky, pulled against Las Vegas when ineffective a 
week ago, made 46 saves. Averaging 33.9 saves a game, he had 25 by halftime in 
front of 4,891. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory puts the first-place Blades (15-4) two games ahead of second-place 
Anaheim (12-5) in the Roller Hockey International Pacific Division. MATT WHITE

WOMEN'S TENNIS; GRAF WAKES UP, DEFEATS RAYMOND IN THREE SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's Steffi Graf survived an early scare as she stormed back to defeat 
Lisa Raymond, 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 6-2, Wednesday in the third round of the $400,000 
Toshiba Tennis Classic at the La Costa Resort and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond matched Graf, the world's No. 1-ranked player, stroke for stroke in 
the seesaw first set.But Raymond, a two-time NCAA champion, failed to keep pace 
in the next two sets as Graf elevated her game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept the ball more in the rally," Graf said. "I was more patient. I think 
that was the big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's Conchita Martinez, ranked third in the world, made her tournament 
debut with an easy 6-0, 6-4 victory against Nathalie Baudone of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very confident," said Martinez, the Wimbledon champion. "I feel I'm 
playing good tennis right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain used strong ground strokes to 
defeat France's Sandrine Testud, 6-1, 6-3, in a night match. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two upsets involving seeded players. Eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat 
of France dropped a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 decision to Tami Whitlinger-Jones of Neenah, 
Wisc., and Angelica Gavaldon of Coronado downed 14th-seeded Gigi Fernandez of 
Aspen, Colo., 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4.

APELL'S MANEUVERS SUCCEED YET AGAIN; TENNIS: MOST TALK CENTERS ON SWEDE'S 
RECENT LIFESAVING HEROICS DESPITE 6-4, 6-2 ROUT OF 27TH-RANKED VOLKOV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan Apell took advantage of a struggling Alexander Volkov to score a 6-4, 6-2 
victory Wednesday in the second round of the Los Angeles Open at the L.A. 
Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Volkov began the match by double faulting, and things got 
steadily worse for the Russian, who appeared to give up in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell, ranked 102nd and better known for his doubles prowess, is playing his 
first season on the ATP pro tour in singles. In a postmatch news conference, 
however, reporters were more interested in hearing about a choking victim he 
faced than the progress of his singles career. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell was preparing for a doubles match at the Manchester Open in June when he 
noticed one of the locker-room stewards choking. 
</P>
<P>
 John Monaghan, 69, was gasping for air and waving frantically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and I thought he had problems," Apell said. "I came to him and he 
couldn't say anything. He had something stuck in his throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Apell struck Monaghan on the back to try to dislodge the object. When that 
didn't work, Apell ran outside to get help. "We need a doctor in here, it's 
urgent," he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell returned to Monaghan's side and, although he had no formal training in 
life-saving techniques, successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize that the name was Heimlich, but I did it," Apell said. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Apell, who is from Sweden, know the maneuver? 
</P>
<P>
 "Swedish instinct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a frustrated Volkov Wednesday, the left-handed Apell won four of six 
break points and concentrated on executing his game plan, which he said was "to 
mix it up a little bit, to get him confused." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan worked. With Apell leading, 4-2, in the second set, the 27th-ranked 
Volkov apparently decided to pack it in. He hit two volleys lamely into the net 
and one wide to hand Apell his last break point. The crowd made its 
disappointment known. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell won the last eight points, capped by an ace that Volkov didn't even move 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov grabbed his tennis bag and left the stadium, eventually returning to 
speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made too many mistakes on unforced errors," he said. "(Apell) just tried to 
mix and keep the ball in play as long as possible from the baseline, and I was 
not ready to play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Apell said he wasn't surprised when Volkov gave up, but empathized with 
Volkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he didn't play his best tennis," Apell said. "Sometimes when you feel 
like you are not playing well, sometimes, you don't know what to do and you 
just give it away. . . . It has happened to me as well. I have done the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Apell, 24, who also defeated Volkov in the second round of the Lipton 
Championships at Key Biscayne, Fla., in March, the victory increased his 
confidence in his singles game. He played only ATP Challenger tournaments in 
singles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other second-round matches Wednesday, Mark Petchey of Great Britain lost to 
53rd-ranked Mark Woodforde of Australia, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Petchey, ranked 89th, 
had upset top-seeded Michael Chang in the first round on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the featured night match, fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek of The Netherlands, 
the defending champion, defeated Robbie Weiss, 6-2, 6-3. Weiss, ranked 123rd, 
won an NCAA singles title at Pepperdine in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance Wednesday was 11,641. In today's second-round matches, 
eighth-seeded Karsten Braasch of Germany will play tournament qualifier Steve 
Campbell at noon, followed at about 2 p.m. by 60th-ranked Chuck Adams against 
second-seeded Boris Becker. Sixth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia will 
play 87th-ranked Steve Bryan, beginning at about 4 p.m. Third-seeded Andre 
Agassi will play 61st-ranked Greg Rusedski of Canada at 7:30 p.m.

NEWSWIRE: PROBERT'S PROBLEMS MOUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Probert of the Chicago Blackhawks had cocaine in his system when he 
crashed his motorcycle last month, a television station in Southfield, Mich., 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Probert also had a blood-alcohol level of 0.31, more than three times the 
legal limit, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been charged with drunken driving in the July 15 accident and is free 
on $10,000 bond. He crashed his motorcycle into a car about 2 p.m. and was 
taken to a hospital, where he spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings released Probert shortly after the crash, saying they'd 
had enough of his off-ice behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 He later signed a $6-million deal with the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Probert's status in the NHL and the United States could be in jeopardy. He 
had been playing for the Red Wings under a waiver from the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver was necessary because the Canadian-born player has a felony drug 
conviction for trying to smuggle cocaine across the U.S.-Canadian border in 
1989.

 Robert Schwartz, district attorney in Albuquerque, N.M., said his office will 
appeal a judge's decision to drop charges against three-time Indianapolis 500 
winner Bobby Unser. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of battery, resisting arrest and careless driving were filed against 
Unser in connection with an alleged confrontation involving an Albuquerque 
airport police officer on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Judge Joanne Birge dismissed the charges with prejudice Friday, 
meaning they cannot be refiled. If the appeal is unsuccessful, then "it's 
over," Schwartz said. Birge originally dismissed the charges due to technical 
problems and the charges were refiled. Tennis

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES WILL BE FIRST ON AUG. 12 STRIKE DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Yankees became the first team to assure themselves of being in 
first place on the players' original Aug. 12 strike date, defeating the 
Milwaukee Brewers, 2-1, on Wednesday night in a rain-shortened game at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was called after 7 1/2 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us looked at magic numbers for the strike date or 
anything else," Don Mattingly said after the Yankees won their sixth in a row 
overall and eighth in a row on the road. "We're just playing the best baseball 
we can day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, 17-3 since the All-Star break, hold a nine-game lead over the 
Baltimore Orioles in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Hitchcock (4-1) pitched a strong game after escaping a jam in the 
Brewers' fourth and protected a 2-1 lead through seven innings. Bob Wickman 
came out to start the eighth, but the downpour beat his first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 68-minute rain delay, the game was called. It was a move that irked 
the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a 2-1 lead, but we have two at-bats against them," said Jody Reed, 
who had two of the five hits against Hitchcock. "We're feeling pretty confident 
we can get something done against them and the game's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 9, Oakland 5 -- The victory at Kansas City extended baseball's 
longest winning streak of the season to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hamelin broke Bo Jackson's club rookie record with his 23rd homer for the 
Royals, whose only longer winning streak was a 16-game run in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin's two-run homer chased Bobby Witt (8-10) in the fifth and broke the 
record Jackson set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Detroit 4 -- The Indians, aided by an error on Tiger pitcher Tim 
Belcher, scratched out four runs in the fourth inning before Sandy Alomar's 
eighth-inning homer clinched their victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (7-14) was charged with an error for missing the bag with his foot 
while covering first on Paul Sorrento's grounder to Cecil Fielder. The error 
loaded the bases, and the Indians -- who already had scored once in the inning 
on Manny Ramirez's run-scoring single -- added three more when Alomar was hit, 
Wayne Kirby grounded to second and Omar Vizquel hit a sacrifice fly for a 5-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Nagy (9-8) gave up four runs, one unearned, and 10 hits in seven 
innings.

<P>
 Minnesota 4, Baltimore 3 -- Scott Leius capped a two-run rally in the bottom 
of the ninth at Minneapolis with a two-out RBI single against reliever Lee 
Smith as the Twins ended a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Cole led off the ninth with a pinch-single against Smith (1-4) and moved 
to second when Kirby Puckett walked on four pitches. After Shane Mack 
sacrificed, pinch-hitter Chip Hale hit a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Kent 
Hrbek was walked intentionally and Leius followed with a single to left-center, 
scoring Puckett with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 7, Toronto 2 -- Tom Brunansky's two-run homer capped a six-run fifth 
inning at Boston and Tim VanEgmond pitched 7 1/3 strong innings for his second 
major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Naehring had three RBIs for the Red Sox, who sent 10 batters to the plate 
in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 VanEgmond (2-3) gave up two runs and eight hits in his seventh major league 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 11, Chicago 8 -- Jose Canseco homered twice for the Rangers and Rusty 
Greer brought in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco's 31st homer tied the score, 8-8, in the seventh. He had a two-run 
double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Thomas hit his 37th homer for the White Sox.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MITCHELL'S HIGH FIVE LEADS REDS' 17-4 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dusty Baker likened it to Cincinnati's Big Red Machine teams of the 1970s: 17 
runs, 24 hits, balls hit all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Kevin Mitchell, who had five hits and five runs batted in, the 
Cincinnati Reds pounded the San Francisco Giants, 17-4, at San Francisco to 
complete a three-game sweep with their sixth consecutive road victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitch put on a hitting clinic," said Baker, the Giants' manager. "He was on 
today, and when he's on, there's none better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw him in, out, up and down. Fastballs in and away, breaking balls in 
and away, and he hit everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell homered, doubled twice and added two singles, and every ball was hit 
hard. The fans at Candlestick Park showed they still had fond feelings for 
Mitchell, who spent four-plus seasons with the Giants, and loudly cheered each 
of his hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That brought back a lot of memories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fifth inning, Mitchell was already four for four. He came up again in 
the sixth with runners at second and third and the Reds leading, 12-2, and 
scorched a two-run single off the right-center wall. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Red Manager Davey Johnson took him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell wasn't the only Red to have a big day. Bret Boone had four hits and 
scored five times, Brian Hunter had four RBIs, and John Roper (6-1) gave up two 
runs and two hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the first four Cincinnati batters, including Mitchell, hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 7, Pittsburgh 0 -- Danny Jackson pitched a six-hitter and Kevin 
Stocker drove in three runs for the Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (14-5) struck out seven and did not walk a batter in becoming the 
first Phillie to pitch a shutout this season. It was Jackson's 14th shutout but 
his first since June 12, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Jordan homered and drove in three runs for the Phillies and Stocker, who 
also homered in Tuesday's game, hit his second homer of the year in the second 
inning against Steve Cooke (4-10). 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, Atlanta 2 -- Jose Vizcaino's two-out, bases-loaded single brought 
home the winning run in the ninth inning at New York as the Braves' bullpen 
squandered another save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th blown save for Atlanta, the 10th for Greg McMichael (3-6) in 
30 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kent walked to open the ninth and went to third on David Segui's 
hit-and-run single. Rico Brogna then hit a single up the middle, tying the 
score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mark Wohlers relieved McMichael, Ryan Thompson sacrificed, Joe Orsulak 
walked and Todd Hundley struck out before Vizcaino, pinch-hitting for Kelly 
Stinnett, lined a single over the shortstop's head to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, St. Louis 3 -- The victory at Montreal was the Expos' sixth in a 
row and helped them open the largest divisional lead of the season in the 
National League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Webster, Sean Berry and Moises Alou had solo home runs, Larry Walker had 
three doubles -- increasing his NL-leading total to 43 -- and Gil Heredia gave 
up only four hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal, which has won 14 of 15 games, has a 5 1/2-game lead over the Braves, 
a half-game larger than the Braves' largest divisional lead on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Heredia (5-3), making his second start of the season, gave up only one hit 
after Mark Whiten hit a leadoff single in the second. He struck out six and 
walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 2, Colorado 1 -- Andujar Cedeno drove in the winning run with a 
two-out single in the ninth inning at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzalez singled against Bruce Ruffin (3-5) with one out. Another out and 
one walk later, Cedeno lined a single to left and Gonzalez scored as Mike 
Kingery's throw to the plate was wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado, which was a half-game out of first place a week ago, lost for the 
fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 9, Chicago 8 -- Benito Santiago's sacrifice fly scored Jeff Conine 
with the go-ahead run in the ninth inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Conine doubled to open the ninth and went to third on Greg Colbrunn's single. 
Santiago then hit a medium-range fly ball, and left-fielder Derrick May did not 
make a throw home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Abbott added a pinch-hit, RBI double later in the inning, giving the 
Marlins an insurance run they ended up needing. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago went three for three with two doubles, and Conine and Gary Sheffield 
hit two-run homers for the Marlins, who won their second consecutive game after 
losing seven in a row.

DEL MAR; MCCARRON, A LATE ADD, RIDES FEATURE WINNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Eddie Delahoussaye asked off of Wednesday's mounts after undergoing a 
root canal, trainer Melvin Stute went with Chris McCarron on Desert Pirate in 
the featured Graduation Stakes and came away with a 5 1/2-length victory over 
favored Charlie Galea. 
</P>
<P>
 It was actually amazing that McCarron did not have a mount in the first place, 
since he is the valedictorian of the Graduation Stakes. Wednesday's victory was 
his eighth in the six-furlong race for Cal-bred 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stute told McCarron to ride the race according to his instincts, but did have 
instructions for the post parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran off with Alex (Solis) during the post parade at Hollywood Park," Stute 
said. "Go off the wrong way and stay away from the other horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Pirate ran away from the other horses in the race itself, putting away 
the 4-5 favorite Charlie Galea after a duel to the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, serving a five-day suspension, will ride both Grade I races this 
weekend, getting Lyin To The Moon in the Ramona Handicap Saturday and Wharf in 
the Eddie Read Handicap Sunday. Both are "designated races" that are not 
affected by suspensions. . . . Silver Music, the winner of the Swaps Stakes at 
Hollywood Park July 23, has been supplemented for the Aug. 13 Pacific Classic. 
Both the Swaps and the Classic are run at 1 1/4 miles. DAVE DISTEL

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: POMONA RACEWAY TURNS BACK CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Hot Rod Assn. will come full circle Saturday when it holds drag 
races for street-legal cars and motorcycles at Pomona Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, designed to help curb illegal street racing, is similar to one 
that led to formation of the NHRA in 1951. Contestants will drive over the same 
stretch of asphalt where the season-opening Chief Auto Parts Winternationals 
and season-ending Winston Select Finals are held each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like turning the clock back more than four decades with the return of 
grass-roots racing at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds," said Wally Parks, 
NHRA founder and board chairman. "It was here that the first police-sponsored 
dragstrip was introduced in the early 1950s. It seems only fitting that this 
new program for street-legal vehicles can be credited to support from the 
police departments of La Verne and Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne Mayor Jon Blickenstaff and Police Chief Ron Ingels spearheaded the 
campaign to return street racing to the Pomona strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a street-racing problem in this end of (Los Angeles County), and I 
hope this will help," Ingels said. "It provides an opportunity for young people 
to have some good, wholesome fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday will be the first time in 20 years that full-sized vehicles will 
compete at Pomona Raceway in other than the two NHRA national events. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, then-Pomona police chief Ralph Parker and then-Pomona police sergeant 
Bud Coons worked to take hot rods off the streets of Southern California with 
police-conducted drag races at the Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona Police Department is distributing thousands of fliers containing 
details of the event to performance-car and motorcycle enthusiasts in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHRA was also created to provide rules for drag racing and to set strict 
safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes back to our roots, the original idea of the NHRA, to give people a 
place to race," said Bernie Partridge, former NHRA vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors must race in either a street-legal car or motorcycle that uses 
street tires and mufflers. Side-by-side racing will be over one-eighth of a 
mile. Competition will be from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes

SURFING; FOR DEFFENBAUGH, IT'S A BIG WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surfing in his first world championship tour event Wednesday, Huntington 
Beach's Jeff Deffenbaugh proved he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three men to qualify for the U.S. Open of Surfing through the Op 
Pro, Deffenbaugh faced third-rated Shane Powell of Australia and Fabio Gouveia, 
a national hero in Brazil. On the strength of eight waves, Deffenbaugh, 21, 
defeated them both and advanced to the third round. Powell and Gouveia moved to 
the second round, which begins the one-on-one, single-elimination format. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got nothing to lose and all to gain here at Huntington Beach," 
Deffenbaugh said. "They're fighting for points and their spot in the world 
(ratings)." 
</P>
<P>
 A regular competitor on the world qualifying series, Deffenbaugh holds the 
13th spot after the Op Pro. The year's top 16 finishers qualify for the world 
championship tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Curren, another wild-card entry, brought out a 5-foot 7-inch, squash-tail 
board, hoping to rekindle the excitement he caused in France last year when he 
won on a 1960s model. He finished third in the tightest heat of the day and 
will go back to a standard surfboard for the rest of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Curren won four Op Pros and three world titles in the 1980s, he has 
not competed in the United States in three years. "I was a bit nervous," he 
said after his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's competition, Op Pro winner Freida Zamba won both her heats by a 
combined margin of 23.44. She is one of 16 remaining from the 48 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. Open returns next year, the contest will be limited to 20 women. 
Graham Cassidy, executive director of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, said 
he plans to give the women's tour its own identity in 1995. . . . Today's 
schedule: 6 a.m.-12:40 p.m., men's surfing, round 2; 12:40-4 p.m., women's 
surfing, round 2; 4-6:40 p.m., bodyboarding, round 2; 9 a.m.-5 p.m., U.S. Open 
Beach Expo; 5:30 p.m.-1 a.m. U.S. Open of Surfing/Surfrider fund-raiser at Hard 
Rock Cafe.

WASHINGTON INSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Times Washington Bureau 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NOT READY FOR CRIME TIME: An extraordinary alliance of Congressional Black 
Caucus members and National Rifle Assn. followers is snarling Democratic 
leaders' hopes for swift passage of the $33-billion crime bill. House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has scrapped plans for a vote today and is scrambling 
to get a Democratic majority of 218 to clear a procedural hurdle. . . . Pro-NRA 
Democrats who oppose an assault-weapons ban and caucus members upset over the 
absence of a "racial justice" provision may combine with 178 GOP lawmakers to 
block consideration of the legislation this week. At best, the bill may get 
through the House tomorrow. At worst, it may have to go back to conference for 
revisions that would produce a Democratic majority. 
</P>

 MCPIQUED: The Pentagon has shot down an eleventh-hour attempt by the Air 
Force's chief of staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, to bring the military's 
prestigious space programs under his wing. The maverick, 58-year-old former 
fighter pilot proposed the idea without telling his colleagues on the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. . . . This week, the chiefs of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps 
disclosed a rare joint memo they had written to Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, protesting McPeak's attempted end-run and 
requesting that the issue "be worked as a joint action" by all four services. 
The chairman's response: Not to worry -- the plan will be subject to JCS 
approval. One irony: The power grab comes as Congress is drafting language to 
transfer the troubled MilStar communications satellite program to the Navy 
because lawmakers believe that the Air Force is mismanaging it. 
</P>

<P>
 NOW YOU SEE IT: The Clinton Administration is struggling to play both sides of 
the street in managing public opinion concerning the new U.S. military 
operation in Rwanda. Although the White House clearly wants President Clinton 
to get credit for responding to the crisis, the Pentagon has been trying to 
minimize the U.S. role -- and the risk to American troops. . . . Pentagon 
officials have been larding every briefing with the admonition that the U.S. 
involvement is "solely a humanitarian relief operation" and "will not include 
peacekeeping" -- i.e., providing security for the effort. And Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry returned from Rwanda last weekend with the announcement that 
the United States had scaled back its estimate of U.S. troops that would be 
needed to 3,000 or fewer, down from more than 4,000 only a few days before. 
Perry also said that, contrary to expectations only a week ago, U.S. soldiers 
probably would not staff the shelters that Washington hopes to set up for 
Rwandan refugees returning home from Zaire.

 LITTLE GREEN MEN: Like most third-party efforts, Ross Perot's presidential 
campaign attracted more than its share of people who are, perhaps, a little 
offbeat. Consider this from the latest Times Poll: Asked if they had ever had 
"an encounter or experience . . . (with) a being from another planet," only 4% 
of George Bush and Clinton voters said they had, but 8% of Perot voters said 
so.

 WHITEWATER WEIRDNESS: Amid the seriousness of the Whitewater hearings were 
these developments: Comedian Jackie Mason put in an appearance at the hearings 
on Monday, apparently in search of material for his comedy routine. . . . 
Perhaps this was the kind of fodder he was looking for: Each time Democratic 
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois took the microphone to speak, conservative 
GOP Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina was observed making this quiet 
statement from his side of the political aisle: He popped the hearing aids out 
of both ears.

SURF'S HEARSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pink hearse will be tooling around Orange County during the next few days. 
Its mission is not to give some dearly departed an unusually colorful send-off, 
but to herald the resurrection of an historical body of Southern California 
rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The man with the hearse is Bob Keane, president of Del-Fi Records, which has 
just reissued its 12-album catalogue of 1963-vintage instrumental surf rock 
music on compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Keane says he used to travel around the country giving away hearses 31 years 
ago as part of the initial promotional push for Del-Fi's surf-music collection. 
At the time, surfers favored hearses for reasons both practical (you could 
easily fit a longboard in one) and image-conscious (what better way to 
advertise your death-defying bravado than by riding in a hearse?). 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave away hearses in Pittsburgh, Dallas, San Francisco," Keane recalled 
Tuesday, over the phone from his office in Hollywood. "In Pittsburgh they had a 
traffic jam because all these kids were following this hearse down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 To honor tradition and to help push his "California Surf Series," Keane and 
his hearse will make a series of Orange County appearances this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today at 11 a.m., he is scheduled to be at the Huntington Beach International 
Surfing Museum, where he will present some of the original, out-of-print album 
covers to the museum, which is at 411 Olive St. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday at 1 p.m., the hearse will dock at Tower Records in Anaheim, and a 
Sunday afternoon visit is scheduled at Tower at Newport Boulevard and 17th 
Street in Costa Mesa. Del-Fi won't be giving away its Cadillac hearse, but it 
will be running a surfboard giveaway contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del-Fi reissue comes at a time of renewed interest in surf music. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Dale, who pioneered the raging surf-guitar sound in Orange County 
ballrooms during the early '60s, emerged last year with a successful comeback 
album, "Tribal Thunder," and recently followed it with another raucous release, 
"Unknown Territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale has been pitching his music not toward old-line surf fans, but toward the 
young hard-rock audience -- witness the stamp of approval that MTV's "Beavis 
and Butthead" gave to the 57-year-old ax-wielder's "Nitro" video. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come Out and Play," the hot track that recently launched O.C. punk band the 
Offspring to national success, also is an MTV staple. One of its most 
insinuating hooks is a snaking, Arabian-flavored guitar riff rooted in 
surf-rock sources. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Billboard magazine did a long feature surveying the signs of 
rekindled international interest in surf music. It cited new activity by such 
'60s bands as the Chantays (the Orange County band, which scored in 1963 with a 
definitive surf hit, "Pipeline," recently issued a solid new album, "Next Set," 
on its own label), and the emergence of many younger surf bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Keane says the Billboard piece helped persuade him to put his Del-Fi surf 
archive back in circulation after about 25 years out of print. It gives surf 
music fans a chance to discover -- or rediscover -- two more worthy Orange 
County bands from the '60s: the Lively Ones and Dave Myers & the Surftones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lively Ones dominate the Del-Fi reissues with five albums of their own, 
and they appear on two compilation discs included in the series. Dave Myers and 
the Surftones are represented on an album of their own, "Hangin' Twenty!" and 
on the two compilations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Impacts, the Sentinels and Bruce Johnston's Surfing Band (led by the 
guitarist who would join the Beach Boys in 1965) are the other groups in the 
series with full albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Keane says the 12 surf albums he issued in 1963-64 sold a combined total of 
about 130,000 copies in their initial release. Now, he has hopes of selling at 
least triple that many on compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the market for everything is a thousandfold what it was in 1963," he 
said. "I think young people will buy it, and middle-aged people too, as a 
nostalgic thing. We've had a lot of reaction from college stations. They love 
it, and they're playing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with a morbid streak might see the Del-Fi hearse promotion as symbolic 
of the label's ill-starred history. 
</P>
<P>
 Keane's first major artist was Sam Cooke, whose early hits appeared in 1957-59 
on what was then called the Keen label. Cooke went on to even greater success 
with RCA but was shot to death in a Los Angeles motel in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Del-Fi's next big star in the making was Ritchie Valens, whose career had 
barely gotten off the ground when he plunged to his death in the famous 1959 
plane crash that also killed Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the Bobby Fuller Four, which recorded for Keane's Mustang Records 
imprint -- including the signature hit, "I Fought the Law" -- until its leader 
was found dead in 1966. Los Angeles police ruled Fuller's death a suicide, but 
Keane insists it was foul play. Keane says he is working to get a film about 
Fuller made, which will outline his theory of the rocker's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that happened, I was kind of burned out," said Keane, who had started 
out in music as a teen-aged clarinetist who fronted his own swing band. Keane 
folded his labels in 1970 and worked for a time with his sons Tom and John as 
they launched their own careers as performers and, later, songwriter-producers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keane, now in his late 60s, revived Del-Fi last year to issue new compilation 
albums by Ritchie Valens and the Bobby Fuller Four. He also has a stable of new 
acts, including the Latin rock acts Bambu and Latin Touch, and Banig, a 
16-year-old singer from the Philippines who Keane says has been likened to 
Whitney Houston and is dubbed "The Cinderella of Manila." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Keane's surf records didn't stir the chart action that releases 
by his doomed heroes did. The principal players of the Lively Ones and Dave 
Myers & the Surftones didn't gain the immortality of Cooke, Valens and Fuller. 
On the plus side, they have managed to make it to 50 without fulfilling their 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Masoner, lead guitarist of the Lively Ones, lives in Anaheim and is the 
owner of several apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he read about Dick Dale's comeback and last year received notice that 
reissued Lively One albums were circulating in Europe. Given those 
developments, Masoner said, "It wasn't a real shocker" that Del-Fi would 
reissue his band's catalogue in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said: "It's surprising that such a simple form of music 
(would return), after what rock 'n' roll has gone through. It's made a complete 
circle. It's a good music for young players to grasp onto, because it's 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Masoner and the Lively Ones' rhythm guitarist, Ed Chiaverini, have been 
approached by Ken Roland, a surf-music promoter who wants the band to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Masoner thinks he'll do it, although "I'm still wondering how much stress or 
trouble or time this is going to put on me, for what it's actually going to be 
worth. But people are taking an interest and it might mushroom into something." 
</P>
<P>
 Masoner, 50, played professionally until about six years ago, most recently in 
the North Fork Trio, an Orange County club band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stayed proficient on the guitar. Right now, I'm probably a much better 
player than I've ever been in my life," said the guitarist, who feels one of 
his accomplishments with the Lively Ones was to help popularize Fender's Jaguar 
guitar model. 
</P>
<P>
 Masoner still sits in occasionally with his old partner, Chiaverini, who 
continues to play on the local scene under the name Eddie Day. Chiaverini's 
current gig is a one-man-band act at the Saddleback Inn in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The two former Lively Ones both have some gripes about their financial 
dealings with Del-Fi: They say the Lively Ones never saw any royalties from 
their records. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say the least, people weren't happy," Masoner said. "But there's no sense 
holding a grudge after 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Keane said that when he initially put out Del-Fi's surf records, he paid the 
musicians a one-time flat fee for them, so he doesn't owe them any royalties.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Myers was a young folk guitarist playing the Orange County coffeehouse 
scene when he saw Dick Dale at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa sometime 
around 1960. "I liked what Dick was developing. I liked the power. It attracted 
me to this raw, new thing, and I wanted to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a marketing consultant, the Huntington Beach resident fondly remembers how 
fertile the surf-band scene was. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we got on Del-Fi, we were running our own dances," Myers 
recalled. "Anybody who could open a hall and get a band in there could draw 300 
people. American Legion halls, bingo parlors -- everybody went dancing. It was 
a great opportunity to play to a lot of people. It didn't take much to get jobs 
and stay busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers figures that surf music died a natural death brought on by inevitable 
musical evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '60s, everything was experimental," he said. "That's where the music 
was. Surf music was experimental music, and it carried a lot of themes that 
were important to youth at that time. When those themes changed, suddenly music 
switched again." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the two Lively Ones guitarists, Myers kept evolving through the late 
'60s, playing other rock styles in new bands that bore the stamp of the hippie 
era. After that, he rekindled his early love for bluegrass music and still goes 
to bluegrass festivals looking for impromptu parking-lot jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 50 years old, Myers says it would take "a lot of warm-up" to get back in 
the rock 'n' roll groove. But he might be open to playing the occasional surf 
gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers hasn't listened to his Del-Fi album in five years, and that was by 
force: He was running a fishing tackle company, and one of his employees fished 
up a copy of "Hangin' Twenty!" and played it over the office intercom system at 
lunch hour, as a birthday joke on the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did it so they could give me a hard time, but what the heck. It was my 
birthday, so I couldn't say much. You've gotta be a good guy on those days." 
</P>
<P>
 Masoner said that on Monday, for the first time in many years, he went through 
his Lively Ones albums and listened to his two favorites, "Surf Rider" and 
"Surf Drums." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the surf-rock revival, his reasons weren't nostalgic, but 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to stimulate my memory," he said, "in case I have to play some of 
those." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 JURASSIC SURF?: Speaking of Dick Dale, he'll play a free concert today at 6 
p.m. at the Virgin Megastore at Triangle Square, 1875 Newport Blvd., Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The always-effusive Dale is especially revved these days about the prospects 
for his new album, "Unknown Territory," and for a just-completed video for one 
of its tracks, "Terra Dicktyl." 
</P>
<P>
 "The director (Andrew Doucette) put these micro-mini cameras, as big as an 
eraser, on my fingers. It looks like a train going down a railroad track. My 
pick looks like it's coming out of the bowels of the guitar." Dale says these 
up-close glimpses of his fret-board action are combined with quick cuts to 
reptilian eyes and footage of a figure who goes airborne and then "comes back 
down again and goes down through this tunnel of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "It never stops; you get dizzy just watching it. It goes too fast for me. I 
like to get a good look at something. But they know better than I do." Dale 
said the final edit should be going to MTV any day now.

RATINGS 'AIN'T BROKE,' BOARD CHAIR SAYS; MOVIES: RICHARD MOSK, THE NEW HEAD OF 
THE MPAA BOARD, SAYS HE SEES FEW, IF ANY, PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filmmakers and distributors expecting to see radical changes in the way their 
movies are rated are in for a big disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mosk, the new chairman of the Motion Picture Assn. of America's 
Classification and Ratings Administration board, who last month replaced 
20-year veteran Richard Heffner, says he sees little, if anything, wrong with 
the system that's been used to designate film ratings in this country for the 
past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ain't broke, don't break it," quipped the 55-year-old civil litigation 
attorney in a recent interview at the Century City law offices of Sanders, 
Barnet, Goldman, Simons and Mosk, where he has been a partner since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can be improved, but I can't foresee any revolutionary changes," 
noted Mosk, whose button-down demeanor and conservative attire -- gray 
pin-stripe suit and starched white shirt -- clearly don't suggest someone 
interested in bucking the status quo. "It's not my style. I'm not a 
rabble-rouser," assures Mosk, son of California Supreme Court Justice Stanley 
Mosk. 
</P>
<P>
 This spells bad news for those hoping a change in the board's administration 
could signal a potential overhauling of a ratings system that for years has 
come under fire by various filmmakers and independent production and 
distribution companies who view it as rigid, outdated and a license to censor 
creative works. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent commentary that appeared in The Times ("MPAA's Big Chance to 
Change," Calendar, July 18), American Civil Liberties Union executive director 
Ramona Ripston and public affairs director Allan Parachini (a former Times 
reporter) suggested that a Heffner-to-Mosk transition "affords an opportunity 
for the industry and the MPAA to partly mitigate the chilling influence of the 
ratings systems on artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU charged that the board "refuses to identify its members, screens 
films in secret and declines to give filmmakers specific reasons why their work 
has received, for example, an NC-17 instead of an R," and challenged the MPAA 
and the ratings board to resolve the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk takes issue with the ACLU's complaints. He argues that senior raters "do 
identify themselves" to studios or producers in discussing a rating. In many 
cases, Mosk said, Joan Graves, who was just promoted to vice chairman of the 
board, acts as the point person. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Fineman, head of post-production at New Line Pictures, concurs that he 
often talks directly to Graves and sometimes one of the other board members, 
though he said he doesn't know them all by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax Films' vice president of marketing David Dinerstein says he too speaks 
to Graves on day-to-day matters, but besides her, "We never talk to the board 
or know who they are other than when a film of ours goes up for appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Heffner, Mosk plans to be a direct conduit. "Anyone is free to talk to 
me," says Mosk, who unlike his New York-based predecessor lives in Los Angeles, 
dividing his time between his law practice and ratings job. 
</P>
<P>
 He supports the MPAA's longstanding position that it would be detrimental to 
publicly identify all board members. "We don't want people trying to affect 
them in some way, so it enhances the integrity of the system to keep them 
anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
 Fineman said in the mid-'70s, when he was working for veteran horror movie 
producer Roger Corman, "We used to actually sit in the screenings with the 
raters and had a kind of negotiation with them."  
</P>
<P>
 That's no longer the case. Films are submitted by producers to the ratings 
board, which is based in Burbank and is made up of eight to 11 paid members, 
all of whom are parents. Their job is to provide guidelines to other parents 
about a movie's suitability for children. Every film submitted is viewed by the 
board, then voted on following a group discussion about what most average 
American parents would consider to be its proper rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes distributors and producers will complain about a rating, but these 
are views of what a typical parent would think -- it's a representative 
sampling," Mosk explains. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ratings chief also objects to the ACLU's charge that filmmakers are 
not given specific reasons for a rating. "The idea that they are not told why 
is just untrue . . . they are told specifics to a particular scene." 
</P>
<P>
 But several Hollywood executives complain that the MPAA tends to be more vague 
than specific. "They prefer to give you general guidelines and let you 
interpret what they mean," one studio executive says. Another top studio 
executive adds, "Unless it's a rules violation (you can't say the F-word more 
than once and get a PG-13), they'll usually be vague." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinerstein and his Miramax boss, co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, whose company 
has had a contentious relationship with the MPAA over ongoing ratings battles, 
say they find the board's lack of specificity extremely frustrating. "They 
indicate to us, but they don't zero in on an area," says Weinstein, who is 
currently fighting the board over back-to-back NC-17 ratings that were slapped 
on Miramax's upcoming releases "The Advocate" and "Clerks." NC-17 bars 
admission of anyone under 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "The Advocate," a courtroom thriller based on fact and set in 
the 15th Century, Dinerstein said, "They wouldn't tell me exactly what was 
wrong, only that it had to do with a sexual encounter" between the film's 
co-stars Colin Firth and Sophie Dix. The scene does involve nudity, admits 
Weinstein, who says he was more perplexed over the MPAA's problem with 
"Clerks," a low-budget movie about two New Jersey convenience store cashiers. 
The film won prizes at this year's Cannes and Sundance film festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were led to guess what they didn't like, but they wouldn't give us 
specifics other than it was about a hilarious off-screen sex scene," said 
Weinstein, whose company is appealing both films' ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk, who at this early stage said he is more "an observer than a participant" 
in the ratings process, did have a phone conversation with Dinerstein about 
"The Advocate" in which the Miramax executive said Mosk told him he would watch 
the film again and get back to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not editors," Mosk says. "We will point to specific scenes when 
possible, but if something (like violence or sex) is pervasive, sometimes it 
can't be identified so an impressionistic view is given." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's chairman also points out that "there isn't a rating until the 
party accepts it," and that distributors have three choices when a rating is 
issued: They can accept it, appeal it, or re-edit their work and resubmit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk's job also entails representing the appeals board on any ratings debate, 
a task he says he is well prepared for. "I've been a litigator all my life," 
notes Mosk, who was a member of the Warren Commission that investigated the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy and a member of the Christopher 
Commission that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney 
G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 If a company is not an MPAA member (all major Hollywood studios are), it also 
has the choice of releasing a film unrated, but that can be problematic when it 
comes to getting adequate theater bookings, advertising and reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk, who says, "I do not set policy," insists that if any changes to the 
existing rating system were to be implemented they would not come from him but 
from a joint committee of the MPAA and the National Assn. of Theatre Owners. 
"Generally speaking, the board votes and gives a film a rating. As chairman, 
I'm there to deal with problems as they arise." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mosk may have more influence over the board than he's willing to admit. He 
says he can vote if he chooses, and, "hopefully, they will listen to my 
opinion." MPAA president Jack Valenti -- who instituted the "voluntary movie 
rating system" as a replacement for the outmoded Hays Production Code in 1968 
-- takes no part in rating decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Valenti, Mosk defends the system as far more desirable than 
government-controlled censor boards around the world or the alternative of 
contending with hundreds of local boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU rejects that argument as "unsubstantiated, self-serving and a weak 
attempt to justify arbitrary MPAA censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk, who has been screening at least one film a day, says so far he is 
"pleasantly surprised at how well (the system) runs."  
</P>
<P>
 On a personal note, he said he and his wife always relied on movie ratings to 
determine what was appropriate for their children to see when they were young 
(they're now 24 and 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk -- a native Angeleno who grew up in a middle-class family in Westwood and 
frequented the Village and Bruin theaters -- said, "I even use it to look at 
ratings for myself."

A CONTINENTAL SEARCH FOR NEW SOUNDS; POP MUSIC: RECORD EXECUTIVE CHRIS 
BLACKWELL IS HOPING TO DO FOR AFRICAN MUSIC WHAT HE DID FOR REGGAE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Blackwell, the record executive whose championing of Bob Marley in the 
'70s helped bring reggae music to international prominence, is accustomed to 
taking the long view in developing pop artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a line of major rock performers stretching from Traffic to U2 to PJ 
Harvey, Blackwell's Island Records was the home for Marley and the first wave 
of Jamaican artists 20 years ago when reggae was virtually unknown outside the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's attempting to start the same process with African music, bankrolling 
"Africa Fete," a 13-city U.S. concert tour that arrives at the House of Blues 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell, who is in his mid-50s, is aware that the obstacles confronting 
African music here will take time to overcome. Among them: a lack of commercial 
radio or MTV exposure, and the fact that the artists sing in African languages 
or Creole French. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggae also was pretty much a foreign language when it first came on the 
scene, but the difference was that there was a large Jamaican population in 
England, where I started Island," says Blackwell, who proposed "Africa Fete" to 
PolyGram N.V., then Island's distributor, in 1992. "There is not that same base 
in African music. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to PolyGram with the idea, I said I didn't think it would start 
to make sense financially for five years. But in four or five years, I felt it 
would be almost like a franchise situation, in a way how Reggae Sunsplash (an 
annual concert tour) became bigger than any particular reggae act." 
</P>
<P>
 Following last year's debut, this second edition of "Africa Fete" is headlined 
by Kassav, the Paris-based group whose sophisticated zouk sound conquered the 
Caribbean in the '80s and exerted a strong influence on many African musicians 
in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Fete returnee Angelique Kidjo's dance-floor-friendly style is grounded in the 
music of her native Benin, while Ziskakan, a group from Isle Reunion off the 
east coast of Africa, makes its U.S. debut with an atmospheric sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Africa Fete's" small-scale, grass-roots approach contrasts with the other 
package tour featuring world music artists that hit the United States this 
summer. The WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) Festival, a full-day event 
headlined by Peter Gabriel that includes workshops and two stages presenting 
more than a dozen artists from around the world, played a series of East Coast 
dates last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But two West Coast shows, with Gabriel replaced by Primus on the bill, were 
canceled. Founded by Gabriel in 1980, WOMAD is firmly established as a festival 
event throughout Europe, but its large scale apparently still requires an 
artist with Gabriel's drawing power to be commercially viable in the United 
States (last year's show, with Gabriel, drew 20,000 fans to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell, who has met with Gabriel to explore ways of working together, 
intends to keep his focus on African music and avoid becoming dependent on an 
artist's drawing power with "Africa Fete." 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Gabriel can do it every year because he's Peter Gabriel and his name 
and his own performance will be able to pull people in and introduce them (to 
the music)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to look every year for another artist to head it and then 
everything hangs on who is the artist you find. My route is going to take 
longer but hopefully it will be more solid." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell borrowed the name "Africa Fete" from a weeklong celebration of 
African music and culture in Paris founded by Mamadou Konte in 1978. He hired 
Konte as a consultant, and cites the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage 
Festival as an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Africa Fete" isn't solely a vehicle for promoting Blackwell's own artists. 
Kassav, for instance, records for Sony Music's TriStar label. (The group's 
presence also fulfilled another Blackwell goal -- having a group from the 
Western Hemisphere on the bill.) 
</P>
<P>
 Island's releases of African artists through its Mango subsidiary began with 
King Sunny Ade's "Juju Music" album in 1982, but Blackwell only now feels the 
time is right for "Africa Fete." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we now had on Island and Mango four or five real world-beating 
artists," he explains. "There were also enough people on other labels now where 
one could put together an 'Africa Fete' and not perpetually have the same show 
going out every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell isn't expecting an immediate sales impact from "Africa Fete" -- in 
fact, he doesn't plan to measure the commercial success of African artists by 
the usual pop standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it like an act, starting small, and I'm hoping it will build up," 
Blackwell says. "My sense is that one would market African music much more the 
way you would aim to market jazz, because it's really on a musicianship basis. 
I'm not saying we're going to be selling millions of records of any individual 
artist, but I think we can reach the kind of market a very successful jazz 
artist can sell." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Africa Fete" plays Friday at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., 9 p.m. 
$22.50 . (213) 650-1451 .

THE MASTER OF SURVIVAL; ART: LIU HAISU, FATHER OF MODERN CHINESE ART, HAS FACED 
MANY ADVERSARIES -- FROM NATIONALISTS TO COMMUNISTS TO THE RED GUARDS OF THE 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION. AT 100, HE HAS OUTLIVED THEM ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SAVITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Scott Savitt is a Beijing-based 
journalist working on a book about contemporary Chinese civil society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever Liu Haisu felt glum about the prospects of continuing his life as an 
artist -- as he did when the prudish Nationalists jailed him in the 1920s for 
using nude models in his Shanghai art classes -- he consoled himself with the 
old Chinese maxim: 
</P>
<P>
 "All extremes become their opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Few countries have experienced more vicissitudes, cycles of purge and renewal, 
than has 20th-Century China. Few artists have suffered more abuse from so many 
different quarters than has Liu, who is widely recognized as the father of 
modern Chinese art. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing Nationalists said he was too radical. The Communists who turned 
them out in 1949 attacked him for failing to produce "workers" art. During the 
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that began in the mid-1960s, he was 
forced by the Red Guards to clean the toilets of the art institute he founded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Liu survived his enemies by outliving them. The extremes had 
become their opposites. Liu, who just turned 100, emerged triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
 Among events marking the artist's 100th birthday is the planned opening next 
month of a museum chronicling the still-working master's art, life and times. 
</P>
<P>
 China's Ministry of Culture has invested $20 million in the project, the 
inauguration of which awaits final inventorying and, where necessary, 
restoration of Liu's collection. "After all the adversity I've overcome, of 
course this is gratifying," said Liu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what's keeping him alive," adds his wife and former student, 80-year-old 
Xia Yiqiao. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in coastal Jiangsu province in 1894, Liu showed an early proclivity for 
traditional Chinese painting and as a teen-ager set out for Shanghai to 
continue his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were heady days for a young artist in China.  
</P>
<P>
 The last imperial dynasty had just fallen, and excitement at the prospect of 
building a modern new nation was pervasive. Young intellectuals maintained that 
it would not be enough to update China's industry. The very weight of the 
country's millennia-old civilization would hinder its advancement, they argued, 
and new approaches were needed to address deep-rooted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This gave rise to what became known as the New Culture Movement -- an effort 
to overhaul traditional Chinese society using the industrially developed West 
as a guide. To this end, the new republic dispatched its best young minds to 
Europe for study, and as a painter, Liu went to France. 
</P>
<P>
 The serene old artist became animated when recounting those days during a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paris in the '20s, what a magical time," he rhapsodized. "Pablo Picasso, 
Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, I knew them all well." In addition to the 
Modernists' pioneering style, Liu was deeply influenced and impressed by his 
European colleagues' intrepid approach to their art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Cezanne and Gauguin before them, these men were profoundly individual 
artists. They seemed heedless of risk in pursuit of realizing their personal 
vision. This, above all, was the lesson I gleaned from that time and those 
painters." 
</P>
<P>
 Liu returned home determined to infuse China's new generation of artists with 
this independent spirit. He established the nation's first modern art 
institute, the Shanghai Fine Arts Academy. The new school's curriculum 
emphasized drawing, sculpture and oil painting, and encouraged students to 
innovate and adopt an engage approach to both their art and life. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu's academy was not only China's first co-ed college, but also introduced 
the controversial use of nude models in life drawing classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this innovation met with conservative opposition. In one 
infamous episode, self-proclaimed defenders of China's heritage ransacked Liu's 
school and pressured the Nationalist government into briefly jailing the artist 
as a "traitor to tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Liu's progressive efforts encountered hostility not only from reactionary 
forces. Artists affiliated with the political left held that the Socialist 
Realism then ascendant in the Soviet Union was the only style appropriate to 
China's stage of social development. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of these opposing views clashed openly on the occasion of China's 
1930 First National Art Exhibition held in Shanghai. Communist apparatchik Xu 
Beihong asserted in a controversial article that the best thing about the 
exhibition was that "none of that brazen stuff by Cezanne, Matisse or Bonnard" 
had been included. He went on to proclaim that "it would be an outrageous waste 
of public funds and probably little better than importing a load of morphine or 
heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 Liu fervently refuted Xu's statements, declaring Cezanne the "uncrowned king" 
of 20th-Century art and accusing Xu of "echoing the pre-1895 Parisian 
marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the stage was set for a battle over political correctness in art, a 
conflict that is still very much alive in China today and one to which Liu 
lends moral weight as an advocate of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1931 Japanese invasion of China served to subordinate aesthetics to more 
immediate concerns. But on several occasions over the next decade and a half, 
particularly at a number of exhibitions held in the wartime capital of 
Chungking, the conflict over the utility of art reared its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the 1949 Communist rise to power, Chairman Mao Tse-tung's dictate 
that "art must serve political ends" was enshrined. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Liu suffered for his liberal views. He was not allowed to resume 
teaching, and during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) was forced to watch as 
Red Guards burned his invaluable collection of Chinese and Western paintings.  
</P>
<P>
 He watched patiently as he survived his political enemies one by one, until 
finally the 1976 death of Mao provided Liu with a new lease on art and life. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the overthrow of Mao's widow and her Gang of Four and the ascendance 
of Deng Xiao-ping as paramount leader, Liu was fully exonerated. He was 
reinstated as honorary headmaster of his old school and has been given free 
rein to work. Today, Liu says he has only one remaining ambition: "To have 
painted in three different centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 And as his wife ushered him away for a rest, the old artist imparted this 
hard-earned wisdom: "Humanity seeks truth, justice and beauty. Through 
history's vicissitudes, these things remain constant."

GOGGINS' 'NUNSENSE II': THE WORLD IS ITS CLOISTER; THEATER: TONIGHT AT THE 
MUCKENTHALER CULTURAL CENTER, THE SISTERS' ANTICS WILL LOOK FAMILIAR TO THOSE 
WHO SAW THE ORIGINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put a nun in a habit and what can you expect? A little devotion, some 
genuflection and praying, a look of spiritual joy? 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't stop there for the Little Sisters of Hoboken. Mix in a few randy 
jokes, a spicy dance or two and a passel of wiggy tunes and you've got the 
complete nun. At least to Dan Goggin's way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Goggin created "Nunsense," the modest comedy revue that won the New York 
Critics' Circle award for best off-Broadway musical in 1986 and has been 
revived countless times ever since, including several productions in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Goggin reflected on his tilted little cloister and was inspired by 
visions of a sequel. The result was 'Nunsense II, the Second Coming . . . " 
which opens tonight in an outdoor production at the Muckenthaler Cultural 
Center in Fullerton. The show, in its Orange County premiere, is presented by 
the Fullerton Civic Light Opera Company as the finale in its Theatre on the 
Green series. 
</P>
<P>
 The original "Nunsense" began with a very bad meal. Sister Julia's vichyssoise 
may have tasted fine, but 52 of the sisters subsequently died of botulism, 
leaving the remaining nuns with no way to bury them. The Reverend Mother 
decided to put on a song-and-dance extravaganza in a local high-school gym to 
raise the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the buoyant nuns stage another show as a thank-you to their 
generous audience. Bedevilment comes in the form of a rival order's claim to 
Mary Amnesia's Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes winnings. That part was 
explained in the first "Nunsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, as in the original, "Nunsense 2" has comic dialogue, silly tunes (the 
doo-wopping "What Would Elvis Do?" is typical) and a sprinkling of daffy 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who loved the first should love the second, said director Rob Barron. 
Anybody who didn't, probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yes, you'd have to have really enjoyed the original to enjoy this, they're 
very similar," said Barron. "If people come in thinking they're going to see 
deep theater, they'll be disappointed. This is a chortle, just nuns having 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron is familiar with "Nunsense," having staged the FCLO's praised 
production of the original last year. For the sequel, he brought back three of 
that show's five actresses: Mary-Pat Green as the Reverend Mother, Jennifer 
Bryce as Sister Robert Anne and Debbie Ebert as Sister Mary Hubert. Rita 
Baretta as Sister Mary Leo and Laura Soltis as Sister Mary Amnesia are 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have loved to have (the full cast) returning, but the other two 
(Tracy Williams as Sister Mary Amnesia and Kathleen Gillmore as Sister Mary 
Leo) were busy on other projects," said Barron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having three back has made for a smooth staging. I know their good points and 
their limitations. Also, they get to explore their characters a little deeper 
now because of the familiarity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity has bred contempt for some reviewers of "Nunsense II." A standard 
criticism has focused on how little Goggin has changed the basic plot, 
characters and songs. 
</P>
<P>
 This knock in the San Francisco Examiner last month was typical: " 'Nunsense 
II' probably wouldn't look so bland if it weren't such a slavish copy of the 
original. . . . This time, it looks a bit less habit-forming." 
</P>
<P>
 The show also has received praise, however guarded. A Chicago Tribune reviewer 
pointed out that " 'Nunsense II' is perhaps a better show, although that's a 
supremely relative concept. . . . (It) delights its audience, including, on 
opening night, a table of real nuns who clapped and whooped as enthusiastically 
as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the similarities, Barron said he and his set designers have tried to 
bring in some variations, especially to the production's look. Where "Nunsense" 
was set against a backdrop of a cheesy high-school staging of "Grease," the 
sequel takes place on the cheesy high-school set of "The Mikado." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we can't do the elaborate effects of 'Phantom,' but we've had some 
fun with this," he said. "This has more color (than the original). . . . We 
have fun with kimonos and other things as we've tried to enhance the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton Civic Light Opera's outdoor production of Dan Goggin's "Nunsense 
II, the Second Coming . . ." previews tonight and opens Friday at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. Performances

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; JACKSON PROTESTS 'WORDLESS' EJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel left fielder Bo Jackson protested his ejection Tuesday against the 
Seattle Mariners to the American League office Wednesday, hoping to avert a 
possible suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, ejected by plate umpire Al Clark, denied he said a word to Clark 
until his ejection. He then heaved a 25-pound bag of balls onto the field, 
along with a carton of sunflower seeds, and the crowd got into the action, 
tossing balls, money and toilet paper onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cursed myself," Jackson said. "I didn't say a thing to him. I just looked 
over at their dugout, looked into space, and said, 'Son of a . . . I never 
looked at the umpire. I just kicked dirt over the plate, and he threw me out. I 
commenced to lose my religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win in a situation like that. Officials (umpires) have gotten too 
big for the game. You can't question them. You can't look at them. You can't 
say anything. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a veteran of 18 years and considered one of the league's most respected 
umpires, filed a report and sent it to the league office. He informed Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann of the contents, but did not want to divulge details. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clark desired, he could fine Jackson $100 for every item thrown onto the 
field, which included 17 baseballs and about 40 packets of sunflower seeds. "I 
didn't bother to count them all," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the size of the crowds may not be that noticeable during this "Ceiling 
Tile Series," the crowd's behavior is. If it wasn't enough that a fan ran onto 
the field to grab a ball in play during the third inning, or a 3-year-old 
wandering on top of the dugout in the fifth inning, or a fan who bounced a 
beach ball off Mariner Manager Lou Piniella's head, there was their conduct 
toward the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't have your usual California Angels fans here," Clark said. "You 
usually don't hear rude, crude comments here. People were even rude going to 
our car." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann still is livid over pitcher Phil Leftwich's nonchalance in his 
attempt to pick up Felix Fermin's grounder, and ensuing throwing error, and has 
yet to decide whether he will even let him pitch in his scheduled start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the way he went after the ball," Lachemann said. "It was a very 
lackadaisical effort. I don't care if he throws the ball 100 feet into the 
stands, you go after it aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leftwich, who spoke with Lachemann: "He took me out because he was (teed 
off) at me, and if I had been manager, I would have done the same thing. There 
was no excuse." BOB NIGHTENGALE

MONTREAL OFFENSE TOO MUCH, SHUTS OUT SALSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa could not find the goal against the Montreal Impact, losing 2-0 in 
an American Professional Soccer League game Wednesday in front of 3,246 at 
Claude Robillard Stadium in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal's Lloyd Barker scored the first goal, which was unassisted, 22 
minutes into the game and the Impact's second goal came after its top scorer, 
Jean Harbor, kicked in the ball from the right corner at the 56-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Salsa had some scoring opportunities, it was Pat Harrington's 
work in goal that shut down the Salsa. The Salsa drops to 3-4 and Montreal is 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa has added a road game because the Houston Force had its APSL 
membership revoked by the league's Board of Directors. The Salsa will play 
Sept. 2 in Montreal.

DEFFENBAUGH SHOWS HE CAN SURF WITH BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surfing in his first world championship tour event, Huntington Beach's Jeff 
Deffenbaugh proved he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of three men to qualify for the U.S. Open of Surfing through the Op Pro, 
Deffenbaugh faced Australia's Shane Powell, the third-highest-rated surfer, and 
Fabio Gouveia, a national hero in Brazil, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of eight waves, Deffenbaugh, 21, defeated them both and 
advanced to the third round of competition. Powell and Gouveia move to the 
second round, which begins the one-on-one, single-elimination format today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got nothing to lose and all to gain here," Deffenbaugh said. "They're 
fighting for points and their spot in the world (ratings)." 
</P>
<P>
 A regular competitor on the world qualifying series, Deffenbaugh was in 13th 
place after the Op Pro. The year's top 16 finishers qualify for the world 
championship tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event may turn on the lights and motivate him to work hard enough in the 
next six months to earn a spot on the world tour," contest director Ian Cairns 
said. "It's an opportunity for Jeff to set himself up professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Curren, another wild-card entry, brought out a 5-foot-7 squash-tail board 
hoping to rekindle the excitement he caused in France last year when he won on 
a 1960s model. He finished third in the tightest heat of the day and will use a 
standard surfboard for the rest of the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Curren won four Op Pros and three world titles in the 1980s, he has 
not competed in the United States in three years. "I was a bit nervous," he 
said after his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in third position and with a case of nerves, fans still flocked for 
Curren's autograph and photographers set up to shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the morning before a crowd formed on the beach, Derek Ho and Sunny 
Garcia showed the Hawaiian touch for surfing barrels. Both won their heats and 
will surf again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a strong result right now," Ho said. Ho, the 1993 world champion, 
started the world tour 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 11 . . . It took me 10 or 12 years to combine 
everything I know," he said. "This year I have a ninth and two 17ths, so it's 
important I get a strong result right now heading into France." 
</P>
<P>
 After the U.S. Open, the world tour stops in Lacanau, Hossegor and Biarritz, 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 48 women entrants, only 16 remain. Eight women advanced Wednesday from the 
first round of the main event into the second, where they will face the top 
eight seeded surfers.

BULLFROGS TAKE 52 SHOTS BUT CAN'T BEAT BLADES; ROLLER HOCKEY: BLADE GOALTENDER 
MIKHAILOVSKY MAKES A STAND IN 8-5 VICTORY AT THE FORUM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Bullfrogs reached a new level of frustration in their 8-5 loss to the 
Blades before 4,981 at the Forum Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades (15-4) took an early five-goal lead and then goaltender Max 
Mikhailovsky held off the Bullfrogs by stopping 47 of 52 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Charron had a goal and three assists for the Blades (15-4), who 
strengthened their hold on first place in the Pacific Division of Roller Hockey 
International. The Bullfrogs (12-6-1) remain in second place, and Mikhailovsky 
has a lot to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just say Max keeps having great games, but 14 of his 18 games have 
been great," Blade Coach Bobby Hull Jr. said. "Let's face it, he's a great 
goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 One that has become particularly troublesome for the Bullfrogs. Mikhailovsky 
made 50 saves in the Blades' 7-4 victory over the Bullfrogs July 23 at The Pond 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to have nightmares about Max," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. 
"We took 50-something shots tonight and we still didn't shoot the puck enough. 
I thought we dominated the hockey game, but we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonier remained composed after the game although his team continues to 
struggle. The Bullfrogs have won only one of their last five games, and after a 
9-1 start, they are 3-5-1 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it will take for me to finally get mad," Sonier said. "But 
how many times can I say that we played well and still lost the game?" 
</P>
<P>
 The difference proved to be costly penalties taken by the Bullfrogs and sloppy 
puckhandling at the top of the slot, which led to numerous breakaway chances 
for the Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades scored on four of six power plays and Tony Gruba, Charron and Nick 
Vachon beat Bullfrog goalie Chris Gordon on breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take what the other team gives us," Hull said. "Look at the standings 
and you can see there is a new team at the top. Now we're the team to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Savo Mitrovic, Jim Brown and Victor Gervais each had a goal and an assist for 
the Bullfrogs. Gervais and Steve Beadle scored power-play goals to draw the 
Bullfrogs within 5-3 in the second quarter, but the Blades shut the door in the 
third quarter and pushed the lead to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog playoff tickets will go on sale Monday and Anaheim will play host to 
a first-round game Aug. 17 or Aug. 20. . . . The Bullfrogs traded Mike Butters 
to Montreal for a second-round draft pick and future considerations. Butters, 
who led the team in penalty minutes last season, was on the team's protected 
list. . . . The Bullfrogs finish the regular season with games at Phoenix 
(Friday), at Calgary (Aug. 12), and at Edmonton (Aug. 14).

CONTESTANTS GEAR UP FOR COUNTY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like a busy week for Marie Hagman of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old school cafeteria manager plans to bend her head over that 
bothersome sampler she began the day of the Northridge earthquake. She won't 
stop cross-stitching until she finishes it Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because if, after all that work on one little piece of linen, she fails to 
make the weekend entry deadline for this year's Ventura County Fair, her 
family's just going to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got busy watching those stupid O. J. hearings and I got off by one hole and 
now I've got to take off the whole border," she groused, pulling up the 
sampler's intricately cross-stitched border, one small green thread at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Canning and cooking, gluing and sewing, framing and prepping, residents all 
over Ventura County are readying their prized entries for one of Southern 
California's smallest and most old-fashioned county fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Ventura County Fair will begin in less than two weeks -- on Aug. 17 
-- and will run until Aug. 28. But the effort to organize and submit entries is 
already well under way, from Simi Valley to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 A ways up California 33, on a dusty ranch in a neighborhood called Foster 
Park, 10-year-old Ashley Allred and her sister Amy, 9, are feverishly turning 
apples into jelly. That's when they are not curdling milk into cheese, or 
meticulously positioning flowers in their 4-H club's floriculture exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 But their favorite entries are their dairy goats. "Goats have the personality 
of their owner," said Amy, petting the brown nose of her nanny, Mobile Missy. 
"My goat knows how to open the gate, and she likes to eat candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy explained that she, too, likes to eat candy and, like Mobile Missy, she is 
smart. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Amy and her sister feed and milk their goats, plus dozens of others 
belonging to their grandmother. In the afternoons, they'll run through training 
exercises with those they will show at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Goats are some of the most popular livestock for residents who live in 
semi-rural areas, such as those skirting the cities of Ventura County, said 
Rose Hayden-Smith, the 4-H youth development adviser for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Many contestants are not raising cattle and pigs anymore, she said, "because 
of zoning (regulations) and the cost of keeping them. Goats you can have in an 
area where you couldn't have a steer." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fair's large livestock competition is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult category -- which only accepts sheep and goats because hardly anyone 
submits other types of animals -- overflowed with entrants this year and 
officials had to turn away 125 would-be competitors. As a result, there will 
only be 1,010 breeding animals shown in the adult division, said Craig Fosdick, 
the fair's assistant superintendent of large livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 Children and teen-agers have entered 403 animals in the youth division, which 
includes livestock destined to be auctioned at the fair for slaughter, Fosdick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All the large livestock competitions have already passed their entry 
deadlines, but most other fair divisions are only beginning to log entries. 
Some, such as the baking competition, where each entry must be fresh, will 
accept items up to the contests' opening moments. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Fillmore resident Rose Zellmer, 35, plenty of time to ponder what 
goodies she'll submit for scrutiny this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to enter a ton of stuff but I have to think to myself, 'How many can I 
do in my schedule?' " said Zellmer, who is a professional seamstress and cake 
decorator, and the mother of four small children. "I like to cook, and I guess 
that's half the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellmer entered a batch of scones last year at her neighbor's urging and won 
first place. "That kind of shocked me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, she thinks that she'll go for a carrot cake recipe that brought her 
sister first place in a high school competition years ago, and a plate full of 
buttermilk brownies that "will melt in your mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a few organized folks are already finished with their entries and 
submitted them Tuesday, the first of two days that the east county fair 
satellite office was open at the sheriff's station. The office will also be 
open Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anderson girls -- Erica, 11, and Alyssa, 10, of Thousand Oaks -- submitted 
eight entries between them, including a mounted picture of their golden 
retriever, Tahoe, for the junior photography competition and thick school 
reports with glossy covers for one of various writing competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alyssa turned in her favorite poem, which she typed herself, one index finger 
at a time, and mounted on colored cardboard. It's called "Imagine the mammal 
that's bigger than a camel!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine being the only mammal that's bigger than a giant camel!" Alyssa wrote 
in the poem that won a school competition. "Imagine eating 200 pounds a day / 
Like barley, oats and real green hay!" 
</P>
<P>
 Alyssa and Erica's mother, Sharon, 42, said she insisted that her daughters do 
all the work on their projects themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that kids need to know that there are places out there that's fun for 
them," she said, "and where their work pays off." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Ventura County Fair runs from Aug. 17 to 28. The large livestock 
competitions are already closed but most contests are just beginning to accept 
entries. For information, call the Fairgrounds at 648-3376.

CAMARILLO MAN CITED IN SANTA BARBARA FIRE; DISASTER: TEACHER SUSPECTED HE WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKCOUNTRY BLAZE AND TURNED HIMSELF IN. HE MAY BE BILLED FOR 
THE COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Camarillo schoolteacher has been cited for accidentally igniting a four-day 
wildfire in remote Santa Barbara County backcountry with a cigarette he smoked 
while rabbit hunting, authorities said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hanger, who turned himself in to fire investigators on Monday, will 
also likely face a hefty bill for the cost of battling the 3,500-acre blaze 
that at one point threatened a condor sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was a bum or something I wouldn't have even gone in" to talk with fire 
officials, said Hanger, 50. "But I'm sick about this whole thing. I hear my 
name on the radio, and I feel horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Total firefighting costs are not yet known, but Santa Barbara County Fire 
Department officials said they expect the tally to top $1 million. A 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service placed the cost at more than $720,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, people who set fires are required to pay the cost of fighting 
them. But actual court-ordered fines usually cover only a small fraction of 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger, who teaches U.S. history and government at Thousand Oaks High School, 
said it dawned on him Sunday that he might have sparked the blaze as he watched 
news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost had a heart attack," said Hanger, a teacher for 27 years. "I just 
panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to find out if he was responsible, Hanger contacted Ventura County 
authorities, who put him in touch with Santa Barbara County Fire Department 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hanger took a fire inspector to Aliso Canyon -- where Hanger had 
hunted rabbits since childhood -- to retrace his steps before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of their walk, the pair paused where Hanger thinks his cigarette 
sparked a one-square-foot grass fire near his pickup truck just before leaving 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by the flames, Hanger said he stomped them out, covered the ashes 
with dirt, then doused the spot with five gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing the fire was extinguished, Hanger said he and his hunting companion 
drove home to Camarillo with their limit of five rabbits each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it out, and then I left," Hanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after visiting the area on Monday, the investigator concluded that the 
large range fire began with the small grass fire that started from Hanger's 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'This is where it started, Mr. Hanger. I'm going to have to issue 
you a citation,' " Hanger recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the embers may have smoldered in cow manure before being 
fanned by light winds and high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our weather has been typically in the high 90s and low 100s with humidity in 
the single digit," said Santa Barbara County Fire Capt. Andy Rosenberger. "Just 
a little bit of a breeze can pick up an ember and start a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger said he does not smoke, but purchased the pack of cigarettes to smoke 
with his companion on the trip, partly to keep the bugs away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally embarrassed about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 firefighters fought the blaze, assisted by six air tankers and 
several water-dropping helicopters. It was controlled by Tuesday night, but 
crews were still on the scene Wednesday, raking through ashes for embers still 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the flames were headed directly for the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary, 
but was halted about five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Terrill of the California Department of Forestry said about 80% of the 
state's wildfires are caused by accident or negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever caused the fire can be assessed the full costs of salaries, overtime 
pay, food and equipment use. And the sum can be prodigious: A single drop of 
fire retardant, for example, costs $800, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But typically, only a fraction of the amount billed by the state is collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state recovered about $1.3 million from individuals who 
accidentally started fires, compared to hundreds of millions spent fighting the 
fires, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a person is billed, Terrill said, it is up to the courts to decide how 
much and how long he or she will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger is scheduled to go to court Sept. 1. He probably will not be billed for 
several weeks. A judge will decide how much of the estimated $1 million Hanger 
will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I could pay that," the teacher said.

COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEES CHASTISE GRAND JURORS FOR CRITICAL REPORT; EDUCATION: 
OFFICIALS DEFEND FISCAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. A $1.25-MILLION SHORTFALL COULD 
MEAN CUTS IN CLASSES AND PART-TIME TEACHERS' LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as they learned of a new budget shortfall topping $1 million, Ventura 
County Community College District trustees defended their fiscal management 
practices and said last month's scathing grand jury report was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 In their formal response to the report -- which accused the district of 
mismanaging its resources and failing to anticipate state budget cuts -- 
trustees chastised the grand jurors for conducting a sloppy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The errors in the grand jury report are so glaring that the grand jury report 
is almost laughable," trustee Gregory P. Cole said during a Tuesday meeting. 
"It is unfortunate that the Ventura County grand jury has to be held in such 
low esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Cole and other officials said the grand jury report ignored the 
efforts the district has already made to bolster its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 While district officials defended their stewardship of the three-campus 
district, they learned they will have to cut another $1.25 million from a 
$61.6-million tentative budget that already was scavenged for savings in 
virtually every department. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Director Harry Culotta said the state recently opted not to fund three 
programs that would have provided the district $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He already has made up for $100,000 of the shortfall by estimating that 
lottery income will be higher than he originally forecast. But another $1.15 
million must be cut from the 1994-95 spending plan, he told trustees in a memo 
before Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury concluded that the district should better prepare for such 
fiscal curveballs from the state. But Cole said it already had. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the grand jury wants to be critical, they should be critical of the state 
Legislature," Cole said. "They're the ones making the mandates and then making 
cuts on top of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue shortfall means that dozens of classes are in danger of being 
canceled, and that sweeping layoffs of part-time teachers may be necessary, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see things cut that are farthest away from the classroom as 
possible, but I'm not sure we can do that," board President Allan W. Jacobs 
said. "We've pared the budget back considerably in all those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the three programs left unfunded by the state would have 
reimbursed the district $800,000 for fees waived for low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said he did not fault the grand jury's intent. But he said jurors 
failed to report that the district already had begun setting aside more money 
for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "just reinforced what we were already doing," he said. "We've 
already made it an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (the shortfall) is not good, but it's not something we didn't 
anticipate," Jacobs said. "We knew the way the government was putting the 
(state) budget together there might be a shortfall." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's adopted tentative budget of $61.6 million includes cash 
reserves of 3%, or about $2 million, down from more than $2.6 million -- just 
over 4% -- in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But trustees seem reluctant to again dip into reserves to make up the new 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want to see us start out the year with less than 3% reserves," 
Jacobs said. "I think we're going to have to make the cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg, however, said the district should look at 
reducing administrative costs before cutting classes or laying off teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want actual classroom cuts to be last on the list," Hirschberg said. "I'll 
renew my proposal to consolidate administrative responsibilities between 
Ventura and Oxnard colleges, and look at the district office and administrative 
spending as a whole to see what we can tighten there." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the grand jury, board members said they have made a conscious 
effort to safeguard the district from the vagaries of fluctuating state funding 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do expect them," Hirschberg said. "But it's just impossible to expect 
particular cuts in particular programs. Our tentative budget was just that. 
When we adopted it, we knew there would be changes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago they agreed to set a goal of increasing district reserves by .5% 
each year, up to a maximum of 5%, despite increasing state cutbacks and a 
decision to pay out almost $2 million due in early retirement benefits, the 
district's response to the grand jury states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This board made a commitment to get us off the (state) watch list," Jacobs 
said. "As a result of that, we've been increasing the reserve every year." 
</P>
<P>
 The state placed Ventura's community colleges on a list of districts to be 
watched two years ago, because of inadequate reserves to cover unexpected 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A vote on the final 1994-95 spending plan is scheduled at the board's Sept. 13 
meeting.

NURSING HOME CALLED AMONG WORST IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cited for offenses such as letting a patient's bedsores fester and serving 
food in dirty dishes, a Ventura nursing home has been named as one of 
California's 50 worst nursing homes for the second straight year, according to 
a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victoria Care Center, a stately pink-and-brown brick building on 
Everglades Avenue, had the 11th-worst record of deficiencies and complaints in 
1993 among all of California's 1,200 nursing homes, said the report by 
nonprofit California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the executive director of Victoria Care Center said patient care at the 
nursing home has improved dramatically under new management brought in last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And a local watchdog group confirmed that the elderly patients at Victoria 
Care Center are getting better treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see positive changes," said Susan Miller, program coordinator for Long-Term 
Care Services of Ventura County, which acts as an ombudsman for nursing home 
patients. "I think things have really come around. Things are improving." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had less complaints," agreed Lana Pimbley, the Ventura district 
administrator for the state Department of Health Services, which regulates 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's report, the San Francisco-based watchdog group lists the 50 
California nursing homes that had the highest number of patient complaints and 
citations and deficiency notices from state inspectors in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 188-bed Victoria Care Center was the only nursing home in Ventura County 
to make the list. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors last year issued four health-and-safety citations against the 
nursing home and fines of $18,000. Over the same period, the state sent the 
Victoria Care Center 90 notices of deficient care, more than four times the 
state average. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state health department received 49 complaints against 
Victoria Care -- the second-highest number for any California nursing home, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victoria Care Center also made the advocacy group's 1992 list of the worst 
nursing homes in the state. That list ranked nursing homes according to the 
amount of fines levied. Victoria Care, which was socked with $50,000 in 
penalties for four citations in 1992, had the 13th-worst record in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides having a high number of deficiencies and complaints in 1993, the 
Victoria Care Center was one of only 50 in the state last year to be cited for 
a violation that led to a patient's death, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, an 86-year-old woman died two weeks after she was admitted in 
June, 1993, from blood poisoning caused by infected bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors found that nursing-home aides neglected to turn the woman 
from one position to another. She was too frail to move on her own, and on one 
occasion was left in a wet bed for 1 1/2 hours, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facility failed to give adequate care to this frail, medically 
compromised resident," said the September, 1993, citation, which carried a 
$10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the state fined the nursing home $8,000 for not monitoring and 
maintaining residents' diets in accordance with physicians' orders, said Kim 
Kelley, a coordinator for the watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 That same week, Granada Hills-based Twin Oaks Life Care Inc., which owns 
Victoria Care Center, brought in a new management company to run the nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The management company -- Arizona-based Retirement Community Specialists -- 
hired a new executive director and nursing director, who within several months 
replaced about 80% of the 200 staff members at the facility, Executive Director 
Leny Sandbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new management, nursing home employees received better training and 
supervision, Sandbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say there was no care before," said the home's new nursing director, 
Sharon Mulkey. "Now we have the best care at Victoria Care." 
</P>
<P>
 One improvement, Sandbeck said, is that Victoria Care has established a formal 
grievance procedure to encourage patients and family members to voice their 
concerns directly to nursing home managers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, three months after Sandbeck took over, the state issued two more 
citations: one on Dec. 11, 1993, for letting a patient sustain a 27% loss in 
body weight over a three-month period, and the other on Dec. 15 for serving 
food in dirty dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sandbeck said both of these citations were less serious than those issued 
earlier in the year and did not carry penalties. "You can't correct everything 
at once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's report did not say how many of the 90 deficiency notices and 49 
complaints were lodged after new managers took over. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the state health department has issued no citations against 
the nursing home. But inspectors have received 20 patient complaints. Upon 
investigation, the state found instances of deficient care in five cases, 
records show. Ten of the complaints were dismissed as unsubstantiated. The 
remaining five are pending.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CHILDREN GET A TASTE OF OTHER 
CULTURES

<P>
 Eight-year-old Evan Huff helped make a batch of a tasty, sugary Mexican 
dessert called bunuelos Wednesday morning. Then he and about 80 classmates 
promptly devoured them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were good," the Moorpark boy reported. "I had two." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them puffed up while it was cooking, just like a pillow. It was about 
to explode," he added with a chortle. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan and the other children, all elementary school-aged, are finishing up a 
week of studying Mexican culture as part of the Summer Youth Cultural Program 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes meet every day for four weeks and are intended to immerse the 
children in the food, music, folklore and arts of different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer sessions are sponsored by the American Assn. of University Women 
and began in 1976. A weeklong session costs $45 per child. This year students 
studied Ireland, Japan and India as well as Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan said he started attending the summer sessions last year because his 
father wanted him to learn about New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we might go there on a vacation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's lessons, held at the Arts Council of the Conejo Valley building on 
Green Meadow Ave., included traditional bark painting -- though the bark was 
replaced with brown paper -- and role-playing a story about the conflicts faced 
by immigrant children. The children also concocted bunuelos and danced to 
Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Young, who teaches the drama classes, said she was trying in Wednesday's 
lesson to put students in the place of immigrant children, both in crossing the 
border and in adjusting to life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week the students made terra-cotta pots, patterned with designs 
of their choosing and, frequently, their own names. They also made bright paper 
flowers to go inside the pots. But Evan had a different plan for his creation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give it to my mother for a candy dish," he said. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DISTRICT TRUSTEES TURN DOWN TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a looming budget shortfall of $1.1 million, trustees of the Ventura 
County Community College District refused to pay for one of their members to 
attend a Dallas convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 3 to 2 late Tuesday to deny trustee Pete E. Tafoya's request 
to approve spending about $1,550 for him to attend a three-day meeting of the 
National Conference of Latino Community College Trustees later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an expense we cannot afford at this time," said Trustee Gregory P. Cole, 
who joined board colleagues Karen Boone and Timothy D. Hirschberg in denying 
Tafoya's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also ruled out paying for student Trustee Chi Young Choe to attend 
the Community College Presidential Summit in Sacramento later this month. That 
two-day trip would have cost the district $196. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board should set a tone at this point in terms of this kind of spending," 
Hirschberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board did approve Choe's request to travel to San Francisco next month 
to attend the California 1994 Student Trustee Orientation at a price tag of 
$350. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya, who under board policy should have submitted his application for the 
out-of-state travel expense 30 days prior to the meeting, said the Latino 
trustee organization was a fledgling coalition that deserved the district's 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does the Latino trustee reach the constituency . . . in a system that is 
not accommodating the Latino community?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members were told prior to Tuesday night's meeting that the state will 
no longer reimburse the district for three programs that cost more than $1.1 
million. JEFF McDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning today, Simi Valley veterans can ride for free to their medical 
appointments in Los Angeles in a new van. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-seat van was purchased after members of the Simi Valley chapter of 
Disabled American Veterans persuaded the city of Simi Valley and the National 
Disabled American Veterans Department to donate $18,000 to buy the van. 
</P>
<P>
 The free van service is available to veterans living in Simi Valley. The van 
will arrive at 8 a.m. each weekday at the Simi Valley Senior Citizens Center at 
3900 Avenida Simi, take passengers to the Veterans Medical Center in North 
Hills and then drive them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans interested in arranging for a ride should call the Senior Center at 
526-9237 at least three days in advance to reserve a space. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOUNCING BOULDER BLOCKS FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Letting a boulder go where none has gone before, a Fontana trucker lost 
control of his load in Simi Valley on Wednesday, dumping an 18-ton chunk of 
granite in the middle of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt when the massive rock, bound for a harbor project in Ventura, 
folded Jenaro Montes' flatbed semi trailer in half as it jounced over the hump 
of a freeway overpass on the freeway at about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wrecked rig -- with its enormous cargo still chained to the trailer -- 
blocked one westbound lane for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers finally shoved the huge rock onto the Tapo Canyon on-ramp 
with a skip-loader, clearing the freeway but blocking the entrance for more 
than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes, 53, said he had been watching the rock bounce in the rear-view mirror 
as the truck rode over overpasses, which are slightly higher than the rest of 
the freeway. The rock kept getting lower and lower as the truck entered Simi 
Valley, Montes said, and he finally started pulling his rig off the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The buckled rig left a deep gouge in the pavement that curves from the center 
lane to the right, where it ground to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "That rock was too heavy," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-ton boulder was one of hundreds that are being trucked from granite 
quarries in Riverside County to Ventura Harbor, said Richard Parsons, general 
manager of the Ventura Port District. 
</P>
<P>
 By next week, tractor-trailers will have hauled 33,000 tons of boulders 
weighing 12 to 22 tons apiece -- enough to fill 1,500 flatbeds -- to the 
harbor, he said. The boulders are being hoisted onto the breakwater and rock 
jetties at the harbor mouth to keep silt from building up there in the strong 
currents. The hauling should end next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is still under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIGN-UPS NEEDED FOR DEAF CHILDREN'S CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deaf children and their hearing brothers and sisters will have a chance to 
attend camp this summer if enough children sign up for the three-day event 
organized by a local advocacy group for the deaf together with the city of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far too few have registered, organizers said.As of Tuesday, only one 
child had signed up for the camp, which will be held Aug. 16 through 18 at the 
Rancho del Rey Center in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers at the Tri-Counties Greater Los Angeles Area Assn. for the Deaf 
said they will cancel the camp unless at least five more children register by 
the Thursday afternoon deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is sponsoring the camp with the city of Ventura's Community 
Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is open to all children ages 8 to 16 who are either deaf or who 
have a deaf parent or sibling. Adults at the camp will know sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, which will cost $30 for deaf children and $20 for hearing siblings, 
will offer nature hikes, crafts and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp for children ages 8 to 12 will run from 8 to 11:30 a.m., while the 
session for youths ages 13 to 16 will be held from 1 to 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Free bus transportation will be provided, with the buses leaving from Ventura 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 To register for the camp or for more information, call the Tri-Counties 
Greater Los Angeles Area Assn. for the Deaf in Ventura at 648-4523. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGES TO STUDY LOW TRANSFER RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a transfer rate that lags behind both state and national averages, 
Ventura County Community College District officials have agreed to inventory 
their class schedules to maximize course offerings to university-bound 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin agreed Tuesday night to prepare a report for board 
members after Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg scolded his colleagues for 
previously disregarding what he said is a sub-par number of students moving on 
to four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschberg complained Tuesday that the district lags behind other community 
colleges in the number of students who eventually transfer to UC or Cal State 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being below the state average is abysmal and I think it's something we need 
to look at," he told his board colleagues. "I want our college district to put 
some thought into why we continue to lag." 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for the Study of Community Colleges concluded in a report released 
earlier this year that the three local colleges transfer fewer than three in 20 
students to a UC or Cal State campus in a typical each year, or just over 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide figure is 19% and the national average is 22%, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members, however, said the study was inconclusive because it does 
not adequately define a transfer student, and it fails to account for transfers 
to private colleges or students enrolled in vocational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a flawed study," Trustee Gregory P. Cole said. "To be able to say 19% or 
14% (of students transfer) on flawed data is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Lakin said he would present his report to the board next month.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS WILL EXHIBIT PHOTOS FROM CUBA TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ventura College photography students who recently returned from a 
trip to Cuba brought back images of the island's vibrant people that will soon 
become the focus of an upcoming show at the college gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten students and Ventura photographers visited the Communist-ruled island in 
June with a contingent of architectural history students from Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura College group, led by instructor Bill Hendricks, was only supposed 
to help the Virginia Tech students document the island's historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But they came away with an idea for a project of their own: the Cubans 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people were incredible," said M. Hughes Cary, one of the photography 
students who made the trip. "They are well-educated but have no place to use 
their education. Their economy is grinding to a halt, and their transportation 
is very primitive. But they cope with this with a lot of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, titled "Cuba: Politics Aside," will open in Ventura College on Sept. 
6 and showcase the work of the amateur photographers throughout the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the photos were shot in Havana, where the group spent most of their 
time, but some depict scenes from the rural Cienfuegos Province. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a walking picture book," Ventura photographer Jennifer Selby said of 
the island. "Every different place had great things to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Cary said the conditions under which Cubans live -- chronic shortages of food 
and clothing, and a lack of common amenities like toilet seats -- was difficult 
to witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman I met, she had three (bread) rolls in her right hand," he said. 
"And that was her ration for the day." 
</P>
<P>
 But the hope and optimism exhibited by the people made the most lasting 
impression on the visitors, who were allowed on the island with special 
research visas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to have very little," Selby said, "but they treated us like they 
had a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 A special reception for the exhibit will take place Sept. 6 at 7 p.m. For 
information, call Bill Hendricks at 654-6476 MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CURBS CONSIDERED ON ADULT MAGAZINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo may soon have a regulation that requires vendors of adult magazines 
to place barriers over the publications so that only their titles can be read 
if the City Council approves a zoning change now being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to direct the staff to 
study the issue and prepare an amendment to the city's ordinance that would 
require business owners to place "blinders" on the racks where the publications 
are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the so-called blinder law would follow a similar ordinance in Simi 
Valley that went into effect in 1988. Although some vendors have challenged the 
law, the city has won every attempt to overturn the regulation, Simi Valley 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo currently has regulations that govern adult-oriented businesses, but 
there are no regulations that deal with the sale of adult-oriented publications 
in news racks or in stores that are not primarily adult businesses, said Tony 
Boden, the city's director of planning and community development. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is expected to bring the proposed zoning amendment back to the 
commission sometime this fall. If the commission approves the ordinance change, 
the City Council would have the final vote. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; WRIGHT TO END LONG TENURE ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 24 years as a Port Hueneme City Council member, Dorill B. Wright 
announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to have served the community as I have, but I feel it is time for 
me to step down," Wright said. "I feel we have well-qualified candidates who 
are capable and willing to improve the quality of life in Port Hueneme and to 
serve the city's citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who also serves as representative of local government on the 
California Coastal Commission, will lose that seat 60 days after he leaves the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 73, began his career with the city in 1966 as a planning commissioner. 
He ran for City Council in 1970 and has held his seat since, serving as mayor 
from 1972 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 During his early years on the council, Wright worked to improve the city's 
pier, build new parks such as the Bubbling Springs Park and the Hueneme Beach 
Park. In 1987, the city named its $2-million cultural center after him.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Wright has faced challenges by residents who oppose the 
construction of a recreational vehicle park at Hueneme Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many residents have criticized the city's decision to build the 
Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center, which was closed last year because of a lack 
of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright cited the development of the parks among his biggest accomplishments, 
and said he is proud of his efforts to establish better business relations with 
the Oxnard Harbor District. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired engineer said he plans to write a book about his work as a public 
official and travel with his wife of 52 years, Jacquelyn.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be somewhat strange not to go to the City Council meetings," Wright 
said. "But I will continue to be involved in the community." CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN ALLEGEDLY FIRED SHOT AT SAMARITAN

<P>
 A 23-year-old Oxnard man was scheduled to be arraigned today on charges that 
he tried to shoot a good Samaritan during a botched robbery attempt outside 
Trader Joe's grocery store in Ventura Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Manuel Andino was taken into custody at his home in the 3300 block of 
South A Street about 12:10 a.m. Tuesday after police traced the license plate 
of the car he was driving to his mother.Witnesses wrote down the number of the 
1983 sedan as Andino fled the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Andino pointed a gun at an unidentified woman customer outside Trader Joe's at 
about 8 p.m. Monday, demanding her purse, police said. But she ran away 
screaming, and a bystander, 32-year-old Jerr Addonis of Ventura, confronted the 
would-be robber. 
</P>
<P>
 Andino demanded money from Addonis, who told the man he had no cash. Andino 
then fired his gun, missing Addonis and smashing a nearby window, police said. 
Andino then fled the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted armed robbery 
and assault with a deadly weapon, Burt said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

D.A. PROPOSES THAT 3 JURIES HEAR WESTLAKE BRAWL CASE; COURT: ARRAIGNMENT OF 
THIRD SUSPECT IN MELEE AT NORTH RANCH PARK IS DELAYED; A FOURTH YOUTH HAS 
DISAPPEARED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS OPPOSE PROSECUTOR'S SUGGESTION.

 Two of the three defendants accused in a brawl that left a pair of Westlake 
High School students shot pleaded not guilty Wednesday, as lawyers debated the 
best way to handle what promises to be a complex trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendant John Yi, 17, was granted a two-week delay of his arraignment because 
his lawyer did not attend Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi, a Taiwanese-American who lives in Thousand Oaks, told Acting Superior 
Court Judge Bruce A. Clark that he needed the extra time so his father could 
return to their homeland and collect money for Yi's legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with four felony counts stemming from the brawl, Yi refused Clark's 
offer of a court-appointed lawyer. He is free on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the objections of defense lawyers, Clark ordered bail to remain at 
$50,000 for each of the two defendants entering not-guilty pleas Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet, 16, of Brea in Orange County, is charged with 
two counts of assault with a firearm. William Huang, 17, of Rowland Heights in 
Los Angeles County, is charged with two counts of aiding and abetting a 
shooting and one count of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suspect -- James Lee, 16, whom authorities say helped start the brawl 
-- is a fugitive. Lee is believed to have fled to his native Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee began after Westlake High football player Curtis Simmons and Lee 
agreed to meet at North Ranch Park for a fistfight Feb. 3, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's supporters, including the three defendants in court Wednesday, emerged 
from their vehicles and announced: "We're the Asian Mafia." They then attacked 
Simmons and his friends with bats, sticks and gunfire, according to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual request, Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli told the judge 
that three juries, all seated in the same courtroom, might be needed to hear 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the triple jury is allowed, the case will require a separate trial for 
each defendant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While dual-jury trials are not unusual in larger jurisdictions, Ventura County 
has never had more than a single jury hear any one case, said Elizabeth A. 
Kane, a court spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys oppose Vanarelli's request, on which the judge is expected 
to rule on Sept. 2, one week before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it would be a circus," said Deputy Public Defender Donna L. 
Forry. She noted that a dual-jury system was used during the high-profile 
murder trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether he is getting the idea from, the Menendez case or what," 
Forry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really weird," commented Huang's attorney, John E. Meyers. "It's off the 
wall. I've done trials with two (juries), and it's crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vanarelli, during an interview, defended his suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli said using three juries in a single trial would allow the court to 
try each defendant simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 A single jury cannot hear the case because each defendant gave police a 
lengthy statement after being arrested, he said. Under state law, an unsworn 
statement by one defendant cannot be used to implicate a co-defendant, although 
court testimony can be. 
</P>
<P>
 So by having three separate juries, prosecutors could simply ask the panel of 
the defendant being implicated to leave the courtroom until after the damaging 
tape is played, Vanarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys said prosecutors should get permission from the judge to 
erase the tainted statements from the tapes, which is allowed under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli said that is not feasible because the tapes are too voluminous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statements they gave are very complete, and we'd rather not run the risk 
of trying to chop them up," the prosecutor said.

SKATEBOARDER KILLED WHEN HE CRASHES ON STEEP SIMI VALLEY STREET; DEATH: MAN 
REPORTEDLY HAD BEEN DRINKING. SHOCKED FRIENDS SAY AVID ATHLETE 'ALWAYS WAS IN 
TOTAL CONTROL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An avid Simi Valley skateboarder has died of skull fractures after he sped 
down a steep rural street, lost control of his board and landed on his head, 
the Ventura County coroner's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Dulcich, 23, apparently had been drinking before he crashed, but 
blood test results are several weeks away, said coroner's investigator Craig 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 A passer-by found Dulcich face-down on Flanagan Drive in the city's Indian 
Hills subdivision just after midnight on Tuesday morning and called 
authorities, Stevens said. About 12 hours later, Dulcich died of head injuries 
in the intensive care unit of Simi Valley Hospital, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His skateboard was found 66 feet down the hill past him," he said. "It 
appears he may have been under the influence of alcohol. . . . Police officers 
and ambulance personnel noticed the odor of alcohol on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Close friends said Dulcich was a talented, hard-core surfer and skateboarder 
who was never reckless, always in control -- and that the long, smooth run down 
Flanagan Drive was one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Dulcich had drunk a few beers with them late Monday, but speculated 
that a rock in the road or a car probably was what caused him to lose control. 
Police said there was no indication that Dulcich was struck by a car, but 
friends said an oncoming car may have forced him to stop slaloming and take a 
faster, more dangerous course straight down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it had anything to do with alcohol," said Derek Bauerle, a 
close friend who said he had known Dulcich since they were both 4 years old. "I 
can tell you now he's skated that hill a lot drunker. . . . He was the best on 
a skateboard out of any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dulcich was between jobs, having worked in restaurants, construction and 
maintenance, friends said. But he lived to surf and skateboard, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could skate better than he could walk," said Dave Katler, another close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Katler said he and Dulcich left the Tree House Sports Bar and Grill before 
midnight and spent at least two hours hiking around caves in eastern Simi 
Valley before he drove Dulcich to the top of one of Indian Hills' winding 
streets and dropped him off for the long ride to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Nick, do you want me to follow you home?' " Katler recalled. "He 
said, 'No, I'm going to take it slow,' " because it was only a short distance 
from the bottom of the hill to his house, Katler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what Nick wanted to do, he wanted to skate that hill," said Katler. 
"I've dropped him there 100 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan Drive descends from the hills at a 10% grade at its steepest, 
dropping 1 foot for every 10 it moves forward, said Bill Golubics, Simi Valley 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 At that angle, the street is steeper than the Ventura Freeway's 7% slope at 
the Conejo Grade, but Dulcich's friends said he had never had trouble skating 
it before. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's, like, an excellent skateboarder, without a doubt," said Josh Dodson, 
another friend and classmate. "Nick always was in total control, and that's why 
this was a little weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said he and his friends had all skated down Flanagan Drive at one time 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crashed pretty hard there one time and dislocated my shoulder," he said. 
"Nick had never even skinned a knee skateboarding. He was usually just so 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said Dulcich "would never do anything stupid. He was always in control 
of his life. That's why I don't understand this. He was never reckless or 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since June of last year, at least four skateboarders have died on U. S. 
streets, all of them hit by cars. In March, 1993, two Southern California 
children were killed in different accidents when they skated into the paths of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although skateboard fatalities are rare, 34,938 skateboarders were injured in 
1993, according to the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulcich's family is greatly upset over the accident, said his brother, Matt. 
"It's been a real tragedy for all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that in lieu of flowers, friends may send donations to 
the Surfrider Foundation, 122 S. El Camino Real, Room 67, San Clemente, CA 
92672.

THEATER PANEL TO INCLUDE DONORS; THOUSAND OAKS: THE COMMISSION RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SCHEDULING CIVIC ARTS PLAZA EVENTS WILL BE EXPANDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The panel responsible for scheduling shows at Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza 
will soon expand to include private donors as well as political appointees, but 
the City Council will retain ultimate control over the theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of behind-the-scenes debate, key fund raisers and arts patrons on 
Tuesday persuaded the council to adopt a compromise plan for restructuring the 
existing theater commission into a nonprofit Board of Governors. They argued 
that donors -- who have already pledged $5 million toward a Civic Arts Plaza 
endowment fund -- should be able to vote on programming and scheduling issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But they agreed that the council should retain control over the complex's 
budget, personnel and physical plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were concerns about elitism, concerns that we had a bunch of rich 
people running the show," former mayor Bob Lewis told the council. "That is 
absolutely not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting it even more bluntly, theater commissioner Larry Janss said: "The 
donors are not out for a power grab." 
</P>
<P>
 As a public-private coalition, with a majority of city appointees, the Board 
of Governors will be required to post agendas, hold open meetings and invite 
citizen comment, City Atty. Mark Sellers said. Each member, including donors, 
will be required to file financial-disclosure forms listing potential conflicts 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reassured that the new Board of Governors would remain open to public 
scrutiny, several council members who initially expressed skepticism decided to 
back the restructuring proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about to experience a new era in this city," Mayor Alex Fiore said 
after a 45-minute debate among the often-divided council members. "It's a 
probable 5-0 vote on a controversial matter." 
</P>
<P>
 After the unanimous vote, Councilwoman Elois Zeanah urged Alliance for the 
Arts fund raisers to make the most of their victory by dangling Board of 
Governors seats before potential donors to reel in more contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we will hear that the endowment grows, in substantial leaps, by 
tomorrow morning," Zeanah said to a few groans from weary fund raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Governors will assemble this fall with the following membership 
categories filling staggered four-year terms: 
</P>
<P>
 Seven members appointed by the City Council, including one representative from 
the educational community and one young adult between the ages of 16 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * One representative from the council-appointed Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five donors who have pledged at least $5,000 apiece to the endowment fund. 
The Alliance for the Arts fund-raising board will nominate the five donors, and 
the council will confirm the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 * One representative from the Alliance for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 * One member of the independent Arts Council of the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Once installed, the governors will raise money to help meet ongoing 
operational costs -- the day-to-day expenses of running a theater. The group 
will also secure funds to support programming, especially to subsidize 
nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with fund raising, the governors will advise the theater's executive 
director on programming priorities and dream up special projects such as 
children's festivals. And they may come up with new schemes for financing shows 
instead of running the 1,800-seat auditorium strictly as a rental facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we will not put the city at risk financially," Alliance 
fund-raiser Stephen Woodworth said, adding that an expanded Board of Governors 
might have more time or inclination to explore alternative financing plans than 
a group narrowly tied to the City Council.

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; BOISCLAIR TRYING ON 16S FOR SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 More than a few 14-year-old girls will sigh in relief this weekend. Erin 
Boisclair of Agoura Hills, one of the most dominant age-group players in the 
country, will skip a national junior tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Boisclair, who turned 14 in January, will pick on somebody her own 
size -- which means a bunch of 16-year-olds will cringe in San Diego, site of 
the USTA Girls' 16 National Championships that starts this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair is ranked No. 1 in the nation at 16-and-under and is top-seeded in 
the tournament. She's 5-feet-8, strong enough to use a one-hand backhand and 
has learned how to serve and volley. She also said she is mentally sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am prepared," she said. "I'm ready as I'm ever going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair has not lost a match in the United States this year, and her singles 
championship in the Easter Bowl in April in Miami stands out as the biggest in 
her junior career. She scored a resounding 6-2, 6-0 decision over Aubrie 
Rippener of Chico, Calif., who is seeded No. 2 in the USTA National. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament opens Sunday at Morley Field in San Diego. Other area entries 
are Jessica Kessler of Studio City, Kirsten Gross of Calabasas and Brandi 
Braverman of Encino. But the player to watch is Boisclair. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's worked real hard this year and the results are showing," said Linda 
Howell, Boisclair's coach. "Is she peaking? Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to this year, Boisclair won only one major juniors tournament (the 
Southern California Girls' 14 Sectional in 1993), but the USTA Junior 
Development program saw enough potential in Boisclair to send her to Europe 
this summer along with its other top age-group players in International Tennis 
Federation competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In three girls' 18-and-under events and three 16-and-under events, she did not 
advance past the semifinals. Her best showings were a third-round loss to 
top-seeded Dally Rondriantefy of Madagascar, 6-1, 6-1, in 18s at Prado, Italy, 
and a semifinal loss defeat to top-seeded Jessica Stech of South Africa, 6-3, 
6-2, in 16s at Torino, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair said every phase of her game -- her serve, net play, ground strokes 
and mental approach -- is a level higher this year. Which might explain how she 
jumped from No. 5 in the country in 14s at the end of 1993 to her No. 1 ranking 
in 16s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the USTA Girls' 14 National Championships last year, Boisclair lost to 
third-seeded Kristina Triska of Boca Raton, Fla. in straight sets. But 
Boisclair overpowered Triska, 6-4, 6-1, this year in the semifinals of the 
Easter Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really mentally tough that whole tournament," Boisclair said. "My game 
was just really on. Every match I was prepared. And so I'm looking forward to 
nationals." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The answer woman: Khim Stithem cringes every time she sees them coming. Lost 
fans at the this week's Los Angeles Open at UCLA see the walkie-talkie in her 
hand and ask her for directions to the nearest drinking fountain, to the 
restrooms, to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year someone asks me who's in the finals," Stithem said. "It's amazing. 
They pay $36 for a ticket on the day of the finals and they don't even know 
who's playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Little do they realize that Stithem has greater concerns. The Burbank resident 
and recreational player is second in command to tournament director Bobby 
Kramer, which means she'll likely know the answer to even the most ridiculous 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Stithem oversees every phase of the operation: ticket sales, promotions, 
staffing, construction, seedings, you name it. It's a year-round job. At 
tournament time, Stithem is in charge of a 600-person crew, about 300 of whom 
are volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so stimulating to see what you work all year for come together," she 
said. "We're quite a team. There's a certain amount of excitement and pride at 
what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Stithem shows up for work next Monday, it'll feel like the day she 
graduated from college. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're relieved and you feel this overwhelming sense of accomplishment," she 
said. "But at the same time you're sad it's over. It's a loss." 
</P>
<P>

 Miscellaneous: Jessica Improta of Camarillo and Shera Wiegler of Calabasas, 
competing for Southern California, have 2-1 singles records thus far in the 
USTA Girls' 16 Zone Team Championships at Salt Lake City. Wiegler defeated 
Keawe Ayau of Hawaii, 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, Wednesday, and Improta lost to Ashlee 
Ferlito of the Northern California Section, 6-3, 6-3. The final round is set 
for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the USTA Girls' 18 National Championships in San Jose won't 
publicize their draw until Saturday, but Meilen Tu of Northridge and Ania 
Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks are expected to be seeded high. Krissy Hamilton of 
Agoura Hills also is expected to earn a top-16 seeding. . . . Mike Bryan is 
seeded third and twin Bob is seeded fourth at the Boys' 16 National 
Championships in Kalamazoo, Mich., which start Sunday.

DIGEST: COLORADO DENIES ADMISSION FOR VAN BUREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Colorado has denied Leodes Van Buren admission, paving the 
way for the former Newbury Park High receiver to attend another school this 
fall if he avoids a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 19, was convicted last week on felony charges of firing a gun into 
the residence of his girlfriend, Marcie James. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren and James now are married. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is set for Aug. 25 in Ventura County Superior Court. Van Buren, who 
had no criminal record before his conviction, faces a sentence ranging from 
probation to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, the state's all-time leading receiver, received a letter this week 
from Colorado denying him admission and voiding his letter of intent, according 
to John B. Miller, Van Buren's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado spokesman Dave Plati said Wednesday that Van Buren was denied 
admission after a review of his academic records. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Van Buren did not back out of his letter of intent, he should not lose 
any eligibility. The NCAA letter-of-intent committee will review the case soon, 
Miller said. Golf

 Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks shot a one-over 73 and fell two shots off the lead 
at the 28th Pacific Coast Amateur Championship at Bear Creek Golf Club in 
Murrieta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a two-time L.A. City Men's champion, is tied for third with former 
Walker Cup member Michael Podolak of Oxbow, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Two collegians share the lead at 140: Todd Andrews of Solana Beach and 
Pepperdine shot a second-round 69 and Brad Dinkel of Golden, Colo., and 
University of New Mexico shot 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys shot 73 to finish at 152, missing the cut by one 
shot.

A DYNAMIC FIRST EFFORT THAT PROVES TO BE THE REAL THING; BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; 
THE GRASS DANCER BY SUSAN POWER , G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS, $22.95, 288 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The Grass Dancer" is a look through an inverted telescope into the rich 
tapestry of Dakota society. Moving a century backward from the early 1980s and 
reclosing the loop in the present, its series of related, beautifully told 
tales unravel the intricate stitch of related lives, the far-reaching 
consequences of chance acts, the lasting legacies of love and jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Power, an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, has written 
a first novel that hums with serious intention and reads like a sad and lovely 
lament. The high plains reservation setting is rendered with the kind of 
authentic realism -- the little but crucial details -- that only the most acute 
observer notices, and her prose is both strong and lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other books that deal with the social dynamics of small communities, 
"The Grass Dancer" is concerned with the power of thwarted or stunted kinship 
-- mothers who lose their daughters, fathers who die before they are known by 
their sons -- and with marital love gone wrong or betrayed.  
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness of one generation literally haunts the next, and the next. 
Frustrated spirits often meddle in human affairs, and indeed the boundary 
dividing the living and the dead is occasionally so blurred that a man can 
marry his fiancee's ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic suffuses the world that Power poetically describes. Eyelashes baked in 
chocolate cupcakes instantly turn high school boys lusty, a tiny fragment from 
the sheet of one bed sewed onto that of another is a prescription for unwilling 
adultery -- or at least that's how people explain seemingly irrational 
occurrences to themselves and each other.  
</P>
<P>
 People, especially the young and innocent, can be puppets in the hands of 
unscrupulous elders whose manipulations, in the long run, are balanced only by 
the goodness of ancestors even older, even wiser in the ways of power. 
</P>
<P>
 In what might be the book's most powerful story -- an archetypal tale of a 
sibling love-hate rivalry -- two sisters do battle using their unfortunate 
children as pawns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked like two opposites, like people with blood running from separate 
rivers. Chaske, whose baptism name was Emery Bauer Jr., after his German 
father, was sturdy and tall for his age, his powerful calf muscles bulging like 
little crab apples under the skin. His hair was creamy yellow, the color of 
beeswax, and his eyes were a silvery gray, so pale they were almost white. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dina, on the other hand, was a blueprint of the women in our family, 
long-legged and graceful, thick braids grazing her narrow hips. Her little 
heart-shaped face was dark brown, the color of a full-blood, and her eyes were 
black and onyx studs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, both perish, each from the meanness of their respective aunts -- 
whose true animosities are toward each other, but whose children are too-easy 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The world that Power describes pulses with vitality and passion. Characters 
roll forward like gusts of wind, smacking into each other, changing direction, 
temporarily blowing the same way, exhausting themselves with the force of their 
will.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though they may pretend otherwise, everyone wants something -- a lot -- 
although achieving a goal is no guarantee of contentment. When they get what 
they wanted, they immediately want something else just as badly. And once in 
awhile, just when they teeter on the edge of finding satisfaction, they misread 
the signals, make a mistake, lose their chance -- and forever regret their 
blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Power is a terrific writer -- energetic, fresh, political, daring. She 
succeeds most impressively when she relaxes into the simple rhythm of her 
stories, trusting the reader to understand their mythic elements without 
underlining them too boldly.  
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism at the heart of this striking novel -- the grass whose beauty 
and movement, whose very soul the best dancers strive to catch and imitate -- 
is unadorned, timeless: "She became a flexible stem, twisting toward the sky, 
dipping to the ground, bending with the wind. She was dry and brittle, 
shattered by drought, and then she was heavy with rain." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grass Dancer" is a book wonderful both for what it is and for what it 
promises. Susan Power is the real thing.

A RACE TO THE FINISH AT CALUMET FARMS; BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; WILD RIDE:THE 
RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF CALUMET FARM INC., AMERICA'S PREMIER RACING DYNASTY BY 
ANN HAGEDORN AUERBACH HENRY HOLT, $22.50, 384 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Lucille Parker Wright Markey died in 1982, she was eulogized as "the 
Grande Dame of Racing," the woman who for decades had presided over the 
country's premiere racehorse stable, Calumet Farm. She was the last of her 
kind, people said: old-fashioned, determined to raise her own thoroughbreds, 
committed to racing less for the social whirl and financial gain than the love 
of horses -- particularly Calumet's prized stallion Alydar -- and the desire to 
excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey left most of her $300-million estate to charity, but the sturdy, 
debt-free Kentucky farm remained in the hands of the founding Wright family, to 
be run by J.T. Lundy, the son of a sharecropper who had married one of Markey's 
granddaughters. Ten years later, Calumet Farm was bankrupt, listing debts of 
more than $167 million. Something like $100 million was missing -- and so was 
Lundy, who had almost single-handedly destroyed not only the farm but the 
Wright family fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Today most Wright family members live in Florida, debt-ridden tax refugees 
attempting to protect their remaining assets from the creditors pursuing them, 
thanks to their former in-law. Lundy is also reported to live in Florida these 
days, and like some of the Wrights, he too has declared personal bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 It might seem, at first glance, that by pillaging the Wright estate Lundy has 
succeeded in bringing the family down to his level, but that's probably not the 
case: Rumors persist that Lundy -- unlike the trusting, naive Wrights -- is 
still rich, having socked away some ill-gotten Calumet millions well beyond the 
reach of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of Calumet Farms is a dramatic story, and in "Wild Ride" former Wall 
Street Journal reporter Ann Hagedorn Auerbach tells it exceptionally well.  
</P>
<P>
 Race fans will love the book, of course, but so will anyone interested in 
recent cultural history, for "Wild Ride" is as much about 1980s greed as it is 
about horses. In a different decade, Lundy might have enjoyed a rags-to-riches 
life, complete with happy ending; a smart man with good horse sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy was not necessarily the wrong man to run Calumet. Once in charge, 
however, it's clear that he lost all perspective, becoming less interested in 
breeding horses and winning races than in the addictions of the era -- power, 
money and deal-making.  
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Lundy modernized Calumet, but he was soon spending money as if 
there were no tomorrow, buying private jets, staying in the best hotels, eating 
in the most expensive restaurants, and always paying the tab for his friends 
and associates -- with the farm's money, of course. Auerbach doesn't spend much 
time unearthing Lundy's motivations, but it's a sure bet that revenge was on 
his mind: You get the feeling that Lundy end-ran the legal trust that 
supposedly ran Calumet in part to embarrass the Wrights and began associating 
with convicted felons in part to shock local bluebloods. And at some level, who 
could blame him? When Lundy began running Calumet, the Kentucky gentry could be 
heard saying, cruelly: "He's drinking champagne, but he can't spell it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also true that money, for many people, was easy to come by in the 1980s. 
The horse business, being a glamour play, boomed during the decade, drawing all 
kinds of money from Wall Street, Texas, Japan, South America and the Middle 
East.  
</P>
<P>
 With Lundy, however, money in was inevitably money out: Suffering from 
advanced deal-itis and staggering lines of credit, he arranged breeding, 
purchasing and sales agreements that leveraged Calumet up to its devil's-red 
eaves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side of the equation, he sold breeding rights to Alydar, the 
farm's principal asset, for millions of dollars, and often produced winners; on 
the minus side, he gave away or pre-sold those same extremely valuable rights 
to friends and associates, hyped auction prices to keep the thoroughbred market 
artificially high, and occasionally paid outrageous sums for horses -- such as 
$25 million for half-ownership of Secreto, the winner of 1984's Epsom Derby. No 
wonder the cost of operating Calumet soared from perhaps $2 million annually to 
$12 million during the Lundy era. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a matter of time before the house of cards collapsed. The 
triggering event was Alydar's death in 1990, which Auerbach suggests -- mildly 
-- may have been deliberately orchestrated to allow Calumet to collect on the 
horse's $36.5-million insurance. There's little evidence for that theory, 
however, and in any case farm management went to heroic efforts to keep Alydar 
alive -- although it is true, as only Lundy and a few other people knew at the 
time, that with most of his breeding seasons pre-sold, Alydar was probably 
worth more dead than alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alydar's death aside, "Wild Ride" is told with care and circumspection, 
Auerbach setting out the evidence in a way that permits readers to decide for 
themselves whether Lundy is indeed a scoundrel (yes) and whether most of the 
Wrights were extraordinarily credulous (ditto). 
</P>
<P>
 One irony that Auerbach doesn't stress is the ways in which Lundy's tale 
mirrors that of the Wright dynasty's founder. William Wright became rich in the 
Roaring Twenties, just as Lundy became rich during the 1980s Bluegrass Bubble. 
William Wright didn't exactly earn his money in an upright manner, the Federal 
Trade Commission determining in 1927 that his claims for his baking powder were 
deceptive.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Lundy, however, the elder Wright knew when to quit. He sold the Calumet 
Co. for $32 million to the future General Foods months before the Great Crash 
of 1929 and used the money to begin turning Calumet Farm into the respectable 
operation that his great-grandson-in-law would eventually shatter.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: VANISHING OF VIL VANA STILL TORMENTS FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was been more than a year since the ocean near Santa Cruz Island seemed to 
open up and swallow the Vil Vana whole. Seven crewmen were on board the trawler 
on the day it went down, and the secret of their struggle is buried at sea with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 While the crew members have found peace, their families have not. They 
struggle both with what they do know and what they don't know, and with the 
role of the U.S. Coast Guard, which, family members claim, has yet to address 
the many questions that still, 16 months later, go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 What, in fact, did happen to the Vil Vana? How could a 41-foot fishing boat 
disappear in the Santa Barbara Channel? What was the Navy stealth ship doing in 
the channel that day, and what role, if any, did it play in the disappearance 
of the Vil Vana? Why has the Coast Guard still not filed a final report? 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of so much contradiction and irresolution, family members continue 
to be tormented, the marauding forces of rumor and conjecture violating their 
desire for quiet acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writer Jeff Meyers covered the original story that ran on news pages in 
early April, 1993. It was a story that tugged and nagged and intrigued, and he 
felt compelled to write an update on the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would check in with family members and feel their anger and frustration 
over the lack of closure," Meyers said. "They couldn't understand why the Coast 
Guard was taking so long and they were sure the delay meant a government 
cover-up was taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers didn't find any evidence of a cover-up. Visiting the investigating 
officer at home, he found an overworked lieutenant commander who too often 
found himself shelving his investigation to take care of other administrative 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the next of kin, I was hoping the Coast Guard would uncover a great hook 
to explain the mystery," Meyers said. "But the report doesn't come close to 
solving the mystery and probably just makes it more ambiguous." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Vil Vana remains a compelling story. "We know more now about the 
boat than we ever have," Meyers said. "But we still don't know enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Life: With summer really bearing down, there is plenty going on 
this weekend that is outdoors, yet in the vicinity of cooling ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like to feel the heat, both inside and out, Jane Hulse's Jaunts column 
has pertinent information about the fifth annual Port Hueneme Chili Festival 
that will be held Saturday at Hueneme Beach Park. Things will get hot and heavy 
at this event. 
</P>
<P>
 If fresh and crunchy sounds better than hot and spicy, there are a couple of 
other food festivals you might consider attending this weekend. Get the details 
in Leo Smith's Tibits column.

SIGHTS; AGE CANNOT WITHER, NOR CUSTOM STALE THE ART OF BEATRICE WOOD; AN 
EXHIBIT OF WRYLY HUMOROUS AND VIBRANT DRAWINGS BY THE OJAI ARTIST IS ON DISPLAY 
AT THE CARNEGIE MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to Beatrice Wood, Ojai's venerable grand dame of the arts, the 
pesky age issue is certainly relative. It has been over a year since the media 
descended on her for the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Wood is simply getting on with the business of living, continuing to 
produce work in two and three dimensions -- ceramic vessels, tableaux and 
drawings. At 101, she is still blessed with the wry levity and flowing hand 
that artists a fraction of her age should envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth prevails, regardless of what numbers tell us. And that's an underlying 
theme of "Dialogues: Drawings by Beatrice Wood," another coup for the Carnegie 
Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 This cohesive group of images focuses on the risky playground of social 
intercourse. But Wood -- alias "Beato" -- casts a suspicious eye on the 
ulterior motives and duplicity in social settings, showing the kind of 
skeptical bemusement you might expect of a perceptive young person. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood has gracefully assimilated the influences gained from her role in seminal 
20th Century art. Accounts of the artist's life can hardly refrain from 
mentioning her intellectual and/or romantic entanglements with such figures as 
Marcel Duchamp, Edward Weston, Brancusi and Henri-Pierre Roche (author of 
"Jules and Jim," speculated to be about Wood). 
</P>
<P>
 What self-respecting, history-loving art observer can get around her 
reputation by association? Wood's cachet as a living legend travels with her 
wherever she, or her work, goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although known for often bedazzling and intricate ceramic works, Wood leans 
toward an almost naive airiness once her drawing persona takes over. Spare and 
unconcerned with virtuosity, Wood's drawings are loose and supple things, 
sensuous of line and sly of content. Her forms and sense of spatial 
distribution -- or dissection -- take cues from Cubism, resulting in a kinder, 
gentler variation thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 As seen in this exhibition of devious delicacies, Wood is a master deflector 
of social mores. In the course of the show, we get the impression that the 
artist is both celebrating the social life while questioning -- sometimes even 
skewering -- it. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting things in perspective, there is "The Well-Fed Settling the World," 
depicting the discreet, ineffectual charms of the bourgeoisie. Wood shows two 
pieces entitled "The Bore," with the offending parties depicted as 
overbearingly pleasant types surrounded by parties melting with tedium. 
</P>
<P>
 She lets us in on her politics and values with such humorous scenes as "Trying 
to Convince a Republican," with subjects reduced to arm-wrestling, or "Men 
Trying to Discuss Politics," all contorted figures and twisted limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her libertine philosophy is stated simply in "Monogamy Is Impossible" and 
"Tell Us a Dirty Story." 
</P>
<P>
 In her work, we often detect references of Wood's own background as a 
well-heeled Easterner who gave up propriety for a more free-spirited life early 
in the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Characters often suggest an earlier period in history, as in the wacky "Man 
Introduces his Mistress to His Wife," with a top-hatted scalawag from another 
time. But, typical of Wood, there is no moral scorn attached to a potentially 
loaded image. 
</P>
<P>
 One tangent to the exhibition proper is the newly unveiled table, a crafty 
looking object, made by Wood along with Lloyd Wright in the '30s. Above it 
hangs a lithograph of Wood's portrait of Helen Lloyd Wright. This image is 
alone in the gallery for its conscious lack of irony. 
</P>
<P>
 In her recent book, "Playing Chess with the Heart," Wood writes: "There are 
three things important in life: honesty, which means living free of the cunning 
of the mind; compassion, because if we have no concern for others, we are 
monsters; and curiosity, for if the mind is not searching, it is dull and 
unresponsive." 
</P>
<P>
 To that short list might be added flexibility. In these drawings, as with much 
of her art, Wood dances along a fine line separating -- and intertwining -- 
innocence and sophistication. She remains a local treasure with a worldly 
reach. LOCAL HARVEST 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs at the museum, a juried selection of local art goes under the 
peculiar moniker "A Classic Celebration." There are some admirable fruits here 
to behold -- further proof of the artistic worthiness lurking in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping off the wall in the museum stairwell, Gary Salvail's "Orange Sofa" 
exudes a funky bewitchment, with its colorful elevation of the everyday. Kazuko 
Knowles shows her painting "Venezia I," a rippling pattern of stones in a dark 
patina. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Shechter's fine, unabashedly Hopper-esque "Union Station" finds a boy 
in a train station, raked with late afternoon sunlight, wallowing in a 
not-unpleasant aura of desolation. Meanwhile, Wilva Ehlers' "Wilva" depicts its 
woman of leisure with appealingly chunky brushwork and a relaxed energy. 
Powerful Ojai artist Alberta Fins' typically dark-toned mixed-and-mashed-media 
pieces contrast with Bill Woolway's marvelously effervescent, folksy 
cityscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs in the back gallery, "Jill Sattler: Atmospheric Photography and 
Other Treasures," is an uneven display of photographs and assemblages, 
distinguished mostly by her evocative sepia-toned portraits of Beatrice Wood, 
flanked by girls on her 100th birthday. Details

THEATER REVIEW; STRONG PERFORMANCES ARE THE STUFF OF 'DREAMER'; THE ONE-ACT 
PLAY BY JOHN PATRICK SHANLEY EXAMINES RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN A FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Patrick Shanley, author of the romantic comedy "Moonstruck," is the 
creator of "The Dreamer Examines His Pillow," a one-act play in brief run at 
the Plaza Players Theatre in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Doreen Lacy's senior directing project for UC Santa Barbara and -- more 
important to the audience -- an opportunity to see some impressive acting in a 
relatively unexposed vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Moonstruck," "The Dreamer . . ." examines relationships within a family; 
this group is presumably also Italian American, although the actors' accents 
wander all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 On the outs with her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Tommy, Donna comes to her father 
for advice. Deep family secrets are revealed, and everybody comes out newly 
enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's dynamic shifts strongly from one scene to the next, with the focus 
predominantly on Donna and her father. She's in her early 20s, maybe a bit 
smarter than she sounds with her Cindy Lauper accent (a comparison of unstable 
Tommy to "an isotope" comes in from nowhere; either she paid attention during 
physics class or Shanley is a careless writer). 
</P>
<P>
 He, a former painter, is Wise but Troubled. In the movies, Dad would have been 
played by Vincent Gardenia. Both characters are particularly well played by 
Sarah Meaney and John Medeiros, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Orrego does what he can with the play's most difficult role: Not only is 
Tommy a cad (dating Donna's 16-year-old sister while on the rebound from 
Donna), he's a thief (stealing from his mother to pay the rent) and of rather 
limited ambition -- popping beers and staring at his refrigerator as if it were 
a TV set. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this guy appealing, even to Donna, is a task that would defy far more 
experienced actors; Orrego nearly succeeds, although his style of acting is 
noticeably less realistic than Meaney's or Medeiros'. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Eck has come up with an interesting and effective lighting design, and 
Meaney's (uncredited) costume is suitably tacky.

THEATER SCENE; 'OTHELLO' HAS DIFFERENT OUTLOOK AT OJAI FESTIVAL; AS A FOLLOWER 
OF ISLAM, ACTOR SHRIFF HASAM BRINGS AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE PORTRAYAL OF 
THE MOOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Shriff Hasam, who stars in the Ojai Shakespeare Festival's production of 
"Othello," has a limited background in Shakespeare. But, as a practitioner of 
Islam, the 41-year-old actor brings a relatively unusual perspective to his 
interpretation of the noble Moor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasam -- who, as a youth, shuttled back and forth between his mother in New 
Orleans and his father in Houston -- was introduced to Shakespeare while 
attending a performance of "Macbeth" in New Orleans. Later, while attending 
Tuskegee University in Alabama, he became seriously involved in the theater -- 
and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 His classmates included Lionel Richie and other members of the band that would 
evolve into the Commodores. And there was a young man named Keenen Ivory 
Wayans, the future creator of the film "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" and the comedy 
series "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I were among the people who helped get students interested in 
theater," Hasam recalled in a recent interview. "We got some other students 
together, hired a director and started doing plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Hasam discovered Islam after hearing about it from other students. "I didn't 
come into Islam because of Malcolm X," he stressed, "but through my own study. 
Everybody's looking for something, and I found what I was looking for when I 
became a Muslim." 
</P>
<P>
 While in Alabama, Hasam appeared in the film "Norma Rae," which starred Sally 
Field. He then moved to Los Angeles and won a role on the soap opera "Rituals." 
But a drunk driver ruined Hasam's prospects for soap stardom: After one 
episode, he was struck down and suffered a broken pelvis. While recuperating, 
he enrolled in Los Angeles City College, subsequently earning his master's in 
theater from CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasam took teaching positions in Houston and, last year, was back at Tuskegee, 
where he started a theater program. He left after his one-year contract 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to spend money," he said ruefully. "They wanted to 
concentrate on the sciences." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hasam is seeking a teaching position in Southern California, "although at 
the moment, I'm concentrating all of my attention on the role of Othello. Of 
the many roles I've performed, Othello is the role that I've always wanted; 
it's a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Shakespeare Festival Artistic Director Paul Backer, who'd known Hasam 
since the Los Angeles City College days, had no trouble choosing him for the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the six people who auditioned," Backer said, "a lot of them were pretty 
good, but I was looking for a bit more age and gravity. Because a lot of the 
plays that he has done are contemporary African American or African, Hasam taps 
into the ferocity that is contained in Othello's dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins or even classically trained black 
actors have played the role, Othello is more uptight, because he's a military 
leader. Hasam brings anger to the role." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his religion has made him more accepting of other cultures and 
beliefs, Hasam said he relates to Othello's anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Othello is a Moor, who had to convert to Christianity in order 
to become acceptable to Venice society, is something I can understand," he 
said. "I had to give up a certain amount of my lifestyle when I became a 
Muslim." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty more Shakespeare in the works for this and next year, with no 
duplication scheduled -- so far. Look for the Ojai Shakespeare Company's "Much 
Ado About Nothing" later this month and the Tour de Force Repertory Company 
production of "The Taming of the Shrew" at Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark-based California Shakespeare Company has just announced its 
schedule: "Love's Labours Lost" (September), "Anthony and Cleopatra" 
(November), "Henry V" (February) and "Twelfth Night" (April). 
</P>
<P>
 All are performed in the area infrequently, with the exception of "Much Ado," 
"Shrew" and "Twelfth Night," which seem to pop up every couple of weeks. And, 
so far, nobody's announced a production of the really overdone "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" or "Romeo and Juliet."

CENTERPIECE: FATAL VOYAGE; IT'S BEEN 6 MONTHS SINCE THE COMMERCIAL TRAWLER VIL 
VANA AND ITS EVEN CREWMEN VANISHED IN WATERS OFF SANTA CRUZ ISLAND. BUT 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS STILL HAUNT THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NORMA WATKINS talks about her 11-year-old granddaughter, who has been prone to 
sleepless nights and dark moods ever since the child's father was lost at sea 
last year. One evening recently, Watkins says, the family was watching a TV 
movie about '30s aviator Amelia Earhart when the youngster made a haunting 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amelia Earhart just disappears," Watkins says, "and my granddaughter goes, 
'That's just like . . . . ' But she couldn't make herself say it. Her 
grandfather finally said, 'Just like Dad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 16 months have passed since the commercial trawler Vil Vana and seven 
crewmen vanished just north of Santa Cruz Island. While families of the victims 
are still tormented by the mysterious and seemingly implausible event -- one of 
the worst maritime disasters in Ventura County history -- they are also 
exasperated and angry with the U.S. Coast Guard, which has neither solved the 
mystery nor finished its official report on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have had answers by now," says Laura Huffman, the mother of the 
three children of crewman Donnie Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an official report, the tragedy lacks finality for relatives, 
preventing them from letting go. "For all I know," Norma Watkins says, "my son 
is alive." 
</P>
<P>
 And without definitive answers, rumors and imaginations run wild. How could a 
41-foot wooden trawler and everyone on board just vanish in the middle of Santa 
Barbara Channel? Conjecture around the docks ranges from drug snuff to UFOs. 
SPECULATION 
</P>
<P>
 Norma and Don Watkins speculate that the Vil Vana was sunk in a collision with 
the U.S. Navy's black stealth ship, the 160-foot Sea Shadow, a scenario 
straight out of a Tom Clancy novel but with a touch of credibility: The Sea 
Shadow just happened to be at Santa Cruz Island that day, the Navy confirms. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawn-out official report and the Sea Shadow's presence fuels the 
conspiracy theories. "Something big-time happened on that ocean," Norma Watkins 
says, sitting under a shade tree outside her La Conchita trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know . . . with that report taking so long . . . The whole thing is 
fishy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coast Guard sees thoroughness behind its lengthy investigation -- 
after all, Amelia Earhart's disappearance hasn't been solved in 57 years. While 
most fatality reports usually take only weeks to complete, running just a few 
pages, the Vil Vana report has grown to 60 pages and "is the largest 
investigation file I've ever seen in my two years here," says Lt. Commander 
Adeste Fuentes, who is in charge of the investigation for the Coast Guard's 
Marine Safety Office in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard investigation has been stymied by a lack of hard evidence and 
a total absence of eyewitnesses. But next of kin, Fuentes says, want intrigue 
and revelation, where none exists. "If you're looking for answers," he says, 
"the answer is, 'We don't know (what happened).' " 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known: The blue-and-white Vil Vana was last seen at 4:30 a.m. on 
April 9, 1993, easing away from E dock at Ventura Harbor Village Marina and 
setting a course for the shrimp beds off Santa Cruz Island. That afternoon, 
satellites began picking up distress signals. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:43 p.m., the pilot of a search helicopter spotted an emergency strobe 
light amid a small debris field floating 1 1/2 miles north of the island, off 
an area called Chinese Harbor. But no boat and no bodies were ever discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard turned up "nothing significant" during its investigation, but 
Fuentes has been able to piece together several parts of the puzzle. A revised 
copy of the nearly completed official report, reviewed by The Times, rules out 
collisions, fires or any scenario evoking the Bermuda Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 What probably happened? "All evidence points to the Vil Vana capsizing and 
sinking quickly without prior warning," Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes' own scenario will be an addendum to the final report, which is 
expected by the fall. He believes the Vil Vana was unstable in the water 
because of changes made to the boat before its last voyage. He believes pilot 
error may have caused the boat to veer sideways to a wave; broadsided by waves, 
the trawler tipped to one side, took on water and rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes thinks the vessel went down with all seven men trapped inside, some in 
the hold, some in the pilot's cabin, some in the work area, which was enclosed 
by a 2-foot-by-4-foot lattice cage running from the pilot's cabin to the 
transom. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollover "may have been caused by a deadly combination of two or three 
factors," Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives of the victims refuse to accept rollover as the reason their men 
didn't come back. "That doesn't satisfy me," says Norma Watkins, frowning and 
lighting a cigarette. "It's hard to believe not one of those men was able to 
get off that boat and make it to the island. Even if they all drowned, not one 
body popped up. Bodies float." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the truth now sits at the bottom of Santa Barbara Channel. 
Recovery of the hull -- which Fuentes believes lies beneath 600 feet of water 
-- could clear up several key questions, including the fate of the victims and 
whether another ship was involved. But the Coast Guard has no plans to find and 
salvage the Vil Vana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not part of our tasking," Fuentes says, explaining: "The Coast Guard 
isn't in the salvage business. If we were, we wouldn't have any money to do 
anything else." QUESTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard investigation doesn't resolve many essential questions: If a 
crewman had the time to manually activate the emergency transmitter, why wasn't 
the ship's radio or cellular phone used to call for help? Why did the 
transmitter malfunction at the time of the incident but work properly later 
during a Coast Guard bench test? What time did the accident happen and where? 
Why were no personal belongings found among the debris? Where are the bodies? 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard's hard evidence is minimal. Investigators traced the origins 
of the Vil Vana to a back-yard San Pedro boat maker who built the vessel as a 
net trawler 45 years ago. In December, 1992, it was purchased for $18,000 by a 
30-year-old Korean immigrant, Seong Choi of Oxnard. Choi became partners with a 
fellow Korean, John Kim, 25, of Glendale. According to Fuentes, Choi and Kim 
"were businessmen trying to be fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Fuentes says, the new owners 
converted the Vil Vana into a shrimp trawler. The net wheel in the stern and 
the swordfish plank on the bow, equipment weighing about 1,400 pounds, were 
removed. To store 200 or 300 shrimp traps, the stern area was rigged with the 
2-by-4 cage, known as a hayrack or corral. A hydraulic drum for hoisting traps 
to the surface was installed on the starboard side of the cage. And, to make 
room for four 20-cubic-foot saltwater tanks in the hold, the 3,000 pounds of 
stone ballast were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the changes make the boat unstable? Boating experts aren't sure, but 
Fuentes believes the tanks may have raised the vessel's center of gravity, 
making it prone to tipping. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Choi and Kim sailed the Vil Vana to Ventura Harbor. Instead of 
leasing a slip, they paid a day rate to avoid paying insurance, which runs 
about $6,000 a year and would have required a safety inspection, boating 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi hired harbor resident Dan Pelton, 33, to provide the fishing expertise 
and drive the boat, although Choi reportedly often took the helm. Pelton didn't 
have a captain's license, but friends and associates considered him an able, 
experienced fisherman and skipper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vil Vana initiated its first fishing trips weeks before the accident and 
went out every day the week of the fateful voyage, hauling in large quantities 
of spot-fin prawns, fishermen say. Reportedly, Choi and Kim became unpopular 
around the docks for overfishing the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the morning of April 9, three of the seven crew members had never been 
on the Vil Vana. Kim took his 17-year-old nephew to dive for abalone. Pelton 
asked his friend and longtime sailor, Donnie Watkins, to crew. Watkins, 41, 
brought along Ben Jordan, 24, also of La Conchita. Jordan had known Watkins 
since he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben called me at 3:30 in the morning (April 9) to tell me he decided to go 
with Donnie instead of going to stay with his girlfriend in Oxnard," says 
Jordan's mother, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Norma Watkins and Laura Huffman, Barbara Jordan launched her own 
tenacious investigation of the accident, interviewing Coast Guard officials and 
harbor locals. She learned that the Vil Vana came in early on April 8 because 
of trouble with its 150-horsepower diesel engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with people moored next to them and they said (the crew) was doing 
work on the engine the morning they went out," Jordan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Don Watkins calls the Vil Vana "a big lumbering piece of junk," it 
was not a shipwreck waiting to happen, says Chuck Connor, a friend of Dan 
Pelton and a Ventura lobster fishermen who had been aboard the boat once. "It 
seemed perfectly fine," he says. "It was a typical older boat, heavy built. But 
I know Dan Pelton. If that boat wasn't seaworthy, he wouldn't have been on it." 
</P>
<P>
 At a top speed of seven or eight knots an hour, the Vil Vana probably needed a 
good three hours to reach the east end of Santa Cruz Island, about 25 miles 
from Ventura Harbor. The seas were average -- three to five feet with 
occasional eight- to 10-foot swells -- and the winds were normal, increasing 
later in the afternoon to 15 to 20 knots. Patches of fog were reported, but 
otherwise the weather was clear, and visibility was 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Pelton, Dan's brother, says the crew planned to set about 300 traps off 
Chinese Harbor -- a task that involved placing open cans of cat food in each 
trap and lowering a string of traps to the bottom -- and pick up about 200 
traps a few miles to the west off Painted Cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Pelton, who searched the area in boats and also flew over in a hired 
plane shortly after the accident, says he found the newly set traps at Chinese 
Harbor, indicating that the Vil Vana was probably still afloat at midmorning. 
But he does not know the fate of the traps at Painted Cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, however, doubts the traps exist. "They swept the whole area (during 
the search) and found nothing, no traps," Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the Coast Guard reported the time of the accident at about 5:30 
p.m., when a COSPAS / SARSAT satellite received a 121.5 megahertz distress 
signal from the Vil Vana's emergency transmitter, the Emergency Positioning 
Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB for short). But the official report now says a 
satellite recorded a 121.5 MHz signal from the Vil Vana at 2:58 p.m. In 
actuality, the Coast Guard now says, it has no idea when the flash point 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really know exactly when the EPIRB was activated," Fuentes says. "It 
could have been as early as noon. We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPIRB malfunction is a critical factor in the Coast Guard's response time 
and, possibly, the crewmen's fate. If the emergency system worked correctly, 
its 406 MHz signal would have transmitted the ship's location to within three 
miles and brought help in one or two hours. But in water temperature of 59 
degrees, Vil Vana survivors would not have lasted more than four hours without 
wet suits, Coast Guard manuals say. The accident probably occurred at least six 
hours before the helicopter pilot spotted the EPIRB's strobe. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the EPIRB only compounds the mystery. Who adjusted it from 
automatic to manual and why? How did the antenna become bent? Why was the 
signal detected by some satellites and missed by others? Why did the EPIRB's 
406 MHz signal place its position, at various times, 800 miles off Northern 
California, 500 northeast of Oahu and 1,500 miles west of Mexico? Why wasn't 
its 121.5 MHz signal -- receivable by satellite as well as FM radio -- picked 
up by the direction finder at the Channel Islands Harbor Coast Guard Station, 
which would have launched a rescue boat immediately? ANSWERS 
</P>
<P>
 The answers will probably never be known, but Fuentes believes the EPIRB was 
damaged in the turmoil and desperation of the rollover. After switching it on 
manually as the boat quickly filled with water, Fuentes says, a crewman may 
have freed the basketball-size device by forcing it outside the corral. The 
EPIRB may have floated under debris for a while, and its submersion, along with 
a bent antenna, "probably impacted the accuracy of the signal," Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes believes the Coast Guard response was by the book. A rescue effort 
couldn't begin until satellites began transmitting accurate information to U.S. 
Mission Control Center computers, he says. Based in Langley, Va., Mission 
Control receives information from satellites all over the world. The control 
room is often chaotic, with dozens of distress blips on the screen and no way 
to automatically determine which is a hoax, a mistake, or real. As many as four 
confirmations are needed before alerts are dispatched to various rescue 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the sake of using Coast Guard resources effectively," Fuentes says, "we 
don't search for signals that disappear. It costs too much." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:35 p.m., the Coast Guard had enough information to order a helicopter 
from its air station at Los Angeles International Airport, but the craft didn't 
take off until 7:43 p.m. -- a normal lag, Fuentes says. By 8:30, the helicopter 
was honing in on the 121.5 MHz signal. The pilot saw the EPIRB's strobe a few 
minutes later and dropped a flare, which illuminated a small debris field, 
mostly deck fodder from outside the cage. Despite a 42-hour search that covered 
2,800 square miles and involved a C-130 transport, two helicopters, three 
auxiliary aircraft and five ships, no other evidence of the Vil Vana's 
existence was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Vil Vana was fishing close to shipping lanes in the Santa Barbara 
Channel, next of kin speculate that it was either sideswiped or swamped by a 
deep-draft cargo vessel or oil tanker, behemoth ships that might not have seen 
a small vessel visually or on radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be a direct collision," Mike Pelton says. "The bow wake on 
those ships can be as high as 20 or 30 feet. Fog comes in from the west, the 
same direction as those ships. If you don't watch your radar, a ship could come 
up on you in a minute and you could get run over in a second." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coast Guard inspected all seven vessels that sailed through the 
channel that day, Fuentes says. No evidence of a collision -- paint scrapings 
or dents -- was found. All seven captains were interviewed, "but they said they 
didn't see any vessel," Fuentes says. The last large ship passed Santa Cruz 
Island, headed to Los Angeles about 1:30 p.m. and was in sight of two other 
southbound deep-draft vessels, Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes also checked out the possibility that a Navy submarine could have 
snagged a line and dragged the Vil Vana under. But the Navy told him none of 
its ships, including subs and the Sea Shadow, was involved in an incident or a 
collision. The Navy also has issued a statement saying the stealth ship was in 
its berth on the south side of Santa Cruz Island all day on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Vil Vana did roll over, next of kin and others don't believe it 
could have sunk with such speed that crewmen were unable to extricate 
themselves. "Those things don't go down like a rock," Chuck Connor says. "It 
never makes sense that nobody got off. The first thing Dan would have done was 
get his wet suit on -- he was capable of doing that in the water and he was a 
great swimmer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fuentes and other boating experts believe the sea can indeed swallow ships 
with sudden swiftness. "(Next of kin) know their sons and husbands are 
survivors and it would take more than a vessel rolling over to take their 
lives," Fuentes says. "But I've seen videos of ships sinking in 30 seconds." A 
ship's descent into the depths creates a vacuum and sucks flotsam down with it, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Separating fact from fiction will get more difficult as time goes by, making 
the Vil Vana's vanishing act even more inscrutable. But there are those who 
think the disappearance isn't as mysterious as it appears. The sea is cruel, 
arbitrary and unfathomable. The unthinkable happens. In 1917, the U.S.S. 
Cyclops, a 600-foot Navy destroyer, vanished without a trace in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boats have been known to disappear routinely," says John Johnson, president 
of Ventura Harbor Boatyard. "No bodies. No nothing. My wife and I have lost 
friends. We had a friend lost at sea in a steel-hulled fishing boat that rolled 
over for no apparent reason and sank quickly. These things happen more often 
than most people realize." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Channel -- once referred to in local newspapers as "the 
graveyard of the Pacific," can be unexpectedly treacherous -- the weather and 
currents confusing many experienced sailors. In December, 1835, the side-wheel 
steamer Winfield Scott hit rocks off Anacapa Island and sank, with no 
fatalities. In February, 1876, the 469-ton iron schooner Kalorama was beached 
by heavy seas, and broke up at the foot of what is now Kalorama Street in 
Ventura, again without casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vil Vana took seven men to a watery grave, making the accident the 
county's worst boating disaster since the Marie, a 40-foot charter engaged in 
work for the U.S. Department of Defense, exploded off Santa Cruz Island on June 
9, 1960, killing seven people. Only two bodies were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The common notion that bodies float is misleading, experts say. When a body 
sinks, strong currents often bury it under silt on the ocean floor, entombing 
it. Bodies not buried will rise slowly to the surface because of gas resulting 
from decomposition. But bodies rising from a depth of 600 feet would likely be 
picked clean by lobsters, shrimp, crabs and hagfish, all of which are plentiful 
off Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had other people never surface," says county Deputy Coroner Mitch 
Breese. "This happens. They never come up." 
</P>
<P>
 Families have looked to politicians for help in getting answers, but they 
think they are being stonewalled. "I'm upset with (Elton) Gallegly," Norma 
Watkins says, waving a letter from the Republican congressman. "He hasn't done 
a damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins and Laura Huffman have written several congressmen, sought assistance 
from the TV show "Unsolved Mysteries" and made dozens of calls to the Coast 
Guard. Norma Watkins doesn't ever plan to give up. "I'm not going to stop 
pestering people," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have asked the Navy to find the Vil Vana, but the Navy doesn't do 
non-military salvage work, a spokesman says. Private salvage operators charge 
about $10,000 a day, Fuentes says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be happy if I knew in fact the boat was there," Huffman says, "and if 
Donnie was there. R.I.P. At least he died the way he wanted to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, the Watkinses and Barbara Jordan have filed a $5-million negligence 
lawsuit against John Kim's wife, whose name appears on the boat's title. U.S. 
citizenship is required to buy and use a ship for commercial purposes, so Choi 
and Kim had the ownership papers signed by Patricia Kim, an American. (Efforts 
by The Times to reach her were unsuccessful.) CHANGING LAWS 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard has ended its investigation; it's the writing of the report 
that's now delaying completion. Fuentes, who has only been able to work on the 
report intermittently because of other administrative duties, says he is 
fine-tuning, making sure he sticks to the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jammed with diagrams, technical jargon, legalese and military talk, the 
finished report will go to the Coast Guard commandant's office in Washington. 
Fuentes is including recommendations for improving safety in the fishing 
industry and doesn't want his credibility undermined by letting guesswork slip 
into the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want (Coast Guard officials) saying, 'He guesses. Why should we 
listen to his recommendations?' " Fuentes says. "It's going to be really hard 
to take an incident with no hard evidence and support the recommendations I 
want to make to headquarters. I want to change laws, so I have to have my act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes wants to improve training for commercial fishermen, tighten other 
boating regulations and educate the public not to rely exclusively on EPIRB's 
to save their lives. If he accomplishes this, Fuentes hopes to avoid another 
Vil Vana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know (the mystery) is disheartening to next of kin," Fuentes says, "but I 
have a message for them: I'm not letting this go away without action from 
headquarters."

 Still, Norma Watkins will step from her La Conchita yard and look across the 
channel every day, her heart still not whole. "It bugs me to see that island," 
she says. "It's so damn close." The Story of the Vil Vana 
</P>
<P>
 The Vil Vana, a commercial trawler, vanished just north of Santa Cruz Island 
on April 9, 1993. It was last seen at 4:30 a.m. that day, leaving the E dock at 
Ventura Harbor Village Marina. That afternoon, satellites picked up distress 
signals. The Coast Guard has only recovered debris from the boat. Neither the 
vessel nor the seven men aboard have been found.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: PLATTE RIVER CROSSING DELIVERS FIRST CD; THE DEBUT ALBUM BY 
THE POPULAR SIMI VALLEY-BASED GROUP IS DUE OUT NEXT WEEK AND HAS BEEN GETTING 
GOOD LOCAL RADIO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While listening to the radio last week, I flashed back to my junior high days 
of Beatlemania. Those who remember that Paul McCartney was in another band 
before Wings also undoubtedly went through a ritual with befuddled parents that 
went something like this: "Paul's the cute Beatle. John's the serious one. 
George is the quiet one. And Ringo's the funny one." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday afternoon, instead of singing the praises of John, Paul, George 
and Ringo, Thunder Country (105.5 FM) deejay Bob Allen introduced "Al, Ron, 
Michele and, of course, Bruce" and the first single off their new CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, you heard right. Sandwiched between hits by Doug Stone and Little Texas 
were the harmonizing fellas we know as Platte River Crossing or the "Country 
Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
 Since hitting the local country scene in June, 1993, the Simi Valley-based 
band has gained popularity in our area, in addition to playing clubs in the San 
Fernando Valley and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Sleeping With My Boots On," a self-produced debut effort on Farm Boy 
Records, is worth hearing -- although some songs are more memorable than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The band will offer its new release starting next week when it plays at 
Alexander's Two-Stepping Tuesday Country Dance Night. And the band's appearance 
Aug. 27 at the Ventura Theatre Country Night will double as a CD release party. 
In addition to hearing their usual music, you can look forward to a set of 
original cuts off the album, which are also very danceable. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, you'll have to listen to Thunder Country radio to hear some of 
the tunes, which have been getting air play since June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to present them to the public as the exciting, high-energy band they 
are when you see them in concert. So I started with 'High Life,' 'Prickly Pete' 
and 'Nobody Else to Hear' rather than the ballads, which are also great," Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't want the initial impression to associate them musically with 
John Michael Montgomery or Doug Stone. So I went for the more fun sound of 
'Trashy Women' and 'Confederate Railroad.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've picked one as a single already," Allen added. "It's the No. 1 cut called 
'Nobody Else to Hear.' It's the most unique, fun-sounding song on the CD, I 
think. And I have had the best response from callers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the introductory hook on this yee-haw, thigh-slappin' 10-step written 
by Al Sorena (lead vocals, bass) grabs you right off the bat, thanks to 
Sardinian import Michele Taras, a shredder lead guitarist who joined the group 
a few months ago. Taras, who is not pictured because he's visiting Italy, also 
plays dobro and mandolin on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody Else to Hear" was written by Sorena and is performed by Ron Platt 
(lead vocals, keyboards, acoustic guitar). Most of the songs were written by 
Platt or Sorena. Former band member Lane Wesley and Dave Seal collaborated or 
wrote a couple of tunes. Randy Carpenter of another local group, Cactus County, 
contributed harmonica, and Rick Sailon plays fiddle on some cuts. Band leader 
Bruce Seidel plays drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidel lays down a great train beat on another noteworthy song -- the last 
cut, "Appalachian Express." Platt wrote and sings this fast 10-step, which 
makes a good signature piece when performed in the clubs. But don't expect to 
hear the train sounds at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real train sounds you hear at the end of the CD were recorded behind my 
house," Platt said. "We mixed a Metrolink and a freight train." Details

REEL LIFE; TRIBULATIONS OF MAKING ART ON A TIGHT BUDGET; THE COST OF SHOOTING 
ON PUBLIC PROPERTY STALLS A YOUNG FILMMAKER'S PROJECT, ON WHICH HE'S ALREADY 
EXHAUSTED HIS SAVINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shooting for a locally produced feature film about the cultural conflicts 
faced by a Mexican-American medical student is on hold as the filmmaker 
scrambles for funds to complete his project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on this project for more than a year," said Simon Balderas, 
the producer and director of "Little Heart," a film about a young man's 
ambition and obligations to his family. "I've got $30 for next month's 
groceries. That's for me, my wife and daughter. I'm to the point now that I 
wonder what I'm going to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Balderas has exhausted his own savings, but still has only gotten halfway 
through the film's $34,000 budget. Most of the interior shots are completed, 
but the picture is still missing the outdoor filming. Therein lies the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderas said the cost of filming on city property, even in Ventura County 
where many independent producers come to save money, has stalled his project. 
Balderas' quandary is emblematic of many independent producers who, in order to 
get their vision onto celluloid, often have to save their best creativity for 
behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to cut corners any way we can," said Balderas, whose day job 
involves producing videos for the Ventura Unified School District's Project 
Vision. "We're trying to work around shooting on public grounds because with 
permits and the required insurance, the cost is $1,500 and $2,000 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the budget for the film would be spent on permits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to do the film entirely in the county. Other independents I talked 
to said just go out and shoot the stuff without permits, but I don't want to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He's looking for private property to shoot the film on so he doesn't have to 
bother with the permit process. State property is a comparative bargain, but 
stipulations still plague his creative vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to shoot on the beach, you have to have liability insurance and 
then you have to pay the ranger's salary of $35 an hour plus overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 If it was a big special effects film with explosions and such, Balderas said 
he would understand, but he just wants to make a sensitive film about a young 
man, his ambitions and his obligations to his culture and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Warner Bros. will be filming "Dark Territory," the latest Steven 
Seagal action adventure, Wednesday in and around Santa Paula. The film's scene 
will feature a dramatic train chase that spills over into the town. Warner 
Bros. had no problem coming up with the permit fees.

EARTHWATCH: MANY VIEW ESCAPE AS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE; ACCORDING TO THE 
MAGAZINE AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS, MORE URBAN DWELLERS ARE MOVING TO RURAL 
COUNTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The summer auto and airline ads seem to scream at us: "Get away from it all!" 
Escape, come to think of it, is the theme of ads in general these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are these greener pastures we are supposed to go to? The pictures 
accompanying the ads invariably show people whizzing around or hanging around 
under blue skies in what looks like Southern California. So we're already here 
-- or "there," so to speak. It's a head scratcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Bray, who lives in Simi Valley, is not confused by such questions. She 
wants to escape to Springfield, Ill. Not just for the summer, but for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't cough for two weeks," she said, referring to a recent visit with 
in-laws. Bray, who is a mother of two small children and is married to a 
utility employee, said she had already been told by a Ventura County doctor, 
"You live here, you're gonna cough." Ironically, Bray came to Simi 20 years ago 
after the family doctor told her parents pretty much the same about the air in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it's normal to be worried about smog. And various U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency studies suggest that Los Angeles County and Ventura County do 
rank way up there in the nation's air pollution hall of infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Springfield? Don't folks usually leave the Midwest and come here? 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. Time was when they moved to California or some other bigger 
place on one coast or another. But nowadays, according to figures reported in a 
recent issue of the magazine American Demographics, "disgusted urban dwellers 
are moving to rural counties, (reversing) a decade of decline when rural areas 
were losing people to the cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Boise, Ida.; Lawton, Okla.; even Bakersfield, Calif. is swelling. New York, 
Chicago, Philadelphia are shrinking and Los Angeles has stopped growing. 
</P>
<P>
 People are moving for all sorts of reasons, and there is a rash of 
publications appearing to provide them advice. The Brays have been studying 
books about this trend for years, even seeking professional advice from an 
organization called the Greener Pastures Institute. They are now trying to sell 
their house so they can move. Even though Simi and Springfield have equal-sized 
populations, the Brays say the smog and congestion conditions are quite 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not, mind you, an anti-California movement. Rather, it is a 
health-seeking movement. There are, in fact, several getting-away-from-it-all 
books that recommend California places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities," by G.S. Thomas, the 
first chapter of which is about the environment, lists Eureka as the top choice 
in the nation, and San Luis Obispo gets high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Places Rated Almanac" by Savageau and Boyer, the city of Ventura appear in 
a list of 1,400 -- in 76th position. There are even lists that put Simi Valley 
in a leading position. Each author, of course, has his or her own priorities -- 
environment, education, employment, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 While immediate health concerns motivate many people like the Brays to think 
about moving, there is also the future to think about. A trend-within-a trend 
is emerging, as evidenced by the title of a book being published this fall, 
"Baby Boomer Retirement," by Don Silver. Although that book is focused more on 
money concerns than air quality, it raises an important new health-related 
issue: "Finding the right place for your parents to retire" is the title of a 
provocative and astute chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of us living longer -- including our parents -- it is important to 
choose to live where environmental conditions are right. The cumulative effects 
of pollution and congestion -- plus the newly discovered threat of ultraviolet 
radiation -- can tarnish our "golden years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we can't even look forward to our proverbial day in the sun without 
trepidation. Last month, American newspapers, including The Times, began 
listing, on the weather page, the daily "ultraviolet index" with ratings from 1 
to 10. The ratings indicate how long we can safely be in direct sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Our area has been getting ratings of 9 this week -- bad. Springfield's part of 
the country rates a 6. Details 
</P>

<P>
 The blond-haired woman sits at the brown Formica table in the tan brick room, 
her husband seated next to her. She talks of lying in bed at night next to her 
husband and then, once the lights go out, entering a state of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, she says, she'll just fall asleep. That would be good -- it's what 
she hopes for every night. 
</P>
<P>
 But she might also become locked within the fear: alone in the dark, looking 
up to the ceiling, waiting for things to get worse and yet not knowing what 
she's afraid of. 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, her heart pounds, her palms go sweaty, her head feels 
light, her breathing becomes rapid and shallow -- and as each of these scary 
things intensifies, she fears they will get even worse. Fueled by such fear, 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sinks into an abyss of no control and paralyzing fright, a voice then 
goes off in her head: Will I pass out? 
</P>
<P>
 Will I die? 
</P>
<P>
 The episodes happen a lot. They've been happening for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband holds her. He stands by her, tries to see her through. But like 
her, he's powerless. The tornado of feelings that rips through his wife is 
larger than either of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman has been tested for neurological disorders. Psychological problems. 
Biochemical imbalances in the brain. Physical fitness. Hormonal states. 
Endocrinological function. Nutritional and metabolic efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been diagnosed, misdiagnosed, told she may have this disease, may have 
that disorder. She's taken more than six different medicines, among them 
antidepressants, in an effort to keep the storms at bay. But still she 
struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there's no easy route to finding and naming something called 
Panic. It wears so many masks, hides behind the symptoms of hypertension, 
thyroid dysfunction, numerous psychological disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 But this woman is healthy, reasonable, charming, together -- a competent 
mother and loving wife. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5% of all Americans suffer as she does from panic attacks. That's 
more than 15 million people -- and many, many more than actually receive help 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seated along facing tables in the same room are others of panic's pilgrims -- 
people who, of their own choosing, attend twice-a-month group discussions at 
Ventura County Mental Health Services, across the street from Community 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Ojai woman whose panic paralleled years of not knowing the 
whereabouts or well-being of her father, recently discovered to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Oxnard man who last attended a session two years ago and has coped 
well since by employing relaxation exercises and avoiding social situations 
that "trigger" panic responses. But he's come for a refresher and to bring his 
sister, seated to his right. His sister, he says, "surprised the heck out of 
me" when she recently reported having "wild" symptoms she didn't understand. It 
seems she was talking to someone on the phone, suddenly felt frightened and, 
freezing up like a deer in the headlights, lost the ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Since panic is not anyone's badge of honor, this man had never told his sister 
of his troubles. But he understood her cries all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, does this run in families?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the Ventura man who spent time in a mental hospital years ago for 
the wrong thing. It was years of immobilizing attacks and misdiagnosis before 
doctors and his family realized he suffered from panic, whose symptoms mimic 
those of so many better-understood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the man is coping, he says, but still not free of panic's terrifying 
threat. With a sign of unabashed hope, however, he distributes reprints of a 
magazine article by a Canadian television journalist who chronicles her "out of 
the blue" debilitation by panic and her slow recovery. In the course of finding 
her way, the journalist cited current research suggesting panic results from 
oversensitivity to a brain protein called cholecystokinin (CCK) -- a protein 
that can be blocked by an experimental drug. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are 11 people in all at this meeting. Mostly, they share panic's war 
stories -- the claustrophobic MRI chamber, the night sweats, the formal party 
setting that triggers an attack, the meditation exercise that failed, the 
medication that made things worse, the happy but strange fact that 
antidepressants do help build a dam against anxiety, panic's precursor. But 
always the anecdotes beg the same questions: Where does it come from? Is it 
psychological? Is it biological? Is it chemical? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Reinhart, a clinical psychologist, runs these free, 
open-to-the-public sessions. As his craft would have it, he listens intently, 
hangs back, tries to guide or elucidate only when necessary. But he does state 
plainly that in this day of profound medical and psychological sophistication, 
panic eludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic, he says, "does seem" to involve the body, the mind, one's genetic and 
psychodynamic legacies. Only when all things are taken into account can panic 
be understood and held at bay -- to the extent that it can. 
</P>
<P>
 At which point the man with the magazine reprint says, "Well I find this thing 
about the brain protein that can be stopped to be exciting. It would be really 
nice if some day we could just take a pill and manage it like a diabetic does 
with insulin." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could say it simpler. After all, there's no reason not to hope.

SHOP TALK; AHA, A NEW WRINKLE IN SKIN-CARE COSMETICS; THE NATURAL ANTI-AGING 
PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM PLANTS. BUT A VARIETY OF BRANDS, BLENDS AND PRICES CAN 
CONFUSE SHOPPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't too long ago that the three-letter exclamation AHA was a simple 
sound indicative of the sudden understanding of a situation. Like, "Aha, that's 
where I left my car keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, AHA is more complicated,when used as an acronym for alpha hydroxy 
acids, a popular product in facial care that has been credited with removing 
wrinkles and slowing the aging of skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds wonderful. But AHA may as well be Aaaaaaaah (a term of frustration), 
considering how many products containing AHAs are on the market and how 
confusing shopping for them can be. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a definition: Alpha hydroxy acids are natural acids extracted from 
fruits, vegetables and sugar cane that, when applied, loosen up and remove the 
outer layer of skin where dead skin cells build up, said Pam Rohrbacher, office 
administrator of Dermatology Associates in Westlake Village. The result, she 
said, is a smoothing of fine lines, an improvement in skin texture and a 
reversal of discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rohrbacher, some experts believe that glycolic acid, derived from 
sugar cane, is the most effective of the acids at penetrating the skin and 
getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But, depending on where you shop for the variety of AHA creams, lotions and 
gels, you may find the product selling for anywhere from $30 for 1.7 ounces (a 
Prescriptives brand at Bullock's department store in Thousand Oaks) to $6.97 
for two ounces (a Neoteric Cosmetics Product at Oxnard's Wal-Mart). 
</P>
<P>
 We found a Jason Natural Cosmetics night-time moisturizer at $25 for one 
ounce, and a Nonie of Beverly Hills all-natural skin cleanser at $10.95 for 
about seven ounces, both at Lassen's Health Foods store in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura K mart, we saw a Maybelline cream for $11.11 for two ounces; a 
Tri-Alpha Hydroxy Fruit Acid formula cream from Loreal for $10.99 for 1.4 
ounces; and a Pond's brand "age-defying complex" at $10.99 for two ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the wide price differences? Well, some of the AHA products contain 
collagen; others have aloe vera -- the whole list of ingredients can vary 
considerably. And, of course, one would expect to pay more for a name brand at 
a name store than for a little-known brand at a discount shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think the more expensive it is, the better it is necessarily," 
said Dr. Ralph Kamell, a Thousand Oaks dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to effectiveness, with regard to skin-peeling ability, he said, is not 
the additional ingredients or the name of the cosmetic manufacturer. Rather, 
it's the concentration of the alpha hydroxy acids in the product. Some may 
contain as little as a 2% concentration; others may have 8% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight percent will peel off more skin than 2%," Kamell said. "The biggest 
problem is that the cosmetics in department stores don't always specify on the 
container the percentage of alpha hydroxy acids in the products. As a result, 
you may find a 2% glycolic acid selling for more than one with 8%." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, Rohrbacher said, you'll generally find a lower range of 
concentration of AHA in cosmetics at department stores. "Avon, Clinique, Este 
Lauder are about 3% to 5% because they want to keep it a cosmetic. If it's too 
high a percentage, the FDA will get involved and then the product crosses over 
into the medical arena, where it could be regulated." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the commercial end of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But another way to go with AHAs would be prescription products, the hard 
stuff. Rohrbacher said most dermatologists tend to start their patients off 
with an 8% to 10% concentration. "We've seen very little adverse sensitivity, 
or severe types of reactions, at that level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concentrations even go into the 15% to 20% range. Rohrbacher said her 
dermatology office sells a brand by Therapeutic Products that costs about $20 
for eight ounces. The price varies depending on the strength of the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmmmm. (A comment indicating thoughtful consideration of an involved, 
confusing topic.)

JAUNTS; SERIOUS COOKS SPICE UP COMPETITION; CHEFS FROM THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHLAND 
WILL GATHER SATURDAY FOR THE FIFTH ANNUAL PORT HUENEME CHILI FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Making chili may not sound like a spectator sport. But if you come around to a 
sanctioned chili competition, you'll get a whole new perspective on that zesty 
concoction. 
</P>
<P>
 You can do just that Saturday when chili chefs from Ventura County and the 
Southland face off in a gastronomical contest of secret spices during the fifth 
annual Port Hueneme Chili Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who thought that chili was just, well, chili, this has all 
the serious competitiveness of professional sports. First of all, the top prize 
is $500, but more importantly, the winner moves on to a regional competition 
sanctioned by the International Chili Society. From there, who knows, maybe a 
shot at the Chili World Championship in Reno in October, where the top prize is 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are serious chili cooks," said Don Leach, a Thousand Oaks attorney and 
chili judge the last 14 years. "Some of them are putting out $100 just for the 
ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach knows his way around a chili bowl. He judges about 20 chili competitions 
a year and has been chief judge for the Port Hueneme cook-off since its 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 6,000 people attended the festival at Hueneme Beach Park, 
sampling chili and other goodies, listening to live music and taking in the 
beach scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chili scene is something else entirely. The chefs may be serious about 
their grub, but they have a sense of humor and a flair for shtick. Their 
cooking booths are sometimes duded up in zany themes, like an Old West motif. 
They dub their creations names like Crazy Horse Chili, Big Dog Kibbled Chili, 
Cactus Jack Chili and Gas, and one dubious concoction called Road Kill Chili. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival runs from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. The chefs must prepare and cook 
their chili there, Leach said. They can't use precooked ingredients, and beans 
of any kind are a no-no. The chefs simmer their chili on Coleman-style 
propane-fueled stoves for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. The judges -- more than 20 in all, 
including some celebrity judges -- make their selections about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes for a winning bowl of chili? According to Leach: "If you could only 
eat one food the rest of your life, which bowl of chili would you choose?" Hot 
is not necessarily good, he said. It all comes down to the perfect blend of 
spices -- cumin, garlic, Tabasco, maybe some oregano, and who knows what else. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want them all to come together," Leach said. Some chefs are so fussy 
about their spices that they go out of state for them. "But if the chili tastes 
unusual and odd, it doesn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Meat is another issue. Some chefs prefer tri-tip, while others go for chuck 
steak, rump roast, sirloin or good old hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest for that prize-winning chili has taken Joel Erickson to at least 20 
competitions a year. The Thousand Oaks software engineer has even simmered his 
chili in North Dakota and Minnesota in hopes of winning a berth in the Chili 
World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably quit if I go to the World," he joked. He took fourth place last 
year in Port Hueneme and he's entered again this year under his banner, The 
Dorset Gulch Chili Gang. 
</P>
<P>
 His recipe is one that has taken him a long time to perfect. He uses good 
tri-tip and his own blend of seasonings. He doesn't tinker with it much. 
</P>
<P>
 His advice? "If you get a good recipe, stick with it." Details

FOR THE KIDS; ANNUAL EXTRAVAGANZA TURNS MALL INTO YOUNGSTERS' PARADISE; NONSTOP 
WHIRL OF MUSIC, ACTIVITIES AND EXHIBITS IN THOUSAND OAKS FEATURES PERFORMERS 
WHO WON'T TURN OFF PARENTS.

<P>
 This weekend is a good time to be a kid. Especially if you drop by The Oaks 
shopping center for its Kid's World '94, a three-day entertainment 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 This free, nonstop whirl of music, hands-on activities and exhibits has kid 
written all over it. But the lineup of entertainment features artists who won't 
turn off parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the ninth year the Thousand Oaks mall has offered Kid's World. It 
starts Friday at 10 a.m. and runs through Sunday at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a tremendous crowd," said Diane Boyd, spokeswoman for the mall. A lot 
of the appeal is that families can see top performers for free, instead of 
paying the usual concert admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of entertainers perform regularly at the mall during its Thursday O.K. 
(Oaks Kids) Club, but some are new, like singer Hazel Payne who performs twice 
on Friday at 4 and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne was part of the pop musical duo, "A Taste of Honey," during the late 
1970s and '80s. Their song "Boogie Oogie Oogie" was a hit in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the music business since the dawn of disco," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne left the music business in the early '80s to concentrate on her family 
-- she has five children, the youngest 8 years old. Two years ago, she got back 
into the music business -- this time performing for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne is very recognizable. Her signature outfit is boxer shorts, baseball 
jacket, and Converse high-tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told I'm very energetic on stage," she said. "I have a tendency to 
be here, there and everywhere. I go out into the audience. I get the children 
involved in the music." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the material is her own, said Payne, who plays electric 
guitar. She delivers a positive message about self-esteem and character, as in 
her number called, "Do Your Best," based on the old tortoise and hare fable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into children's music was a natural for her, she said. "I always made 
up songs when my children were little. If I was going to teach them something, 
it was in song." 
</P>
<P>
 Also performing Friday, at 5 p.m., is Caren Glasser, an O.K. Club regular and 
emcee. She'll be taking the stage on Saturday and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Mark 
Beckwith, a singer and guitarist who appeals especially to preschoolers, 
performs at 1 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the shows are hourly beginning at 11:30 a.m. with the Scott Land 
Marionettes, which also appear at 1:30 p.m. Look-alikes Janet & Judy, a 
fast-moving duo who appeal to older kids, take the stage at 12:30 and 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Dan Crow and his Thunderwear Band liven things up at 1:30 and 3:30 
p.m. All the concerts are in the mall, near the Broadway store. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Kid's World also features a safety theme, with exhibits by fire, 
police and ambulance crews. Parents can have their children fingerprinted on 
Saturday and Sunday from noon to 3 p.m. If children bring in their old 
toothbrush they can get a new one, courtesy of the Santa Barbara/Ventura County 
Dental Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Arroyo Vista Recreation Center has a special deal for teen-agers. 
The center will offer an "open gym" for youths 11 and older on Fridays from 3 
to 9 p.m. This is a chance to shoot baskets and play volleyball. Equipment is 
available at the center. For information, call 531-9100. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Kid's World '94, three days of entertainment and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday, 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: The Oaks shopping center, 222 W. Hillcrest Drive, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 495-2031.

FASHION; VESTS PUT COOL TO THE TEST; DESPITE THE HEAT, THE GARMENTS FROM 
MENSWEAR WIN OVER WOMEN. BUT IT'S THE MULTI-POCKET VERSION THAT MAY ENDURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dog days of summer, as temperatures soar, feminine fashion proudly 
parades the vest. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend makes little sense -- until you come to know fashion's rules, as we 
have. Some of its tenets are: You can't go wrong copying menswear. Form should 
not follow function. Weather doesn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Manhattan, the high court of fashion injunction, vest wearers are 
sweltering in the streets. Of course, they have the keen satisfaction of 
dropping to the pavement in style. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, vests were launched last year as an accessory before the fact. But 
with summer's progress they have, like zucchini, come into their own with a 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs, boardrooms and chili cook-offs are choked with women foregoing 
decolletage for the three-piece look -- or, for vests over T-shirts, over long 
trailing shirts, or, less often, directly over underclothes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, we defy you to get through a local supermarket without encountering a 
vested woman. 
</P>
<P>
 To check the garments' universality, we surveyed Barbara Bowman stores in 
Ojai, and Target stores. At the former, vests accompanied almost half of the 
outfits in the shop. They come in tasteful earth tones in knits and embroidered 
fabrics, and tend to run into three figures. We were taken by a tweedy knit 
bolero number at $210, which is trimmed with unmatched buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 When we pointed out to sales associate B.J. Ray that vests didn't seem 
summery, he said, coolly, "We are suggesting them instead of a jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the latest trend is the long vest, sometimes teamed with short 
jackets and pants to create a three-tiered look. The thigh-length vest is 
appreciated by many women because, he said, "it hides certain critical areas." 
</P>
<P>
 At Target, in contrast, the vests were short and bold and less than $15. 
Tartan plaids were the tamest pattern, outnumbered by wild prints such as 
watermelon slices and sunflowers that would put Van Gogh to shame, and a peppy 
Flintstone number. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tell that a style has reached a universal phase when it has sub-plots 
such as these. We can picture vests becoming so common that, like neckties for 
men, they will be required for working at Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, women's clothing could fade to neutral grays, browns and creams, and be 
worn for decades, saving countless hours of shopping. Only the vest would be 
routinely replaced, reflecting trends such as the daring see-through vest, 
alternating with swings to demure houndstooth button-to-the-collar models. 
Additional excitement could be added by raising and lowering vest hemlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if these developments are too radical to gain favor, we can see another 
practical vest application, which somehow designers have overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 This is so obvious, it will probably be out there next season -- so, this 
amounts to a fashion scoop -- no, make that a fashion innovation. And remember 
where you read it. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, women have a number of essential items they carry with them at 
all times, such as (but by no means limited to) car keys. They do not wish to 
stuff these objects into their hip pockets as men do. So, they are tied to a 
handbag, making them appear dependent and insecure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a shoulder strap, bags are hefty, awkward and vulnerable should 
their owners put them down to dance. To solve the problem, some women have 
turned to the kangaroo-ish belly pack -- but we're thinking of something with a 
little more panache. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is right under woman's collective nose -- the vest! 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need to create a vest with pockets for valuables. Already on the 
market are versatile sports vests with room to spare for things the '90s woman 
totes. We found them at Sports Chalet in Oxnard in muted tones of khaki and 
olive. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite model had pockets enough for credit cards, checkbook, driving 
gloves and lunch, and also featured little sewn-on rings for hanging often-used 
items at the ready. Fishermen, it seems, like to use them for a line clipper 
and a tube of Fly Rise -- a sort of silicone gunk that makes fishing flies 
float. We can imagine lots of things a woman might pinion to her chest: a road 
map; earphones, maybe a can of pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nice feature is a woolly patch intended for hooking flies to one's 
chest. This would lend itself to attaching spare earring backs, or pinning 
those pesky parking stubs that tend to elude one at exit gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaki and olive happen to be big colors this season. But, should someone need 
a wider choice, Big 5 has similar hunting vests in Blaze Orange -- an excellent 
choice for meeting someone in a crowd -- or Mossy Oak, which is someone's 
clever term for traditional camouflage. This seems less useful in social 
situations, but it could come in handy for hostile corporate takeovers. Kind of 
intimidating -- especially with the still popular combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why not go avant garde? These garments will no doubt rise in price when 
the new trend catches on. You can now get in on the bottom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, your hands will be free for those activities you have missed while 
lugging a purse: filling plates with canapes; catching fly balls in the stands; 
fending off passes in elevators. And, a particularly useful move in the weeks 
to come: adjusting sweatbands.

THEATER REVIEW; AUDIENCE GETS TAKEN FOR GREAT RIDE; MUSICAL ABOUT CIRCUS 
MEISTER'S STORIED LIFE BURSTS WITH ENERGY AND HOLDS AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION 
DESPITE LACK OF SUBSTANCE.

 When you stop to think about it, it may not be the greatest show on earth, but 
"Barnum," the energetic musical loosely based on the life of the preeminent 
19th-Century American showman, sets out to ensure that you never get the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the safety net of a particularly deep or engrossing story, the 
show offers enough visual sleights of hand to divert even the most discerning 
intellects. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, that's entirely appropriate -- spectacle, rather than substance, was 
the flashy signature throughout Phineas Taylor Barnum's checkered career as a 
street peddler, museum curator, road show impresario, politician and circus 
meister. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for this last incarnation that P. T. Barnum is best remembered today, 
and so the show's conceit is to decorate this unabashedly fanciful biography 
with an ensemble of carnival performers -- clowns, jugglers, acrobats and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, director Jack Shouse and choreographer Michael Barnard have made the 
most of the strengths of "Barnum" with a vibrant, colorful staging for PCPA 
Theaterfest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center ring is Gregg Coffin's engaging performance in the title role. 
Part visionary, part con man, and the supreme embodiment of our uniquely 
American brand of cheerful cynicism, Barnum parlayed his optimistic philosophy 
that "there's a sucker born every minute" into fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 But he practiced his "Art of the Humbug" on such a grandiose scale that even 
his marks appreciated it as they were being taken. From his early inspiration 
to exhibit an allegedly 160-year-old woman as "George Washington's nurse" to 
the exaggerated claims that he made about his museum curiosities and touring 
attractions, Barnum refused to let his imagination be bound by the conventional 
tightrope of propriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed aloft by first-rate singing and dancing acrobatics, Coffin treads 
Barnum's moral ambiguities with the greatest of ease, combining irresistible 
wide-eyed exuberance, quick wit and a self-deprecating amusement at his own 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of bland accuracy, he offers the alchemy of thrills and excitement. 
Consciously articulating this stance to his sober, conservative wife, Charity 
(Kitty Balay), in "The Colors of My Life," Barnum transforms the everyday world 
with corny magic tricks as he sings, turning lemonade into red wine and a white 
napkin into a crimson scarf. In the later "Black and White," after trying to 
abide by traditional politics, Barnum's drab mayoral campaign bursts 
hilariously into peacock bloom -- and victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of Mark Bramble's book and Michael Stewart's lyrics is to play the 
gaudy hues of Barnum's life against the muted grays of placid Americana, but 
that social backdrop isn't defined clearly enough to allow for an engaging 
dynamic (such as Meredith Willson achieved with the similarly themed "The Music 
Man," for example). 
</P>
<P>
 "Barnum" is all foreground, right down to Cy Coleman's brassy, big top score, 
which barely lets the few serious moments register before revving back up to 
high-wire pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, the show must go on -- which it does with delightful spunk. But 
after the fat lady sings, don't be surprised if you find yourself wondering if 
you've been taken at some level, like so many of P. T. Barnum's patrons before 
you. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Barnum." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Aug. 13, Wednesdays through Sundays at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Festival Theatre, 420 2nd St., Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $12 to $18.

MUSIC; BAND HAS DEEP ROOTS IN SANTA BARBARA FIESTA; SPENCER THE GARDENER, 
FORMED IN 1989, WILL PLAY FIVE TIMES DURING ANNUAL EVENT ON STATE STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Santa Barbara Fiesta is just an excuse to party, as if party animals 
needed a bigger incentive. The annual wingding will essentially make State 
Street a parking lot, as revelers bar hop down the main drag to see just about 
every band in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Barnitz, of Spencer the Gardener, loves Fiesta time. Someone must love 
his band, too -- they're playing five times during the celebration, including 
opening day, which was Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Fiesta," Barnitz said during a phone interview. "Some people really 
don't like it because it's tourist-oriented, and it's very crowded, but I don't 
necessarily have to wait in line, so I don't care about that. Fiesta is a 
longstanding tradition. My mom used to get into it, and so did my grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like STG has been around as long as the Fiesta itself, but the band 
has only been going since 1989, with a year off following a gnarly traffic 
accident that nearly put the band into the past tense. STG, a band that seems 
synonymous with the Santa Barbara scene, actually plays their hometown but a 
few times a month, except for Fiesta week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a lot of good bands in town, but I haven't seen too many of 
them because we're always playing," said Barnitz. 
</P>
<P>
 While STG keeps chugging along, other bands come and go, while a few get 
signed. Toad the Wet Sprocket, which started a bit before STG, just released 
its fourth album on Columbia. Ugly Kid Joe is signed to Polygram, and Dishwalla 
has a new one coming out on A&M. None of this seems to matter to Barnitz, who 
doesn't have a jealous bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that stresses me at all, and in one sense I can understand," he said. 
"Record company people are looking for bands that will fill stadiums. They want 
to know what their fan base is. I think they think we're a great band, kinda 
surfy -- but will it play in Ohio? 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, no one in Santa Barbara is overly competitive, and bands congratulate 
each other on their success, and mean it. I'm very happy for all those bands 
that got signed, but I think there's a lot of great bands that'll never get 
signed." 
</P>
<P>
 So, STG continues to do it their way. They have three albums on two CDs, with 
a fourth in the works. That equates to 33 songs recorded with a lot more in the 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we've signed ourselves," said Barnitz. "We've had lots of 
inquiries in the past, but essentially, we've never had an offer worth taking. 
Independent companies have talked to us, but have never offered us enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recently got a distribution deal from a friend who used to work for a 
record company. He has a lot of companies that he gives product to, so our 
stuff will be in a lot of stores soon." 
</P>
<P>
 STG was the first local band to be a hit in both Ventura and Santa Barbara, 
and has since expanded its horizons considerably and put some serious miles on 
the camper. The band goes to the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, Chico and 
Lake Tahoe and as far south as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year at this time, I set up a tour across the country," said Barnitz. 
"Some of the band members decided they didn't want to travel -- they weren't 
ready to go out for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 So some of them left the group, leaving behind the serious hard-cores. Besides 
Barnitz, they include original members Nate Birkey on trumpet and John 
Schnackenberg on sax. Cougar Estrada is on drums, Brian Fox on bass and Dave 
Hetrick on percussion. But no matter who plays, dancers love this band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same as before," said Barnitz. "Big band spy movie music set on a 
tropical beach, with revolving members." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnitz has been doing the rock 'n' roll thing pretty much since he graduated 
from Santa Barbara High School. His first band, called All Night Longo, was 
followed by pop rock group, the Tan. Then there was the Wedding Band, which is 
temporarily on vacation, followed by the Gardener band, inspired by Barnitz, 
who once had a real job as a landscaper. Whether he knows a rhododendron from a 
ranunculus is unclear, but Barnitz knows what a good song should sound like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it all goes back to when my dad died," Barnitz said. "I had a choice 
of two things: get a $2,000 inheritance or part of a nursery. I took the money 
and bought a guitar and an amp. That was the first big mistake in my life."

 Sip and nibble. Sip and nibble. 
</P>
<P>
 That should be about the most strenuous exercise guests will be expected to 
perform at Ventura's Leeward Winery on Saturday and Sunday during the third 
annual "Taste of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 The function is intended to illustrate the impact Ventura County has on the 
agricultural industry. So, along with samplings of the Leeward wine, folks can 
try raspberries and strawberries from Driscoll Farms of Oxnard; organic dried 
apricots from Hall Ranch in Ojai; baby carrots, sweet corn and mixed salad from 
Underwood Ranch in Somis; and mushrooms (sauteed in wine, butter and garlic) 
from Pictsweet Mushroom Farms in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWayne Boccali of Boccali's Restaurant will bring along some of his fresh 
tomatoes, grown in a garden behind his establishment, and The Chart House 
people will prepare a Caesar salad. The event will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
both days. Admission is free. The winery is at 2784 Johnson Drive in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For another example of the county's agricultural impact, don't forget the 27th 
Santa Paula Citrus Festival from Friday through Sunday along Main Street, off 
the 10th Street exit of Highway 126. There will be a farmers' market at the 
Veteran's Memorial Park from 8 a.m. to noon Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>

<P>
 About a month ago, Irvine's trendy Zuni Grill was dramatically transformed 
into a down-home, family-style restaurant called Saddlerock Ranch. The new 
place is the first of what is expected to be a chain of about 10 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's that have to do with the local scene? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at Ventura County and Agoura Hills as our next locations," said 
Harold Herrmann, the chain's director of operations. "We are very committed to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddlerock Ranch offers a "grass-roots style of cooking," said Herrmann. "The 
food is very Americana -- roast turkey, meat loaf, steaks, hamburgers, brisket, 
vegetarian dishes, cream corn, corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese. Very, very 
straightforward cooking that people can recognize."

POLICE FOCUS ON STALKING MOTIVE IN SIMPSON CASE; CRIME: EX-WIFE'S 
ANSWERING-MACHINE TAPES SEIZED, FRIENDS INTERVIEWED. EXPERTS CITE NEED TO GIVE 
REASON FOR KILLINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives are interviewing friends and associates of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and have seized copies of answering-machine tapes from her 
home in an effort to establish that O.J. Simpson pursued his ex-wife with the 
vengeance of a stalker and that her murder on June 12 was the final act of that 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 During last month's preliminary hearing for Simpson, prosecutors homed in on 
his means and opportunity to commit the double murder in Brentwood -- chipping 
away at his alibi, for instance, and introducing evidence that he had bought a 
knife weeks before the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did not address a provocative question in the case: If Simpson did 
commit the murders, as they allege, what was his motive? 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution is not legally obligated to prove motive in order to get a 
conviction," said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson. "But a question 
jurors always have is: 'Why would someone do such a terrible thing?' . . . 
Because people think they know O.J. Simpson, and the O.J. Simpson they know 
would never do such a terrible thing, it will be crucial for the prosecutors to 
answer that question." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders, and his legal team has accused 
authorities of failing to pursue leads that point to other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalking theory against Simpson was most elaborately detailed in the June 
21 grand jury testimony of Keith D. Zlomsowitch, who briefly dated Nicole 
Simpson in 1992. He told grand jurors that Simpson pursued the couple during 
that time, showing up at restaurants where they were dining and once spying on 
them through a window while the two were having an intimate encounter on Nicole 
Simpson's couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch said he felt threatened and intimidated by Simpson's actions, 
particularly when Simpson confronted him as he was massaging Nicole Simpson's 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zlomsowitch's testimony could form an important element of the motive 
case against Simpson, he is not the only person who has been interviewed about 
the troubled relationship between O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the case, several of Nicole Simpson's 
friends have been questioned about whether they have knowledge regarding 
allegations of abuse. Louis Brown, Nicole Simpson's father, said Wednesday that 
he and other family members have been in regular contact with authorities and 
expect to be officially interviewed at some point, but have not been yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also have launched an exhaustive search for records of calls for help 
at Simpson's home, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have been a really good friend (of Nicole) and not have been 
around when O.J. would show up" uninvited, one friend of Nicole Simpson said. 
"He would come to the table (at a public place), for example, and make his 
presence known -- make comments until one of us made some comment back, like, 
'C'mon O.J., don't do this.' Then he'd sit there and stare at her till we all 
felt uncomfortable enough to leave. It wasn't like an 'Oh, poor O.J.' stare. It 
was like, 'I'm watching you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other friends of Simpson's slain ex-wife said authorities had seized the tapes 
from her telephone answering machine, which she would use to screen his 
unwanted telephone calls "when he wasn't doing well and she didn't want to deal 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was O.J.'s style to go on and on and on," one friend said. If Nicole 
Simpson refused to pick up the phone, the friend added, he would leave long 
messages on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 As prosecutors weigh the evidence regarding motive, they confront several 
potential pitfalls, experts said. If their evidence falls short of proving a 
motive, the failed effort might make jurors suspicious of the entire case, 
legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is no guarantee that Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
would allow prosecutors to introduce certain kinds of evidence indicating 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general rule, courts will not admit evidence of prior bad acts, commonly 
referred to as character evidence. However, courts in some circumstances will 
admit evidence of such prior acts if they can be used to show motive. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, such evidence might include Zlomsowitch's testimony and tapes of 
911 calls in which Nicole Simpson pleaded for help because a man she identified 
as her ex-husband was threatening her. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the "stalking evidence" or the 911 tapes admitted, Levenson said, the 
prosecutors would first have to show that the acts are relevant to the murder 
and then show that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its possible 
prejudicial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But if prosecutors do not address the issue of motive, that too has risks. 
Barry Levin, an experienced criminal defense attorney, noted that California 
allows jurors to infer innocence from the absence of any evidence about motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motive is powerful evidence for the prosecution," Levin said. "The absence of 
motive is powerful evidence for the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 As the police canvass Nicole Simpson's friends for clues about her 
relationship with her ex-husband, some of those friends are taking action of 
their own. Robert W. Peterson, the owner of a Denver private investigative 
agency, said Wednesday that he has been retained by a group of clients calling 
itself simply: "Friends of Nicole." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said his backers wish to remain anonymous but have instructed him to 
turn over to authorities any information he uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the brief time that he has been working on the case, Peterson said he has 
talked to witnesses who have information regarding the relationship between 
O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife. One witness described shouting matches in 
restaurants and other public places, the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness is one of several who have been questioned by police and who have 
said that Nicole Simpson was afraid of her ex-husband, Peterson added. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept on as good terms as she could with him," Peterson said. "But she was 
scared to death of him." 
</P>
<P>

report.

NEWS ANALYSIS; GAINS OF MTA, UNION DON'T MATCH STRIKE TOLL ON RIDERS; TRANSIT: 
NINE-DAY WALKOUT REVEALS POWERLESSNESS OF THOSE WHO RELY ON BUSES. LOCAL 
BUSINESSES ALSO SUFFERED.

<P>
 As the Metropolitan Transportation Authority put three-quarters of its buses 
back on the road Wednesday after a nine-day strike, sobering lessons emerged 
from the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that the MTA and its striking mechanics achieved painfully little 
compared to the agony the strike caused for half a million virtually stranded 
bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike cost the local economy $18 million, according to county analysts -- 
twice as much as the MTA will save during the three years of the new labor 
contract for its 1,900 mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in the months ahead, agency officials expect to encounter 
uncalculated costs. For example, the combined effects of the strike and a Sept. 
1 fare increase are expected to cut ridership by almost 15% this fall -- and 
some of that loss may be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 The second lesson of the strike is that Los Angeles' mass transit riders -- 
most of whom earn less than $15,000 a year -- are a politically powerless 
group, especially in contrast to those of other U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In other mass-transit-dependent cities, where the automobile is less crucial 
to survival, far more people at various income levels would be affected by a 
transit strike -- and far more political pressure would have been wielded to 
prevent one, or to settle it with more urgency, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, at one point in the MTA strike last week, talks adjourned for 2 
1/2 days with no political outcry. And there was little public dismay when Gov. 
Pete Wilson refused to order a 60-day cooling-off period that would have 
prevented a strike or cut it short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles, while it certainly depends on the transit system, it's not like 
Manhattan. It's not like Chicago, or Boston, or even Washington, D.C., which 
have highly developed rail systems that are well established, that people 
depend on," said Jack Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public 
Transit Assn. and a former general manager of the now-defunct Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. "The more dependence there is on the transit 
system, the less likely you are to have these long and devastating strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York and other major cities, transportation serves a large economic 
swath of the population: lawyers, janitors, factory laborers and students board 
the subways and buses. In addition, New York state law -- unlike California's 
-- prohibits municipal transit employees from going on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's labor unions evolved from those of the powerful railroad workers. 
When the private bus carriers and old trolley lines were taken over in the 
1950s by a new public entity, the transit unions secured a waiver from the 
California Legislature that made them exempt from a ban on strikes by 
"essential" public employees, such as police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more pressure on the political establishment (in New York) to 
make such a strike difficult," said Jared Lebow, a spokesman for New York City 
Transit. 
</P>
<P>
 When New York transit workers broke the law and held an 11-day walkout in 
April, 1980, the punishment was quick and severe: Union members were docked pay 
for 22 days and the unions themselves were fined several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where the majority of workers commute by automobile, 
victims of a transit strike are virtually voiceless. According to a transit 
agency study, 61% of Los Angeles bus riders earn less than $15,000 and only 5% 
make more than $50,000. Studies show that low-income people are less likely to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, with little public pressure to settle the MTA strike, "we faced a 
situation in which the agency and union both pursued their own interests at the 
expense of riders," said James Moore, associate professor of urban planning and 
co-director of USC's Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, politics began to snowball. The governor heeded the 
request of the MTA board not to intervene, despite a brief attack by state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for governor. Had Wilson 
demanded the 60-day cooling-off period, it would have potentially postponed a 
transit strike until September -- a time closer to the November election, and a 
time when a broader cross-section of bus riders might be affected: In 
September, hundreds of thousands of students use buses to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Brown's complaints were nothing but "a one-day story," said Rich 
Lichtenstein, a political consultant and lobbyist. "The MTA bus strike will be 
long forgotten by the time the elections roll around. . . . When do you want 
the impact of a strike? From the point of . . . the gubernatorial campaign, 
you'd much rather have it in the quiet of the summer when it will receive much 
less attention than in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 The riders' interests also paled beside internal politics on both sides of the 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one side, Mike Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, 
representing the mechanics, is up for reelection in November -- a fact some say 
made it imperative that he take a tough stance. Bujosa was also under pressure 
to flex the union's muscle in response to the MTA's decision last month to cut 
costs by laying off 83 mechanics while negotiations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing could not have been worse," said one MTA official. Here was a 
union head backed into a corner: negotiating with an agency pledging not to lay 
off workers -- even though it had just axed 83 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the MTA's side, the agency -- which had faced an operating shortfall of 
$175 million -- has come under increasing pressure to balance its books. Toward 
that end, the drumbeat for subcontracting -- or hiring private companies for 
work previously performed in-house -- became louder and louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to resolve their differences, both sides agreed to set up a joint 
union-management committee that will review all controversial subcontracts. 
When the union wants to keep a contract in-house, it must show that its members 
can do the work for the same or better price than a private-sector competitor. 
In the cases of a dispute, the committee will step in. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution to the transit strike was not about hourly wages. Yet it caused 
financial ripples throughout Los Angeles as a significant slice of the county's 
work force found it nearly impossible to show up for work on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist with the county's Economic Development Corp., 
estimated that the strike cost the local economy $2 million a day -- or a total 
of $18 million for the nine-day walkout. In addition to riders, the restaurant 
and hotel industry -- as well as merchants who depend on transit-dependent 
customers -- suffered disruptions and business losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the demographics of people who ride the bus. They are . . . working 
in industries where if they miss a day, it won't be made up to them," Kyser 
said. "There were so many different constituencies affected."

PANEL URGES U.S. DATABASE TO VERIFY WORKERS' STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform urged the Clinton Administration on 
Wednesday to establish an experimental program to verify worker eligibility 
through a computerized registry based on Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year pilot project would be set up in five states heavily affected 
by immigration, including California, and would seek to determine the best and 
fairest way to check a job applicant's identity -- whether through tamper-proof 
Social Security cards, driver's licenses, a telephone verification system or 
other methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would rely on data provided by the Social Security Administration 
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The other states involved in 
the project would be Texas, Illinois, New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation immediately stirred up old debates over the threats to 
civil liberties such a national identification system might pose. Congress has 
considered workplace verification at least twice before but has backed away in 
the face of strong opposition from civil rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the immigration issue has come to a boil across the country, finding 
ways to deter the hiring of illegal immigrants has risen to new prominence. The 
bipartisan federal commission's recommendation is certain to give the 
verification system plan an infusion of political respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very interesting proposal, one that we would like to look at closer 
when they have fleshed it out," said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. "It is not inconsistent with efforts 
that we're making to improve employer verification methods." 
</P>
<P>
 The President has the power to create such a program under authority granted 
him in a 1986 immigration law, the commission said, but Congress probably would 
have to appropriate sizable funds to develop and support an effective data 
tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should stop talking about this issue and start testing some new approaches 
along this line," said former Texas Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan, chairwoman 
of the commission, which presented a preview of its upcoming report to the 
Senate subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (a) number goes into the registry and it shows up bogus, that is the 
answer. Can we enhance the credibility and integrity of the Social Security 
number? Maybe. Maybe not. But we need to find out," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil liberty and minority groups immediately attacked the plan as being 
impractical, costly and inimical to the rights of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "A national registry system, even as a pilot project, is a ludicrous and 
unreasonable way to solve an immigration issue," said Denyse Sabagh, an officer 
of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. "The commission would be better 
served . . . if it focused on more positive approaches to manage immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council of La Raza, the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, the Organization of Chinese Americans and the National Jewish 
Community Relations Advisory Council all registered their opposition to the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test project is merely a launching pad for a national computer registry 
and a de facto ID card system," said Lucas Guttentag, an immigration specialist 
for the American Civil Liberties Union. "A national ID card is an old idea and 
a bad one." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, well-prepared for the civil libertarian opposition, departed from her 
prepared remarks to offer a "personal note." 
</P>
<P>
 "I, as chair of this commission, would not be a party to any system that I 
felt was an unpardonable intrusion into the private lives of people. If I felt 
that what we are recommending would be such an intrusion I can assure you that 
recommendation would never have seen the light of day, not even as a pilot 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan emphasized that the commission was proposing to add only one additional 
step to the existing work application procedure. All workers already must have 
a Social Security number and all employers must ask for it, she said. The 
commission is urging that a system be established to verify that the person to 
be hired actually has the Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program would allow the five states to experiment with various 
techniques and procedures for tying in to the federal database. The commission 
would analyze the results and incorporate its findings into its final report, 
due in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, employers are required to obtain proof of citizenship or 
legal residency before hiring an employee. But the current system allows more 
than two dozen different documents to prove authenticity and is rife with 
counterfeit cards and fraud. Judiciary Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) questioned the accuracy of the INS database. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it problematic to rely on a faulty database for verification of 
employment authorization?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan replied that it would not be if the government were willing to spend 
the money to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The verification plan was the most controversial recommendation of the 
nine-member commission, which was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. 
The group has been working two years on a comprehensive report to Congress on 
how the law is working and must deliver an interim report by Sept. 30. Jordan's 
remarks Wednesday were a summary of the commission's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also is urging the Border Patrol to rely on a policy of 
preventing illegal immigration, rather than trying to apprehend immigrants once 
they have entered the United States. The commission was impressed by the 
success of Operation Hold-the-Line, a experimental strategy employed in El Paso 
that deploys agents in saturation strength at the border. The commission also 
is considering a user fee for border-crossers to provide additional funds for 
border management. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of public benefits, the commission said illegal immigrants should 
be ineligible for any federally funded benefits, except for health or safety 
concerns such as immunizations and child nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission recommended that legal immigrants continue to be eligible 
for assistance programs, based on need. The members strongly endorsed plans to 
ensure that sponsors become financially responsible for immigrants brought into 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recommendation of particular resonance to California, the commission 
endorsed a short-term authorization of financial aid to states most affected by 
the costs of illegal immigration. But the commission was careful to tie the aid 
to more reliable data from the states, and an agreement that states would not 
become dependent on the money and would cooperate in the enforcement of federal 
immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactions of the senators in the hearing room were positive, although 
Kennedy and Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), veterans of hard-won immigration 
legislation in 1986 and 1990, know that political consensus is hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), whose immigration legislation incorporates 
some of the commission proposals, said she "agreed with virtually everything 
(Jordan) said." How It Would Work 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal outlined Wednesday by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, 
five states including California would be part of a pilot project to determine 
the best way to tie into a federal database to verify the status of work 
applicants. The goal is to weed out illegal immigrants or those not authorized 
to work in this country. The current system is rife with fraud and counterfeit 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, when you apply for a job: 
</P>
<P>
 * An employer would ask for a Social Security number -- just as before. 
</P>
<P>
 * But to verify that the applicant is actually the person who was issued that 
number, employers would query a federal database combining records from the 
Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * The database would alert employers to applicants with multiple Social 
Security numbers, or numbers with multiple names. 
</P>
<P>
 * If an applicant is flagged, states in the pilot program might use new 
techniques to determine the worker's authenticity. These experimental methods 
might include telephone verification -- much like a credit card, 
counterfeit-resistant driver's licenses or tamper-proof Social Security cards. 
</P>
<P>
 * After three years, if successful verification systems are developed, they 
would be adopted nationally.

CLINTON ASSAILS HEALTH CARE FOES; PRESIDENCY: GOP IS ACCUSED OF REBUFFING 
EFFORTS AT COMPROMISE. HE STRONGLY DEFENDS MITCHELL'S REFORM BILL AS MEETING 
TESTS OF POLITICAL REALITY AND PRACTICAL IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton defended his health care reform efforts against criticism 
from both right and left Wednesday night -- accusing Republicans of repeatedly 
evading efforts at compromise and saying that the bill proposed by Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine should be good enough to satisfy 
liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton strongly defended Mitchell's effort, which some Democratic liberals -- 
particularly in the House -- have criticized. These critics have said that 
Mitchell's bill falls short of the goal of covering all Americans. But the 
President argued that it meets the tests of both political reality and 
practical impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it will achieve universal coverage for all Americans and that is 
the one criterion I have set out," Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mitchell's bill, employers would not be required to provide coverage for 
all workers if a combination of insurance reforms and subsidies succeeded in 
covering 95% of Americans by the year 2000. If the 95% goal is not met, a 
mandate would be applied state-by-state. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics on the left have argued that the 95% goal falls short of universal 
coverage. But Clinton denied that, saying -- if the 95% goal can be met -- 
"that is evidence that we can achieve full coverage in the near future" without 
resorting to a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the debate over whether Mitchell's 95% constitutes universal coverage 
has attracted considerable attention in Washington, as a practical matter the 
question may be moot. All health care analysts agree that a small percentage of 
the population would fall through the cracks in any program, even one that in 
theory mandated 100% coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as Republicans have warned, Clinton and his aides hope that -- if 
the Mitchell bill or something like it gets through the Senate -- it could be 
melded with a more liberal House bill into a somewhat broader package. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Mitchell, Clinton sought to inject a note of political realism into 
the discussion. "Remember how a bill becomes a law," he admonished reporters. 
"Sen. Mitchell has to find a majority for a bill that can pass the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate task is very hard," he said, adding that Mitchell "has done a fine 
job with a bill that I personally believe will reach universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan I originally proposed has been changed and much of it for the 
better," Clinton said -- an unusual admission for a President on a major 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had scheduled his prime time press conference, only the third such 
night-time session in his 18 months in office, in hopes that he could bolster 
public support for his health reform initiatives -- in part by reminding 
Americans of successes he has had elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, White House officials initially had thought of scheduling a prime time 
speech, opting for the press conference only after indications that the 
commercial television networks would not have given live coverage to a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-minute statement that opened the nearly hourlong questioning, 
Clinton recounted his claims of progress, saying that the economy had improved 
on his watch and "the road ahead looks good." 
</P>
<P>
 As he did so, Clinton also tried to undermine the credibility of his 
Republican opponents, accusing them of having been wrong last year on his 
economic program and chastising them for their stance on health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing figures on declining deficits, increasing new jobs and decreasing 
unemployment since the passage of his economic plan a year ago Friday, Clinton 
noted that "our opponents said if that plan passed, the sky would fall, 
unemployment would go up, the deficit would explode. Well, they were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, he added, "we have reached out to them" but, "every time we 
have done it, they have moved away." 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, when we started this debate and I said I wanted universal 
coverage, many members in Congress (of both parties) stood up and clapped," he 
said. "At one time, there were two dozen Republican senators on a bill to give 
universal coverage to all Americans. They have all abandoned that bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Some two dozen Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas, originally had co-sponsored a bill introduced last September by Sen. 
John H. Chafee (R-R.I.). That bill would have required all individuals to buy 
insurance but would not have required companies to pay for it. Even Chafee has 
now abandoned the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like our approaches in the Senate and the House, what is your 
alternative?" Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, speaking to reporters after the press conference, said that he did not 
rule out compromise. "We could still put a bill together. I don't think it's 
over," he said. But he criticized Mitchell's proposal, saying that it would 
rely too heavily on government. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton has done in the past, he tried to steer clear of questions about 
legislative detail, saying that "it is terribly important in this debate, when 
these issues tend to be complex and detailed, to keep our eye on the central 
reality here, which is how do we solve the problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 To provide an example of that reality, he introduced John Cox and Daniel 
Lumley, two of the several hundred people who rode buses into Washington from 
across the country this week to promote health reform. Describing difficulties 
with the present health care system, Clinton said: 
</P>
<P>
 "If the program works for John Cox and for Daniel Lumley, I'll be for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Cox had provided the emotional high point as the President 
and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed the bus riders to the White 
House with a rally on the south lawn of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, a broadcaster with a Christian radio station from Athens, Tex., told the 
crowd about burying his wife, Jan, who recently died of stomach cancer. Mrs. 
Cox had delayed seeing a doctor because her problems had been deemed to be the 
result of a pre-existing condition, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We buried her Monday and I'm here today to tell Congress that right is 
right," Cox said. "Unless we can ensure universal health coverage to all 
Americans, then life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for some is just a 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
 After wiping a tear from his eye, Clinton embraced Cox. "Congress has to 
decide whether it's going to listen to the insurance companies or to Jan Cox's 
last wish," he told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions on health care are difficult, Clinton said during the rally, but 
"the members of the United States Congress hired on, just like I did. We didn't 
say: 'Vote for me in a representative form of government and I will make all 
the necessary decisions to solve the problems of the country except those that 
are difficult, controversial and make people mad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got to do something that everybody wants to do, but it's not easy 
to do, the people that hired on have to make the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton sought to focus attention on the impact health reform would have 
on individuals and families, members of Congress remained mired in the hard 
details of actually turning ideas into laws. And the ability of Congress to 
finish work on legislation before its scheduled adjournment date this October 
seemed increasingly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Current plans are for both houses to vote on legislation before adjourning for 
their August recess but the start of that recess, at a minimum, now seems 
likely to be delayed. At one point, rumors swept Capitol Hill that House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) might put off House votes until September. 
But Foley spokesman Jeff Biggs insisted that the Speaker will not allow 
Congress to leave town without voting -- the same position Mitchell has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Further delay of the bill could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule already appears to pose an almost impossible challenge, with 
lawmakers being called upon to pass the massive and controversial legislation, 
work out a House-Senate compromise in a conference committee and approve the 
final version before adjourning for the year in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate threat of delay appears to be the inability of the 
Congressional Budget Office, with its full-time staff of only 17 employees, to 
keep up with the avalanche of demands for cost estimates of the House and 
Senate leadership proposals, as well as other alternatives that lawmakers hope 
to bring to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer huddled with House Democratic leaders and 
Mitchell late into the afternoon. Asked whether he can produce the necessary 
cost estimates within the next few weeks, Reischauer replied: "There is no 
answer. That's all."

COLUMN ONE; HEZBOLLAH: THE LATIN CONNECTION; BOMBINGS IN ARGENTINA AND PANAMA 
PROMPT CONCERN OVER THE RADICAL GROUP'S GROWING PRESENCE IN THE REGION. EXPERTS 
SAY LAX SECURITY AND POROUS BORDERS CREATE A PRIME BASE FOR TERRORISTS.

 The convention hall near the National Congress was festooned with flags 
bearing Islamic symbols and posters of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock shrine. 
About 100 Argentine right-wing activists and Shiite Muslims filled the 
audience. In the front row sat diplomats from the Iranian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy's cultural affairs officer, Imam Mohsen Rabbani, rose. "Israel," 
he intoned in accented Spanish, "must disappear from the face of the Earth." He 
and a dozen speakers who followed quoted Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini and called for unity in the fight against Zionism and the satanism of 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Such rhetoric and trappings would not be unusual in the Middle East. But this 
was the other side of the world: downtown Buenos Aires, three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's activities in Argentina are attracting new attention in the wake of 
the terrorist bombing last month that killed nearly 100 people at a Jewish 
community center. That suicide bombing, an airliner bombing in Panama the next 
day, a 1992 attack that destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires and other 
incidents in recent years point to what U.S. officials and security experts 
believe is a little-noticed presence of radical Islamic groups in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rabbani meeting, described for The Times by people who were present, has 
not been tied to any act of violence. And both Rabbani and the leaders of 
Argentina's small Shiite community have condemned the bombings. But officials 
here are now questioning whether Iranian diplomats such as Rabbani have had a 
role in indoctrinating or aiding terrorists, who can use Latin America's lax 
security to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The armed branch of Hezbollah, the fundamentalist Party of God based in 
Lebanon, and other violent groups are thought to have been planting agents and 
recruiting sympathizers in Latin America since the mid-1980s, using the general 
flow of mainstream Arab and Muslim immigrants as cover, terrorism experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the millions worldwide who hold the Muslim faith, only a small percentage 
are fundamentalists, and an even smaller number are extremists who advocate 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proof is still being accumulated, American and Israeli officials have 
blamed the two Argentina bombings on Hezbollah, which has been exchanging blows 
with Israel in Lebanon for more than a decade. A legal political party that has 
militant wings, Hezbollah is also suspected in two bombings in London last 
month. Its political leaders deny involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parts of Latin America make an ideal landscape for terrorists: porous 
borders; inept law enforcement combined with weak investigative skills; large 
Jewish, Arab and other communities drawn from conflict-ridden parts of the 
world; established rings of smugglers, drug traffickers and arms merchants, and 
entrenched traditions of corruption. In Argentina, a long string of 
anti-Semitic attacks has gone virtually unpunished for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hezbollah is mainly engaged in terrorism in Europe and the Middle East, but 
it has migrated to Latin America," said Robert Kupperman, a senior adviser at 
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "There are a 
lot of Israelis (in Latin America) -- a lot of targets -- and it's a 
springboard to the United States. . . . The purpose behind the (latest) 
bombings is that Hezbollah wants to show it has a long arm and can reach 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina has the largest Jewish community in Latin America, at about 250,000; 
the population of Arab descendants is more than triple that number. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of Hezbollah's ability to attack in Latin America is not known. The 
actual membership may be quite small, and little hard evidence of the 
clandestine group's activities is available. But investigators and intelligence 
specialists cite the following factors in addition to the two Argentina blasts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The day after Buenos Aires' seven-story Jewish community center was reduced 
to rubble on July 18, a suicide bomber said to be Lebanese and unable to speak 
Spanish or English boarded a commuter flight in Colon, Panama, near the 
Atlantic end of the Panama Canal. When he detonated the bomb, all 21 people 
aboard were killed, including 12 Jewish and Israeli businessmen, and three U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a report earlier this year, Argentine intelligence identified the jungle 
region at the border with Paraguay and Brazil as a potential base of operation 
for Middle Eastern terrorists. The area has an estimated 30,000 Lebanese 
Shiites, many there illegally. The car and explosives used in the 1992 embassy 
attack were reportedly traced to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Hezbollah radicals) have the capability to do something in Brazil, 
probably Caracas (Venezuela), and I'd say most of the major urban areas of 
Latin America," said Vincent Cannistraro, a former senior CIA officer who is an 
international security consultant in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * A senior leader of the Abu Nidal organization, a renegade group of radical 
Palestinians, was arrested in Lima, Peru, in 1988, thwarting a reported plan to 
blow up the Israeli Embassy and a synagogue there. In 1992, seven alleged 
members of Islamic Jihad -- another radical fundamentalist group in the Mideast 
-- were arrested in Quito, Ecuador, by Interpol agents who claimed the men 
planned attacks on the Israeli ambassador in Bogota, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Venezuela last month expelled four Iranian diplomats and declared the 
Iranian ambassador persona non grata. All were accused of plotting to kidnap an 
Iranian defector, who later provided evidence implicating other Iranian 
officials in the Argentina bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these indications, some Argentine observers are skeptical that a 
significant Middle Eastern terrorist network exists in their country. Rather 
than an entrenched Hezbollah organization, they see a more ad-hoc union formed 
for specific operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there could easily be an alliance (of Middle Eastern terrorists) with 
groups here that are not necessarily Islamic, such as the neo-Nazis, who are 
not of great importance but who are nevertheless dangerous," said Norberto 
Mendez, a social scientist who teaches courses on fundamentalism at the 
University of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamentalist Shiites here probably have nothing to do with (the July 18 
bombing). They would be such obvious suspects. . . . That they have ties with 
Iran, there is no doubt. But that does not link them with terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Karim Paz, an Argentine convert to Islam who runs the Al-Tahuid mosque 
in Buenos Aires, said Wednesday that while he supports Hezbollah's struggle in 
Lebanon, he would end that support if it were proved that the group carried out 
the Buenos Aires bombings. People outside the Mideast should not be brought 
into Hezbollah's conflict with Israel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Argentina's ambassador to the United States, Raul Granillo Ocampo, told a 
U.S. congressional hearing this week that Argentina's Shiite community is too 
small to have a terrorist infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in Buenos Aires the investigation is focusing on two fronts: the 
evident existence of a local support network for the terrorists -- perhaps 
including unwitting participants -- and the Iranian Embassy's possible role in 
the planning or execution of the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe they have pieced together the steps leading to the 
purchase and rigging of the car bomb used July 18, and judicial officials have 
indicated that they want to question up to five Iranian diplomats, some of whom 
have left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, U.S. forensic specialists dispatched here are trying to determine 
the bomber's physical characteristics. They have little evidence: His remains 
are among body parts collected in 10 bags. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, five Argentines have been detained for questioning, including men who 
bought and refurbished a Renault van that was later used as the car bomb. But 
there is no indication at this point that the men had knowledge of the bombing. 
In fact, Argentine officials concede their investigation is full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the police are concerned, the investigation is very advanced," 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf told the Argentine newspaper Clarin. "But 
being able to prove it judicially, where the suspect has rights and can refuse 
to testify, is another matter. Argentina cannot act like Israel, which 
determines who is politically guilty and then bombs them." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine officials contend that their investigation is hampered by their 
inexperience with international terrorism -- and because a ruthless national 
security apparatus was dismantled after democracy replaced military 
dictatorship a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of expertise was obvious in the investigation of the 1992 Israeli 
Embassy bombing. No arrests were made except for four Pakistanis who were 
quickly released for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Saul Menem, who is of Syrian descent but has sided with 
Israel on several foreign policy matters, has gone to great lengths to assure 
Jewish leaders -- and the world -- that this time his government has undertaken 
a thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, including several Jewish leaders, question the political will of 
some government officials, especially in law enforcement, where some officers 
are said to have fascist sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
 An army intelligence agent was arrested after an arsenal and Nazi literature 
were found in his house. Alejandro Sucksdorf was not discreet: Signs on the 
fence around his house bore swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not have the least doubt that the (July 18) bomb was the child of the 
impunity surrounding earlier acts of terrorism," said Sergio D. Widder, the 
representative in Argentina of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish groups have documented 30 anti-Semitic incidents in Argentina in the 
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, initial suspicion after the July 18 bombing fell on neo-Nazi groups, 
in part because the bomb exploded at the hour of a regularly scheduled meeting 
of a committee assigned to study newly released government files on Nazis in 
South America. The meeting had been canceled unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the skill and evident advance planning involved in the attack, 
the hateful but not well-organized neo-Nazi groups were dismissed as likely 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials admit they did not note the arrival of Islamic fundamentalists 
in Latin America until the 1992 bombing. But they now say they believe 
Hezbollah clerics began working in Lebanese communities in Argentina, Brazil 
and Paraguay in the mid- and late 1980s, at the height of the Lebanese civil 
war, and that Hezbollah cells began to form. 
</P>
<P>
 "The explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 came as a bolt 
from the blue," said a U.S. official who specializes in terrorism. "I don't 
think we ever had any thought or any inkling that Hezbollah had an operational 
presence in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we began looking, a lot of concern centered on the tri-border area. . . 
. It turns out that Hezbollah has been working there for several years, 
beginning with an effort to do fund raising for their operations in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian police and the Argentine National Intelligence Service became 
interested in the tri-border cities of Ciudad del Este in Paraguay and Foz do 
Iguacu in Brazil, after learning of contacts between alleged Hezbollah members 
and arms traffickers in the area, Clarin said, citing the Argentine 
intelligence report. 
</P>
<P>
 Long known as a center for contraband and prostitution, the region is a 
bustling place of intrigue. Arabic is heard as much as, or perhaps more than, 
Spanish in Ciudad del Este, and shopping there can just as easily net a visitor 
a fake passport or an automatic rifle as a watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The borders are also heavily forested, law-enforcement vigilance is virtually 
nonexistent, and tens of thousands of foreign tourists arrive every year to 
visit the nearby Iguacu Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove how easily the borders can be crossed, two reporters from an 
Argentine magazine traveled to the area less than 48 hours after the 
community-center bombing, as President Menem was claiming borders had been 
closed to prevent the escape of possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we check no one," a Paraguayan immigration police officer told the 
magazine Gente. "Anyone can come through here, from anywhere in the world and 
work in whatever occurs to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats also say Argentina's passport is easily reproduced. 
</P>
<P>
 In their investigation, Argentine authorities are relying heavily on the 
testimony of the Iranian defector in Venezuela who implicated up to five 
members of Iran's diplomatic mission in Buenos Aires. Monoucher Motamer is said 
to have sought asylum after the Iranians allegedly tried to kidnap him. The 
incident prompted the Venezuelan government to expel the diplomats and ban the 
ambassador. Unconfirmed Argentine news reports have since suggested that 
Motamer was a CIA agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem has said Argentina will break diplomatic relations with Iran if its 
involvement is proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Argentina's Arab and Muslim communities fear they are being made a 
scapegoat. Arabs from Lebanon, Syria and Egypt -- most of them Christian -- 
began migrating to Argentina in the middle of the 19th Century in search of 
business opportunities and, much later, to escape war. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two types of victims here -- the dead and wounded, and now there 
are the victims of ideological repression, (suffering) a type of witch hunt," 
said Gabriel Ali, a representative of a local Muslim organization. 
</P>
<P>
 If terrorism in Argentina caught the world by surprise, Panama as a scenario 
was even less expected, and some diplomats and officials think there may not be 
a Middle East connection in the bombing. Panama does not share Argentina's 
history of overt anti-Semitism. But it has long been a haven for fugitives of 
all sorts, and it is a well-known center for money laundering and other shady 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 The suicide bomber was said to have had a clumsily forged U.S. passport. He 
apparently had not been in Panama very long. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is still under investigation, but officials in Washington said the 
attack -- atypical of Hezbollah in style and method -- reflected advance 
intelligence and preparation: The bomber knew what flight would be carrying 
Israeli and Jewish businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Such planning reflects deep roots in the area, the officials said.

 * Abu Nidal: Known as Fatah Revolutionary Council in the Mideast, and headed 
there by terrorist Abu Nidal. Since 1970, linked to terrorist attacks in 20 
countries. Also involved in money smuggling.

ALTMAN REFUSES TO STEP DOWN OVER WHITEWATER; PROBE: DEMOCRATS, GOP CRITICIZE 
TREASURY OFFICIAL. BENTSEN ADMITS THAT AIDES MADE 'ERRORS IN JUDGMENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under intense criticism from Democrats as well as Republicans over the 
Administration's handling of the Whitewater controversy, Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman declared Wednesday that he does not intend to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen acknowledged that his 
subordinates made "some errors in judgment" that demonstrate the need for 
changes at the Treasury Department, but he stopped short of saying that he 
would seek their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about a possible personnel shake-up at the department came as 
Bentsen and Altman testified before separate committees during the sixth day of 
Congress' inquiry into the propriety of contacts between White House and 
Treasury officials concerning the investigation of a failed Arkansas savings 
and loan owned by James B. McDougal, President Clinton's one-time partner in 
the Whitewater Development Corp., a real estate project. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 hours of testimony, Altman finished his appearance before the Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee at 2 a.m. EDT Wednesday. At 9:30 
a.m., he was called before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee for six more hours of hostile questions about his contacts with the 
White House on the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Democrat Richard C. Shelby of Alabama sided with a number of 
Republicans in calling for Altman's resignation on grounds that he was involved 
in improper contacts with the White House and that he then misled Congress 
about those contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Altman's failure to quell criticism has fed speculation that he 
would be forced to resign, Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), a member of the House 
panel, asked him: "What is your thinking on resignation as an attempt to 
restore your credibility with this committee?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not intend to do that," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bentsen, appearing before the Senate committee, was asked by Sen. 
Patty Murray (D-Wash.) if he thought that any member of the Treasury staff 
should be removed, he ducked the question. "Whatever happened here was not done 
with the intent to harm," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House press conference, where questions about Altman's tenure also 
were being asked, the President said he regrets it when any Administration 
official is less than candid with Congress but that he supports Altman, his 
former college classmate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secretary of the Treasury has confidence in him and so do I," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also emphasized that he has not been absorbed by the Whitewater 
hearings. "I've watched none of these hearings. I've been working on jobs, 
health care and peace in the Middle East," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the President is confident that 
Altman can "rebuild his relationship" with Congress and "can continue to serve 
and serve well." 
</P>
<P>
 She indicated that Altman will have a series of private meetings with 
legislators in order to try to smooth things over. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he became enmeshed in the Whitewater controversy, Altman -- a former 
Wall Street investment banker -- was widely touted as a Treasury 
secretary-in-waiting -- the natural successor to Bentsen when he steps down. 
But as a result of these events, he no longer appears to be in line for a 
promotion, and his prospects for continuing in his present job appear 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearings, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler indicated that 
Altman's future in the Administration would depend on his ability to 
re-establish his credibility with Congress. But during the House hearing, Rep. 
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) observed that the criticism of Altman has only grown 
since the congressional inquiry began. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening here," he said to Altman, "is that you are being held out 
as the fall guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was treated gently 
by most of his questioners. Nevertheless, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) got 
into a finger-wagging shouting match with Bentsen, who sought to minimize the 
controversial actions of Altman and other Treasury officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I have a difference of opinion," Bentsen shouted at D'Amato at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who served as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp. until March 
31, has been criticized for misleading Congress about his contacts with the 
White House and for failing to formally disqualify himself sooner than Feb. 25 
from any decision involving the RTC's investigation of Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Altman and other Administration witnesses, Bentsen conceded that some of 
the actions of Administration officials were unfortunate but not illegal or 
improper. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Treasury secretary demonstrated the same Washington savvy 
that he displayed during his 1988 debate with Dan Quayle when, as the 
Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee, he cited his friendship with John 
F. Kennedy and rejected Quayle's effort to compare himself to the late 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in public service for nearly 30 years," he told the Senate panel. 
"I've seen everything from the McCarthy hearings to Watergate, Iran-Contra, the 
Church committee, all of it. What you have here is a unique confluence of 
circumstances that, when you strip away all the rhetoric, resulted in actions 
that broke no criminal law, did not violate the ethics rules and did not in any 
way affect the Madison case." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said he met with Altman and Treasury Counsel Jean Hanson on Feb. 1. At 
that meeting, he recalled, Altman said he was considering disqualifying himself 
from the Madison Guaranty matter. But Bentsen said he had no recollection of 
advising Altman to disqualify himself, as Altman has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bentsen said, he met again with Altman and Hanson on Feb. 23 -- 
the day before Altman allegedly gave misleading testimony to Congress about his 
contacts with the White House concerning Madison Guaranty. But he said he was 
unaware that Altman had met with White House officials on the subject until 
Altman talked about it at congressional hearings on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the Senate panel later in the day, W. Neil Eggleston, 
associate White House counsel, recalled that he was in that committee room on 
Feb. 24, when Altman said he had met with White House officials about Madison 
Guaranty on Feb. 2 but did not disclose other such meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston said he was so disturbed by Altman's failure to tell the committee 
that there had been other meetings that he immediately went into the hallway 
and telephoned White House officials to alert them to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, Eggleston said, he called then-White House Counsel Bernard 
Nussbaum, who was vacationing in Mexico, to discuss Altman's omission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.) said of Altman's testimony: "Given the most 
charitable interpretation, it was incomplete and misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato criticized Bentsen for failing to advise Altman to disqualify himself. 
He also criticized Altman for allowing Nussbaum to dissuade him during the Feb. 
2 meeting from disqualifying himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have the courage to stand up to Bernie Nussbaum," D'Amato said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who has been conducting his own 
investigation of the Whitewater controversy, said some RTC employees wrote a 
memo last September objecting to the agency's recommendation to the Justice 
Department that the government should pursue criminal charges in the Madison 
Guaranty case. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first evidence that anyone within the government ever tried to 
impede the criminal inquiry, which since has been turned over to independent 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. The RTC is continuing to investigate civil charges 
involving the failed thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have insisted that while some of the contacts between 
the Treasury Department -- which oversees the RTC -- and the White House should 
not have occurred, they were not improper because they did not lead to any 
effort by the Administration to block the inquiry. But Republicans have long 
suspected that the contacts were part of a ham-handed effort on the part of the 
Administration to obstruct the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be true that criminal referrals were not effectively blocked, but it 
is not true that an effort to do so was not made," Leach said. "It is difficult 
to assess at what levels efforts were precipitated, but it is clear they were 
coordinated in such a way as to be reported to the top of the RTC." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from the House panel, Hanson admitted that she was aware of 
the RTC memo objecting to the criminal investigation. But she denied Leach's 
suggestion that she assisted in preparing the memo or any effort to frustrate 
the criminal inquiry.

BOSNIAN REBELS CRACK FACADE OF SERB UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb nationalists dealt a third and final blow to an international 
peace plan Wednesday, angering their last friends in the world and cracking a 
facade of Serbian unity. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' obstinacy in the face of threats from patrons in Serbia and Russia 
to sever all ties illustrated the virulence of the nationalist fever incubated 
by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic when he instigated the Balkan conflict 
with his rallying cry of unity for all Serbs in one state. 
</P>
<P>
 The defiant rejection came amid what U.N. peacekeepers said was a dramatic 
increase in artillery, mortar and machine-gun fighting in and around the 
Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic also warned peacekeepers 
that they were preparing to seize weapons now under U.N. guard. That 
pronouncement seemed an ominous sign the artillery bombardment of Sarajevo 
could soon resume in full fury after five months of relative peace produced by 
a North Atlantic Treaty Organization threat to break the siege with air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
vowed to use all available means, including air strikes, to prevent rebel 
recapture of the impounded weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gen. Rose made very clear to the (Bosnian) Serbs that . . . he would use 
force to keep the weapons inside the collection points," U.N. Protection Force 
spokeswoman Claire Grimes told journalists in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eruption of hostilities has sparked fears of a looming showdown in the 
28-month-old war that may compel the hesitant, ineffectual peacekeepers to pull 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has repeatedly said further use of air power to deter Serbian aggression 
would place his troops in jeopardy of being taken hostage or subjected to 
retaliatory fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After rejecting the peace plan in the most defiant terms to date, the 
self-appointed Bosnian Serb parliament on Wednesday called for a referendum on 
the proposal on Aug. 27-28. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies expect to underscore their objections to the settlement by 
turning out a captive, highly manipulated vote, which they can then brandish as 
proof they had no alternative but to reject the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 1 million or so people living in Serbian-controlled areas have 
access only to media controlled by the Karadzic forces, they are widely 
expected to parrot whatever opinion on the peace plan their leaders espouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and ultranationalists in the rogue Bosnian Serb leadership have split 
with Milosevic over the passionate issue of whether their conquered lands can 
be annexed to a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic masterminded the deadly drive for an expanded Serbian state but has 
been pressured by stiff U.N. economic sanctions against his country to ponder 
concessions that would allow a negotiated settlement of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-nation peace plan would give Serbian nationalists rule over almost 
half of Bosnia, but it precludes union with the Serbian state in its 
prohibition against any change to the internationally recognized borders. 
Allied Bosnian Muslims and Croats who would get 51% of the republic's territory 
have endorsed the proposed partition. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic had threatened to cut off all support for his Bosnian Serb proxies 
if they continued to reject the peace plan, which he described as a fair 
formula for ending the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karadzic and the lawmakers of the so-called Bosnian Serb Republic issued a 
categorical rejection when they met in their mountain stronghold of Pale to 
weigh the latest pressures applied by their patrons. They had already vetoed 
the plan on July 19 and again last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by their SRNA news agency, the Bosnian Serbs deemed the 
proposed territorial split "unacceptable for the Serbian side." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, a traditional Serbian ally, responded with a swift, unusually harsh 
rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior diplomat in Moscow announced Russian authorities had "frozen" 
contacts with the Bosnian Serbs and warned they would face severe consequences 
if they ignored the advice of their few allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat, who was not identified, suggested Russia was still banking on 
Milosevic to bring his Bosnian Serb proteges in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Bosnian Serbs' spurning of his appeal for compromise, Milosevic 
may find it difficult to follow through on threats to cut off the flow of arms, 
money and fuel feeding the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalist hard-liners such as Biljana Plavsic, a deputy to Karadzic, have 
accused the Serbian strongman of betraying the cause of building an ethnically 
pure, aggrandized Serbian state. 
</P>
<P>
 The view of ultranationalists such as Plavsic and Bosnian Serb military 
chieftain Ratko Mladic is that Serbs have spilled blood capturing the 70% of 
Bosnian territory they now hold and to give any away would mean defeat and 
dishonor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rebels' sole source of fuel and weapons, Milosevic could easily shut 
down the war machine if he cinched supply lines. But having stirred up 
nationalist passions as a means of conquering territory, Milosevic may find 
himself powerless to elicit a compromise from those he manipulated to see any 
concession to the goal of Greater Serbia as an act of treason. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic has threatened in the past to cut off the rebels for scuttling 
international peace initiatives. The supplies have continued uninterruptedly, 
however, probably because the Serbian strongman fears a political backlash 
among nationalists in his own state if he turns on the Serbian warriors he has 
sponsored in Bosnia and Croatia.

ISRAEL, JORDAN MOVE CLOSER TO PEACE TREATY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan moved closer to signing a peace treaty Wednesday, when 
Israel's Parliament overwhelmingly endorsed a declaration ending the state of 
war between the two nations and King Hussein flew over Israeli airspace for the 
first time en route home from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 As a trio of Israeli F-16 fighter planes escorted Hussein's private jet, 
piloted by the king, on its brief journey across Israel, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin radioed the airborne monarch, informing him of the Knesset vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy indeed to learn from you of the welcome that the Washington 
declaration has received in the Knesset," Hussein said. "To the people of 
Israel, we send our best wishes and our prayers for peace. Shalom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Majesty, I see you now. Your plane is over me," Rabin replied as the 
king's plane roared over the coastal town of Herzliya. The prime minister was 
there, sitting outside an officers' school and using an army radio. Hussein 
flew so low that people on the streets could see the Jordanian crown on the 
tail of his jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your impression of Tel Aviv, Your Majesty?" the normally taciturn 
Rabin asked Hussein playfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful city," Hussein replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Majesty, thank you very much. I hope that in your flight over Jerusalem 
you will see the tremendous development of this holy city," Rabin said. "I hope 
that this city will be the city of peace for the future of all the peoples in 
the region." 
</P>
<P>
 "That is, indeed, our dearest hope, and we will do everything we can to 
achieve peace in our region," Hussein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he streaked across the sky above Jerusalem's Old City, which 
Hussein lost in battle to the Israelis in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation, broadcast live on Israel Radio, provided an electrifying cap 
to a day devoted to Israeli-Jordanian peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 As lawmakers spent the day debating the Washington declaration, Israeli and 
Jordanian negotiators worked feverishly to complete details to open a border 
crossing above the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat, at the southernmost tip of 
each country. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio reported that crews already were tearing down chain-link and 
barbed-wire fencing separating the two countries in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin hopes to join Hussein and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on 
Monday in inaugurating the crossing. It will initially be used only by tourists 
carrying passports other than Israeli or Jordanian. But Rabin expressed hope 
Wednesday that, soon, Israelis and Jordanians will cross the border freely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is a great privilege today to be witness and partner to beautiful 
moments in Israel's history," Rabin said, as he sought the 120-seat 
Parliament's endorsement of the agreement he signed last week in Washington 
with Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Supreme Court Chief Justice Meir Shamgar and 
dozens of dignitaries were present for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reservations expressed by some opposition members about the special 
status that the document recognizes for Jordan in administering Jerusalem's 
Muslim holy sites, the non-binding endorsement passed by a 91-3 vote with two 
abstentions; 24 lawmakers were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin passionately restated his government's commitment to maintaining 
Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital and insisted that the Washington 
declaration only recognizes Jordan's existing role in caring for the Temple 
Mount and the Muslim shrines there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This government, like all those which preceded it, believes that there are no 
disagreements in this chamber over the eternalness of Jerusalem as the capital 
of Israel," he said. "The whole, unified Jerusalem was and will be until the 
end of time the capital of the Israeli people, under Israeli sovereignty, a 
center for the longings and dreams of every Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem, Rabin said, "is not to be bargained for," brushing aside the 
insistence of PLO chief Yasser Arafat that talks between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization over the status of the city -- holy to 
Muslims, Jews and Christians -- should begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a triumphant day for Rabin, who has withstood withering criticism from 
the government's chief opposition, the nationalist Likud Party, over his 
dealings with the PLO and who has battled public sentiment strongly opposed to 
relinquishing the strategic Golan Heights to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington declaration offered Rabin a rare chance to appear as leader of 
a united country, heading confidently toward making peace with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four pages placed on the Knesset's table today are the essence of the 
dream of peace between Israel and Jordan, which will become in the coming days, 
we all believe and hope, a full peace treaty," he said. "We no longer have a 
doubt in our hearts that the Arab peoples are joining us on the path to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 No members of Likud voted against the declaration, although two abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In contrast to the impression that the government tries to create -- that 
there is among the people a camp of supporters of peace and a camp of enemies 
of peace -- the reality is the reverse, and we're proving that here today," 
said Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu in his Knesset speech endorsing the 
Washington declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu said Likud still opposes the agreement between Israel and the PLO 
that allows the Palestinians to build a self-governing authority in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Likud's differences with the government over its efforts to reach a 
comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict remain so deep that there 
is no chance Likud will join Rabin's Labor Party and its leftist allies to form 
a broad-based government, as some Israeli pundits have urged. 
</P>
<P>
 "With such deep disagreements, there is no possibility of our joining this 
government," Netanyahu said, addressing Rabin directly from the Knesset podium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Netanyahu's party is in the grips of an internal wrangle about how best to 
respond to the government's growing success in negotiating with Arab states and 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington declaration triggered a fresh round of internal bickering in 
Likud, because the notion of making peace with Jordan wins such wide support 
here. The agreement with the PLO was initially easy for Likud to reject -- 
because Likud still regards the organization as terrorist, and because the 
agreement may ultimately require Israel to relinquish territory in final 
negotiations on the future of the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But Likud predictions that Palestinian self-government would quickly prove 
unworkable and that the PLO would prove an unreliable partner have yet to come 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel now is engaged in intensive discussions with the PLO on expanding 
self-government beyond Jericho to the rest of the West Bank. Israeli and PLO 
negotiators are also working out economic projects, and the Israeli army has 
said it is working well with Palestinian police in maintaining security. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Moshe Katsav, head of Likud's Knesset faction, publicly 
urged the party to accept the agreement with the PLO and consider joining a 
national unity government. He was immediately denounced by party hard-liners, 
including former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and former Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday on Israel Radio, Sharon -- who has said he will run 
for prime minister in 1996 -- accused Likud leaders of losing their heads and 
said the party has lost its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate continues to rage within the party about how to deal with the reality 
of Israel's neighbors, one by one, offering peace in exchange for territorial 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Rabin has hinted that this may even include Syria -- the Arab 
state that has insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal from land captured from 
Syria in the 1967 war. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is due back here Saturday night on yet another round of shuttle 
diplomacy between Damascus and Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli newspapers are reporting that Syrian President Hafez Assad has 
accepted in principle the notion of a phased peace with Israel in return for a 
phased Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assad apparently has yet to spell out his vision of relations with Israel. 
The Israelis insist they will never withdraw totally from the Golan for 
anything less than full peace -- open borders, trade relations and restrictions 
on deployment of armed forces on both sides.

COSTA MESA POLICE KILL BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY and JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 Police shot and killed a bank robbery suspect Wednesday after a chase through 
a nearby fitness center that scattered patrons and ended in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the Bank of Yorba Linda, who said they recognized the man from a 
robbery in April, called police and chased the suspect to the fitness center. 
The man, who has not been identified, died in a hail of gunfire after an armed 
confrontation with more than a dozen Costa Mesa officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not say how many shots were fired, or whether the handgun found 
next to the victim was loaded. The shooting is under investigation by the 
Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellers at the bank, in the 1700 block of Adams Avenue, said they first saw 
the man early Wednesday afternoon in their parking lot and thought that he 
resembled a man who had robbed them at gunpoint April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m. they again saw him outside the building, and this time they were 
sure, employees said. After calling police, several bank employees -- one in a 
car, the others on foot -- followed the man down Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed him to make sure he was the one. We didn't want to lose him," 
said Sherry Greer, the bank's assistant manager who had dealt directly with the 
April robber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to get hit again," Greer said. "He may have thought we were an 
easy target." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, weighing about 300 pounds, eventually reached the parking lot between 
the Girl Scouts of America building and the Family Fitness Health Center, where 
he found police officers waiting in cruisers and a police helicopter overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 As he headed toward the fitness center, police ordered him to stop, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suspect ignored police and entered the fitness center, they said. 
Patrons inside said the man burst into the health club with police close 
behind, then ran out an emergency exit at the rear of the building and into a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness huddled on a landing in front of the health club said she heard more 
than a dozen shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigator George P. Wilson would only say: "A confrontation occurred 
between the subject and he was shot. Paramedics responded and pronounced the 
subject dead. A handgun was found next to the body."

SKATEBOARDER DIES OF HEAD INJURIES AFTER FALL ON STEEP STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An avid Simi Valley skateboarder died of skull fractures after he sped down a 
steep rural street, lost control of his board and landed on his head, the 
Ventura County coroner's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Dulcich, 23, apparently had been drinking before he crashed, but 
blood test results are several weeks away, coroner's investigator Craig Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby found Dulcich face down on Flanagan Drive in the city's Indian 
Hills subdivision just after midnight Monday and called authorities, Stevens 
said. About 12 hours later, Dulcich died of blunt head injuries in the 
intensive care unit of Simi Valley Hospital, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His skateboard was found 66 feet down the hill past him," he said. "It 
appears he may have been under the influence of alcohol. . . . Police officers 
and ambulance personnel noticed the odor of alcohol on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Close friends said Dulcich was a talented, hard-core surfer and skateboarder 
who was never reckless and always in control -- and that the long, smooth run 
down Flanagan Drive was one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they had drunk a few beers with Dulcich late Monday, but speculated 
that a rock in the road or a car probably was what caused him to lose control. 
Police said there was no indication that Dulcich was struck by a car, but 
friends said on oncoming car may have forced him to stop slaloming and take a 
faster, more dangerous course straight down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it had anything to do with alcohol," said Derek Bauerle, a 
close friend who said he had known Dulcich since they were 4. "I can tell you 
now he's skated that hill a lot drunker. . . . He was the best on a skateboard 
out of any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Katler, another close friend, said, "He could skate better than he could 
walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Katler said he and Dulcich left the Tree House Sports Bar and Grill before 
midnight Monday and spent two hours hiking around caves in eastern Simi Valley 
before he drove Dulcich to the top of one of Indian Hills' winding streets and 
dropped him off for his favorite ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Dodson, another friend, added, "He's, like, an excellent skateboarder 
without a doubt. . . . Nick always was in total control, and that's why this 
was a little weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said he and his friends had all skated down Flanagan Drive at one time 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crashed pretty hard there one time and dislocated my shoulder," he said. 
"Nick had never even skinned a knee skateboarding. He was usually just so 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Although skateboard fatalities are rare -- four have been reported nationwide 
this year -- 34,938 skateboarders were injured in 1993, according to the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn.

FISCAL CONCERNS DRIVE WILSON'S PAROLE POLICY, MEMOS SHOW; PRISONS: ANALYST'S 
REPORTS APPEAR TO UNDERCUT GOVERNOR'S CONTENTION THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS ALWAYS 
THE TOP ADMINISTRATION PRIORITY. BUT CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS SAY A 'NUMBERS GUY' 
WAS EXPRESSING HIS OWN VIEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A Wilson Administration effort to reduce the number of parolees returned to 
prison was propelled by budget pressures and monitored by middle managers 
urging supervisors in the field to stay within targets set by prison 
headquarters, according to internal memos obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The memos, written by a Department of Corrections administrator who was 
tracking the progress of the project, appear to undercut Gov. Pete Wilson's 
contention that public safety considerations have always outweighed budget 
considerations in the setting of criminal justice policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Department of Corrections officials say the views expressed in the 
progress reports were those of a "numbers guy," a researcher who had no 
authority over the parole system. The author's concerns about the budget, they 
say, came only after his superiors had determined that the policy he was 
tracking could save the state money while also promoting public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The memos were released by the state in response to a request under the 
California Public Records Act and were written over a 16-month period by Norman 
Holt, a veteran analyst in the department's Sacramento headquarters. They were 
distributed to the Department of Correction's top officials and the supervisors 
of the state's four parole regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's parole policies have become a hot topic in the Republican governor's 
campaign for reelection. At issue is the way in which his Administration has 
handled the tens of thousands of convicted felons who pour forth from state 
prisons each year, many of whom go on to break the law or violate the strict 
guidelines that govern their behavior while they are on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown asserts that Wilson, despite his harsh anti-crime 
rhetoric, pursued a policy that endangered the public by allowing more parole 
violators to remain on the streets rather than being returned to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with parole agents and some records released earlier appeared to 
support Brown's contention that the Administration's policy was primarily 
designed to save money by reducing prison overcrowding. The memos obtained by 
The Times fit into the same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports track the progress of the so-called Improved Decision Making 
Project, under which supervisors and parole agents were trained to assess the 
risk presented by each parolee and use a more thorough, consistent process to 
decide whether to send a violator back to prison or allow the parolee to remain 
free. The project was originated under Gov. George Deukmejian, but implemented 
under Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say the project was designed to target parolees who 
had been in prison for nonviolent crimes and whose parole violations were 
considered minor, most involving drug use. But it applied to all parole 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt's progress reports included several pages of charts and graphs showing 
whether each of about 100 parole offices around the state was meeting the 
department's goals for reducing the number of prison beds used by parolees. 
Based on the numbers, Holt, trained as a sociologist, wrote a few pages of 
commentary evaluating how the project was going. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical was Holt's comment in an Aug. 25, 1992, report, in which he calculated 
the fiscal consequences of unnecessarily sending people back to prison: 
</P>
<P>
 "With the current combined, in-and-out population approaching 100,000 
parolees," Holt wrote, "1% equals about 1,000 prison beds and 1/10 of a point 
equals 100 beds or $1,000,000 in overcrowding costs." 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, Holt castigated field offices that were sending too many 
parole violators back to prison. If local parole offices that were overshooting 
their budgets were private businesses, he wrote, they would be declared 
insolvent, hounded by creditors and forced into bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is based on fiscal responsibility," Holt wrote. "Some parole 
units use many more resources and have made little progress in the last seven 
months bringing their average supervision cost in line with the rest of the 
division." 
</P>
<P>
 In another memo, Holt recapped a meeting of Northern California administrators 
and supervisors that turned stormy because some supervisors were resisting the 
department's pressure to avoid, when possible, sending parolees back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still some fighting over ideologies," Holt wrote. "It needs to be 
transformed into strictly budget terms to get full cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last six months of 1991, Holt reported, most offices made progress 
in reducing the number of parolees they were returning to prison. But in 
January and February, 1992, the gains made the year before began to slip away 
because of a sudden resurgence in the number of parole violators going back to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase "surprised everyone," Holt wrote. "It's a sober reminder of how 
fragile the project is: built upon administrative urging (or badgering, if you 
prefer) a little data, a few resources and not much else." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators responded by monitoring each unit's rate weekly and by 
reviewing more cases while they were in process instead of waiting to audit 
them after a decision had been made. Finally, every unit that was using 15 or 
more prison beds per 100 parolees under its supervision had every case reviewed 
by higher-level administrators before a parolee could be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The added oversight worked. The parole division not only met but exceeded its 
target of reducing the prison population by 2,100 at the end of the 1991-1992 
fiscal year. But in the summer of 1992, the progress slipped again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rapid increase in bed use in the past few weeks suggests the need to 
reinforce the importance of staying within the budget and continuing to work on 
improving the decision-making process," Holt wrote. "The experience in February 
of this year showed how quickly . . . violations can get out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Holt's progress reports, Democrat Brown said the material "lays out in 
a much more direct fashion" a pattern of events her staff has tried to piece 
together by "connecting the dots" between fragments of information that have 
been available about the parole policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about government's most fundamental role, which is ensuring 
and providing for the public safety," Brown said in an interview. "Can we do 
things more efficiently, can we make sure dollars are spent more wisely? No 
doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to have bed quotas for parole violators as a way to save that money is 
crazy and I believe dangerous to the public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, said 
the targets set for parole offices were not quotas. The data Holt provided, 
Brown said, was simply to help administrators compare their performance against 
a statewide standard. There were no penalties for offices that failed to meet 
the targets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a numbers guy," Brown said of Holt. "He was crunching the numbers to 
show how much progress we were making. He didn't supervise. He didn't manage 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, in an interview Wednesday supervised by a state public information 
officer, said he firmly believes that parole agents and their supervisors 
should consider fiscal consequences when deciding how to handle parole 
violators. But he said that is not necessarily the official view of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were just my opinions," said Holt, a 28-year veteran of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt said he often attended meetings in which Robert H. Denninger, chief 
deputy director of the Department of Corrections, reminded administrators that 
the Legislature would give the department additional funds if the prison 
population exceeded projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Denninger made that point so frequently, Holt said, that it "was to the point 
of being nauseating."

SENATE GIVES SPACE STATION CRUCIAL VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected efforts to kill the space 
station, removing the final legislative hurdle of the year for the 
$17.4-billion project and providing more stability than it has had in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that our contractors and employees tell us we need more than 
anything else is stability," National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
chief Daniel S. Goldin said in an interview. "We now have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin said that the continuation of congressional support this year will let 
NASA prove that its management reforms can get the space station -- plagued by 
delays and cost overruns -- "on track, on budget and on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, the project had had such lukewarm political support and such 
an erratic funding record that its design changed year by year and its stated 
mission was never made clear to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's 64-36 margin of support in the Senate, as well as overwhelming 
approval last month in the House, reflected the increasing commitment to the 
station that has followed an agreement last year to bring Russia onto the 
program's international team. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will allow NASA to go from an "agent of the Cold War" to an 
important force in international cooperation, Goldin argued, a crucial 
transition for the space agency that has converted opponents of the station to 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) voted against the station last year but reversed 
his position Wednesday, convinced that the project had come "light-years in 
terms of design and mission," he said. His shift was influenced by the foreign 
policy aspect of the station as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin has also increased confidence in Congress that he can rein in runaway 
costs on the project through more focused management. Under Goldin, NASA put a 
single company, Boeing, and a single NASA center, the Johnson Space Flight 
Center in Houston, in charge of building the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin's popularity has succeeded in winning support from traditional 
congressional blocs long opposed to the space station, such as among the black, 
Latino and female members, which Goldin argues shows that the agency is 
"getting more relevant to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 And, although NASA has spent $11 billion on the project with little that is 
tangible to show for it, the agency now stands ready to begin serious work on 
the program. Contractors around the country will turn out 25,000 pounds of 
flight hardware this year and 75,000 pounds next year -- a tiny fraction of the 
total job, but visible progress nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate opponents of the project, led by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), asserted 
that Russia's participation will not save any money in building the station, 
despite claims by NASA and the Clinton Administration to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 A General Accounting Office report cited by Bumpers said that, because of 
"lower than anticipated contributions of Russian hardware, Russian 
participation would add a net $400 million in funding requirements to the space 
station program." 
</P>
<P>
 Under last year's agreement, Russia will supply a basic spacecraft for 
propulsion, along with guidance, navigation and control for the station. It 
will also provide Soyuz capsules to be used as rescue vehicles, should space 
station crew members need to return to Earth in an emergency, as well as 
systems for docking the shuttle to the space station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate vote Wednesday came on an amendment to the fiscal 1995 
appropriations bill for various independent agencies, including NASA.

TURKEY PUTS KURD LEADERS ON TRIAL DESPITE RIGHTS CRITICS; COURTS: THE SIX 
DEFENDANTS ARE EX-LAWMAKERS. THEY ARE NOT ACCUSED OF VIOLENCE, BUT MAY FACE 
DEATH SENTENCES.

 Six elected ethnic Kurd leaders went on trial Wednesday for alleged political 
crimes, despite mounting American and Western criticism of Turkey's human 
rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish warplanes simultaneously bombed a suspected Turkish Kurd rebel camp in 
northern Iraq, an attack almost certainly timed to show the armed forces' 
determination to pursue the military solution they favor to crush a 10-year-old 
Kurdish revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops killed 13 Kurdish rebels in the previous 24-hour period, piling up 
bodies in the bloodiest year yet of a conflict that has killed an estimated 
12,400 guerrillas, troops and civilians since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey now deploys almost 300,000 soldiers, police and militia in mainly 
Kurdish southeastern Turkey to stamp out an estimated 10,000 rebel militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish officials claim more than 2,250 guerrillas have been "captured dead" 
this year and boast that their "kill rates" are better than those of 
U.S.-backed forces in Vietnam. But some foreign diplomats worry that Turkish 
officials' obsession with a military victory may drag Turkey into a 
Vietnam-style quagmire. U.S. officials visiting Turkey over the past year have 
stressed the need for some kind of political solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Turkey's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
strategic position close to Russia, the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle 
East, Washington has also begun to express similar sentiments. Some in Congress 
have even proposed to partly link a 10% reduction in Turkey's proposed $364 
million in U.S. military aid to improvements in Ankara's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assess the situation (of Turkey's human rights record) as being a matter of 
concern and importance," U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee in a hearing last week. "I've never felt that 
the solution to those internal security problems was advanced by violations of 
human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of what promises to be a long trial in Ankara of six ethnic Kurd 
leaders was typical of Turkey's outdated laws and its narrow approach to the 
problems of its 12 million Kurds, about one in five of the Turkish population, 
diplomats following the trial said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six suspects were all elected to the Turkish Parliament in 1991, riding a 
wave of state promises on human rights and ethnic reforms. But those hopes 
quickly faded. 
</P>
<P>
 All six were stripped of their parliamentary immunity and jailed five months 
ago. The five who were members of the Kurdish nationalist Democracy Party were 
expelled from Parliament, as were six other deputies who fled to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the state prosecutor called for the death penalty for all six as 
he started to read a 452-page indictment. The six are accused of speaking out 
for Kurdish political rights and accepting directives from an outlawed, 
Syrian-based Kurdish rebel leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some have voiced sympathy for the rebels or have relatives in rebel 
ranks, none of the suspects are accused of any act of violence themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is judging whom? This is like the Spanish Inquisition in the Middle Ages" 
screamed the front page of the Istanbul-based Kurdish nationalist daily Ozgur 
Ulke (Free Country). It published a full page of what it called a "countersuit" 
in the name of 43 of the most prominent ethnic Kurd politicians and activists 
slain in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The "countersuit" detailed the Kurdish nationalist case, alleging that Turkey 
had: unfairly suppressed the Kurds' ethnic identity for the 71-year history of 
the republic, emptied and largely destroyed 1,500 villages since 1984, denied 
Kurds the right to a Kurdish education, operated holding camps and bombed seven 
Democracy Party buildings this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign pressure has brought some promises of reforms from Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller. But more noticeable has been a shift toward nationalist 
populism on both sides since the death last year of Turkish leader Turgut Ozal, 
who lifted a ban on the Kurdish language in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things have changed, however. Public and television debate of the Kurdish 
question is more open than ever. And not all Turkish Kurds agree with the 
radical Stalinist ideology of the rebels, who are labeled as terrorists both by 
the United States and some European states.

AMERICAN ALBUM: WHEN HOME SECURITY LOOKS LIKE SIEGE MENTALITY; BULLET-RESISTANT 
SIDING FOR RESIDENCES IS NOW AVAILABLE. INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT IS INTENSE, BUT 
SOME WONDER IF IT SIGNALS A SURRENDER TO CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Shaheen and Alan Sharp never expected such a demand for their new 
fiberglass wallboard siding, which they claim is strong enough to withstand a 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of calls came in from people living in high-crime areas in Los Angeles, 
where drive-by shootings are reported with tragic regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural residents in Ohio wanted protection from stray bullets fired by hunters. 
In the Tornado Belt, people were looking for relief from flying debris that 
could damage their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas like California that are prone to earthquakes, people wanted 
reinforcement for their hallways and doors. And in the Midwest, one lady living 
next to a golf course asked for protection from errant golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many orders coming in for a product that was started as a 
good-neighbor attempt to protect San Antonio residents from drive-by shootings, 
Shaheen and Sharp -- two building contractors and longtime friends -- may have 
stumbled onto something that could dramatically change the way a lot of people 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 While trying to make homes safe from gunfire and other elements, experts said, 
the new Bullet Resistant Systems Ltd. company could also have the effect of 
making people prisoners in their own homes. In an era when there are already 
security cameras in shopping malls, burglar alarms on cars and, in New York, 
bulletproof clothing for schoolchildren, this could be yet another sign of a 
society giving in to the criminal element. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know where this thing is going to lead us," conceded Sharp. "But we 
do know that everybody seems to want it." 
</P>
<P>
 They hit on the idea after attending a Neighborhood Watch meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Antonio, with white, black, Latino -- even cowboy -- gangs on the rise, 
where police said there were 1,262 drive-by shootings last year, where recently 
a young girl was shot on her living room couch and another child was hit in his 
bedroom, some residents had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held in an affluent part of town, where a few gang members had 
recently moved in to new federally financed housing projects next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowners were scared to death," Shaheen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease their fears, Sharp and Shaheen developed a half-inch-thick material 
that for roughly $4,000 or more will cover the inside of your walls, doors, 
roof and garage, and for additional protection, sliding panels that cover the 
windows at night. The product is similar to aluminum siding, only it is 
bullet-resistant. They call it "Safe Shield." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to the two entrepreneurs, a customer can order the material 
tough enough to stop bullets from a .38-caliber special, a .357 magnum, even a 
semiautomatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're buying a level of protection," Shaheen said. "You're buying what you 
think you need for a war zone when they attack your house." 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate their product, they invited the San Antonio police gang and 
bomb squads for a test-firing earlier this year. At a local gun range, the 
police threw a large amount of firepower at the mock panels set up to resemble 
the front of two homes. When the smoke cleared, the panels had withstood the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put hundreds and hundreds of bullets into this thing and nothing got 
through," Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police here decline to discuss the product's worthiness. They said that as 
a matter of policy, they do not endorse for-profit enterprises. But Hubert 
Williams, director of the Police Foundation in Washington, said that there are 
several reasons why a police department may not want to sign on to a commercial 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the product could eventually become defective and lead to legal 
responsibility for the police. He said criminals could get their hands on the 
material and some day use it to barricade themselves in drug houses or for 
other reasons. And, perhaps most important, by endorsing the product, police 
could be sending a message to their community that the gangs have won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that we have come to the point in our cities where some 
children have to wear bulletproof clothing and other people are considering 
bulletproof veneer to protect their property," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in our society anything that makes money goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one San Antonio home has been fortified thus far, and the media attention 
from that venture left Sharp and Shaheen deluged with inquiries from 
individuals and home builders around the country. They now plan to put together 
a marketing strategy where they would franchise the know-how and materials to 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 And while acknowledging that it could be seen as a big money-maker, they said 
their primary intention is to produce something that can help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, people began buying back-yard floodlights," Sharp said. "Then it was 
security alarms and then burglar-bars on their windows. Some people nowadays 
just don't feel safe at home anymore."

5 FRENCH CITIZENS SLAIN IN ALGERIA; MILITANTS BLAMED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three French military guards and two French consular workers were shot dead 
here Wednesday in an attack blamed on a Muslim insurgency that is targeting 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootout occurred when gunmen tried to plant a car bomb in a heavily 
guarded neighborhood that is home to most of France's diplomatic personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility. Authorities referred to "terrorists," their 
usual term for Islamic militants who have been waging a violent campaign to 
topple Algeria's military-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings followed a bloody July in which seven Italians and seven East 
Europeans were slain. Fifty-six foreigners, including 15 French citizens, have 
been killed since September, when militants began going after foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last month, the ambassadors of Oman and Yemen were held for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian authorities said at least four gunmen dressed as police drove to a 
French guard post Wednesday near a school in Ain Allah, a heavily guarded 
neighborhood southwest of Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said two guards were taken by surprise and shot at point-blank range 
with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A third guard and the consular employees were killed in another exchange of 
fire that took place when gunmen tried to park a car with a bomb outside a 
building, the French Foreign Ministry said. The bomb was safely defused. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 people have died since the government canceled January, 1992, 
elections that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.

102 INJURED IN AMTRAK DERAILMENT IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PHILLIPS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amtrak's westbound Lake Shore Limited derailed at high speed near here early 
Wednesday morning, injuring 102 passengers and crew members, after wheels on a 
mail car climbed over the rail and bounced along for three miles before hitting 
a switch and sending the train down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the injuries were minor, although six passengers were admitted to 
hospitals. The Lake Shore Limited originated separately in New York and Boston, 
and the two sections were combined into a 16-car train in Albany, N.Y., for the 
trip west to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the passengers were sleeping before the 3:45 a.m. wreck, when 13 of 
the 16 cars left the rails and some turned over. Only the two locomotives 
stayed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got very surreal for a minute," passenger Jim Lamb told the Buffalo News. 
"The train started to wiggle, and then it tipped over. It was all very calm. 
There was no screaming or exclamations." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the passengers were 22 Boy Scouts from Southwick, Mass., all of whom 
escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team of investigators to 
the scene, but although the team and railroad investigators quickly determined 
what happened, they did not yet know why. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety board member John Lauber said investigators had found gouges in the 
rail for about three miles before the wreck scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources close to the investigation said it appeared that wheels on one 
axle of the first car on the train, the mail car, slowly climbed on top of the 
rail as the train rounded a slight curve, then dropped to the road bed. At a 
road crossing some distance later, the other set of wheels on the same end of 
the car left the rail. Then at a point where a set of switches allows trains to 
change tracks, the wreck occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members on a freight train sitting on the other track waiting to cross 
over behind the passenger train noticed sparks flying from underneath the car 
and radioed the passenger train engineer, but it was too late. Preliminary 
indications are that the train was traveling 74-76 m.p.h., below the posted 
speed for the area.

DEMOCRATS FINALIZE DEAL WITH CHICAGO ON '96 CONVENTION SITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of haggling over contract details, the Democratic National 
Committee and Chicago have closed a $32.1-million deal for the city to be the 
site of the party's 1996 presidential nominating convention. 
</P>
<P>
 DNC Chairman David Wilhelm is to make the announcement today in Chicago with 
Mayor Richard M. Daley, the committee announced Wednesday. It will be the first 
time Chicago has been host to a national political convention since 1968, when 
the Democratic gathering was marred by violent protests against the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic officials had earlier settled on Chicago as their preference but 
have been negotiating with the city over unresolved issues, such as making sure 
enough space was available to house the convention.

BREYER SWORN IN AS HIGH COURT JUSTICE IN A PRIVATE CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen G. Breyer was sworn in as the nation's 108th Supreme Court justice 
Wednesday at a private ceremony at Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's Vermont 
summer home. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's wife, Joanna, was the only witness at the swearing-in, conducted by 
Rehnquist, court spokeswoman Toni House said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer replaces Justice Harry A. Blackmun, whose retirement took effect when 
Breyer took the two oaths required by the Constitution and the Judiciary Act of 
1789. 
</P>
<P>
 A public swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for Aug. 11 at the White House, but 
House said Breyer decided that he wanted to begin work and hire his law clerks 
as soon as possible. He also wanted the chief justice to administer the oaths, 
House said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court also is likely to hold a public investiture ceremony for Breyer 
in its stately courtroom several days before the fall term opens on Oct. 3, 
House said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is President Clinton's second high court appointee; Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg joined the court last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, 55, a longtime federal appellate judge, was confirmed by the Senate on 
a vote of 87 to 9, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators from both parties praised him as a man of high qualifications and 
integrity, as well as a practical problem-solver who addresses issues with a 
non-ideological approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In replacing Blackmun, the generally conservative court's most liberal member, 
Breyer is expected to find a home among the moderate justices.

WASHINGTON STATE WILDFIRE REVERSES COURSE, THREATENS LAKESIDE HOMES

 A vast wildfire shooting flames 150 feet high changed course and swept back 
Wednesday to within three miles of Lake Chelan. Nervous lake-shore residents 
lined up boats to escape in case flames blocked the only road out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials urged homeowners along the lake's south shore three miles from 
Chelan to evacuate. But several stayed, keeping a wary eye on smoke plumes that 
rose into a white cloud 40,000 feet high and visible in Seattle, 75 miles west 
on the other side of the Cascade Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes over the hill, at that point we might get a little more 
excited," said Walt Haberman, watching the fire with a group of friends outside 
the Chelan Yacht Club, where his boat was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get out of here at any time with the boat," Haberman said. "All we'd 
have to do is go across the lake there and tie up." 
</P>
<P>
 The 104,040-acre Tyee Creek fire had threatened this town of 3,000 and the 
lake's southeastern shore last week before moving west. The fire began moving 
back toward the lake Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned, a wall of flames 150 feet long jumped over a bulldozed fire 
line, said Tyee fire spokesman Larry Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight the fire moved to within 11 miles of Leavenworth, about 30 miles 
southwest of Chelan. Leavenworth, a Bavarian-themed tourist town, already is 
being threatened by a separate, 26,400-acre blaze known as the Hatchery Complex 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian crews backed by Marines were battling the Tyee blaze in central 
Washington, while other crews fought eight other fires around the state. Most 
of the fires were ignited by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's wildfires were among 26 major fires burning more than 204,000 
acres in eight states Wednesday.

NUCLEAR PLANTS TOLD TO PROTECT AGAINST TERRORIST BOMBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nuclear power plants must install barriers to guard against vehicle bombs like 
the one that exploded under the World Trade Center, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRC had refused for years to require the anti-terrorist barriers at 
nuclear plants, but commissioners reconsidered because of the New York City 
bombing and another bizarre incident, which both happened in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A man driving a station wagon crashed through a fence and a metal garage door 
at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in central Pennsylvania. The man, a 
former mental patient, roamed the plant's turbine building for four hours 
before he was apprehended. He carried no explosives or weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's nuclear plants have 18 months to comply with the rule issued this 
week. They may use a variety of barriers, including ditches or walls.

NO NEED YET FOR CONGRESS' OK ON HAITI, CLINTON SAYS; CARIBBEAN: SENATORS VOTE 
100-0 FOR A RESOLUTION CALLING ON HIM TO SEEK LAWMAKERS' ENDORSEMENT FOR USE OF 
FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton sought to calm Congress' invasion jitters Wednesday night, 
saying it was "premature" to ask for its authorization to use military force to 
restore democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a unanimous roll-call vote in the Senate earlier in the day on a 
non-binding resolution calling on him to obtain congressional approval before 
launching an invasion, Clinton indicated he would probably seek lawmakers' 
endorsement of American military action in Haiti. But he stopped short of 
making a firm promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would welcome the support of the Congress, and I hope that I will have 
that," he said at a nationally televised news conference. "Like my predecessors 
of both parties, I have not agreed that I am constitutionally mandated to get 
it. I think we have done all we need to do (right now) because I don't want to 
cross that bridge before we come to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the Haiti resolution, sponsored by Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) on a 100-0 roll call. The measure reminded Clinton that U.N. 
Security Council approval -- voted Sunday -- was no substitute for 
authorization by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the Senate that the action of the U.N. should not be interpreted 
as an approval by Congress," Clinton said. But he said it was important to keep 
the option of using force to depose Haiti's military-led government to clear 
the way for a return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted by a 
coup in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining his resolution, Dole said: "If the President wants to seek 
authorization (for invading Haiti), now would be the time to come to Congress 
and ask for it. Authorization in the United Nations is a poor substitute for 
authorization by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic lawmakers who support a strong policy against Haiti's military 
rulers said the resolution only restates the reality that Congress retains its 
constitutional power to declare war. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's warranted, the President will come before this body" and seek 
permission to use U.S. troops to topple the Haitian regime, said Sen. 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), noting that former Presidents Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush did not seek congressional approval before invading Grenada and 
Panama, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, said the U.N. resolution does not imply in any way that Clinton has 
decided to use force in Haiti. "In fact, I have advised him not to use force," 
Pell added. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Republicans criticized the President for even seeking a Security 
Council resolution authorizing military action in Haiti, contending it had set 
a bad precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an abrogation of the Monroe Doctrine," argued Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), 
referring to the traditional American policy of asserting special U.S. 
interests in hemispheric affairs and opposition to European influence in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole asked: "Why do we need the permission of these (other) countries to act 
in our hemisphere?" 
</P>
<P>
 The sense-of-the-Senate resolution was preceded by two similar resolutions 
urging the President to seek congressional approval before using military force 
in Haiti. They were adopted after the Clinton Administration sent warships and 
a contingent of U.S. Marines to the waters off Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, the bodies of two men were found Wednesday in a busy 
street, the apparent victims of rising political violence. The men, who news 
service reports said appeared in their 20s, had been shot and their necks 
cinched with straps.

POLICE SAY BURGLAR OFFERED FALSE EVIDENCE IN OTHER CASES; SIMPSON CASE: THE MAN 
WHO CLAIMED HE SAW TWO WHITE MEN FLEEING AFTER THE SLAYINGS ALSO REPORTED 
SEEING POLLY KLAAS ALIVE A MONTH AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SLAIN, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A self-professed burglar who says he saw two burly white men leaving the scene 
where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were killed has come forward 
in previous cases pretending to have important evidence, law enforcement 
sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar, Frank Chiuchiolo, has been in prison three times and has a 
history of running scams -- a record that he admitted in interviews with The 
Times. But according to law enforcement sources, the burglar has offered false 
evidence in other high-publicity cases, including the Polly Klaas 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, the father of the victim in that case, confirmed that Chiuchiolo 
had called the Polly Klaas Foundation on Nov. 5, 1993. "He said that he had 
seen Polly on Nov. 1," Klaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that Klaas was killed within hours of her abduction on 
Oct. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If Chiuchiolo's story about the Simpson case turns out to be false -- or if 
his credibility is so badly damaged that O.J. Simpson's defense attorneys 
cannot afford to call him as a witness -- it could deprive Simpson of 
potentially valuable testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming him, Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said in court last 
week that the witness "has given testimony or evidence that is totally 
inconsistent with the theory of a lone assailant and is entirely inconsistent 
with the fact that Mr. Simpson is that assailant." 
</P>
<P>
 Records from the Klaas Foundation show that Chiuchiolo called on the morning 
of Nov. 5 and told a phone operator that he had seen Klaas in a parking lot 
accompanied by a man with long, dark hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He yelled 'Polly,' and the child turned and so did the man," the operator 
said Chiuchiolo reported. "He then yelled 'Dolly' to protect himself. . . . 
Caller has been in prison and is very nervous about talking to police." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiuchiolo spoke to The Times on several occasions last month on the condition 
that his identity not be revealed. But after the San Francisco Examiner 
published his name Wednesday, he agreed to allow The Times to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Chiuchiolo denied that he had spoken to authorities 
about the Klaas case. Attempts to reach him later in the day to ask about his 
contact with the Klaas Foundation were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Simpson's defense camp have spent considerable time checking out 
Chiuchiolo's story, meeting with him numerous times and questioning him about 
his alleged observations on the night of the slayings. From the start, 
Chiuchiolo has acknowledged his long criminal history. His rap sheet shows 
dozens of arrests in California, Nevada and New York. Most were for burglary or 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of his history were confirmed by law enforcement sources last week and 
published by The Times. Chiuchiolo never mentioned offering evidence in 
previous cases, and on Wednesday continued to deny that he had ever misled 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feds are going to try to discredit me on this thing," he said. "But I 
know what I saw. There's no doubt at all. I saw two white guys leaving that 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
 As new details have emerged, however, police have become convinced that the 
man is lying, and members of the defense camp have grown more wary as well. 
LAPD detectives in the Simpson case met with him for more than three hours last 
week. Afterward, they asked other law enforcement agencies to assist them in 
gathering background material about him. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interviews with police, defense investigators and The Times, Chiuchiolo 
said he had driven to Los Angeles from Northern California on June 12 so that 
he could burglarize houses. Chiuchiolo said he made the long trip because he 
did not want authorities to connect him to the crimes, adding that he is 
well-known to police in Happy Camp, where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Brentwood, Chiuchiolo said, he spent much of the evening casing 
houses, working his way through various neighborhoods, picking out houses that 
appeared to be empty and planning to burglarize them once darkness fell. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m., Chiuchiolo said, he saw two men near what turned out to be 
Nicole Simpson's condominium. He said they looked like security guards, so he 
kept moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 10 p.m., Chiuchiolo added, he was approaching another house 
across the street and preparing to go inside when he heard a woman scream and 
turned to see the same two men running away. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened, Chiuchiolo said he ran back to his own car and sped back home, 
stopping only for gas and to call his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiuchiolo's story impressed defense attorneys and investigators in part 
because he came forward before a $500,000 reward was offered for information 
leading to the arrest of the "real killer or killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead lawyer, said Wednesday that he was unaware 
of any new developments regarding the burglar, but said he and the rest of the 
Simpson defense team have many leads to pursue, not just the testimony offered 
by the burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that if Chiuchiolo did provide false reports in previous 
cases, he almost certainly will not make an appearance in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the report of this individual coming forth with inaccurate information in 
other high-profile cases is true, then this mystery witness will never become a 
trial witness because his credibility will have been destroyed," said Peter 
Arenella, a UCLA law professor. "If this report turns out to be accurate, it's 
not surprising: High-profile cases tend to attract bizarre characters who will 
do anything to get their moment in the limelight."

RIDERS WELCOME RETURN OF BUSES; TRANSPORTATION: ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF MTA'S 
FLEET RESUMES SERVICE AFTER STRIKE ENDS. PASSENGER LOADS ARE LOWER THAN NORMAL 
ON SOME ROUTES. 
</P>

<P>
 Buses were back rumbling through the streets of Los Angeles on Wednesday -- a 
welcome sight even with their nine-day mantle of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 About three-fourths of the pre-strike fleet of 1,900 Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority buses rolled out, and all 202 lines were in operation, 
making it again possible for hundreds of thousands of residents without cars to 
get from here to there. Full service was expected to be restored today or 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least at one MTA yard, some buses and drivers sat idle because there 
were not enough mechanics to inspect the buses. Officials reported about 70% of 
the mechanics back on the job Wednesday -- a day after ratifying a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 As a goodwill gesture, the MTA is leaving the fare at 50 cents through Sunday, 
down from the usual $1.10. Nonetheless, transit officials predict a 5% drop in 
ridership because of the strike. MTA officials expect ridership to decline 
further after the fare goes to $1.35 on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 During the walkout by union mechanics, which was honored by drivers and 
clerks, the MTA put about 350 buses on the street, but service stopped at 6 
p.m. Round-the-clock bus operations resumed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All over town, the end to Los Angeles' first transit strike in more than a 
decade was greeted with relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," sighed Paula Smith, a Delta flight attendant who works until 12:30 
a.m. and often could not get back to her Mid-City home during the strike 
because the last bus had left. "Now, I don't have to sleep in strange places or 
bug anybody for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over for the sake of our passengers," said Jody 
Little-Williams, an MTA secretary from South-Central Los Angeles who was 
mustered into service as a replacement driver. 
</P>
<P>
 She is pleased to be able to sleep later. Little-Williams, who had never 
driven a bus before the strike, was reporting to the bus yard at 4:48 a.m. to 
operate Line 560 on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only regret: "I wish I could have gotten one more chance to say goodby to 
the riders," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some drivers said passenger loads had not returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't realize we're back," said John Nunez, finding only about 20 
passengers on his usually packed Olympic Boulevard bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were glad to see us back, but most of them didn't expect a bus to be 
there," said Art Blumberg, carrying 20% of the usual riders on his route from 
Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Dixon, a mechanic who was back on the job at the Highland Park bus yard, 
said there were no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said he was heartened earlier Wednesday, when he had been in Glendale 
fixing a bus that had broken down on the road. When he got it started, 
pedestrians waved and cheered at the MTA mechanics and driver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Askia Faheen, a driver who honored the picket line, was glad to be back behind 
the wheel on Wilshire Boulevard, greeting familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get to know some of the people, you look forward to seeing them," 
said Faheen, a driver for 11 years. "How're you doin'?" he said to passengers 
as they boarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mechanics approved their agreement, some drivers expressed 
concern about their proposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the possibility that we might be going out again," said driver Paul 
Robinson, who added: "I talked to seven guys, and six said they voted 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots were mailed Monday to 4,400 bus and train operators represented by the 
United Transportation Union. They will be counted Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Many passengers were just happy they could get around again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated," said Byron Johnson, who during the strike had been leaving for 
work three hours early so he could catch one of the last buses to get to his 
graveyard-shift job. "I can sleep again." 
</P>
<P>
 As the best indicator that public transit is returning to normal, riders 
complained about late buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset," said Elaine Vigil, waiting at a bus stop at 4th and Soto streets 
in Boyle Heights. "I'm going to be late to work. It's kind of frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping nervously into traffic to look for the bus, she motioned across the 
street to the opposite side. "This is the fourth bus going that way, and no bus 
coming this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to cause me to want to get a car," she said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited along Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, Juan Gonzalez said 
the end of the strike made little difference on the street. The 22-year-old man 
had been waiting 45 minutes for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if there's a strike or not," he said. "The buses still 
aren't running." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA announced that holders of July monthly passes are eligible for refunds 
for days the strike was in effect. They should send their passes to P.O. Box 
194, Los Angeles 90053. Refunds will be mailed.

 The emergency room physician who was most seriously injured in the so-called 
mystery fumes case in February said that she is preparing to make a $6-million 
claim against Riverside County. Dr. Julie Gorchynski said in a statement that 
she still does not know exactly what caused her injury -- deterioration of her 
knee bones caused by a lack of blood. Gorchynski and five other emergency room 
personnel at Riverside General Hospital were struck with nausea, dizziness and 
other symptoms after a cancer victim, Gloria Ramirez, was rushed to the 
hospital complaining of breathing difficulty.When a sample of her blood was 
drawn for analysis, attendants said it smelled foul. Several people, including 
Gorchynski, collapsed after smelling the blood sample, and the emergency room 
was evacuated. Ramirez died that night of what was determined to be kidney 
failure brought on by cervical cancer. The Riverside County coroner's office 
said that after an exhaustive autopsy, it found nothing in Ramirez's system to 
explain the alleged fumes.

GAY ACTIVISTS DOWNPLAY SENATE SCHOOL BILL

<P>
 Gay rights lobbyists are downplaying the impact of this week's U.S. Senate 
vote threatening programs for gay public school students, saying they are 
confident the proposal will die before final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In an amendment to an education funding bill, the Senate voted 63 to 36 Monday 
to cut off federal money to any school district that teaches that homosexuality 
is "a positive lifestyle alternative" through classwork, textbooks or 
counseling. 
</P>

 Given its many gay-friendly projects -- including Project 10, a nationally 
known counseling program for gay high school students -- the Los Angeles 
Unified School District would be a key target of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of gay rights groups said they were heartened by Senate 
votes on a rival amendment and expected the anti-gay language, proposed by 
Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Robert C. Smith of New 
Hampshire, to be eliminated in a Senate-House conference committee that will 
study the legislation after the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a very strong position for it to be taken out in conference and we 
are confident that will happen," said Doug Hattaway of the Human Rights 
Campaign Fund, a national gay rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Helms ban is enacted, Los Angeles school board member Jeff Horton 
predicted it would not be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine the federal government just cutting off money to Los Angeles 
-- no matter what we did," said Horton, who is openly gay. "My position would 
be, screw 'em. We're going to continue to meet the needs of all students and 
take what comes." 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin said he would recommend that the board 
aggressively oppose the ban, and if it does become law, fight it legally and 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel, and I think most of the board -- if not all -- feel we have an 
obligation to provide a supportive atmosphere for all students," Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's approval of the Helms proposal stirred considerable concern in 
gay circles. "Our phones are going crazy," said David Smith of the 
Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "People across the 
country are outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 He characterized the measure as one of a series of anti-gay proposals that 
Helms has recently attempted to attach to various appropriations bills. In this 
case, it took the form of an amendment to a $12.5-billion reauthorization of 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides funding to virtually 
all of the nation's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, 
voted against the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after passing the Helms amendment, the Senate went on to 
unanimously approve another -- offered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) -- 
that prohibits direct use of federal school funds to promote or encourage 
sexual activity of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of the overwhelming support for the Kennedy amendment, Hattaway 
predicted that it will probably replace the Helms language in the final 
legislation.

CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; SAN FRANCISCO; DOLPHIN STRANDINGS BLAMED ON DISEASE 
</P>

 Disease is probably to blame for an unusual number of dolphin strandings along 
the California coast earlier this year, marine scientists said. In a peculiar 
episode that sparked a statewide hunt for a cause, 46 common dolphins washed 
ashore during a nine-week period ending June 4.Thirty-six were stranded along a 
110-mile stretch of coast in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
Initially, environmentalists and some marine mammal experts speculated that an 
oil spill or some other pollutant was the culprit. Other suspected causes 
ranged from a toxic "red tide" of algae blooms to the use of sonar by research 
vessels mapping the topography of the ocean floor. Now investigators believe 
the mammals died of natural causes after being drawn close to shore by a food 
source.

SOUTHLAND LEADS U.S. IN BEACH CLOSINGS, WARNINGS; ENVIRONMENT: O.C. BUCKS TREND 
WITH NUMBER OF INCIDENTS DECLINING BY MORE THAN HALF IN 1993. RESEARCHERS POINT 
OUT THAT AREAS WITH FREQUENT TESTING HAVE THE MOST ALERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Beaches across the United States were closed to swimmers or posted with health 
warnings more than 2,400 times last year, with one-third of them occurring in 
Southern California, according to an annual report released Wednesday by a 
national environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, beach closures and advisories resulting from high bacteria 
counts more than doubled to 1,397 in 1993, compared to 609 the year before, 
according to the Natural Resources Defense Council report. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County bucked the trend, posting 61 closures -- largely due to 
sewage overflow and runoff in Dana Point -- compared to 139 in 1992, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "One difference that sort of stands out," said Bob Merryman, the county's 
director of environmental health, "is that there was a significant decrease in 
the incidents that were caused by line blockages in the sewer lines. The sewage 
treatment plants, generally speaking, are doing a little bit better job in 
maintaining their systems." 
</P>
<P>
 That trend appears to be continuing: as of this month, he said, the county has 
experienced 29 beach closures, compared to 47 at the same time last year. "Even 
if we have two or three more closures and they are minor," Merryman said, "the 
number will be significantly lower than last year's." 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of health advisories in California does not mean that the 
region has the nation's most contaminated beaches. Instead, most of the 
disparity is attributed to local health agencies that test more frequently and 
are quicker to warn the public than their counterparts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of California's increase was attributed to numerous health 
advisories in San Diego County, where heavy winter storms caused sewer system 
breakdowns or washed large volumes of runoff to sea. San Diego County posted 
727 warnings last year -- by far the most in the nation -- including some in 
January and February that lasted several weeks and encompassed much of the 
county's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blame should not lie with those whose numbers are high," said NRDC 
attorney Everett DeLano in Los Angeles. "This does not mean that San Diego 
beaches are more heavily polluted than Los Angeles County's, rather that San 
Diego is doing a better job of protecting the public and closing the beaches 
when they should be closed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, beaches were closed or posted with warnings 59 times -- 
an increase from 37 in 1992, according to the report. About half were along a 
20-mile stretch of Santa Monica Bay from Topanga Canyon Boulevard to the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the only Southern California county that does not routinely 
test its beaches for bacteria. It posted health warnings four times last year 
because of an oil spill in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the warnings were triggered by high coliform bacteria counts, 
which indicate that the water has been contaminated by human sewage or animal 
waste from spills or river runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But since there are no national standards, how frequently beaches are tested 
for coliform bacteria and under what conditions they are closed to the public 
varies widely from state to state -- even county to county -- and from year to 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, eight states, including Oregon, Washington and most of the Gulf 
Coast, do not monitor coastal water and issue no public warnings. But health 
agencies in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties sample a large number of 
beaches weekly and issue public advisories because of strong interest from 
swimmers, surfers and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, water officials this week unveiled what they hope will be a 
natural remedy to the pollution that has caused popular Aliso Beach to be 
closed frequently over the decades: catch basins of native plants along Aliso 
Creek to trap and filter damaging spills before they reach the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can deal with the pollution in the creek," said Michael Dunbar, district 
general manager for the Laguna Beach-based South Coast Water District, "before 
it gets to the public beach." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Dan Avero, deputy environmental health director for the county, 
said its high number of advisories is at least partially a result of its 
frequency of water tests and its policy of posting warnings after rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some jurisdictions don't have the funding to do routine monitoring. We 
probably do more sampling and monitoring than any other jurisdiction," he said. 
"We take a cautious approach in deciding to go out with the advisories. Our 
priority is to protect public health and we want to make sure the water is safe 
for people to swim in." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of San Diego County's health warnings -- 187 last year -- were triggered 
at Imperial Beach by persistent problems with sewage flowing up the Tijuana 
River from Mexico. Frequent storm-related sewage spills also occurred near 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day that a beach was posted with an advisory is counted as one occasion. 
At Del Mar Beach on Camp Pendleton, for example, health warnings were issued 
from Jan. 16 through March 6, amounting to 50 advisories. 
</P>
<P>
 The coliform tests used by most counties to determine whether to post warnings 
are not considered a highly accurate way to measure the real health risks to 
swimmers and surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 While coliform can indicate the presence of raw human sewage, which could 
spread diseases such as hepatitis and dysentery, it also may point to bird 
droppings or other animal wastes that are not considered a serious disease 
threat. But since no reliable means exist to determine the source of the 
coliform, most health departments in Southern California close beaches as a 
precaution until the counts are normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists say their report is evidence that Congress, which is 
debating reauthorization of the Clean Water Act, should incorporate more 
stringent controls on urban runoff and set uniform standards for when states 
monitor and close beaches. The debate in Congress is expected to last through 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the numbers that are at issue. What this report really attempts to 
show is that there are still beach closings. It's an indicator that our waters 
are not clean," DeLano said.

MOTHER'S QUEST FOR A BETTER LIFE TURNS TRAGIC AS CHILDREN DIE IN FREAK HANGING 
</P>

<P>
 Diana Brown moved her family from Santa Ana to Las Vegas in search of a better 
life and newer dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Her world came crashing down this week when her two children died by hanging 
from a tree in what police said was a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 North Las Vegas police said Luneta Brown, 11, and her 10-year-old brother, 
Clement, apparently had been playing in the back yard when they accidentally 
hanged themselves with a piece of rope attached to a tree. The chairs nearby 
had been tipped over and it appeared the children had been standing on them, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is still being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same question goes through my mind," Diana Brown, 35, said Wednesday from 
Las Vegas. "It's just hard for me to fathom that anyone could play this kind of 
game in the first place. Just how do children play this kind of a game?" 
</P>
<P>
 The children were staying at their aunt's house while their mother returned to 
Santa Ana to pick up their birth certificates so they could register for school 
here. The youngsters were told to stay at their home in southeast Las Vegas, 
where they moved two weeks ago. But the children convinced a relative that they 
were supposed to stay at an aunt's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she moved to Las Vegas to look for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "California wasn't offering me and my children anything," said Brown who is a 
single mother with three other children. "I just wanted a better life for them. 
Las Vegas was new. I thought it would provide that. I didn't know I would lose 
so much here." 
</P>
<P>
 Luneta and Clement attended Esther L. Walter Elementary School in Anaheim 
before moving to Las Vegas.

MAKING A BIG IMPRESSION; ELEPHANTS LEAD PARADE AS CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a herd of elephants tromps single-file into the the parking lot of The 
Pond of Anaheim, it means one of two things: Either the Republican National 
Convention or the circus is in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of parents and children who lined a mile-long stretch of streets 
weren't applauding any glad-handers Wednesday afternoon; instead they were 
cheering the circus elephants and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Halting traffic as it passed, the animal procession hoofed its way from the 
circus train on Sunkist Street to the arena, all to trumpet the arrival of the 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the animals," said Diana Jakemedes, 9, of Anaheim. "I like the 
horses. They were cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Elephants) are fun. I've seen them at the zoo," agreed Autumn Thompson, 4, 
as the elephants strolled by single-file, linked trunk to tail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were funny the way they grabbed hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large mammals can be seen in all of the 19 performances staged by the 
124th edition of the "Greatest Show on Earth" between Thursday and Aug. 14. In 
addition to the animals, the famed three-ring circus also will showcase Russian 
acrobats, French aerialists, animal trainers, dancers, clowns, a human 
cannonball, Cossack riders and a canine comedy show. 
</P>
<P>
 For many parents and grandparents, Wednesday's animal walk was a pleasant 
journey back to their youth. A lifelong Anaheim resident, Ray Masciel, 69, 
remembers waking at daybreak as a youngster to watch the great beasts walk by. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were kids we'd see them come in on the other side of town," said 
Masciel, a retired businessman, who brought his four grandchildren to 
Wednesday's parade. "We'd stay until we saw the elephants raise the tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the whole excitement of the circus coming to town," he added. "Now, 
the excitement for me comes from (watching) the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marching down the streets of Anaheim was all the work the elephants had to do 
Wednesday. Circus crews erected the tents, which covered half a football field 
in the arena parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the elephant's walk, the large mammals received a soothing bath, 
trainers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get a tub of water and they spray themselves," said Brenda Olson, a 
circus spokeswoman. "Then, trainers hose them down." 
</P>
<P>
 When the circus train halted on the railroad tracks near Sunkist Street and 
Cerritos Avenue about 4 p.m., the elephants didn't exactly bound out of the 
train. More than an hour passed before they emerged. The animals couldn't be 
unloaded until the arena had been properly prepared for them. 
</P>
<P>
 As it did for many other youngsters, the wait proved very trying for A.J. 
Bessey, a tearful 2-year-old attending his first circus walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd enjoy seeing the animals," said A.J.'s mother, Kim, a 
preschool teacher from Anaheim. "It's typical of the circus to be running late. 
But at least they should have some clowns out (in the meantime)." 
</P>
<P>
 But smiles broke out among the children, and adults, when the spectacle 
finally began. The crowd especially seemed to enjoy "Romeo and Juliette," two 
baby elephants being pulled to the arena in a trailer. In their circus debut, 
the heavyweight youngsters are the first pachyderms born and bred at the 
circus's elephant farm in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the happier faces in Wednesday's circus crowd belonged to Fernando 
Rodriguez, a food-truck vendor. In the afternoon heat, beverage sales were 
brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's usually no business in the afternoons," Rodriguez said. "I like the 
circus."

IRE RAISED AS HENLEY SIGNS RAMS PACT; COURTS: PLAYER'S FREEDOM ON BAIL 
AGGRAVATES ATTORNEYS FOR OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THE DRUG CASE IN WHICH HE AWAITS 
TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Professional football cornerback Darryl Henley signed a one-year, $350,000 
contract Wednesday to rejoin the Rams even though he is awaiting trial on 
cocaine-trafficking charges, triggering complaints from attorneys for other 
defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is not facing a (possible) minimum mandatory 10-year sentence (as 
Henley is) and yet he's in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles," 
said Joan P. Freeman, a deputy federal public defender whose client is accused 
of extorting money from Henley and faces a possible maximum term of three to 
four years in prison. "I'm having some difficulty with this." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Henley's lawyer said the athlete is free on bail and within his 
rights to return to the playing field. Henley was a starter for the Rams last 
season until he took a leave of absence when his legal problems became public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see anyone saying that this guy is a flight risk," Henley attorney 
Roger Cossack said. "He'll be surrounded by 100 people and millions will be 
watching him on television every Sunday. It's hard for me to think that the 
court would not allow Darryl Henley to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight defendants who have been charged in the combined cases of 
extortion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine, only Henley and his uncle were 
given the chance to make bail at the time of their arraignments. Henley is 
accused of masterminding a drug ring that distributed large amounts of cocaine 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Tracy Donaho, a former Rams cheerleader who was named in a 
federal indictment as a courier for the drugs, was also given an opportunity to 
make bail but has since pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against 
Henley and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the accused -- James Timothy Saenz, charged in an alleged attempt 
to extort money from Henley -- spent 10 months in federal prison. He was 
released last week, when bail was finally set at $10,000. The other four must 
wait until Jan. 10 for their trials to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a real disparity in treatment in this case," said one defense 
attorney in the case, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. 
"Darryl Henley is clearly a celebrity who has been in the limelight and 
although nobody is saying it, his case has been handled differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors argued strenuously last December before U.S. Magistrate 
Ronald W. Rose that Henley should be kept in custody until his trial because he 
might disappear and is a danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Henley, Donaho and 
three others as participants in a conspiracy last year to transfer two 
shipments of cocaine from Henley's home in Brea to drop-off points in Atlanta 
and Memphis, using the 20-year-old Donaho as a courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, including one of those charged in the trafficking conspiracy, have 
also been charged with threatening Henley's life in an attempt to extort 
$360,000 they say he owed them for cocaine they delivered to him. All are 
scheduled to be tried together. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents began investigating Henley in July, 1993, after Donaho paid 
cash for a one-way ticket from Ontario International Airport to Atlanta. Such a 
purchase is a tip-off that a passenger may be carrying drugs, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 When she landed, agents allegedly discovered 26 pounds of cocaine in a bag she 
had checked. Donaho later said that Henley had recruited her. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Henley -- who was aware of the criminal investigation -- 
went to police himself to report an extortion attempt. Henley said the threat 
came at gunpoint at the Rams' practice facility in Anaheim. He reported that 
three men stole his 1992 Lexus 400 SE and a Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun inside the car. One of the men who allegedly threatened him was found 
shot to death in West Covina some hours after the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating Henley's extortion claims and arresting several suspects, 
authorities focused on Henley's alleged involvement in the cocaine ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, after pleading not guilty to the charges against him, Henley 
was released on $200,000 bail. Bail for his uncle, Rex Henley, who was indicted 
last month as part of the cocaine trafficking conspiracy, was set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the charges of disparate treatment for Darryl Henley, his 
attorney said the football player is an excellent candidate for release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about the prior records about anybody else, but Darryl 
Henley has never been in trouble in all his life," Cossack said. "He has been 
active in charity work and for the past 10 months, has been terrific in terms 
of making court appearances and keeping in touch with pretrial services." 
</P>
<P>
 A condition of Darryl Henley's bail is that he not travel outside a 
seven-county central California area.  
</P>
<P>
 Cossack said he will ask for a modification of the bail conditions, allowing 
Henley to travel to Rams away games. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot, one of two federal prosecutors handling 
the Henley case, declined to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL and Rams officials say that Henley is considered innocent and free to play 
unless he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts disagree over whether Henley should have been allowed to make 
bail in the first place, much less be permitted to play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unusual is that bail was set in an amount that was achievable," said 
Eric E. Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Police Foundation in 
Washington. "Generally, in a case (involving drug trafficking), there is a 
presumption that a person should be jailed. If an indictment alleges that 
(Henley) is the . . . central figure in this conspiracy, the fact that bail has 
been set that he can make is highly unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say that Henley, the most prominent of the defendants in the 
criminal case, is the least serious flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine he'd be a danger to the community and be a flight risk," said 
Judy Clarke, head of the federal public defender's office in Spokane, Wash., 
and an expert in federal drug cases. "I don't find it unusual at all that he be 
granted bail. Presumably, he'd be under the watchful eye of managers and the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 One federal law enforcement official believes the others in the case still in 
prison have good reason to be unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was one of the other defendants, I think I'd be pretty upset watching 
Darryl Henley play football on Sundays."

HUMAN BONES FOUND IN LAGUNA BELIEVED TO DATE TO BEFORE 1920; ANTHROPOLOGY: A 
CAL STATE FULLERTON EXPERT SAYS THE REMAINS COULD BE OF A NATIVE AMERICAN OR A 
HOMICIDE VICTIM. 
</P>

<P>
 Workers repairing a broken water main here Wednesday unearthed large human 
bones of a Native American or perhaps a homicide victim buried under the street 
sometime before 1920, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains discovered so far, which consist of a long, thick femur and more 
than 60 pieces of a fragmented skull, could also be several centuries old, 
according to Judy Suchey, a forensic anthropologist from Cal State Fullerton 
hired by the Orange County coroner to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bones are definitely human," said Suchey, who has performed such studies 
for more than 25 years. "They are very large adult bones and probably male, 
because they're so robust. In fact, I'm most intrigued by the robusticity. The 
thickness of the skull is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery, in the 100 block of Crescent Bay Drive where homes range in 
value from $4 million to $5 million and the ocean glistens in the distance, had 
the whole neighborhood talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's neat!" said Brad Frazier, 13, who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really cool!" said Eric Hammond, 12, who, with Frazier, arrived 
at the scene shortly after the bones were uncovered around 9 a.m. by a pavement 
company. No clothing or artifacts were immediately found. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators for the Laguna Beach Police Department said the street had not 
been worked on since 1920, leading them to conclude that the bones date to the 
early part of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary indications by Suchey were that the bones are at least that old 
and possibly much older. She was aided in her search by Tom Collins, a graduate 
student assistant, who carefully chipped away at the earth surrounding the 
bones Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Suchey said the bones may have been those of a Native American. She compared 
them to similar findings in the county in recent years, particularly in the 
Aliso Creek area, and conceded that they also could be those of a homicide 
victim, although there was nothing uncovered to suggest that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm intrigued by the fact that the bones were found at such a shallow depth," 
she said, "and that they're so huge." 
</P>
<P>
 The bones appear to be quite old, she added, because "they're mineralized and 
dense and heavy . . . but other than that, I can't ascertain much of anything. 
Knowing that the street hasn't been worked on since 1920 is a helpful 
indication." 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday evening, Suchey was still hoping to find teeth, which, in a 
prehistoric human, would reveal "a lot of wear because of the immense amount of 
grit in their diet. The crowns in such a person would be worn down almost 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bones were those of an American Indian, they may well date back 
hundreds of years. But from 1850 on, they could be from a variety of different 
peoples. However, they're almost certainly not from a person of (Asian) 
extraction, because the bones are so large . . . so robust." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that when workers discovered the bones, the skull was still intact 
but quickly fragmented into dozens of tiny pieces as they passed it around, 
trying to figure out what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a full skeleton. I'm not sure what we have," she said. "We're 
not making assumptions about anything. In this business, you can't. We don't 
really know what we have."

SUIT NAMES 2 RESTAURANTS IN YOUTH'S DEATH; COURTS: PARENTS CLAIM DRIVER OF CAR 
IN FATAL CRASH WAS SERVED ALCOHOL DESPITE BEING UNDERAGE. THE ALLEGATIONS ARE 
DENIED. 
</P>

<P>
 The parents of an 18-year-old Huntington Beach youth killed in a car crash 
have sued two local restaurants, alleging that they negligently served alcohol 
to the underaged driver of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Clarke died last summer when a car driven by an 18-year-old 
boyhood friend plunged off Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, Kevin and Lynn Clarke, are seeking unspecified damages from DP's 
Pub and Grill in Newport Beach and Mario's restaurant in Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach couple claim in the wrongful death lawsuit that employees 
at the two restaurants served alcohol to the driver of the car, Bryan J. 
Martin, before the crash in the early morning hours of Aug. 17. They further 
allege Martin was served alcohol while he was "obviously intoxicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Peter T. Cathcart, who is representing the Clarke family, 
said it appears the two youths were not asked for identification at either 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But one restaurant owner denied the allegations, saying his employees ask 
everyone for identification. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know they absolutely were carded and they had false 
identification," said Rusty Vasterling, co-owner of DP's Pub and Grill, who 
said he has spearheaded a local effort to train restaurant employees about 
identifying minors. "I am extremely proactive in this minor identification and 
serving awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Valenzuela -- whose father, Mario Valenzuela, owns the Huntington Beach 
restaurant -- said she hadn't seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment on it. But 
she said the restaurant would never serve a minor unless false identification 
had been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We card everybody, just about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, bars and other establishments can be held liable if they 
serve alcohol to minors who get drunk and later become involved in an accident, 
Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, also names the 
holders of the liquor licenses for the two establishments as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Clarke died at the scene of the 1:45 a.m. crash after the car 
being driven by his longtime friend tumbled about 300 feet off a dark, curvy 
section of Ortega Highway near San Juan Capistrano. It is one of the deadliest 
stretches of roadway in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Clarke, who had been working part time at a Domino's Pizza, had 
graduated from Edison High School in Huntington Beach earlier that summer and 
was planning to take classes at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 18, of Fountain Valley, was injured in the crash and arrested on 
suspicion of manslaughter and felony drunk driving. He later pleaded guilty to 
a charge of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and felony drunk driving 
and served a six-month jail sentence at Huntington Beach City Jail, according 
to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clarke family is seeking compensation for funeral, burial and memorial 
expenses and general damages, Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this society we do have an obligation to protect what are considered to be 
a group of people who don't necessarily make intelligent and mature decisions," 
Cathcart said. "When you are serving alcohol, obviously the effects of that can 
be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said at the time of the crash that Martin 
was speeding east around a corner when he apparently lost control of his 1981 
Pontiac Firebird along a segment of the highway without guardrails. The car 
went off the side of the two-lane road, overturning several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Clarke, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the car 
as it tumbled, the CHP said. Authorities found Martin, still conscious, at the 
bottom of the steep slope. He had been wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and Christopher Clarke had been friends since the early 1980s when they 
lived in the same Fountain Valley neighborhood. Both had attended First 
Southern Baptist School.

JUDGE DISMISSES FELONY COMPLAINT -- AND THIRD STRIKE; COURTS: DUE TO LACK OF 
EVIDENCE, CYPRESS MAN INSTEAD FACES TWO MISDEMEANOR ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THE 
ABUSE OF HIS FORMER GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>

<P>
 In what is believed to be the first time a "three strikes" case has been 
dismissed in Orange County, a municipal judge on Wednesday said he threw out a 
felony complaint against a convicted felon because he believed prosecutors 
filed the wrong charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher said he did not want to minimize 
the allegations against Lance Powell, who was arrested on suspicion of felony 
stalking involving a former girlfriend. A felony conviction would have made the 
Cypress man eligible for a life prison sentence under California's new "three 
strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dutcher said there was insufficient evidence to support the more serious 
felony charge and that he used his discretion to instead charge Powell with two 
misdemeanors, accusing him of abusing his former live-in lover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen hundreds of these cases and this was not a felony stalking case," 
Dutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade, head of the special prosecution unit that 
handles spousal abuse and stalking cases, said she is considering whether to 
refile a felony stalking charge against Powell, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're still reviewing the case," Shade said, declining further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans said Wednesday that he believes the 
Powell case marks the first time a local judge has reduced a felony charge in a 
"three strikes" case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Susan Kirkpatrick suffered bruises and feared for 
her safety after at least two violent confrontations with Powell in May, when 
the two lived together. Kirkpatrick has since been "backing away" from what she 
initially told police, Shade said in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In court records, Shade also said she believes the appropriate charge was 
filed because the defendant repeatedly harassed the victim and left her fearing 
for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said the felony stalking law is more properly applied to cases where a 
victim is harassed and followed, not in an instance that is considered a 
domestic violence case. The judge reduced the charge July 15 and previously 
signed a restraining order to keep Powell away from his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he based his decision on the evidence before him because he 
believes it would be improper to give the defendant's prior record weight in 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has a 1979 conviction for assault with intent to commit murder and 
assault with a deadly weapon and a 1985 conviction for kidnaping. In 1987, he 
was also charged with improperly possessing a firearm while on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 For Powell, the judge's decision means he no longer faces a potential sentence 
of 25 years to life in prison -- the equivalent of a first-degree murder 
conviction. Misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson in March signed the "three strikes" legislation into law. The 
measure increases prison time for defendants convicted of felonies and counts 
as "strikes" certain violent or serious felonies. After two strikes, a 
defendant is eligible for a life prison sentence upon a third conviction of any 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the measure will help fight crime and keep streets safe, while 
opponents say the law unfairly lumps together nonviolent and violent offenders 
and will lead to prison overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 In court records, Deputy Public Defender Joel M. Garson argued that the felony 
stalking case against Powell was unfounded. The dispute between Powell and 
Kirkpatrick involved two isolated incidents in May and reflected heightened 
passions between two people -- not a typical stalking case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garson also said in court records that if the felony stalking charge were 
upheld in this case, it could arguably be used in every domestic violence case, 
an application he felt was unreasonable.

KNBC'S THREATS OVER TAPE SPARK DISPUTE; MEDIA: NEWS OFFICIALS CRITICIZE 
STATION'S WARNING TO OTHERS NOT TO AIR VIDEO. YOUTH'S LAWYER UNDERCUTS DEBATE 
BY SAYING HE WILL RELEASE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The threats of KNBC Channel 4 to sue any news organization that uses a 
videotape showing a Compton police officer beating a youth sparked a flap 
Wednesday among local news officials, who criticized the station's hardball 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the boy's lawyer undercut the debate by saying that he will make 
the tape available to the district attorney and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC officials said they had paid $125 in an exclusive deal Tuesday with Maria 
Quintana, who shot the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Wednesday, Mark Hoffman, the station's news director, 
warned news organizations against using the footage. KNBC had broadcast the 
tape extensively during the previous evening's newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may be contacted by an individual unaffiliated with KNBC-TV circulating a 
copy of the videotape for broadcast," Hoffman said in the statement. "Please be 
aware that neither he nor anyone else has been authorized in any way to license 
or otherwise distribute this material. Only KNBC-TV may authorize any other 
party to use or license this material. You are hereby on notice that to use 
this videotape in any manner would violate NBC and KNBC-TV's exclusive rights 
to this material." 
</P>
<P>
 But Humberto Guizar, the attorney representing the youth, said Wednesday that 
he had the original tape and that he would make it available to investigators 
and allow journalists to view and copy it. Guizar said the tape had been shot 
by "a godmother to one of the siblings" from inside a trailer nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC "threatened me," Guizar said, "but I didn't enter into a contract with 
them. They said they have exclusive rights. But their contract wasn't with me." 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar said the tape ended up in the hands of Channel 4 only after the family 
struck out with the legal community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else wanted to look at the tape. The person (who shot the video) went 
to a number of attorneys and they were all asking for $3,000 retainers, and 
they didn't even want to look at the tape (until they had gotten their money)," 
he said. Frustrated, he said, the family went to the media, and "went to all 
the local channels, but Channel 4 was the one that jumped on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to blasting the station's hard line on release of the tape, local 
news officials on Wednesday criticized the fee paid to Quintana, which is 
typical of that paid to professional stringers who prowl the city at night 
looking for crime scenes and accidents they can film for television stations. 
Many said Quintana should have received much more for the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kenny Boles, managing editor of KNBC News, said in a statement, "It is 
standard and accepted practice in the news business to pay a small fee for 
amateur photographs and videotape. Channel 4 pays a $125 fee for home video 
that we use on the air. Our exclusive agreement to air the recent police 
beating of Felipe Soltero is consistent with this policy." 
</P>
<P>
 News officials also criticized KNBC's unyielding position on the tape. They 
said it is common practice for news organizations to share footage after the 
exclusive is aired, and for other news organizations to credit the newspaper or 
station that scored the scoop. One news director said he would obtain the video 
from Soltero's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at KABC-TV Channel 7 said, "They very emphatically said they would 
sue us if we used the footage. It's very strange and very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're just planning to hype this more than O.J. Simpson," said one 
news executive at a rival station, a prediction that was at least partially 
borne out when KNBC ran parts of the videotape about 10 times in 20 minutes 
during its 4 p.m. newscast Wednesday. The station also showed the beating three 
times on one promo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after George Holliday shot his videotape of the police beating of 
Rodney G. King, a flap also erupted over use of the tape, but for far different 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In that instance, Holliday, a plumbing company supervisor, sold his tape 
exclusively to KTLA-TV Channel 5 for $500. KTLA fed the tape to Cable News 
Network, with which it has an affiliate agreement, stipulating that CNN embargo 
the footage to all other Los Angeles stations. KTLA wanted at least one more 
night of exclusive local coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, KNBC got a copy of the tape through KPNX in Phoenix, a station that 
is both a CNN and NBC affiliate. Holliday filed a $100-million lawsuit for 
copyright infringement against CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC for what he said were 
unauthorized telecasts of the tape. He also alleged that KTLA defrauded him by 
not informing him that it would release the tape to CNN. The suit was 
ultimately dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questioned KNBC's strategy, especially because Guizar insisted on making 
the tape widely available. They also downplayed the relative significance of 
the incident compared to the beating of King. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a Rodney King situation," said Jeff Wald, KCOP-TV Channel 13 news 
director. "In that case, you had a bunch of officers standing around, 
participating in the beating. This is a case of one overzealous officer who 
this kid may have mouthed off to. It's brutal and very unfortunate, but it 
doesn't have that kind of significance."

BEATING ON VIDEOTAPE IS INVESTIGATED; VIOLENCE: THE FBI AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE 
ARE CHECKING INTO THE INCIDENT. OFFICER WHO IS SEEN STRIKING A 17-YEAR-OLD HAS 
BEEN PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. 
</P>

<P>
 The FBI and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office launched 
separate investigations Wednesday of possible civil rights violations and 
police brutality arising from the videotaped beating of a 17-year-old youth by 
a Compton police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape, shot secretly by a neighbor, shows Officer Michael Jackson 
lunging at Felipe Soltero and knocking him to the ground with a sudden blow 
from the butt of his baton to the youth's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders can be heard screaming in the background. The 180-pound officer is 
then seen rearing back and striking Soltero at least four more times before he 
drops his knee into the back of the youth's neck to hold him down while placing 
him in handcuffs. Finally, the tape shows Jackson yanking Soltero to his feet, 
using the baton stuck under the youth's arm as a hoist. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report Jackson wrote about the Friday incident, however, he said he hit 
Soltero only in the torso and legs and only after Soltero hit him first. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Soltero was arraigned in Juvenile Court in Compton on a charge of 
interfering with a law enforcement officer and released pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was examined by a doctor at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center 
before being jailed Friday at Los Padrinos Juvenile Detention Center in Downey 
over the weekend but has not seen a doctor since, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was being held at Los Padrinos, jail officials discovered that 
Soltero had an outstanding warrant for fighting in public in Lynwood several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a big bump on his forehead and headaches and a lot of psychological 
trauma" from the "astonishingly brutal" attack, said Soltero's attorney, 
Humberto Guizar. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar said he plans to file a federal lawsuit against Jackson and the city of 
Compton to recover damages for Soltero's injuries and the violation of the 
youth's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton police said they began investigating the incident on Monday, after 
Soltero had complained over the weekend to a children's social worker. Jackson 
was off over the weekend and was placed on paid administrative leave by the 
department Wednesday, after the broadcast of the videotape on KNBC-TV Channel 
4, which paid Soltero's godmother $125 for the rights to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Police Chief Hourie Taylor said Jackson, 33, has had "a minimal 
disciplinary record" during his six years on the force. He was suspended for 
one day in 1991 for an off-duty incident of conduct unbecoming an officer but 
has no other violations in his personnel record, police said. Police would not 
reveal further details about the violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has received four written commendations during his career. In March, 
1991, he was commended for showing restraint in use of force during an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar attributed the brutality of the beating to the fact that his client is 
"Hispanic and Hispanic in appearance" and to what he said was a statewide 
climate of racism against Latinos and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar also invoked the memory of the beating of motorist Rodney G. King by 
Los Angeles police. King was beaten after a car chase in 1991. On Wednesday, 
the City Council authorized payment of the $3.8-million civil judgment he won 
in the case. "Rodney King was supposed to teach these officers a lesson," 
Guizar said. "I guess some people never learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Others rejected the idea that the incident was racially motivated. Jackson is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Mayor Omar Bradley acknowledged that there are tensions between the 
area's African Americans and Latinos. But, he said, the beating was not related 
to those tensions. "Any suggestion this was racial is nefarious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Field, the deputy district attorney who heads the office's Special 
Investigations Division, said his office has begun checking the circumstances 
of the incident. He said he has seen nothing "that makes me believe this was 
racial in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman John Hoos said the results of his agency's preliminary 
investigation will be forwarded to the Department of Justice's Civil Rights 
Division in Washington and to the U.S. attorney's office here "for a 
prosecutable opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the case said Beth Rodriguez, a county children's 
social worker, went to the trailer in the 1900 block of West 156th Street in 
Compton on Friday after an abuse complaint against Manuel Shigala, 41. Shigala 
lives there with Soltero's mother, Enriqueta de la Cruz, and at least three 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Shigala was arrested Saturday in connection with the complaint, but charges 
were not pursued and he was released Wednesday, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the beating incident, five children ages 22 months to 14 years were 
taken into protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rodriguez arrived at the mobile home on Friday, Soltero was 
uncooperative, according to Jackson's report, and tried to keep her from 
questioning at least three other children who lived there. Witnesses and police 
said she called for assistance, fearing for her life because he threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was sent to the scene, wrote in his report that after he arrived 
he told Soltero to calm down or face arrest and that the youth, who is 5 feet, 
3 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds, began swearing and threatening to kill him 
and Rodriguez. A fight began when Jackson tried to arrest the youth, and it was 
at that point that he removed his baton and hit Soltero twice in the torso and 
twice in the legs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Soltero was down, the report continued, Jackson struck him twice more in 
the legs, after which the youth stopped resisting and was placed in the police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness said he saw Soltero hit Jackson when he tried to put the youth in 
handcuffs. "Felipe struck the cop, then it was all over," said Jim Murillo, 31, 
who lives next door. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Soltero only defended himself. "He didn't want to get arrested 
. . . and that's when the police officer jumped on him and started fighting," a 
14-year-old neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unclear at what point the video camera was turned on, the tape 
shows Soltero and his 14-year-old sister standing and talking to Jackson when 
Jackson suddenly shoves past the girl and strikes Soltero in the face. The tape 
then shows him striking Soltero several times after Soltero appears to have 
given up resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was hitting him with the baton I thought he was going to kill him," 
said the young neighbor, who witnessed the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton Police Department, like many urban departments, has faced other 
brutality allegations in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, two unarmed brothers were shot to death in their driveway by 
a Compton police officer answering a domestic dispute call. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pouvi Tualaulelei, 34, and his brother, Italia, 22, together were shot 19 
times by Officer Alfred Skiles Jr., who contended that he acted in self-defense 
after the men attacked him Feb. 12, 1991. A jury deadlocked 9-3 in favor of 
acquitting Skiles of voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge later blocked an attempt by prosecutors to have Skiles retried, but 
the victims' families eventually won a $2.1-million settlement from the city, 
which agreed to the payout one day before a civil trial was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a Los Angeles jury awarded $2.3 million to the family of a 
16-year-old boy who was shot three times -- including once in the back of the 
head -- by Compton police after a car chase 11 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office later concluded that the officers had acted in 
self-defense, but the civil jury disagreed.

FUGITIVE HACKER LEAVES TRAIL OF STRANGE CLAIMS; CRIME: 'AGENT STEAL' SAID HE 
WORKED UNDERCOVER FOR THE FBI WHILE AWAITING SENTENCING FOR CRIMES THAT INCLUDE 
RIGGING RADIO STATION CONTESTS. CASE SHEDS LIGHT ON SHADOWY COMPUTER WORLD.

<P>
 He called himself Agent Steal, computer hacker. He was a slender, good-looking 
rogue partial to Porsches and BMWs who bragged that he worked undercover for 
the FBI catching other hackers. 
</P>
<P>
 But today Agent Steal, whose real name is Justin Tanner Petersen, is on the 
run from the very agency he told friends was paying his rent and flying him to 
computer conferences to spy on the hacking community. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, 34, a Westside resident, disappeared in October after admitting to 
federal prosecutors that he had been committing further crimes during the time 
he claimed to be working with the government "in the investigation of other 
persons," according to federal court records. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is a microcosmic slice of the close-knit and ruggedly competitive 
world of computer hacking, where friends struggle to outdo each other and then, 
when they're caught, sometimes turn on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Petersen's list of accomplishments, known as "hacks," includes 
breaking into computers used by federal investigative agencies and tapping into 
a credit card information bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who once promoted after-hours rock shows in the San Fernando Valley, 
was involved in the hacker underground's most sensational scam: hijacking phone 
lines at Los Angeles radio station KPWR-FM to win contests with prizes ranging 
from new cars to trips to Hawaii. The mastermind of that scheme was another 
hacker, Kevin Poulsen, a.k.a. Dark Dante. Poulsen is awaiting sentencing in 
connection with the case, having already spent three years in custody, the 
longest term in jail for any hacker in history.  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen has boasted that he trapped former colleagues. Last year he gave an 
interview to an on-line publication called Phrack in which he claimed to have 
tapped the phone of a prostitute working for alleged madam Heidi Fleiss. He 
also bragged of working with the FBI to bust another infamous hacker, Kevin 
Mitnick, a San Fernando Valley man who has been hiding for almost two years to 
avoid prosecution for allegedly hacking into computers illegally and posing as 
a law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to work for the bureau I contacted Mitnick," Petersen said in the 
Phrack interview. "He was still up to his old tricks, so we opened a case on 
him. . . . What a loser. Everyone thinks he is some great hacker. I outsmarted 
him and busted him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Petersen's story may be bunk. He is, after all, a shadowy person who 
didn't even use his own name during the years he spent on the fringes of the 
Los Angeles rock scene. Longhaired Eric Heinz, as Petersen called himself, 
shattered the computer nerd stereotype. He frequented the Rainbow Bar and Grill 
on Sunset Boulevard, often with different women on his arm, and handed out 
cards identifying himself as a concert promoter and electronic surveillance 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI refused to talk about Petersen directly. But J. Michael Gibbons, a 
bureau computer crime expert, said he doubted Petersen was working as a 
government informant to ensnare his hacker buddies for the bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 That kind of relationship is dangerous for the FBI, Gibbons said. "Across the 
board, hackers cannot be trusted to work -- they play both sides against the 
middle." The agents "could have had him in the office," Gibbons said. "They 
probably debriefed him at length. (But) send him out to do things? I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorney Richard Sherman of Santa Monica, who represents another 
hacker, has accused the FBI of actively using Petersen as an informant and 
turning a blind eye to Petersen's alleged credit card fraud during the time he 
was in the bureau's care. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 19 letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Sherman said three agents in Los 
Angeles engaged "in a course of conduct which is illegal and contrary to Bureau 
policy" in handling Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Ann Farrington, deputy chief of the Justice Department's public integrity 
section, responded July 18 that there were no grounds to begin a criminal 
investigation. Assistant U.S. Atty. David Schindler in the Los Angeles office 
said, "It is factually incorrect that we allowed Mr. Petersen to commit 
crimes."  
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Petersen best described him as a bright, verging-on-arrogant 
man who dressed well and sometimes walked with a cane, a result of a motorcycle 
accident six years ago that cost him a foot. He sometimes promoted after-hours 
clubs in the Valley and in Hollywood, according to a partner, Phillip Lamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond said Petersen once told him: "The difference between you and me is I 
get a thrill from breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Phrack interview, published on the Internet, an international network 
of computer networks with millions of users, Petersen as Agent Steal bragged 
about breaking into Pacific Bell headquarters with hacker Poulsen to obtain 
information about the phone company's investigation of Petersen's hacking.  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen said they found "a lot of information regarding other investigations 
and how they do wiretaps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Very dangerous in the wrong hands," said Phrack's interviewer, according to a 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the wrong hands," Petersen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen was arrested in Texas in 1991, where he lived briefly. Court records 
show that authorities searching his apartment found computer equipment, Pacific 
Bell manuals and five modems. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI affidavit expressed fear that Petersen could have been eavesdropping on 
law enforcement investigations. The affidavit said Petersen admitted 
"conducting illegal telephone taps" and breaking into Pacific Bell's COSMOS 
computer program, which allows the user to check telephone numbers and 
determine the location of telephone lines and circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury in Texas returned an eight-count indictment against him, accusing 
Petersen of assuming false names, accessing a computer without authorization, 
possessing stolen mail and fraudulently obtaining and using credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was transferred to California and sealed out of concern for 
Petersen's safety. The motion to seal, obtained by attorney Sherman, states 
that Petersen, "acting in an undercover capacity, currently is cooperating with 
the United States in the investigation of other persons in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen eventually pleaded guilty to six counts, including rigging a radio 
station contest with a $20,000 prize. He faced a sentence of up to 40 years in 
jail and a $1.5-million fine, but the sentencing was continued several times. 
Sherman believes Petersen continued working for the government during that 
time. Petersen's partner, Lamond, said Petersen told him the FBI was paying him 
$600 a month "to help them track down hackers." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, 1993, 15 months after entering his first guilty plea, Petersen was 
confronted outside federal court by government attorney Schindler, who asked if 
he had been committing any crimes while on bail. Petersen said he had, 
according to Schindler.  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen then met briefly with his attorney and took off. 'I've got a big 
problem and I'm splitting," he told a friend the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Petersen were unsuccessful and his attorney, Morton Boren, 
said he has "no knowledge of Justin committing any crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman also criticizes the government for allegedly allowing Petersen, while 
serving as an informant, to utilize a Pacific Bell Telephone Co. computer 
called Switched Access Services, known as SAS. Sherman said the computer allows 
operators to intercept telephone calls and place other calls, making it appear 
the calls originated from other phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Motta, executive director of applications, reliability and support for 
Pacific Bell, said he would not comment on Sherman's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Phrack interview, Petersen made no apologies for his choices in life. 
Discussing Petersen's alleged role as an informant, interviewer Mike Bowen 
suggested that "most hackers would have done the same as you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most hackers," Petersen replied, "would have sold out their mother."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TEACHERS, 
DISTRICT AGREE TO HALT TALKS FOR A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After meeting for about three hours on Wednesday, negotiators for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and the teachers union agreed to halt their 
contract talks for a week to give both sides time to explore some of the ideas 
floated during the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract negotiations, centering on United Teachers-Los Angeles' demand 
for restoring a 10% cut in teacher salaries, are scheduled to resume Aug. 10. 
Board of Education President Mark Slavkin said the board will meet in closed 
session this morning for an update, and he and UTLA spokeswoman Catherine Carey 
said both sides expect to keep their promise not to talk publicly about the 
negotiations until some agreement is reached.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; LAW WOULD LIMIT GIFTS TO CITY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gifts that public officials receive from people doing business with Tustin 
would be restricted under a law given preliminary approval by the City Council 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, elected officials and city employees could not accept $250 
or more in gifts during a calendar year. Violations would be considered a 
misdemeanor and could result in city employees being fired or elected officials 
being removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law is slightly stricter than a statewide measure that goes into 
effect Jan. 1. The state law, which expands the Political Reform Act, will 
prohibit state and local officials from accepting more than $270 in gifts 
annually. That figure will be adjusted every two years based on changes in the 
Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Political Reform Act prohibits local elected officials from 
receiving more than $1,000 annually in gifts and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tustin's proposed law was debated by the council, Mayor Pro Tem Jim Potts 
and Councilman Michael J. Doyle argued unsuccessfully that public officials 
should receive no gifts at all from people doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need to accept any gifts whatsoever," said Potts, who views 
such restrictions as part of a nationwide reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the private industry right now, they won't let employees accept gifts or 
lunches because there might be a pay-back," he said. "Dealing with public 
money, we have to be held to even higher standards, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting in favor of the $250 prohibition were Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli, 
Councilman Jeffery M. Thomas and Councilwoman Tracy Worley. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltarelli said that banning all gifts went too far. An overly restrictive law 
could be misused, he said, "simply because some political activist wants to get 
us removed from the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who was elected to the council in April, promised voters she would 
work for a gift ban. Worley said she never claimed to support a total gift ban, 
and that the cost of a lunch or a dinner "is not going to influence my vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibiting council members from receiving any gifts "would tie our hands," 
she said, "and just make this job harder to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the gift limits law is expected to be considered at the Aug. 
15 council meeting.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT VOTED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed housing project for low-income people was rejected this week by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 3-1 to deny the project after dozens of residents 
objected to its proposed location. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Julie Sa and Don Bankhead sided 
with the residents. They said the proposed site was inappropriate for the 
project. Councilman Chris Norby was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Molly McClanahan cast the dissenting vote. She called the project 
"worthy" and said it could have provided affordable housing for people who work 
in the city but cannot afford to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said the proposed complex would alter their view and lower their 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in my back yard," Jane Caple told the council during a three-hour 
public hearing Tuesday. "Why can't you put this somewhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 The La Habra Neighborhood Housing Service, a nonprofit organization, had 
proposed building a 15-unit apartment complex on a lot on Harbor Boulevard that 
has not been developed because of landslides and other geological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding the vacant lot is St. Jude Medical Center, Fullerton Municipal 
Golf Course, a convalescent home, business buildings and some homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Hayes, executive director of the La Habra NHS, called the proposal a 
"quality project" that would not "negatively impact" neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors disagreed and while some said they did not oppose affordable 
housing, they insisted Harbor Boulevard was not the place for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the plan been approved, the developers would have received a $565,000 loan 
from the city to help build the complex. The building also would have been 
taken off the property tax rolls for up to 99 years -- something some residents 
and Sa did not like. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead said he would have voted in favor of the project had it not required 
a zone change from office space to medium-density residential. "I hope we can 
find another site for it because it is a good project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin suggested the city look for land it owns to swap with the proposed 
site's landowner so the project could still be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a land-use issue," he said. "I think it's a project in the 
wrong place and I think the solution to this problem is to exchange (land) and 
keep (the vacant property) as open space." MIMI KO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; GALANTER URGES 
CITY TO BLOCK REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents fighting a proposed redevelopment of the 795-unit Lincoln Place 
apartments found a powerful ally Wednesday when Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter formally announced her opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a standing-room-only hearing before a panel of city officials, Galanter 
urged the city to block a developer's request to demolish apartments for low- 
and moderate-income tenants and build market-value condominiums on the 40-acre 
site in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment "would change Lincoln Place from a mixed community to one 
that, by economic necessity, excludes the elderly on fixed incomes and younger 
families starting up," Galanter said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Merlino, vice president of TransAction Companies Ltd., predicted eventual 
victory for the $150-million project. "We think it's just the beginning of the 
(approval) process," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DEMOLITION OF PRESS BOX 
AT COLISEUM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the scheduled reopening of the earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum a month away, Coliseum officials Wednesday resolved the last major 
historic-preservation issue holding up the mammoth repair effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Don C. Webb, who is directing the project, told a meeting of the Coliseum 
Commission that state preservation officials -- who have veto power over 
modifications of the historic landmark -- have agreed to allow demolition of 
the facility's ramshackle press box. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big step," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, president of the commission, which in the long term hopes to build a 
modern press box as part of a series of improvements to keep the Los Angeles 
Raiders at the Exposition Park stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming football season, however, only part of the press box will be 
demolished and a temporary facility erected, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will begin demolition immediately," he said. "We're not going to let the 
moss grow under anything around here with only 31 days remaining." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum is scheduled to reopen Sept. 3 for a USC-Washington game. The 
Raiders open their home season eight days later, playing Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many repairs remain to be done and hundreds of workers continue to toil 
around the clock, officials on Wednesday celebrated completion of one large 
part of the project: Concrete was poured for the last of 56 seismic 
reinforcement beams ringing the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan joined representatives of the commission, 
the state Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency -- which is paying 90% of the quake repair costs -- in etching their 
names in the wet concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated costs of the project have risen steadily, from $35 million shortly 
after the Jan. 17 quake to $58 million as of last week. The increases have been 
attributed to new damage discovered and to required city building code 
upgrades, including new electric power facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a race toward finishing at this point," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherilyn Widell, the state's historic preservation officer, said she and other 
preservation officials agreed to allow demolition of the press box in part 
because it falls far short of meeting current building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The press box, built in 1948, "definitely has history," Widell said. But she 
noted: "When you're doing preservation, you have to make sure the building is 
still viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Preservation officials will keep photos of the press box and carefully review 
"anything new that may go in its place," she said. PAUL LIEBERMAN

HOT AND BOTHERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever spent time in the country's colder regions, you know all about 
the "wind-chill factor." More than telling the temperature, that figure tells 
how cold it feels by adding wind speed. Determined not to allow winter to 
out-classify summer, the National Weather Service has begun calculating the 
"ultraviolet index," and the "heat index," sometimes called the "agony index." 
</P>
<P>
 The "heat index," begun in 1984, reflects how the combination of temperature 
and humidity feels. For example, with an air temperature of 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 60%, the National Weather Service 
determined that it feels like 130 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Frank Lepore, National Weather Service spokesman, about 20,000 
people nationwide have died as a result of heat-related injuries over the past 
50 years. What's more, 700,000 to 1 million people each year are diagnosed with 
skin cancer -- three-quarters of which are UV related. The UV index is designed 
to measure ultraviolet light levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these are an attempt to put this very technical stuff into useful 
terms people can understand," Lepore said, "to make the public understand that 
there is an environmentally-related health hazard." UV Index 
</P>
<P>
 The "ultraviolet index," begun in June, is still in the experimental phase. It 
measures the amount of time it would take for a fair-skinned person to get 
sunburned during the hottest part of the day. UV Level: What it signifies 0-2: 
Minimal exposure, when it takes more than 30 minutes to burn. 3-4: Low UVI, 
when it takes 15-90 minutes to burn. 5-6: Moderate UVI, when it takes 10-60 
minutes to burn. 7-9: High UVI, 7-9, when it takes 7 to 35 minutes to burn. 
10-plus: Very high, when a sensitive-skinned person could burn in fewer than 
five minutes. Heat-related Injuries 
</P>
<P>
 There are several signs that the heat has gotten to your body. "No one in 
their right mind is going to go out there and jog if we're having a 110-degree 
heat wave," said Manuel Rivas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles chapter of the 
American Red Cross. "But we tell people just in case, to catch those people who 
don't have common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat cramps: Often in the legs or abdomen, can signal the early stages of 
more serious heat-related injuries. Resting in a cool area, drinking cold 
fluids and massaging the cramped area are often enough to quell the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat exhaustion: Symptoms are headaches, nausea, dizziness, weakness, 
fatigue, clamminess and normal or below normal body temperatures. Treatment is 
the same is for heat cramps and needs to be handled promptly. If allowed to 
progress, heat exhaustion can lead to mild shock or heat stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat stroke: Among the most serious heat-related medical emergencies, 
developed when symptoms of heat exhaustion go untreated. The body, overwhelmed 
by heat, begins to stop functioning. If not treated immediately, heat stroke 
can be fatal. Symptoms include a high body temperature; red, dry skin; 
progressive loss of consciousness; rapid, weak pulse, rapid, shallow breathing; 
and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment includes cooling the body with ice packs on wrists, ankles, armpits 
and neck; drinking four ounces of water every 15 minutes and minimizing shock. 
If a victim refuses water, vomits or is unconscious, seek immediate medical 
attention. Summer Heat Tips 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross offers the following tips to coping the effects of summer heat: 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow down and avoid strenuous outdoor activities 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay indoors as much as possible 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing 
</P>
<P>
 * Drink plenty of water 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat small meals throughout the day 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid foods high in protein, which increases metabolic heat 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages Heat and Pets 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget dogs and cats on those sweltering, summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to realize that pets suffer from the heat too, it's not just us," 
said Madeline Bernstein, the executive director of the Los Angeles Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. "The biggest problem we have this time of 
year is that pets get left in cars with the windows cracked a tad. It's usually 
fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 If a dog begins to breathe rapidly, has difficulty walking or otherwise 
exhibits signs of disorientation, it may be suffering heat stroke. In that 
case, the animal should be cooled down with lukewarm water (cold can be too 
shocking) and then taken to a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaving a pet's fur in hopes of keeping it cool is not necessarily a good 
idea. The fur insulates against heat just as it does against cold, Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's already too late, Bernstein suggests being extra careful not to 
leave the animal in the sun; animals, like humans, are susceptible to sunburn 
if they are stripped of their protection. The Agony Index

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT; COLLEGE 
DROPS DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN ALLEGED RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pomona College has dropped disciplinary proceedings against a former student 
who was accused of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a woman student filed a charge with the school's disciplinary board, 
accusing the man -- who at that time was a senior -- of having raped her 2 1/2 
years earlier.The charge carried a possible penalty of expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman never reported the incident to police. Legal experts said a criminal 
case would have stood little chance because the woman conceded that she never 
had indicated an objection to having sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rules at the college require that there be explicit consent in order 
for an act of sex to be considered consensual. The issue split the campus 
during the last weeks of school, with protesters who supported the woman saying 
the case typified the problem of date rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The man sued the school and won a court decision that postponed the hearing 
until after commencement, allowing him to graduate in May with the possibility 
that his degree could be revoked. He later filed a lawsuit seeking monetary 
damages from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school dropped the proceedings last week. Pomona spokeswoman Nina Ellerman 
said the college determined that because the man is no longer a student, the 
school does not have jurisdiction to discipline him. On Tuesday, Ellerman said, 
the man's attorney informed Pomona College that he was dropping his suit.

CLUB CASINO'S GENERAL MANAGER QUITS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George G. Hardie, longtime general manager of the Bicycle Club Casino, 
resigned this week to pursue other interests, including a race for county 
commissioner in Clark County, Nev., which includes Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardie, a prominent figure in California's card club industry, said he will 
continue to serve as a consultant to the Bicycle Club, which he has managed 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The casino is being run on an interim basis by a trustee for the government, 
which seized the club in 1990 after it was found to have been built in part 
with $12 million in laundered drug money.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; LETTER OF OBJECTION DELAYS STADIUM VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of a last-minute objection, the City Council delayed a decision this 
week on an earthquake recovery plan aimed at refurbishing Anaheim Stadium or 
possibly building a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium Associates delivered a letter of opposition to the council 15 
minutes before Tuesday night's meeting. According to city codes, the objection 
must be answered before the council can vote on the recovery plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The business, which leases 68 acres of stadium parking lot, contends the 
recovery proposal is actually a city smoke screen to acquire Anaheim Stadium 
Associates' development rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler disagreed with the objections filed by Anaheim Stadium 
Associates. The recovery plan is necessary to help finance stadium repairs 
caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just grasping at straws," Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council designated the stadium and its parking lot a 
redevelopment project, paving the way for financing needed stadium repairs. 
During the earthquake, the stadium's 17-ton scoreboard fell and caused an 
estimated $10 million in damage. Because of that damage, the city is allowed to 
create a redevelopment project without finding that the site is blighted, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the designation, the city will be able to use any increase in tax revenue 
for future development on the 150-acre stadium land. City officials say the 
project eventually may help finance a stadium remodeling or even a new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A new stadium or renovation of the existing one is believed to be a key 
element in any effort to keep the Los Angeles Rams in Orange County, some city 
officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-page letter to the council, Anaheim Stadium Associates argue that if 
the recovery plan is approved and a new stadium built, it would threaten their 
right to develop the parking lot property. The business claims that a 1983 
agreement with the city guarantees them the right to construct 2 million square 
feet of office space in four high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to make a decision on the recovery plan on 
Tuesday.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL QUITS FIGHT ON SPECIAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week announced it will not appeal an Orange County 
Superior Court order to hold a special election on Oct. 18 to replace three 
recalled council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Donald E. Smallwood last month ruled in favor of the Fullerton Recalls 
Committee in a lawsuit seeking the October special election. He later upheld 
his own ruling and denied a request by the city to reconsider his order. 
</P>
<P>
 The only option left to stop the special election from occurring in October 
would be to file an appeal, but it could take the appellate court longer than a 
year to hear the case, city officials said. As a result, council members 
decided to stop fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge ruled that if an appeal was filed, it would not stop his order," 
Councilman Don Bankhead said. "By the time an appeal reached an appellate 
court, the election would already be over with and that would not benefit the 
city. The whole purpose for the appeal is to try to stop the (Oct. 18) election 
to save money." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of the special election will replace Bankhead, Molly McClanahan 
and Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin until their terms expire. Bankhead's term is up in 
1996. McClanahan's and Catlin's seats expire in November. Whoever replaces them 
will serve for about two weeks and then face reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Smallwood ordered the special election in October, the council was 
going to consolidate it with the November general election in an effort to save 
money. But its plan was foiled when the recalls committee filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last year when McClanahan, Bankhead and Catlin voted 
to levy a 2% utility tax, despite protests from hundreds of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan and Catlin called the October special election a waste of 
taxpayers' money. City Clerk Anne M. York said it will cost about $107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest foolishness," Catlin said earlier this week. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; GROUP TO INVESTIGATE STREET LIGHT BILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city-sanctioned committee will investigate whether Southern California 
Edison Co. has billed the city twice for some street lights and charged for 
street lights in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday appointed former Councilman Ray Littrell, Jack Schild 
and Tom Petrosineto the committee, which will include representatives from 
Edison and the city as non-voting members. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members directed the committee to submit its first report in six 
months, but no deadline has been set to complete its work. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials last week suggested formation of the committee during a public 
forum in which street lighting was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Littrell, 59, who has spent the past six months studying the street light 
problem, said in the meeting that taxpayers might be duplicating payments for 
some lights -- at a flat rate and a metered rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said that the city might be paying for street lights in 
Stanton and at border areas with Anaheim, Westminster and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Martin, Edison Co.'s area manager, acknowledged that the city might have 
been double-billed for some street lights, particularly in a parking lot near 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that only nine street lights might be involved, not the hundreds 
that Littrell and Schild have reported. The city has about 7,800 street lights, 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is to determine exactly how many street lights might have been 
double-billed and how the money would be recovered, Littrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be out in the streets checking what's actually out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Littrell said the committee soon will develop a game plan that includes 
determining how much the city is being billed for street lights and how many 
street lights are owned by the city or by Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The city pays a lower monthly rate for city-owned street lights. Littrell's 
committee will determine whether this is better for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also will look at current street-lighting fees to determine 
fairness to property owners, Littrell said. A portion of the fees are used by 
the city for park maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners with street lights have complained that they pay more for park 
maintenance than those with no street lights, although everyone uses the parks, 
and some homeowners contend that they are subsidizing park maintenance for 
everybody in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will find ways to make it more equitable for everybody, Littrell 
said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; PRO-HEADLANDS PAC LED SPENDING IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A political action committee backed by owners of the coastal Headlands 
property led the campaign spending in the recent City Council race, according 
to financial statements filed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concerned Taxpayers of Dana Point spent $19,075 to support three 
candidates in the June race, according to the final report on campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the committee-backed candidates, Harold Kaufman and Karen Lloreda, won 
seats on the council, but the third, William Shepherd, came in fifth in the 
close race for the three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was formed by M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis Securities Co., 
owners of the Headlands property since the 1940s. Chandis Securities, a company 
that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major 
stockholder in Times Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners' plan to build a 400-room hotel and 370 homes on the 121-acre 
Headlands property was a major issue in the council race. A city referendum on 
the $500-million development plan will be held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pro-Headlands development committee, Dana Point United PAC, spent 
$9,353 backing the three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the field of 12 candidates, Shepherd, Kaufman and Lloreda were the 
leading spenders, reporting expenses of $8,686, $8,303 and $8,169 respectively. 
Witold Muller, who finished ninth among 12 candidates in the race, was the 
next-highest spender with $6,127 in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Gallagher, who finished first in the race, spent only $2,604. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY TO DISCUSS USE OF BASE FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are concerned that hundreds of housing units on the Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station could house the homeless after the military vacates 
the base in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 About 550 of the units, being used to house base personnel, are in Irvine, 
near Harvard and Warner avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of 32 homeless services groups want to use some of the units as 
temporary housing for individuals and families in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and Tustin officials plan to meet soon with members of the Orange 
County Homeless Services Coalition to discuss the proposal, which also calls 
for job training and child development centers, including day care and youth 
programs and classes, near the housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to build a community where homeless people can live temporarily 
while they receive job training, said Tim Shaw, executive director of the 
Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, one of the groups in the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition officials proposed that the homeless housing be spread throughout 
the base's 1,500 dwellings. Units not used by the coalition could be used for 
permanent low-cost or market-rate housing, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials expressed reservations about concentrating large groups of 
homeless people at the base. The city's policy has been to scatter low-cost and 
temporary housing units so that they blend with the surrounding community, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want one community to become the homeless community," Councilwoman 
Paula Werner said last week. "We want to take away the stigma." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of the Navy is not expected to consider the coalition's request 
until this fall at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal McKinney Act, the Department of Defense must give homeless 
assistance providers first priority for using vacated military facilities and 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would also need the approval of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services, said Mark 
Tomich, a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 552 base dwellings in the city consist of attached homes and townhouses. 
They were built over the last decade and seem to be in good shape, Tomich said.

<P>
 The gunman and a companion -- described as white men in their early 20s -- 
fled after the shooting on the 7600 block of Amberleaf Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Vergara, 22, was reported in critical condition Wednesday at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to the stomach. 
Angel Campos Silia, 22, was released Wednesday afternoon from Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana after being treated for wounds to the thigh. Both victims are 
of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of the two men who was at the scene was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were in the alley shortly after midnight when the two assailants 
approached and one suddenly fired five or six rounds from a small-caliber 
handgun, said Lt. Luis Ochoa. He said the victims apparently did not know the 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no idea about the reason for the shooting," Ochoa said. 
"As far as a motive, we just don't know right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was described as being about 5 feet, 7 inches tall with 
close-cropped light hair. He was wearing gray pants and a white T-shirt, Ochoa 
said.

'3 STRIKES' SHOULD SPARE YOUTHS, MARCHERS SAY; PROTEST: TEEN-AGERS CALL FOR 
EXCLUSION OF JUVENILE FELONIES AND SAY ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME SHOULD BE 
ADDRESSED. 
</P>

 Contending that the state's "three strikes" law fails to attack the root 
causes of crime, about 100 black and Latino teen-agers on Wednesday called for 
exclusion of juvenile felonies from the law during a peaceful march and rally 
in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need new crime laws to get rid of crime," Jose Herrera, 18, a recent 
high school graduate, told a crowd gathered outside the Welcome Baptist Church 
on South Central Avenue. "We need jobs, recreational opportunities and a better 
education system." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, who plans to attend Los Angeles Community College this fall and 
eventually to study law, said that money spent on new prisons to warehouse 
long-term convicts would be better targeted toward improving living conditions 
in minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing statistics showing that it costs as much to incarcerate a youngster as 
to send him to an elite private college, Herrera concluded, "With no jobs, 
you're going to have someone selling crack or stealing things to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "three strikes" law, offenders with two serious or violent felonies 
face sentences of 25 years to life in prison if convicted of a third felony. 
The failure to differentiate between crimes or to give judges discretion in 
issuing sentences has led some political leaders to call for revisions and also 
has prompted several judges to rebel when issuing sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon rally, under sweltering skies, was organized by the South 
Central Youth Empowered Thru Action, the youth component of the Community 
Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention, a publicly funded organization that 
has campaigned against the rebuilding of liquor stores destroyed in the 1992 
Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Bass, executive director of the substance abuse organization, said the 
law is racist since a majority of adults and youngsters sent to prison in 
California are black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 According to California Department of Justice criminal statistics for 1992, 
28% of felony charges statewide were filed against blacks and 31.6% of blacks 
convicted were sent to prison. An additional 33.8% of felony charges were filed 
against Latinos, and 37.2% of Latinos convicted were sent to prison. On the 
other hand, 34.3% of felony charges statewide were filed against whites, and 
28.9% of whites convicted went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass said the rally was an effort to focus attention on problems with the law 
so that more minority community leaders and elected officials would take a 
stand against it.  
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't that we oppose sanctions against crime," Bass said. "The problem is 
the hysteria right now of passing a massive social policy because of a couple 
murders." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were 133 murders in the area covered by the Los Angeles 
Police Department's 77th Street bureau, where the 10-block march concluded. In 
the area covered by the Southeast bureau, where the march began, there were 133 
murders. In contrast, the West Los Angeles bureau reported 10 murders in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those at the march were activist Michael Zinzun, chairman of the 
Coalition Against Police Abuse, and several teen-agers dressed in fake prison 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're young you're less aware of right and wrong," said Ashonte Burley, 
16, who held a sign reading "3 Strikes Rule Is Unfair to Youth." "As you get 
older, you get wiser." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to "three strikes" was not universal among those whose path the 
march crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauty salon co-owner Laurease Botiz, after watching the parade pass her 
heavily gated windows, said the law may help make high-crime neighborhoods 
safer.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes 'three strikes' to keep gangbangers off the streets, I'm for it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Botiz said violent felonies by juveniles should be counted as strikes because 
"any 15-year-old knows the difference between good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gov. Pete Wilson signed the law in March, the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office has filed 749 "three strikes" cases.

STEALING PIZZA COULD BE THIRD STRIKE FOR FELON; CRIME: SUSPECT TELLS POLICE HE 
DIDN'T EVEN EAT THE SLICE HE IS ACCUSED OF TAKING FROM CHILDREN AT REDONDO 
BEACH PIER. HE FACES ROBBERY CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A convicted felon could be looking at life in prison under the "three strikes" 
law for stealing a slice of pepperoni pizza he says he didn't even eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dewayne Williams, 27, of Los Angeles is facing robbery charges for 
taking the pizza from four children, ages 7 to 14, while they were sitting at 
Adam's Pizza on the Redondo Beach city pier Saturday evening. Because of his 
prior felony convictions, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison 
under the "three strikes" law passed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said Williams, who is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs about 220 
pounds, and an unidentified companion allegedly approached the outdoor table 
where the three boys and one girl were sitting and demanded a piece of their 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Williams) said something to the kids, and they were in shock, they didn't 
say anything," said the manager of Adam's Pizza, who did not want to be 
identified by name. "So he just reached down and took some of their pizza. Then 
his friend took some, and then another one (of Williams' group) took some. They 
only left the kids about two slices of pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and the other members of his group walked away laughing, the manager 
said. Williams later was arrested at a nearby video games arcade after the 
pizza store manager called police. The others eluded police. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has pleaded innocent to the robbery charges. His attorney was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach police Detective Mark Sturgeon said Williams told police that he 
and some family members had been playing a game of "Truth or Dare" and that his 
brother-in-law had dared him to take some pizza from the children. Sturgeon 
said Williams claimed he didn't eat the pizza he allegedly stole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a New York-style pepperoni pizza," Sturgeon said. "But (Williams) told 
me he doesn't eat pork, so he threw it in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say taking the pizza constituted a robbery, or at least felony 
petty theft. According to court records, Williams has accumulated four felony 
convictions -- for robbery, attempted robbery, drug possession and unauthorized 
use of a motor vehicle -- since 1987. Another felony conviction could send him 
to prison for 25 years to life under the "three strikes" law. The law requires 
the lengthy sentence for any felon who already has been convicted of two or 
more violent or serious felonies.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the district attorney's position that this ("three strikes") is 
the law and we're going to enforce it," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shapiro, 
who filed the complaint charging Williams with two counts of second-degree 
robbery and one count of felony petty theft. The "three strikes" allegation 
also was filed against Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro added that senior administrators in the district attorney's office 
could decide not to make it a "three strikes" case.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST / SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 2 MORE CITIES VOTE 
AIRPORT STUDY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South County cities opposing the conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station into a commercial airport have reached near unanimity in jointly 
funding a $250,000 study to come up with alternative uses for the 4,700-acre 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest and San Juan Capistrano agreed Tuesday to help with the funding, 
and the only South County city yet to join the study, Laguna Hills, is 
scheduled to consider the issue next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of cities, known as the South County Working Group, is counting 
on the study as a major weapon in the campaign against converting the air base 
into a major commercial airport once the facility is closed because of federal 
military cutbacks. An initiative to build the airport will go to the voters on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides supporting a study, Lake Forest decided Tuesday to take direct action 
against the El Toro Airport Initiative, with council members agreeing to file a 
lawsuit to remove the measure from the ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 But airport supporters said Wednesday that the coalition's tactics will not be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is just a waste of time and money," said Irv Pickler, an Anaheim 
councilman and member of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, a group 
of North County cities pushing for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they feel they can beat the initiative -- and that's possible in a court 
of law -- more power to them," Pickler said. "I don't remember any initiative 
that has qualified for the ballot being thrown out prior to it being voted on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Regional Airport Authority had asked the South County 
coalition if it could contribute ideas and funding to the land-use study but 
was turned down by South County officials, who said the request came too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to contribute and be a part of that study," Pickler said. "Let's 
make it encompass all, and we'll pick up our fair share of the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the South County cities have nearly all approved contributing for the 
study, some dissenting voices on the city councils have been heard. 
</P>
<P>
 In both Lake Forest and San Juan Capistrano, appropriations to fund the study 
passed on 3-2 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Councilwoman Helen Wilson said the study might not be ready for up 
to 14 weeks, just before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our goal isn't to create a unified mailing piece opposing the airport 
measure, (the study) just doesn't make sense," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, Councilman Gil Jones said he is uncomfortable spending 
money on an issue that he believes serves only two or three cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a problem spending (city funds) in a political sinkhole," he said. 
"This is a north-south issue at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in other South County cities have estimated that the study could be 
ready in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant being hired, Kotein, Regan & Mouchly Inc., will be asked to 
look at several previous airport studies, some of which have concluded that the 
El Toro site isn't viable for a commercial airfield. FRANK MESSINA and JEFF 
BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL BLOCKS VOTE ON TAX FOR BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman David Sullivan has failed to garner support for a November 
ballot measure to let voters decide whether to eliminate a tax that goes toward 
city employee retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 city employees at Tuesday's City Council meeting whooped and 
hollered when the council rejected the proposal. Sullivan introduced a motion 
for his ballot measure, but none of his colleagues supported it, so there was 
no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members expressed concerns that if the municipal tax -- which 
costs each Huntington Beach homeowner about $84 a year -- was repealed it would 
have a devastating effect on the city's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimated a possible loss of $6.25 million, which would mean 
substantial cutbacks in services and city personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the bottom line is this is a great city and we must provide a certain 
number of services," said Councilwoman Grace Winchell, who lauded city workers 
as "good, responsible employees." 
</P>
<P>
 "To cut $6 million would be totally irresponsible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva charged that if the tax were repealed, it would equate to 
a tax shift since other taxes would need to be raised to cover the lost 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tax increase in the city," Silva said. "I can't support it. It 
would end up costing taxpayers more money in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been collecting the tax, which appears on property tax bills as 
"Huntington Beach city debt," since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach is the only city in Orange County in which a property tax 
levy is used to pay for employee retirement costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he raised the issue because he believes a vast majority of 
citizens don't know that they are paying the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he was proposing "an up or down vote on this tax." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we put it on the ballot, an overwhelming number of citizens in the 
community would stop that tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax helps pay for the city's $9.7-million yearly cost of employee 
retirement benefits. The city picks up the employee cost for these. The benefit 
was negotiated years ago with employee groups in lieu of salary increases and 
has continued over the years.  
</P>
<P>
 If the tax money were lost, City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said, at 
least 75 jobs would have to be cut and drastic reductions would be made in the 
police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said Tuesday that "the battle was lost tonight, but I'm not so sure 
that the war has been lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan added that citizens who favor eliminating the tax could organize to 
get the issue placed on a future ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the council voted to ask the county assessor to reword 
property tax bills to clearly state that they include a tax for employee 
retirement costs. Sullivan cast the only vote against the action. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; RESOLUTION ENDORSES RAMS' LOCAL PRESENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city loves the Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the message in a recent City Council resolution that urged the Rams 
not to leave Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-0 vote last week, the council passed the resolution, which is similar 
to those being endorsed by other cities in the county, including Santa Ana. The 
resolution noted that although Anaheim is the home of the Rams, the football 
team brings economic benefits "throughout the Orange County area." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution also praised Rams players for helping out with many local 
charities. If the Rams move, the resolution said, many charities "will suffer 
because of a loss of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Business in Orange County would be hurt if the Rams leave, according to the 
resolution. The measure said that many businesses, such as restaurants and 
hotels, "enjoy more trade because of the Rams," and that some people in the 
county "will become unemployed if the Rams move." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the resolution warned that the county could not contemplate luring a 
replacement team if the Rams were to pull out. "Other teams in the National 
Football League will be closely watching the situation with the Rams to 
determine if the fan support is sufficient to support professional football in 
Orange County," the resolution said. BILL BILLITER

FEMALE DISPATCHER SUES NEWPORT POLICE FOR HARASSMENT; LITIGATION: SHE IS 11TH 
FORMER EMPLOYEE TO FILE SUCH AN ACTION SINCE 1992. LAWYER FOR EX-CHIEF AND A 
CAPTAIN SCOFFS AT CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Another former Newport Beach police dispatcher has filed a sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the city, its ex-chief and a former police captain, charging 
she was ogled, subjected to unwanted sexual advances and other discrimination 
while at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by former dispatcher Michelle Johnson brings to 11 the number of 
female Police Department employees who have filed such harassment suits since 
1992. Three of 10 women who joined the original suit in 1992 have reached 
out-of-court settlements with the city. Seven others remain plaintiffs in the 
case, which is scheduled for trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit she filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, Johnson 
charged that former Capt. Anthony J. Villa Jr. leered and asked if she had a 
boyfriend on her first day at work in 1989, then touched her and made unwanted 
advances during her years with the department. She claimed this conduct was 
condoned by former Chief Arb Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also charged that Villa jeered and frightened her by flinging his arm 
at her when she told him in 1992 she was thinking of going to law school. 
"Several male colleagues had pursued the same course of education . . . and had 
not been harassed about it by Villa," Johnson said in the lawsuit, which seeks 
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa declined to comment Wednesday. Attempts to reach Campbell were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney representing Villa and Campbell dismissed Johnson's claims as 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like she just copied it from from the other (harassment) 
complaint," attorney Jeffrey Epstein said. "It's as baseless a claim as the 
others. I just don't think there's any basis whatsoever for her bringing the 
complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 City personnel records indicated Johnson quit her dispatcher's job to go to 
law school in August, 1992. (Her lawsuit says she left last year.) Johnson did 
not return calls to her home in Agoura Hills. She represented herself in filing 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the suit took city officials by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally out of the blue," City Atty. Robert Burnham said. "We 
conducted an extensive investigation, and this name hasn't come up. . . . We're 
in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayor Clarence J. Turner: "I'm surprised she didn't join the other 
plaintiffs or step forward before this time. . . . We'll just have to 
investigate and see what the grounds of the complaint are." 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the cases against the department was filed in September, 1992, by 
four female employees of the department, charging that Villa made lewd comments 
and touched them improperly and that Campbell tolerated the behavior. Six 
others joined the suit later. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the original allegations, the city has paid $275,000 to 11 current and 
former employees of the Police Department to settle harassment claims. Eight of 
those workers received money in exchange for a promise not to join the lawsuit. 
Three of the employees on the original suit settled with the city this year, 
including a former dispatcher who accused Campbell and Villa of raping her 
after a police party in 1981. In the settlement agreements, the two men 
admitted no wrongdoing but settled in order to avoid the costs of mounting a 
legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa and Campbell have always denied the charges but were fired separately 
after a 1992 city investigation into the sexual harassment allegations. They 
sued the city, charging wrongful termination, and were reinstated last June 
long enough for the city to retire them with benefits. In exchange, they 
dropped a civil lawsuit against the city and waived their rights to the civil 
service hearings they had demanded to clear their names. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement agreement with Campbell at the time said the city investigation 
produced "no corroborated evidence that Campbell sexually harassed any female 
employee . . . (or) condoned any specific act of misconduct on the part of any 
of his peers or subordinates."

 A lottery machine serviceman was shot and slightly wounded Wednesday during a 
botched robbery at a drive-through dairy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Kim, 48, of Buena Park was grazed in the shoulder and back of the head 
in the 8 a.m. shooting at the Rockview Dairy at Crescent Avenue and Moody 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to La Palma Police Sgt. Sven Hansen, a car with three people in it 
drove into the Rockview Dairy, and one of the passengers got out of the car and 
demanded money from the owner at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "As this is happening, there happens to be an independent repairman for the 
lottery machines," standing by the sales counter, Hansen said. Kim "turns and 
sees the guy with the gun and starts running away." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman shot at Kim, then fled in the car, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the attacker's car as a white, two-door compact import with 
blue and gold license plate. The last three numbers are 177, Hansen said.

AWARD TO RESIDENTS GROUP GREATER THAN REPORTED; LAW: A CLERK MISINTERPRETS 
JUDGE'S RULING IN SMALL-CLAIMS COURT. NEIGHBOR ORDERED TO PAY $90,575, NOT 
$50,175.

<P>
 The Municipal Court judge who ruled in favor of a group of Huntington Harbour 
residents against their neighbor explained Wednesday that the amount of his 
judgment was much higher than what a clerk had indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents were awarded $90,575, not $50,175 as the court clerk reported 
Tuesday to several news organizations, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Corey S. Cramin had consolidated the claims that couples from the 
upscale enclave had filed against Elena Zagustin for purposes of the court 
hearing only, but he awarded each spouse a separate judgment of $5,000. The 
maximum judgment in small-claims court is $5,000; a joint claim would have 
limited awards to $5,000 for each couple. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervising clerk at Municipal Court in Westminster said the judge's 
comments on the case files made it seem that he awarded joint judgments to 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "He consolidated the claims for hearing purposes only, not for the judgment," 
clerk Carol Kuzio said. "I was trying to explain that ruling (Tuesday), and 
that's where the misinterpretation came about." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents used a tactic that originated with an Oakland group -- called 
Safe Streets Now! -- to take Zagustin, an engineering professor, to 
small-claims court in an effort to force her to clean up her house or move. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past eight years, Zagustin's home has been cited for code violations, 
and criminal and civil complaints have been filed against her by the city of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen of her neighbors filled Cramin's courtroom Monday, seeking $5,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's leader, who had been informed of the lower judgment Tuesday, said 
Wednesday that the $90,575 judgment would make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors all think that whether its $50,000 or $90,000, that's still not 
enough to get Elena to move, whether that's movement to clean up or movement to 
move," David Flynn said. "Everything's the same. It's still not enough to meet 
our end goal. The extra amount might speed it up a little bit, but not that 
much."  
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors nevertheless see Cramin's rulings as a victory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just happy that the judge found us to be correct," he said. "We didn't 
think we'd make it with one jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin, who owns several Orange County properties, has said that her house 
is clean and that she has no intention of moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about the neighborhood's court hearing prompted a host of calls 
Wednesday, Flynn said. But he warned that the Safe-Streets-Now! tactic -- used 
predominantly to force evictions of drug-selling tenants or crack down on 
slumlords -- should not be used by those engaged in petty disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping that people won't get into this thing and start suing their 
neighbors because their lawn is two inches too high," he said.

VISITOR, 43, FALLS OFF BOAT, DROWNS AT MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 43-year-old visitor from England drowned Wednesday when he fell off a boat 
docked at a marina in the Back Bay area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name was withheld until family members could be notified, fell 
off the 32-foot vessel sometime after 3 p.m. It was tied to a slip at a marina 
at 300 E. Coast Highway, according to Lt. Jim Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 William Pannell, who lives on the boat, told police he pulled the man on 
board, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is scheduled this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they were drinking," Carson said, "although we won't know the 
victim's condition until we get the toxicology reports."

KIDS IN STREET, TOYS ON LAWN LAND HOMEOWNERS IN COURT; LAWSUIT: COVENANT 
VIOLATIONS ARE A DETRIMENT TO PROPERTY VALUES, NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION SAYS IN 
SEEKING INJUNCTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Dan and Jeanette Troesken allegedly have committed the no-nos of the Highland 
Light Village Assn.'s rules of good housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 They have left toys in their front lawn. They have fixed their cars in the 
garage with the door open. They have allowed their children to play in the 
street. Their Venetian blinds in the front window are askew. They have 
permitted guests to park their cars on the street for days. They have oil 
stains on their driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Highland Light alleged in a lawsuit filed in Superior Court this 
week, the Troeskens violated the association's Declaration of Covenants, 
Conditions and Restrictions, otherwise known to residents belonging to 
homeowners groups as CC&Rs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Troeskens' violations are "unsightly and a detriment and damage to the 
value of the property of the plaintiff," the lawsuit states. Highland Light is 
seeking a court injunction ordering the couple to obey the CC&Rs and to pay 
unspecified damages and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawsuit named Dan and Jeanette Troesken because they own the house 
at 2140 Via Teca, Jeanette Troesken's daughter, Valerie Keys, and her husband 
have rented it for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Keys said Wednesday that she is being unfairly targeted because "they do not 
like renters here. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Keys, standing near her crooked Venetian blinds, said she plans to countersue 
the association for what she termed harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a leg to stand on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keys, 33, admitted that she and her husband, Drew, have left oil spots on the 
driveway. He rebuilds race cars and has worked on some of them in the garage, 
his wife said. They have periodically cleaned their driveway and have scheduled 
another cleanup in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read the CC&R many times, and most of the things they listed aren't even 
in the book," Valerie Keys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three children, whose ages range from 2 to 9, have played in the street 
and have left toys on the lawn, Keys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules do say kids can't play in the street, but up until six months ago, 
they didn't have a park to play" in, she said. "All I did was what most normal 
people do who have children, and I got picked on for being a nice mom." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Highland Light could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, between December, 1991, and May of this year, 
Highland Light has sent the Troeskens 16 certified notices informing them of 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other violations alleged in the lawsuit include allowing a trailer to be 
parked periodically at their home, leaving a motorcycle parked against the side 
of their garage and allowing their dogs to roam loose and failing to pick up 
their pets' droppings.

DRIVER'S LOAD OF CIGARETTES BLAMED IN PART FOR CRASH

 A brimming carload of cigarettes blocked the view of a driver involved in a 
collision Tuesday night that critically injured the other driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the passenger and rear seats of Muhammad K. Minaie's Mercedes Benz 
were piled high with cardboard boxes of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Minaie, 48, of Yorba Linda was driving north on Fairmont Boulevard about 8:30 
p.m. when Kimberly Ann Smith, 19, pulled onto the street from Lorca Lane, said 
Brea traffic officer Dean Fleig, whose department patrols Yorba Linda. Minaie 
struck Smith broadside on the driver's side of her vehicle. Minaie "could see 
out the front, but his view was blocked to the right," Fleig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, of Yorba Linda, suffered head injuries and was in critical condition at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana on Wednesday. A 14-year-old boy in her car was 
treated for injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Minaie was cited for driving with an obstructed view. He was treated for minor 
injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the collision was still under investigation Wednesday, but Fleig 
said the blocked view appeared to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Minaie was taking the cigarettes to several stores that he owns.

STATE REJECTS STUDENT'S CLAIM IN CSUF SPANKING INCIDENT 
</P>

<P>
 The state Board of Control has rejected a claim by a Cal State Fullerton 
student who was struck on the bare behind by a professor, a move that allows 
the student to file a discrimination lawsuit against the university, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Keary Johns, 23, said he believes racism played a role in the April 27 
incident, in which Prof. Emeritus Julian Foster has admitted striking Johns 
with a ruler as the student was bent over a chair. Johns is African American 
and Foster -- who said the incident was a joke that got out of hand -- is 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Control met Tuesday and rejected Johns' claim, a procedure that 
must be completed before a lawsuit can be filed against the state, Deputy 
Executive Officer Curt Soderlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soderlund said the decision does not reflect the board's view on whether the 
claim possesses merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this is the procedural go-ahead for a lawsuit," he said. "This 
basically means this case involves complex issues of law that would be better 
addressed in a courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana civil rights attorney Ron Talmo, who is representing Johns, said he 
intends to file a lawsuit within weeks seeking $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns says he was trying to drop Foster's class when the professor said he 
would first have to submit to a swatting. Johns said he only agreed to drop his 
sweat pants because he wanted to graduate and needed to keep a failing grade 
from appearing on his report card. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, however, says he was reprimanding Johns for not taking his schoolwork 
seriously when Johns suggested a spanking as punishment. Foster said he thought 
it was a joke and was playing along and was shocked when Johns dropped his 
pants. He said he regrets "lightly swatting" Johns as part of the joke, but 
stresses that race played no role. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said proper action has been taken against the teacher, but 
declined to elaborate. Officials said Foster is not scheduled to teach at the 
school during coming semesters.

AROUND THE VALLEY: MILD-MANNERED MEMBERS WELCOME NOVICE TO THE CRUISE CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 25 years I've done some kooky things while roaming this town for stories. 
</P>
<P>
 I've flown with a member of a women's pilots club calling out on the radio for 
the long-vanished Amelia Earhart. I've stood among the costumed troops and 
gunpowder haze of a mock Civil War battle, notebook in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But I had never before cruised the boulevard. Any boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the skirmishes between cruisers and police have been a fixture of L.A. 
and Valley life for as long as I can remember, I was never drawn to the milieu 
of metallic paint jobs and throbbing music. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been a central part of teen-age life in the '50s, an awesome 
spectacle on Van Nuys Boulevard in the '60s, a cultural mainstay on Whittier 
Boulevard, but I'd just as soon attend a lecture on the life cycle of the 
three-spined stickleback as ride in procession past thousands of adolescents 
looking at my car. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't even wash my car. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with no great expectations, therefore, and no little apprehension, that 
I drove on assignment Sunday night to the notorious La Rinda Plaza. La Rinda is 
the shopping center in Sylmar where the city, responding to neighbors' 
complaints of hooliganism, trash and traffic nightmares, is currently trying to 
eliminate cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot was shadowy and quiet when I arrived about 8:30, the only crowd in 
sight a band of evangelists passing out flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But just before 9, a line of cars swooped into the lot and snapped with 
military precision into parallel parking spots. Soon another row of cars took 
up facing positions, and the drivers, along with their women and a baby or two, 
got out and stood beside their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting to see that there would be no immediate hostility, I approached 
a young man on the periphery. Within seconds, I was surrounded by a dozen 
members of the club Neu Exposure, all aflutter at having the ear of anyone 
wearing a jacket and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The president, 24-year-old Leo Rodriguez, good-naturedly chastised the news 
media for their style of reporting on the La Rinda campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were called malefactors, miscreants," he said. "What does that mean? We're 
trash?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and his girlfriend, Rachel Torres, are bright, sociable people, both 
graduates of San Fernando Valley high schools. They work regular jobs and speak 
passionately of the virtues of cruising, which they contend gives young people 
positive values. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he introduced Bobby Juarez, a stocky man with a half-inch 
haircut and a Fu Manchu face. "He works at In-N-Out during the day and at night 
he works in a hospital," Rodriguez said. Juarez also had his wife and infant 
daughter with him. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9:30, an LAPD car circled the lot, loudspeaker blaring: "Everybody get 
in your cars and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you want to cruise with us?" Rodriguez asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I got in a white Buick with Sal Lopez, 19, and his friend Peps Noguera, 17, 
who doesn't have a driver's license, but owns a $1,500 show bike. They both 
work at Magic Mountain to support their hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Neu Exposure's cars, about a dozen, varied from lovingly painted and polished 
vans and pickups to Lopez's ordinary Buick, which he borrowed from his brother 
after thieves took his Astro. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars moved west on Rinaldi Street, then south on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
Making a formation U-turn, they parked along the wall of the cemetery next to 
San Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgriguez said cruisers are blamed unfairly for littering the cemetery. 
"Personally, I have never seen anybody throw any litter over the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Just then, one of the members ripped a temporary "No Parking" sign from a lamp 
post and sailed it over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez grinned with embarrassment, and then handled the delicate duty of 
correcting the culprit without accusing him directly. Whoever this person was, 
Rodriguez said -- naming no names -- should consider that someone's grandmother 
is buried there, and how would he like to find litter on his grandma's grave? 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Neu Exposure said they are not cholos, gang bangers or taggers. 
They just want to show off their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to a party and get shot up faster than you can get shot up here," 
Rachel Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, through the night, none of the club members drank any alcohol or said 
a provocative word to a fellow cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 They applauded cars they liked, especially those that danced hydraulic-powered 
jigs. Their most enthusiastic acclamation was for a faded VW bus -- a throwback 
to the hippie '60s -- that bounced its front wheels a foot off the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 10, Rodriguez began thinking ahead to the customary police 
attempts to drive the cruisers away, looking for escape routes the club could 
use if police blocked the street later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go for a stroll," he said, meaning a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's driving style was impeccable as the cars circled through a traffic 
jam, round and round the quarter-mile row of parked cars on the cruising strip. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30, the police moved in, lights flashing. In a classic pincer 
movement, they sealed off the street. By the time the last car was released 
through the barricade, 93 tickets had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Neu Exposure's cars escaped, however, sliding out a side road, just as 
Rodriguez had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not displeased. I don't doubt residents who say their lawns or houses 
have been defiled and they fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just harder to want to eradicate those who have welcomed you into their 
club.

BASEBALL SEASON MIGHT END TODAY; LABOR: ANGERED BY THE OWNERS' LATEST MANEUVER, 
PLAYERS REPRESENTATIVES WILL VOTE AND COULD CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The baseball players union is expected to poll its 28 player representatives 
either today or Friday to consider moving up the Aug. 12 strike deadline in 
response to the owners' refusal to make a pension payment of almost $8 million 
that was due on Aug. 1 from All-Star game receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machinery is in place to consider it," Gene Orza, the union's associate 
general counsel, said Wednesday of the plan to poll the respective 
representatives. "We have an awful lot of angry players." 
</P>
<P>
 While there was sentiment in some clubhouses Wednesday for an immediate 
walkout, union sources said it is more likely that current series will be 
completed and that an earlier strike, if approved, would begin Friday, with 
today's games being the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consideration, the sources said, also might be given to the strictly 
punitive act of moving the deadline to Sept. 30, allowing the players to 
receive all of their salary and assuredly wiping out the postseason and the 
owners' $140 million in TV revenue, but an earlier August date appears more 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said the union's New York office was flooded with calls from upset 
players Wednesday after it was revealed the owners were withholding payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say what you want about the players, but they understand a couple 
things," Orza said. "They understand what constitutes fair play and what does 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start playing with their wives and children (by tampering with 
benefit plans), you've gone beyond fair play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an all-time low, as I said yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 At Anaheim Stadium Wednesday night, Chili Davis of the Angels said players 
wouldn't have participated in the recent All-Star game if they knew the pension 
payment was going to be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this has brought us even more together as a unit and made us more 
determined to go on strike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger player representative Brett Butler met with teammates for 40 minutes 
and said: "All bets are off. I can tell you the players are upset with the 
things that have been going on. It seems like the flicker of hope (for a labor 
settlement) has been snuffed out with the way (the owners) have gone about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The union vented some of its anger during a two-hour resumption of collective 
bargaining negotiations in New York Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no progress on the critical issues, but Don Fehr, the union's 
executive director, said there was explosive response by the union in regard to 
the pension payment. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the owners of keeping the almost $8 million "so they can fund a 
strike with the players money. It's insulting, stupid and a cheap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in the history of our contentious relationship have they done anything 
like this," Fehr said. "We're researching our legal options and will take the 
appropriate action. I have no doubt they'll eventually pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners negotiator Richard Ravitch reiterated Wednesday that he considered it 
perfectly normal and a common practice in all industries to withhold funds when 
there is no bargaining agreement in place, the baseball contract having expired 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a four-year agreement that said very specifically what the owners 
shall contribute to the fund," he said. "It also said the owners are under no 
obligation to make any contributions beyond the terms of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Making no apologies for his hard-line approach, Ravitch said both sides knew 
there were economic pitfalls during collective bargaining and that the players 
benefited significantly from the owners' decision not to stage a lockout during 
spring training or the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners assumed a tremendous risk with that decision because they knew the 
players could strike at any point and create a tremendous disruption in the 
game," Ravitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, said the conditions of employment can be changed only through 
collective bargaining, and that even Ravitch and his staff admitted that the 
conditions had not been changed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Ravitch that the union made public, Fehr told owners their 
decision was "in contravention of all custom and practice." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a cheap shot, and a blind one, and was intended that way," he wrote. 
"Why the players would want to be 'partners' with people who do that is beyond 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by phone, Fehr added: "They can't agree to the players services in 
the All-Star game and then not pay them. I asked Ravitch if he thought the 
players would have played the All-Star game knowing the owners intended to 
withhold the only compensation the players receive and he had the gall to say, 
'Gee, I don't know.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's just sophistry bull. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's Ravitch's idea or the owners as a group, but it's just 
part of the plan to drive the players out. As I've said before, this is not a 
fight of the players' making, but they won't be intimidated. They're not going 
to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr also said "there was considerable pressure within the union to not 
participate in the All-Star game" but that management asked them to hold off on 
a strike because of the game's importance to the Pittsburgh Pirates and the 
owners' new TV alliance with ABC and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the two sides will hold another bargaining session today amid the 
deteriorating relationship and a claim by sources close to the negotiations 
that the big-market clubs, often portrayed as having no desire for a prolonged 
work stoppage, have agreed to shut down for the season if the players strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim commissioner Bud Selig denied that, saying there is no such agreement. 
He insisted again, however, that there is definite unanimity among the often 
splintered owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've risen out of the morass of big-market, small-market self interest," he 
said. "There's unanimity on our side and unanimity on their's, but we have to 
stop telling each other that and find a system that will be beneficial to 
both."

DREAM BEGINS ALL OVER; BASKETBALL: DREAM TEAM II, CLAIMING TO BE GREATEST EVER, 
OPENS AGAINST SPAIN TONIGHT IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Young, trash-talking Son of Dream Team, having already nominated itself as the 
greatest in basketball history, plays its first game of the 1994 World 
Championships tonight as Coach Don Nelson throws a three-guard lineup at Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson says the unit with 6-foot-7 Reggie Miller at forward plays well 
together and maintains he didn't pull the names out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he could beat poor Spain with five guards, which would be a good 
option if suspense were an objective. However, Son of Dream Team wants to show 
the world that in this game the big dog still wears the Stars and Stripes and 
also to prove it's better than the Real Dream Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of this squad say they would beat their elders, with Shaquille 
O'Neal adding, "Easily."  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, acknowledging graciously that this is a junior varsity compared with 
the Michael-Magic-Larry-Charles team that dominated the Barcelona Olympics, has 
his own harp to play: reminding an NBA increasingly mired in macho slowdowns 
what fast-break basketball is like. 
</P>
<P>
 His U.S. players will press and force the pace. Chuck Daly's staid Dreamers 
beat Olympic opponents by an average of 44 points a game, but if they elbowed 
the occasional Angolan, they didn't hound teams as Nelson intends to. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA competition committee will soon meet to recommend rules changes. 
Nelson hopes to preserve his vision of basketball as opposed to, say, Knick 
Coach Pat Riley's. "Our scores have come down every year for the last 10 
years," Nelson said recently at the Chicago training camp. "It's to the point 
where it's becoming boring. We're getting into these 70-point games that are 
total control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys pound it inside and take time off the 24-second clock. It's become so 
predictable, it's almost sickening occasionally. Where is the basketball, the 
things that we have done for years? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bunk to say the Knicks don't have offensive players. That's a bunch of 
baloney. . . . Take Charles Smith. He could have averaged 20 points and he has 
averaged 20 points, but he's been limited to a seven-point scoring average and 
they're making him a brute. That's just an example. It's so boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Jordan the last three or four years wasn't driving to the goal as 
much because he was getting punished. He didn't want to do that any more. He 
didn't want to take that beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a few of us warning the league in meetings the last four or five 
years, 'Hey, this game is headed in the wrong direction.' They always said, 
'Well, look at the ratings. Look at the popularity. You guys are crazy. Don't 
fix it if it's not broken.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, now for the first time, they're starting to take a look at it because 
they've been taking some criticism and rightly so." 
</P>
<P>
 If the cocky Americans can actually walk the walk, this tournament will be a 
U.S. clinic with the other participants happy to go home with a photo of 
themselves with O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, here's a look at the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Pool A with the Americans: 
</P>
<P>
 Spain -- A European power in the 1970s, it aged and stumbled to ninth in the 
Barcelona Olympics two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil -- Hot-shooting Oscar Schmidt and fast-talking Marcel Souza are gone, 
so this high-spirited, high-scoring team is a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 China -- Coach Jiang Xingquan says he saw the Dream Team crush opponents "as 
easily as eating bean curd" and knows what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Pool B: 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia -- With the late Drazen Petrovic, Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja, they 
played the Dream Team even for 15 minutes of the '92 Olympic final. But 
Petrovic died in a car crash last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia -- Andrew Gaze, borrowed by Seton Hall for a year, is the leading 
scorer, but NBA scouts want to see 6-10 power forward Mark Bradtke. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba -- Athletic but inexperienced at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea -- The tournament's smallest team, it qualified when North Korea 
dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Pool C: 
</P>
<P>
 Canada -- Celtic Rick Fox joins 6-10 warhorse Mike Smrek on a well-coached 
team that should advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia -- A far cry from what it was before the Soviet breakup, since its best 
players -- Sarunas Marciulionis and Arvidas Sabonis -- were Lithuanians. In 
'92, Marciulionis organized Lithuania's Olympic entry (with help from the 
Grateful Dead, who played a benefit), but this time he has been convalescing 
from a knee injury. Russia was fourth in its own Goodwill Games. NBA scouts are 
checking out guards Sergei Babkov and Sergei Bazarevich. 
</P>
<P>
 Angola -- After Charles Barkley elbowed one of them, they went on to finish 
10th at Barcelona, upsetting host Spain in what was deemed a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina -- Forward Marcelo Nicola was a second-round draft choice of the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pool D: 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Rico -- Won the gold at the Goodwill Games with a veteran team headed 
by former U.S. collegians such as Jose Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece -- Coach Efthimis Kioumourtzoglou clashed with center Panayotis 
Fasoulas and went home, leaving the team to assistant Makis Dedrinos. If 
nothing else, the Greeks still lead the tournament in syllables. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany -- Detlef Schrempf and Chris Welp aren't playing, so former Tar Heel 
Henrik Rodl is their star. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt -- Two African teams are guaranteed invitations, but there are few 
professional leagues on the continent. Egyptian Coach Robert Taylor, a native 
of Cleveland, says they're here for the experience.

FOR NASCAR DRIVERS . . .; BRICKYARD 400 IS THE BIG TEST; SATURDAY'S RACE STARTS 
NEW ERA FOR FOYT, EARNHARDT AND FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brickyard 400, which will usher in a new era in motor racing Saturday when 
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway showcases Winston Cup stock cars on a track 
heretofore used exclusively for Indy cars, might present an unusual challenge 
to the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis, with its shallow nine-degree banking, is almost flat compared 
with the 31-degree, high-banked superspeedways of Daytona and Talladega, where 
stock cars careen through the turns sometimes three abreast. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stock car racing analysts look at Indianapolis as "a road course where 
all the turns are left." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the leading Winston Cup drivers have tested at Indianapolis since the 
race was announced, but they don't know what it will be like when 44 cars are 
on the 2 1/2-mile rectangular oval at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The best measure of what to expect might come from a look at the nine stock 
car races held at now-defunct Ontario Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario, which rose like a $30-million mushroom out of the vineyards of 
Cucamonga to become the Taj Mahal of racing in 1970 only to be leveled 10 years 
later by the wrecking ball, had the same nine-degree banking and dimensions for 
its 2 1/2-mile track as Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, the nine races produced a variety of results, from the 
1974 victory of Bobby Allison in a Matador, described as "the most exciting 
race ever run at Ontario Motor Speedway," to the 1975 victory of Buddy Baker, 
whose Ford led 140 (of 200) laps of what was probably the most boring race at 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison's victory was later protested and car owner Roger Penske was fined 
$9,100 by NASCAR officials for using an illegal engine. At the time, it was the 
largest fine ever levied against a winning car owner. The winner's purse was 
only $15,125. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Foyt won the inaugural race in 1971 before 78,810 spectators in such 
perfect conditions that even Foyt, the irascible Texan, was moved to say: "The 
weather today was really beautiful . . . for California." 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt won the first two races, and Benny Parsons, now a TV commentator, took 
the last two. In between, Bobby Allison won in 1974 and 1978, David Pearson in 
1976, the late Neil Bonnett in 1977 and Baker in 1975. There was no race in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, defending Winston Cup champion and a favorite here this week, 
has fond memories of Ontario. He drove there as a rookie in 1979 and clinched 
the first of his six championships there in 1980 with a fifth-place behind 
Parsons that enabled him to edge Cale Yarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indy is basically the same track we drove at Ontario," Earnhardt said 
Wednesday as the Speedway infield filled with NASCAR transporters. "I liked 
that race track and I think what I learned back then will help me Saturday. 
There will be a lot of drafting down the straightaways, the way we did at 
Ontario, and there will be some slingshot passing coming out of the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to see a lot of cars on the lead lap, like Ontario. That's 
because it's so far around these tracks that it takes more doing to lose a lap 
than it does at some of the high-banked places we drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest difference (with) Ontario won't be the track, but the cars. 
They're so much more sophisticated, the air around the car moves better and the 
tires are so much improved. I can't wait to get out there (on the Indy track)." 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt, one of three drivers in the first Ontario race who will try to qualify 
for the Brickyard 400 today, believes that the changes made recently to the 
Indianapolis track may have made it more difficult than what he remembers at 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I got so excited about getting in the Brickyard is because I won 
those first two races at Ontario and I thought it would be nice to say I was in 
the first race at both tracks," Foyt said. "I went out there (in 1971 and '72) 
and set track records both times and sat on the pole and won both of the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt tested his new car, a Ford powered by an engine built by Rusty Wallace's 
team, during a recent NASCAR test at Indianapolis. It was his first time in a 
race car since he retired from Indy car driving more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was awful dang mad at me when I told her I was going to drive in the 
Brickyard," Foyt, 59, said. "She said I was too damned old to be out there 
trying to race with a bunch of 20-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt doesn't think the Ontario experience will carry much weight in Saturday's 
160-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brickyard will be different," he said. "(IMS President) Tony George 
tightened up the track when he put those corners on the warm-up lanes; that'll 
keep the guys from cutting across like we used to do. Getting through that 
first turn now is like threading a needle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ontario was probably a lot easier because it was wider. The first turn was 
tough both places, but at Ontario you could go just about flat out through 
(turns) two, three and four. You can't do that at Indy. It's going to be so 
tight, I expect there'll be a lot of sheet metal flying around." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest driver trying to qualify is Hershel McGriff, 66, who drove not only 
in the first Ontario stock car race but also in NASCAR's first superspeedway 
race, the 1950 Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C.  
</P>
<P>
 McGriff, the 1986 Winston West champion and one of several West Coast drivers 
entered in the Brickyard 400, drove in all eight Ontario races and also won two 
late model sportsman races on that track. In the Brickyard, he will drive a 
1994 Ford bought from Glen Woods of the Wood Bros. team, and he thinks his 
Ontario background will prove helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars are a lot faster today than they were 15 years ago, but I've been 
racing all along, so that won't bother me, and the track is pretty much the 
same," McGriff said. "I've done some of my best racing on road courses, and 
that's how I used to approach Ontario. I probably have more experience getting 
through flat corners than most of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is making the field. That is going to be very difficult 
no matter who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 A Winston Cup-record 85 entries will be pared to 44 for the race during 
one-lap time trials today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hylton is the only other driver from the 1971 Ontario race entered here. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine drivers who competed in the 1980 Times 500 -- the final race held at 
Ontario -- are among the Brickyard 400 entries: Terry Labonte, Lake Speed, 
Darrell Waltrip, Harry Gant, Kyle Petty, Dave Marcis, Earnhardt, McGriff and 
Hylton. 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip's memory of Ontario is not good. In 1979, he entered the year's final 
event with a two-point lead over Richard Petty in quest of his first Winston 
Cup championship. When Waltrip ran a poor eighth and Petty was fifth, the title 
went to King Richard as Parsons won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vaguely remember Ontario," Waltrip said. "It was similar in design, but 
there is something special about Indianapolis with all those big grandstands 
and the way the infield is all filled up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ontario was very wide open, almost like driving on a California freeway. 
Indianapolis is more like driving down a country road. You've got trees, the 
golf course and people sitting in their condos with their feet hanging over the 
wall. It's just a totally different atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Petty, who won more stock car races than anyone, never won at Ontario 
although he drove in all eight races. He finished second in 1974 and third in 
1971 and also clinched his seventh and last championship there in 1979. He 
retired at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Petty took four ceremonial laps here last August, then donated his 
No. 43 STP Pontiac to the Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while since we went to Ontario," Petty said after his brief run. 
"I forgot how long those straightaways are, and I'm thinking, 'Man, I'm running 
awful fast,' when I see that grandstand down in the corner coming right at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raced 35 years and I always sort of halfway dreamed of running at 
Indianapolis, but not in one of those convertibles, but in a car with a roof 
over my head. They waited until they heard I was retiring before they cut a 
deal with NASCAR to let us cats on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great thing for Winston Cup racing. It puts us into a different 
echelon. We've always been considered good ol' boys from the South who run 
around in the woods, but things will change now that we're here at Indy. We'll 
get a whole lot more acceptance from ordinary folks, the ones who don't 
necessarily follow racing real close. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look back long enough, though, and you'll see that we're not the first 
stock car cats here. In 1911, when the 500 started, they was all running stock 
cars on the bricks. What they did was take the bodies off those stock cars and 
call them Indy cars." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that will be radically different from Ontario will be the 
attendance. All of the more than 280,000 seats -- Speedway officials refuse to 
give the precise number -- were sold within hours of the announcement of the 
race on April 14, 1993, and close to 1 million ticket requests were processed, 
according to Bob Walters, IMS public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-race crowd estimates range between 350,000 and 400,000, which is the 
figure usually associated with the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 The purse will be different, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The posted purse for the 1971 Miller High Life 500 was a NASCAR-record 
$207,675, of which Foyt collected $51,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's race will be another record, with more than $3.2 million on the 
line. The winner will receive nearly $500,000. The Winston Cup record is 
$2,756,845 posted for the Daytona 500 on Feb. 28, when Sterling Marlin got 
$253,275 for winning.

THIS HOUDINI'S HARD TO HOLD; FAMOUS FOR DISAPPEARING ACTS, RAIDERS' SCOTT DAVIS 
MIGHT STICK AROUND THIS TIME. THEN AGAIN . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Davis is hard to miss. But then so are most guys who stand 6-feet-7, 
weigh 280 pounds, are articulate and can dominate a room by their mere 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does this guy manage to keep disappearing and reappearing? 
</P>
<P>
 He could be the next Fabio. Instead, he seems determined to be the next David 
Copperfield. Or Harry Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in college after an outstanding athletic career at Illinois' 
Plainfield High, where Davis was one of the top prep football players in the 
country, starring on both offense and defense. He also played basketball, ran 
track and put the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Davis went to the University of Illinois, where he put in one season and 
promptly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Poof! Just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis left school and took off for Phoenix, where he could get lost in the 
sands of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he planning on coming back? He didn't know and he didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was burned out," Davis said. "I had come out of high school known for 
sports this and sports that. I was an All-American tight end, and everybody was 
hounding me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first year in college was a very frustration-filled year. I wasn't having 
fun with it. So I took what I guess you could say was a sabbatical. I wanted to 
get away from sports. I decided it was time to find out who Scott Davis was, 
time to do what was best for Scott Davis." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was to disappear from the spotlight and get lost in the peace and 
quiet of Arizona. He worked in interior design and got a feel for the business 
world, his eventual destination when his playing days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best decision I had ever made," Davis said. "It was a good year 
for me, a really good year. If I had it to do again, I'd go back and do the 
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it one day at a time, didn't put any pressure on myself and just let 
things happen as they did." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was that Davis, invigorated by a year away from athletics, 
decided to put the pads back on and fulfill his destiny by becoming a star 
defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Illini's defensive lineman of the year as a sophomore, All-Big Ten 
as a junior and and honorable mention All-American as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Davis took yet another big step, becoming a first-round draft 
choice in the NFL when the Raiders made him the 25th player selected overall in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing four seasons, Davis became proficient against both the pass and 
the run and made 27 sacks, including a career-high 10 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Poof! He disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone without warning. No fanfare. No high-profile news conference such as the 
one Howie Long held to announce his retirement. No emotional farewell such as 
Bob Golic went through. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis simply disappeared from the sporting world. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that he was trying to hide his intentions when he took off the 
silver and black uniform after the 1991 season. Davis maintains that he didn't 
know at the time he wouldn't be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the off-season," he said, "I started thinking it was time for me to get on 
with something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would someone make that decision at 26, apparently still at the top of his 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly it," Davis said. "I was young, healthy and had had a couple of 
good years. What better time to go than when you're finishing on a good note? 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I wanted to be was a guy that kind of fades out. I'd rather 
leave being known as a good player than as a guy who becomes third-string 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say, you are doing what is best for you, that's a little 
selfish, but I don't think so. If you're in any type of organization and you're 
not happy, I think it's not very conducive to the upward movement of the team 
to stay. I think it takes a smart man to know when he's reached his time, 
reached his limit." 
</P>
<P>
 While Davis felt confident that he had reached his limit, others were not so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Raider camp in the summer of 1992, the word was that this was just 
a salary ploy, that Davis was merely holding out for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a wilder theory that Davis had long harbored a secret desire to 
become a pro wrestler and would soon reappear wearing an evil mask with a sneer 
to match as a star of the World Wrestling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that," he said with a laugh. "I don't know where that got started." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 1992 came and went and so did '93, but still no Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 He was busy with his new life, working in real estate and land development in 
Illinois and Wisconsin, and in the rental business in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a certain comfort there," Davis said, "going on to the next stage 
of your life. It felt good. It felt like it was a smart decision that I had 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis got so far away from the game that when people thought they recognized 
him and asked him if he had played football, he said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Because, he explained, "That's not where I was at." 
</P>
<P>
 So what changed? What made him suddenly reappear in the national spotlight 
this summer at 29, back in his old spot on the defensive line after signing a 
four-year, $4.35-million contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was any one ultimate factor," he said. "I had achieved 
the other goals in my life, re-evaluated things and felt I still had some 
things to achieve in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had stayed in shape while he was away, but maintaining muscle tone is 
not quite the same as maintaining the ability to fight through an offensive 
wall and locate the quarterback or to bring a running back to an abrupt and 
violent halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has been playing on the second unit for the Raiders in the initial stage 
of his comeback and he struggled at times in Sunday's exhibition opener against 
the Denver Broncos in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a little bit of time, and I get frustrated," he conceded. "But it's 
a pretty long preseason, so there's time to get everything in place before the 
season starts. I'm more relaxed now. I don't get so stressed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't spend a lot of time doubting myself. If I did, I certainly wouldn't 
be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Davis is here, how long will he stay? 
</P>
<P>
 "My contract is for four years," he said, "so, we'll take it a year at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 With Scott Davis, that's the way it always is.

DATELINE / ST. PETERSBURG; KELLY PASSES BOILING POINT OVER ARENA'S LACK OF ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Goodwill Games President Jack Kelly, who not only has deferred to members of 
the St. Petersburg Organizing Committee but defended them against criticism 
from the local and foreign media, finally lost his cool. That gave him 
something in common with the Yubileiny Sports Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 After being assured by local organizers for more than 48 hours that there 
would be ice at Yubileiny in time for Tuesday's short-track speedskating, Kelly 
was frustrated when the event had to be moved to another arena, the SKA Ice 
Palace, one hour before the competition was scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kelly was in no mood to listen when they again assured him afterward that 
one of the Goodwill Games' premier events, figure skating, would begin as 
scheduled at Yubileiny Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of taking their word for it, he and St. Petersburg's deputy mayor, 
Vitali Mutko, kept a vigil inside the rink until the early-morning hours 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched it very, very slowly add ice," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 After another unsatisfactory check at 8 a.m., Kelly called a news conference, 
preempting the local organizers by announcing that the start of the figure 
skating would be postponed until tonight and that the SKA Ice Palace was being 
prepared for the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met for their regular session in the afternoon, the local organizers 
did not agree. They recognized that the competition would have to be postponed 
but were still holding out hope that it could be held at Yubileiny.  
</P>
<P>
 Kelly remains skeptical. "Their specialists appear to not be specialists," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work with Kelly said they have seldom seen him so demoralized. After 
35 trips here in advance of the Goodwill Games, he had faith that the local 
organizers would be able to pull them off. He certainly did not believe that 
they would be the fiasco they have become. He might have been the last 
believer. RANDY HARVEY

 Cornerback Darryl Henley signed a one-year, $350,000 contract Wednesday night 
to play for the Rams this season, and is expected to be on the practice field 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who awaits a trial, scheduled Jan. 10, for cocaine possession and 
cocaine distribution, did not receive a signing bonus or any guaranteed 
money.The Rams will have to release a player today to make room for Henley on 
their 80-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the initial awkwardness is over with, the football end will take care of 
itself," said Marvin Demoff, who negotiated the deal with the Rams for Henley. 
"I think Darryl is somewhat anxious on how he will be received, more so by (the 
media) and the public than the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the presumption of innocence, I think it is clearly appropriate that 
Darryl have the right to pursue his livelihood while the government takes a 
year to a year and a half to bring this matter to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of Henley's bail, he is not allowed to leave a seven-county 
region in Southern California, but the Rams said they were assured by Henley's 
legal representatives that that won't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things, as I understand, are negotiable," Coach Chuck Knox said. "It 
would be tough to play if you can only play half the games. That would be an 
unusual hardship to be placed on him and the team."

 The Cleveland Browns have finally signed their two first-round draft picks, 
cornerback Antonio Langham and wide receiver Derrick Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Langham, the ninth player drafted, agreed first to the basic terms of a 
four-year, $4.6-million deal, which included a $2.5 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, the 29th player taken in the draft, agreed to a four-year deal

 James Hasty, the Jets' best cornerback, will undergo arthroscopic surgery on 
his right knee today and be sidelined at least three weeks. Hasty will have 
scar tissue removed that formed after surgery in March. . . . Dolphin 
quarterback Dan Marino and his worrisome right leg are ready to take the next 
step in his comeback from a torn Achilles' tendon with a start in Saturday's 
game against Pittsburgh. But it was surprising to some since Marino still walks 
with a limp and admits that his right ankle hurts.

PRESIDENT SAYS HE MIGHT INTERVENE

From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling himself "a lifelong baseball fan," President Clinton Wednesday 
indicated a willingness to intervene in the rising feud between major league 
baseball players and team owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can play a constructive role, we will," he said at a White House news 
conference, noting that Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich had met with 
representatives of both players and owners recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who said he has "a greater interest in this than maybe a President 
even should," did not elaborate on how the Administration might head off a 
threatened strike. He said only, "The situation is sufficiently delicate that I 
think we need to leave it at that."

 The Pittsburgh Pirates, who claim they've lost $60 million since 1985, put 
themselves up for sale Wednesday. The city has six months to find a buyer 
willing to spend about $85 million to keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>

 "Six months will be a challenge, but we're committed to keeping the Pirates in 
Pittsburgh," Mayor Tom Murphy said.

 The New York Yankees claimed left-handed pitcher Rob Murphy, who had been 
waived by the St. Louis Cardinals. Murphy was 4-3 with two saves in 50 relief 
appearances for the Cardinals with a 3.79 ERA in 40 1/3 innings. . . . Montreal 
Manager Felipe Alou flew home to the Dominican Republic to attend the funeral 
of his father, Jose Rojas, 89. Bench coach Tim Johnson took over as manager 
Wednesday and is expected to do so again today.

COOPER TO FACE CHARGES DESPITE WIFE'S WISHES

<P>
 Michael Cooper, former Laker star and current assistant coach, will be charged 
with misdemeanor battery and assault resulting from a dispute with his wife 
last week at their vacation home near Albuquerque, N.M., a police spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wanda Cooper said she doesn't want to press charges, Ray Vigil, a 
spokesman for the Corrales (N.M.) Police Department, said charges will be filed 
because a police officer witnessed the incident last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanda Cooper said police were called after a newly hired housekeeper became 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pressing charges against Michael and I would if the situation 
warranted," Wanda Cooper said. "They asked me already if I want to press 
charges and I don't, but it's out of my jurisdiction because that's the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I wasn't in any danger with Michael. I'm the one that's volatile, 
not him. Michael does not abuse me. I'm not an abused wife. I'm not in denial 
about this. I'm vehemently opposed to domestic violence, particularly where I'm 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not allow myself to stay in a situation where I thought my life was 
at stake and I absolutely know that is not the case here. Michael and I had a 
heated discussion and that's that. This was blown out of proportion. He's never 
expressed anger by manifesting violence." 
</P>

 A spokeswoman for the Sandoval County district attorney's office said no trial 
date has been set. CHRIS BAKER

RAMS TO GIVE BACKUP QUARTERBACK A NOVEL OPPORTUNITY; FOOTBALL: MARTIN, A 
SPORTSWRITER IN COLLEGE, WILL TRADE IN HIS USUAL SPOT ON SIDELINE FOR SOME 
ACTION AGAINST PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jamie Martin, the former sportswriter, should have to write this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Why me? Why punish the innocent? 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Martin, the former sportswriter for the Weber State Signpost, should 
know what a good interview is all about: witty quotes, funny asides, 
penetrating perspective and the story writes itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, Jamie Martin, the quarterback for the Rams, delivers dull quotes, yes 
and no answers, diplomatic gobbleygook and his story stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams won't risk Chris Miller's health in Saturday's exhibition opener with 
Green Bay and T.J. Rubley has a sore arm, so for the first time since joining 
the Rams more than a year ago, Martin is expected to play in an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," Martin said, and now I lay me down to sleep . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly your parents, your friends -- they must really be excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haven't told them," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, anyone home? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my temperament," he said. "I don't like to get people too excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, the voice-activated tape recorder is having trouble picking you up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pretty monotone, I guess," he droned. "I'm not here to put on a show or 
anything. I'm just not flashy. I'm like that cliche, I guess, 'Just do my best 
and work hard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hold Page 1: Come on, you don't get drafted, you don't do much but eat free 
lunches and stand around at practice with helmet in hand last season, and now 
the Rams are giving you an opportunity to play, to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 Take his word, he said, "I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Martin put on a uniform for the Rams' four exhibition games after 
former quarterbacks coach Ted Tollner spotted him playing at Weber State. 
Martin, however, went to the showers each week without ever making it onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 After working as a practice player for the team during the first part of the 
regular season, he finished the year on the roster and on the sideline holding 
a clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was employed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year he's challenging Rubley for the opportunity to back up Miller and 
Chris Chandler. The coaches said they were impressed with his off-season work 
and there has been speculation that he will beat out Rubley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came in to do my best," he said. "If I do my best, I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the guy talks like Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "How ever it works out," Martin said, "it works out." 
</P>
<P>
 But this week has been special, right? More practice time because of the 
injuries to Miller and Rubley than all of last season combined. How's life 
changed for you now that they allow you in the huddle? 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't," he said before expanding on his answer, "not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the Rams' public relations department wanted no part of talking with 
Martin -- it failed to make any mention of him in its preseason media 
publication. But try and write a story with no good quotes and no biographical 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see, there's a lot I can tell you about Jamie," said Brad Larsen, 
sports information director at Weber State. "He's the all-time leading passer 
in Big Sky Conference history. All-time. He was awarded the Walter Payton 
Trophy as Division I-AA player of the year in 1991. Threw 93 touchdowns during 
his career. Set an NCAA single-game record with 624 passing yards and 47 
completions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also wrote for the school's newspaper, and was pretty decent." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Martin? The very same boring Jamie Martin? This guy had to interview 
people, knows what it is like to have to write a story with nothing to write 
and now he gives interviews designed to shut down the newspaper industry? 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen him before he came out of his shell," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 You think he's ready for David Letterman? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a sports information director's delight," Larsen said. "I mean he's not 
one of those rah-rah guys, but when you get him on the field, boy, people 
listen to him." 
</P>
<P>
 He's going to have a chance to be on the field Saturday, and then there will 
be those postgame interviews in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait.

REFOCUSED JELSO AIMS FOR RETURN TRIP TO BUENOS AIRES; RACQUETBALL: FIRST 
EXPERIENCE WAS AS ARGENTINA'S COACH IN PAN AM GAMES QUALIFIER. NOW, AFTER 
PROLONGED SLUMP, HE MUST PLAY HIS WAY ONTO U.S TEAM. 
</P>

 Racquetball is the kind of fast-paced, high-octane sport that sometimes seems 
a blur to its spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the 180-m.p.h. serves that crack against the walls like bullets 
fired from a gun. Then there are the players, crashing into walls and each 
other while flailing at the speeding ball. Lose concentration for a 
split-second and that point, and perhaps the match, is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Jelso lost that focus not only for a second but for several months. The 
6-foot-3, 200-pound player, who has been ranked as high as No. 8 by the 
American Amateur Racquetball Assn., suffered the worst slump of his career 
after winning a gold medal in singles play at the U.S. Olympic Festival last 
summer in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently has he snapped out of it. He added another Olympic Festival gold 
medal this year, teaming with Sudsy Monchik in doubles last month in St. Louis. 
Jelso also placed second in the Outdoor Nationals on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Jelso's focus is as intense as ever as he approaches two major events. First 
is the Elmwood Pro-Am in New Orleans on Aug. 10, the first International 
Racquetball Tour event of the season. Then in October, Jelso will play in the 
National Doubles at Jacksonville, Fla. The winning team will represent the 
United States in the Pan American Games in Buenos Aires in March. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jelso, 24, qualifies for the U.S. team, it will be his second Pan Am Games 
experience. His gold-medal performance in singles at the 1993 Olympic Festival 
should have earned him a place on the U.S. national team for the Pan Am Games 
but, he said, he later was told by the AARA that the position had been promised 
to another player. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Argentine national team wanted a coach who was a top U.S. 
player. The AARA pointed Argentina to Jelso. He spoke little Spanish and the 
players little English, but somehow they forged a fourth-place finish at the 
Pan Am Games qualifier in Buenos Aires, Argentina's highest in international 
racquetball competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I had something to do with it," Jelso said of Argentina's performance. 
"But I'll give them credit -- they did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent slump tested Jelso's patience until his upswing last month. "It got 
to the point before the festival where I was really bummed out," he said. "I 
wasn't playing well and my stroke really wasn't there yet. I took a month off 
to rest my mind because mentally I got drained sometimes from being on the 
court practicing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Jelso and his coach, Jim Carson, agreed last fall that he should take several 
months off to fine-tune his game. It was during that break that the slump 
began, after he adopted a more conventional grip at Carson's urging. Never mind 
that Jelso was winning with a grip he had used since he was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought the decision the whole way," said Wendy Bruce, his girlfriend. "He 
did it only because he and his coach decided together. He knew it wasn't the 
right thing to do. His heart wasn't in it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to competition at the end of the year, he was unsure and 
tentative, a far cry from the aggressive and intimidating presence that was 
Jelso's calling card before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him in a tournament in Portland (Ore.), and he looked horrendous," said 
Monchik, his doubles partner. 
</P>
<P>
 While he lost to players he was beating handily just months before, he didn't 
know whether to hold his racket the new way or the old way. 
</P>
<P>
 As the slump dragged through the first half of this year, he took another 
break. No competition, no practice. He didn't even touch a racquet. "I went 
through the burnout stage," Jelso said. "I lost to a couple of people I 
should've beat. I was trying to figure out what it was. I was real 
lackadaisical on the court. It got to the point where it was just repetitive. . 
. . I didn't have that fire burning like before." 
</P>
<P>
 This time the break, coupled with a compromise grip, repaired his game, just 
in time for the Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Outdoor Nationals July 22-24. Jelso had not played outdoor 
racquetball, in which there is no back wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the difference in the games, he advanced to the final before 
losing to friend Brian Hawkes, who has won the event the past six years and 13 
times in the last 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know how I (made it to the final)," Jelso said. "I know the 
indoor game, but the outdoor game is a totally different experience. You can 
have some people who aren't very good indoor players kill you outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the pro tour awaits. And he is sure he will be the best 
before he is through playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years from now . . . I see myself in the top five, top two, maybe," he 
said, his eyes staring at something seemingly just out of reach.

CATCH THEM ON THE REBOUND; AFTER STARTING SLOWLY, MACLEAN, WILSON, BUTLER SHOW 
NBA THEY CAN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The topic for the day was rebounding and 61 youngsters sitting on the 
gymnasium floor were listening intently to the guest speakers from the NBA at 
Don MacLean's basketball camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Wilson of the Sacramento Kings stressed the importance of boxing out 
the opponent, while Mitchell Butler of the Washington Bullets emphasized the 
use of both hands when reaching for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the desire to rebound, they said, that is essential. And they should 
know -- they speak from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Who better to help former Simi Valley High star MacLean discuss the art of 
rebounding at his youth camp at Royal High than Wilson, who played for 
Cleveland High, and Butler, who starred at Oakwood High in North Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean, Wilson and Butler share more than their playing days at UCLA. 
Work-out partners since before they were teen-agers, they met in a youth 
basketball league more than a decade ago and the Westwood-area neighbors 
continue to work on their games together in the off-season. MacLean and Wilson 
are business partners. MacLean and Butler are teammates with the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Each enjoyed highly successful high school careers, only to suffer -- and 
overcome -- a career-threatening lull in the college or pro ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean, UCLA's most prolific scorer, was a forgotten rookie on the Washington 
bench two seasons ago. He was the NBA's most improved player last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson didn't even last his rookie season with the Atlanta Hawks. Having 
fallen the bitter victim of no playing time, Wilson bolted for the Italian 
League halfway through the 1991 season only to return two years later and sign 
a one-year contract with the Lakers. Although he was cut after only five 
starts, Sacramento snatched him and he is now negotiating a second contract 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mitchell? He wasn't even drafted out of UCLA. Scouts doubted his ability, 
but scouts make mistakes. Mitchell went from not wanted to a four-year deal 
with Washington in one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebounding? Yeah, these guys know something about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean, who led Simi Valley to a Southern Section championship as a senior in 
1988, left UCLA as the leading scorer in Bruin and Pacific 10 Conference 
history with 2,608 points, sank a conference-record 711 free throws and had 
more 20-point games (68) than any other Bruin -- three more than a 7-2 center 
once named Lew Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being the 19th overall pick in the 1992 draft by Detroit, MacLean was 
traded twice (by the Pistons and Clippers) before he was ever given an NBA 
uniform. And when he landed with the Bullets, MacLean had his work cut out for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 With Harvey Grant, Pervis Ellison and Tom Gugliotta already in Washington, 
MacLean was forced to the bench. He started just four of the 62 games in which 
he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (tough) because it was the first time it had ever happened to me, 
basically," MacLean said. "But I got a lot of good work in. I paid attention 
and made sure that I was improving even though I wasn't playing. I was 
listening, I was watching people play out on the floor, so that when I did get 
an opportunity, it wasn't like a wasted year." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean averaged 6.6 points and two rebounds in just under 11 minutes a game. 
Not exactly rookie-of-the-year numbers. But he was determined to improve and 
his quest began in the weight room. He added 15 pounds of muscle to his 
6-foot-10 frame and improved his quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean's second year bore no resemblance to his first. He started 69 games 
and shared the team's scoring lead with Rex Chapman at 18.2 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could play in the league," MacLean said. "My confidence was never 
shattered. It was more like I was (angry) that I wasn't playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, two years MacLean's senior, would like to take a little of the credit 
for his friend's newfound motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (MacLean) was in high school and I was in college, I used to beat him up 
a lot, kind of rough him up, and I think that motivated him a lot because he's 
really hit the weights hard and now he's the one banging with the tenacious 
attitude," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's first season in the NBA was similar to MacLean's -- only worse. A 
second-round pick by Atlanta in the 1991 draft, Wilson averaged only 2.2 points 
and 4.0 minutes in 25 games before a back problem put him on the injured 
reserve list. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than working for more playing time -- as MacLean did with the Bullets 
-- Wilson bolted for Italy. He was playing in the Italian League before the NBA 
season was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," he said of his rookie season. "It's one thing if you are 
given the opportunity and you fail, then you can accept it, but I haven't 
failed because I was never given the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's impulsiveness came as no surprise. While at UCLA, Wilson built his 
reputation on temper and instinct. These were qualities teammates admired and 
later emulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so aggressive, so tenacious," MacLean said. "(He had) an attitude, but 
I'll tell you what, those two qualities made him a great player. Those are two 
things I learned from him in college . . . not to take anything from anybody 
and to just go out and be aggressive and have a killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time All-City Section player at Cleveland and a three-year starter at 
UCLA, Wilson is the fourth-leading scorer (1,798 points) and rebounder (1,001) 
in Bruin history. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wasted little time getting recognized in Italy. He averaged 19.0 points 
and 9.5 rebounds for Oar Ferrol in his first season, and 21.1 points and 7.5 
rebounds for Pescanova in his second. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy helped Wilson further his career, if only in his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm getting any faster or jumping any higher, but I think I'm 
understanding the game more," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After two seasons abroad, Wilson returned to Los Angeles for a second chance 
at the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed a starting position with the Lakers to begin the 1993-94 season. It 
lasted only five games before he was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, however, Wilson felt vindicated. He was given the opportunity 
and made the most of it. He averaged 10.2 points in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a money thing," he said. "What happened with the Lakers, I felt very 
comfortable with because I got the minutes, I produced and I got cut. So, I 
knew it wasn't because of my playing ability. I played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento concurred. The Kings came calling when the Lakers released Wilson, 
and Wilson responded. He started nine of the 52 games he played and averaged 
8.0 points and 4.7 rebounds in about 21 minutes. He played well enough that the 
Kings are negotiating a new contract with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll most likely be back in Sacramento," Wilson said. "I'm comfortable with 
the style of play there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's struggle started shortly after high school. He was of one the 
country's top recruits after finishing at Oakwood in 1989 as the fourth-leading 
scorer in state history. Once at UCLA, however, 50-point games were long gone. 
Fact is, he never scored more than 19 in a college game. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's role seemed undefined and he was mostly overshadowed at UCLA. In his 
freshman season, Wilson and MacLean grabbed the spotlight. Then it was MacLean 
and Tracy Murray, and later Shon Tarver, Tyus Edney and Ed O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I had a very defined role that myself and Coach (Jim) Harrick 
understood clearly," he said. "And I don't think very many other people ever 
understood it. Most people -- even basketball minds -- would say I got lost in 
the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler saw things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think being as athletic as I was, I was asked to do the things that a lot 
of other players couldn't do and most of the time that was setting screens, 
rebounding, playing good, hard, solid defense, making passes other guys 
couldn't (make)," said Butler, who could play all five positions -- and did. 
</P>
<P>
 While Butler graciously assumed the role-player position, NBA scouts were 
turning away from the 6-4 senior, who never complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood that," Butler said. "After my senior season, after I averaged 9 
1/2 (points a game), I pretty much realized that it was slim-and-none that I 
would get drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sulking about his misfortune, Butler went back to the gym to 
improve his game and prove that he belonged in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got back that competitive edge, that desire to just go out and cremate 
guys. I think I lost that at UCLA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is a model of perseverance. He latched on to the Bullets as a free 
agent and in six months went from a rookie with a one-year contract to a player 
who has finessed his way into the Bullets' long-range plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler had 19 starts in 75 appearances and averaged 12.6 points. He got 
stronger as the season progressed, averaging 21.0 points in his last three 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 His reward? Butler signed a four-year, $2.2 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade has passed since the three players first met. Their careers 
have changed, but their friendships remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 All three live near UCLA in the off-season and can be found working out at 
UCLA or the Mid-Valley Athletic Club in Reseda, or perhaps grabbing a bite to 
eat at the Sand Bags sandwich shop in Westwood -- which Wilson and MacLean 
bought three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond established in area youth leagues is one of the reasons MacLean and 
Butler followed Wilson to UCLA. It also accounted for the presence of Wilson 
and Butler at MacLean's basketball camp last week. They are planning another 
camp together later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we push each other and I think we're better because of that," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While each of the former Bruins focused on a different rebounding technique at 
MacLean's camp, all three punctuated their speech with a familiar axiom: 
</P>
<P>
 Never give up. Never.

O.C. BANK FILES FOR LIQUIDATION UNDER CHAPTER 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp, seized last week by regulators, announced late Wednesday that 
it has filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Langston, the bank's vice chairman, would not comment on the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the bank said in a news release that the company "does not 
anticipate that any distributions will be available for the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 In its bankruptcy filing, CommerceBancorp listed liabilities of nearly $12.3 
million and assets of only $165,574, according to the press release. 
</P>
<P>
 State banking officials shut down the 15-year-old business bank Friday, saying 
it was "operating in an unsafe manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's main office in Newport Beach and its branch in Orange were to 
reopen as offices of Covina-based California State Bank. Branches in Costa Mesa 
and Long Beach were to close, and their accounts were to be shifted to the 
Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the bank delayed a $14-million stock offering that would have brought 
in badly needed capital and could have helped stave off the closure. Bank 
officials said the offering was postponed because of publicity about the 
institution's ties to First Pension Corp., an Irvine pension management firm 
that allegedly lost $121 million of investors' retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp has been on the state's list of troubled banks since 1990.

O.C. LEADS STATE TO 24.3% SURGE IN HOME SALES; HOUSING: SECOND-QUARTER GAIN LED 
BY O.C. RESALES, REALTORS GROUP REPORTS. MEDIAN PRICE FALLS SLIGHTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushed by a strong showing in Orange County home resales, completed sales of 
detached homes in California for the second quarter jumped 24.3% from the same 
period a year earlier, the state realtors association reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, second-quarter resales of detached homes were up 32.3% for 
the period. The median selling price of $214,000 was off just 0.7% from 
$215,590 for the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As market conditions have improved, the realtor group said, the decline in 
home prices has slowed considerably. Though falling prices have hurt many 
recent home buyers, who have seen their equity erased, they have helped boost 
sales activity by improving the relative affordability of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, for example, 40% of all households had sufficient annual 
income to afford the median-priced home in the second quarter. That contrasted 
with just 15% when median prices exceeded $280,000 in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "California experienced its strongest second-quarter housing market in five 
years, despite a slight decline in sales from the first quarter's especially 
robust pace," said Garden Grove realtor Pat Neal, president of the state trade 
group. "Sales also increased during the first half of this year, compared to 
both the second half and the first half of 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, sales of previously owned homes rose 13.6% for the second quarter, 
according to the National Assn. of Realtors. That demand helped push up the 
median price of a home by 3.3% to $110,600. That contrasts sharply with the 
California statewide median of $184,660 -- a 2.1% decrease from the second 
quarter of 1993. Home Prices Drop, Sales Increase 
</P>
<P>
 Median Orange County home prices during the second quarter dropped slightly 
from the same period of 1993 but remained the highest in Southern California. 
Sales here outpaced those in most of the rest of the region. Second-quarter 
(April-June) sales activity and prices for detached, single-family new and 
resale homes: 04,16,10,08,08 Median Price Sales County price change change Los

 In June, the percentage of households able to qualify for a home loan dropped 
more in Orange County than in any of the surrounding counties or statewide. 
Though the median price fell slightly, the monthly payment increased because of 
higher interest rates. 07,16,07,07,10,10,08,08 *2*Households *2*Monthly

O.C. BRIEFLY: CORAM HEALTHCARE OF NEWPORT TO MOVE OFFICES TO COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coram Healthcare Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to move to Boulder, Colo., 
within a year and build a headquarters there that will be staffed by 60 to 80 
new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Coram, which specializes in providing intravenous drug remedies to patients at 
their homes, now has only four employees in its Newport Beach headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was formed earlier this year in a merger among four companies, 
including Ontario-based Curaflex Health Services. About 200 former Curaflex 
employees still work in an office in Ontario; Coram managers aren't sure 
whether those jobs will move to Boulder, said Don Cook, a Coram vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Coram has announced that it will buy Houston-based HMSS, which 
provides similar home health services. HMSS is now owned by Secomerica Inc., a 
holding company also based in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not disclose the sale price. If approved by government 
regulators, the transaction is expected to be completed by mid-September.

TRIMEDYNE'S SHARES DROP BY NEARLY 50%; STOCKS: THE IRVINE MEDICAL LASER MAKER 
BLAMES UNMET EXPECTATIONS AND UNCERTAINTY OVER FDA APPROVAL FOR PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of medical laser maker Trimedyne Inc. lost almost half their value in 
the final hour of trading Wednesday amid concerns about the company's latest 
quarterly results and a delay in federal approval for marketing of one of its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimedyne, based in Irvine, said Wednesday it lost $594,000, or 7 cents a 
share, for its third fiscal quarter, which ended June 30. That compared to a 
loss of $561,000, or 6 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 3% to $3.4 million from $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While the quarter's performance was not substantially different from that a 
year earlier, Trimedyne Chairman Marvin P. Loeb said Wednesday that several 
analysts had issued reports predicting better numbers for the latest period. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock price plunge resulted from "a combination of the usual problems 
companies encounter when analysts' predictions aren't met, as well as 
continuing uncertainty over FDA approval" for a laser catheter Trimedyne wants 
to market in the United States, Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Fred Toney of Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco had projected a 
profit of 2 cents a share on revenue of $4 million for the quarter. He still 
recommends purchase of Trimedyne stock, noting that it is selling near its book 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimedyne stock dropped $3.25 a share on the Nasdaq market Wednesday to close 
at $3.625. Nearly 2.6 million shares -- 28.6% of the 9.1 million outstanding -- 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock price has been dropping steadily this year and closed 
Wednesday down nearly 80% from its March high of more than $16 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Trimedyne reported a loss of 
$1.5 million, or 17 cents a share. That compared to a loss of $616,000, or 7 
cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Nine-month revenue was down 
8% to $10.3 million from $11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has delayed approval of Trimedyne's 
Urelase device for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, an ailment 
afflicting many men over 55 years of age. In March, the company said the FDA 
requested more information and analysis of the clinical study data submitted in 
an application for the product. It has been approved for general urological 
use, Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The uncertainty is can we get the FDA to give us pre-market approval," he 
said.

CITY OFFICIALS URGED TO STREAMLINE REGULATIONS IN EFFORT TO LURE HOLLYWOOD 
MOVIE MAKERS; TOURISM: AN OCCASIONAL FILM IS SHOT IN ORANGE COUNTY, BUT 
LOCATION SCOUTS MORE OFTEN GO TO SAN DIEGO OR TUCSON.

 More than 100 officials of local governments and tourism-related businesses 
gathered Wednesday to find out why Orange County has lights, camera but little 
action when it comes to luring movie film crews here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they produce here, they spend money here," said County Supervisor Gaddi 
H. Vasquez, the opening speaker at a workshop on film production at the 
Waterfront Hilton Hotel in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract them, he urged that the cities step up their efforts to entice film 
crews by cutting red tape. The result could create a higher visibility for the 
county, which would increase tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held to recruit city officials and others to examine their 
film permit and fee process to determine whether they can do more to encourage 
Hollywood producers to shoot their films in Orange County, perhaps by 
simplifying procedures and devising uniform fee schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of this summer's movies have scenes filmed in Orange County. Among them 
are "Clear and Present Danger," the film adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel 
starring Harrison Ford that opened Wednesday. Parts of it were shot at John 
Wayne Airport and in Los Alamitos, among other places. Parts of the Rob Reiner 
movie, "North" were shot in the county as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But many more movie crews have passed over Orange County. Even though 
baseball's California Angels are based in Anaheim, most of "Angels in the 
Outfield," the Disney fantasy starring Danny Glover about angels intervening to 
help the hapless team, was shot largely at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez and others say that location scouts are simply not thinking of sites 
in Orange County, and that has to be changed. The county recently provided a 
budget of $242,502 over three years for salaries for a film office through the 
Orange County Chamber of Commerce to generate more film production in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials estimate that film crews spent $250,000 on location in Orange 
County last year, compared to $27 million in San Diego and $20 million in 
Tucson.

BANK OF NEWPORT STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE; FINANCE: A $6-MILLION WRITE-OFF PUTS ITS 
ASSETS BELOW THE MINIMUM REQUIRED AS A RESERVE AGAINST LOSSES. IT COULD BE 
SEIZED BY REGULATORS.

 Bank of Newport, which has been struggling to recover from years of turmoil, 
said Wednesday that its prognosis is not good. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old Newport Beach bank said it became "critically 
undercapitalized" after the government forced the bank to write off more than 
$6 million because of an equipment lease deal. That leaves the bank, with five 
Orange County offices and more than 100 employees, vulnerable to takeover by 
federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're in bad shape. They have a very short fuse," said Barry Rubens, 
president of California Research Corp., a Santa Monica banking consulting firm. 
"They're going to have to come up with some money in the next 45 days, or 
they're going to be seized." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the write-off, the bank's capital is now just 0.83% of its assets, 
far below the minimum 2% required by regulators as a reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known as a bank for the wealthy, Bank of Newport today has mostly 
businesses as customers. It has been struggling to correct a series of loan 
problems, most of them tied to real estate, that have caused it to lose more 
than $10 million over the past two years. The bank lost $4.6 million for the 
first quarter this year, according to federal statistics released last month. 
Its assets, once more than $300 million, have shrunk to $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators have restricted the bank's operations and demanded that it raise 
money from investors to increase its level of capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remain very hopeful," said veteran Orange County banker David T. 
Blankenhorn, who became president of Bank of Newport in January. "We're 
continuing to talk to several banks who are interested in buying us and talking 
to several investors." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were seized, Bank of Newport would be the fourth Orange County financial 
institution to be closed this summer. CommerceBank in Newport Beach, Guardian 
Federal Savings in Huntington Beach and Pioneer Bank in Fullerton were all shut 
down by regulators in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the bank revealed that Sonora Group, a Costa Mesa leasing 
company, had begun last year to take out loans at the bank and issue leases on 
equipment that it never bought. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical lease financing, a bank lends money to a company to buy 
equipment, such as computers. The company then leases the equipment to 
businesses at a rate that will cover monthly loan payments and provide a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Bank of Newport transactions, which the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles is investigating, the bank must write off $4.4 million of 
its leasing portfolio and another $1.55 million to cover the settlement of 
claims made by those to whom the bank had sold the leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before that, though, the bank had a troubled history. Longtime President 
Ronald L. Rodgers, who helped found the bank in 1972, resigned under pressure 
in March, 1993. He was sued this year by the bank, which alleged that he and 
his wife, Verna Johnson, a former secretary there, used bank expense accounts 
for personal purchases. The bank's chairman, E.O. Rodeffer, has recently 
suffered from health problems, Blankenhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at least one analyst thinks the bank can be turned around. "It's a good 
bank," Rubens said. "The question is whether there is enough time to market the 
bank to a buyer." Bank of Newport

EURO DISNEY SAYS STOCK OFFERING IS 80% SUBSCRIBED 
</P>

<P>
 The struggling Euro Disneyland amusement park reported Wednesday that a recent 
offering to raise $1.1 billion has been 80% subscribed by the public and the 
parent company Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the current market conditions and the timing of the rights issue, the 
company is pleased with the level of subscription and the confidence expressed 
by its shareholders," Euro Disney SCA said in a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in April, 1992, the theme park has been troubled by recession in 
Europe, lesser-than-expected attendance -- forcing cuts in admission prices -- 
unfilled hotels and poor souvenir sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the biggest capital-raising operations ever seen on the Paris stock 
exchange, Euro Disney has created nearly 600 million new shares at $1.88 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue allowed existing shareholders, including the Walt Disney Co., which 
has a 49% original stake, to subscribe to seven new shares for every two held. 
</P>
<P>
 But the operation resulted in a massive dilution of the previously existing 
170 million shares and cut Euro Disney's market share price to one-third the 
price before the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A creditor-bank syndicate led by French banks is underwriting the issue and 
presumably would take up the remaining 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz, a nephew of King 
Fahd, in June agreed to act as a backup underwriter by buying unsubscribed 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Euro Disney said that the prince would acquire up to a 24% stake. 
Euro Disney late Wednesday declined to say what stake the prince may now hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Prince Al-Waleed will finance the construction of a convention 
center at the theme park, just east of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the lead underwriting banks were not immediately available for 
comment.

 UnionFed Financial Corp.: The Brea parent of Union Federal Bank on Wednesday 
reported a loss of $26.5 million for its latest fiscal year, which ended June 
30. That compared to a loss of $32.1 million for the same period the previous 
year.For the fourth quarter, UnionFed reported a loss of $9.8 million, compared 
to a loss of $11.4 million for the same quarter last year. The company blamed 
the latest red ink on additional provisions for loan losses and continued 
losses from real estate operations. The bank also said it no longer meets 
regulatory capital requirements and is subject to increased monitoring by the 
federal Office of Thrift Supervision. UnionFed said it has hired Keefe, 
Bruyette & Woods Inc. as a financial adviser, subject to OTS approval, to help 
it formulate a capital restoration plan.

VICTIMS OF CORPORATE LAYOFFS LOSE MORE THAN THEIR INCOME; PSYCHOLOGY: NEW 
COUNSELING TECHNIQUE ADDRESSES THE SENSE OF LOSS THAT EXECUTIVES MAY FEEL AFTER 
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR WORK FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They work together, eat together, know each other's spouses and children, and 
share the daily peaks and valleys that make up a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the layoff notice comes, more than income is lost: A whole family is 
torn apart and bereavement is common. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the premise of a new counseling technique being used by Dr. Robert 
Deutsch, a Connecticut psychologist who has seen a big jump in the number of 
laid-off business executives as the defense, aerospace and insurance industries 
have been rocked by economic hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "These executives spend an inordinate amount of time at work and the 
work-family relationships are vital to them," he says. "Many of these folks 
find themselves, at the drop of a nickel, losing their entire work family." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsch said that because of this, one of the first items on the agenda is 
bereavement counseling, as well as crisis intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is often the first time they have experienced failure, so they really do 
not have an adaptive template for coping with rejection and loss," said 
Deutsch, an associate at Bank & Hiebel Child and Family Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men and women are devastated by the experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The founder and president of Private Interventions for Public People Inc., 
which specializes in counseling executives and celebrities with substance abuse 
problems, Deutsch says business executives who lose their jobs struggle with 
shame and are often reluctant to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ashamed of a dramatic change in image. They're fearful of never 
achieving success again. They're fearful of the impact of this experience on 
family relationships, peer relationships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who aren't accustomed to asking for help. Many of these 
folks are former elite athletes who are not only extremely successful in the 
boardroom, but maybe played professional ball as well. They're accustomed to 
achieving all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsch said he has found the slogans and survival techniques used in recovery 
programs like Alcoholics Anonymous -- concepts such as looking at life one day 
or one hour at a time -- helpful in teaching these men and women to reduce the 
pressure on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a notion is radical for people who by nature are long-range planners, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Families also are brought in to deal with their own sense of shame and fears 
of economic insecurity and instability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an executive is laid off you often see major disruptions in parent-child 
relationships and in marital relationships," said Deutsch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not unusual to see sexual dysfunction, or depressive reactions. Kids 
might develop fears, sleep disorders. They have always had the notion that 
things were solid, and then suddenly there is a major crack in the lining." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he urges his clients to give themselves time to recover from the blow 
of losing a job and to exercise restraint and caution instead of jumping back 
into the workplace to escape the discomfort of being unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery time varies from person to person, said Deutsch, and depends on 
the executive's personal history, whether they were raised in healthy families 
and learned good coping skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Women executives, he said, tend to be more resilient because they have had 
more experience with facing roadblocks in their lives and are better able to 
adapt to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, women typically are better able to benefit from support systems," 
Deutsch said. "Men tend to isolate more when they have this experience."

IT'S A WRAP; ANY BODY GETS STAR TREATMENT AT O.C. SPAS AND SALONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Body wraps have been around since ancient times, and now, like the hedonistic 
Romans before them, modern pleasure-seekers are getting all wrapped up in this 
head-to-toe treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a body wrap as a kind of marinade for the body. First you are covered 
all over in mud, seaweed, aloe, mineral oil, herbs or some other therapeutic 
concoction. Then you are wrapped in plastic, towels, blankets or foil and left 
to, well, stew in your own juices. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens next varies according to who's doing the wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Body wraps have been promoted for their ability to detoxify impurities from 
the body, to tone and temporarily reduce the appearance of cellulite and to 
rejuvenate the skin. Whether they actually do any of these has been debated, 
but they are therapeutic for the mind. The best wraps offer a couple hours of 
pampering complete with massages, soft music and dim lights designed to help 
the subject unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago (body wrapping) was so new," says Brenda DeSan, owner of 
Bellezza Salon/Day Spa in Laguna Niguel. "Now it's happening all across the 
country. It's becoming the '90s thing to go to a day spa and get the 
treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other local spas and resorts, the Spa at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, 
which opened doors Monday to charter members and Sept. 1 to the public, offers 
assorted body wraps. It does so in a setting that easily recalls the ancient 
Romans with its molded ceilings, columns and classical furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a growing interest in wraps," says Kimberley Matheson, executive 
director of the Spa. "I attribute it to this fast lifestyle. Everyone needs a 
time-out. It's not often that you're awake and still and quiet, and you're 
doing something good for your body." 
</P>
<P>
 Men as well as women are getting wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more and more men becoming experimental. They're taking care of 
their bodies, too," Matheson says. 
</P>
<P>
 When you arrive for a wrap at the Spa, you are immediately issued a fluffy 
white robe and sent to a plush locker room to change. In a dimly lit waiting 
room you meet aesthetician Bonnie Fitzgerald. She ushers you into a small room 
equipped with a shower and table, where you lie on your back for the wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 For shy types, Fitzgerald is sensitive about what she calls "the towel issue," 
maneuvering the towel around the body as she works so patrons never feel 
completely exposed. She begins by rubbing on the black Moor mud -- a 
nutrient-rich soot from a spa lake in Hungary -- over your face and body. 
Ordinarily wraps begin with brushing off the dead skin cells with a loofah 
sponge or brush, but mud wraps have exfoliating properties that make this step 
unnecessary. By the time Fitzgerald is finished you look like a tar baby. 
</P>
<P>
 She wraps you in a sheet of plastic that's slightly heavier than Saran Wrap, 
then tucks you into a heavy blanket. Thus mummified, you lie still while she 
gives you a relaxing mini-facial with the mud, then covers your eyes with cool 
pads scented with neroli oil (an extract from orange blossoms, she explains). 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves you to relax, occasionally venturing in to spritz your face with 
neroli water to make sure the mud on your face doesn't harden into a mask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the wrap, which lasts about half an hour while the body soaks up the 
nutrients in the mud, it's time for a shower. You emerge from the plastic 
feeling a little like the Swamp Thing and step quickly into the already-warm 
shower, where a loofah sponge and bath gel have been left for you to rub off 
the mud. Then you're off to soak for 20 minutes in a jet bath treated with 
mineral-rich crystals, while sipping a champagne flute filled with lemon water. 
</P>
<P>
 The $95 treatment finishes with Fitzgerald rubbing your body all over with a 
moisturizer. You leave feeling as if you'd shed a second skin; your hands and 
face haven't been this smooth and soft since you were a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other types of wraps depending on one's tastes and skin care needs. 
</P>
<P>
 At various spas around the county, you can take your pick of body treatments, 
including an herbal wrap in which linens steeped in a natural herb mixture are 
wrapped snugly around the body; an aloe gel wrap designed for dry skin, and a 
Spirulina (algae) wrap for toning and nourishing the skin. Services last from 
30 minutes to two hours depending on the type of treatment and range from $30 
to $95. 
</P>
<P>
 Other spas and resorts have their versions of the body wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point Resort offers two kinds of body wraps, a white clay wrap 
scented with rose oil touted for its moisturizing and calming effects and a 
Dead Sea mud wrap for absorbing toxins and restoring skin's softness ($75).  
</P>
<P>
 "The treatments involve all of the senses," says Margaret Duran, spa 
coordinator of the resort. Clients are lulled with relaxing music and a 
15-minute moisturizing massage after the wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bellezza, clients can have their pick of wraps and whole body treatments, 
including a seaweed body treatment and a European body wrap (each 1 1/2-hour 
treatment is $85). The European wrap is done by wrapping the body with cloths 
that have been steeped in herbs and is promoted for its hydrating and toning 
effect on the skin.

BACK TO NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Woods in Brentwood, a $400 floral arrangement looks the way Mother 
Nature and the designer intended: exquisite, but less than perfect. The 60 
color-assorted roses and four blue-violet hydrangeas -- spilling from a silver 
keepsake box -- are garden-grown, open and blissfully blemished. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the flawless, furled long-stem roses and stark tropical arrangements 
of the '80s, tributes to black-and-white rooms with chrome-and-leather 
furniture. Instead, today's fashionable bouquets speak of antiques, rumpled 
slipcovers, a renewed interest in gardening and a desire to escape a world with 
too many harsh edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Savvy people want something that looks like they did it themselves," says 
floral designer Wayne Woods, owner of the Woods and another shop in the Beverly 
Hills Four Seasons Hotel. "Oftentimes, if we're doing a party, I will cut 
things from their gardens. They want to go back a step." 
</P>
<P>
 The trendiest bouquets also whisper of cottage industries and environmental 
correctness. Around Los Angeles, the leading floral designers avoid throwaway 
materials as much as they do outmoded hothouse carnations, uptight roses and 
baby's breath. Their back-to-nature flowers arrive, sometimes minus a petal or 
two, in collectibles -- anything from silver chests and etched lead-crystal 
vases to galvanized buckets, vine-filled glass bowls and customized terra-cotta 
pots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot more fun, adventuresome arrangements than there were two 
or three years ago," says Robert C. Smith, the owner of Laurels in West 
Hollywood, whose floral designs appeared in the recent remake of "Father of the 
Bride." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? "I would like to think that with all the nesting and cocooning, 
people looked inside magazines and became much more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers weren't exactly thrilled when designers began experimenting 
with more natural, more romantic-looking arrangements several years ago. "If I 
sent floppy viburnums and open roses, I would get calls that the flowers were 
dead," recalls David Williams Yeh, owner of Secret Garden in Beverly Hills. "I 
felt I had to educate people. Now, I get very few complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clients who study Elle Decor magazine and deal in flower currencies -- sending 
and receiving at the mere mention of a birth, death, invitation or restaurant 
reservation -- have no trouble spotting each artist's signature work. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a former clothing designer, is known for garden-inspired, comfortable 
creations that start at $50. To mimic nature, he and his artistic team mix hard 
and soft textures, placing Australian baby protea, for example, next to a 
California garden rose. An arrangement might contain rosemary, oregano, mint, 
chamomile, grapes, cut oranges, whole limes, Casablanca lilies or sunflowers of 
every variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of inspiration comes from local landscapes or a drive along the coast 
to see the mustard flowers in bloom," Woods says. Cottage-industry growers 
provide him with furry brown grasses, pretty weeds, potato vines and passion 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to see a texture they haven't seen before that delights them. 
It's really to open them up to the beauty of nature, to remind them we're part 
of nature. We're the same as a tree or a cow. We're not an automobile or a 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Hubert, painter, stylist, lecturer and owner of Silver Birches in 
Pasadena and in the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, incorporates Dumpster finds 
in his work. Inspired by fashion (he is a floral consultant for Ralph Lauren, 
among others), fine art, jewelry and even food, he lives in what he calls "an 
enchanted world." 
</P>
<P>
 And he shares it with established clients. One of them recently entertained 40 
guests in the picturesque, Mission-style patio of Hubert's Pasadena shop. She 
provided the lunch. He donated the delicate, rose-cluster table decorations and 
the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert, who uses only local materials for arrangements starting at $75, 
quickly turned a discarded palm frond, roses from his garden, Mexican bamboo, 
wisteria runners, oregano, loquat, blooming rosemary, dusty miller pods, 
agapanthus and belladonna delphiniums into a spectacular, $350 signature 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retraining floral designers to think in more natural terms takes some 
discipline. At Laurels, an appointment-only design studio with a $55 minimum, 
owner Smith has a rule against using what he calls "filler flowers" and insists 
that new employees work without cutting stems. "It's a way to deprogram them 
and stop them from making anything too stylized." 
</P>
<P>
 An example of Smith's unexpected combinations appeared earlier this year at 
the New Yorker's Academy Awards party in the Hotel Bel-Air. On the tables were 
brightly hued floating flowers in glass bowls, surrounded by thistles, grasses 
and orchids in sake cups resting on rice paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Some designers are harvesting flowers from the lavish gardens of their own 
clients. The staff at TFS, a West Hollywood floral boutique nestled behind an 
interior design studio, makes $50 per-hour house calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They supply the flowers, we supply the talent," explains co-owner Michael 
Burkhart. "It's a way to be ecologically sound." 
</P>
<P>
 TFS' lush, free-flowing centerpieces turn up at big occasions, including the 
Comedy Hall of Fame Awards and the Soap Opera Digest Awards. But in what 
appears to be another trend in the flower trade, the shop also sends smaller 
pieces, starting at $40, to restaurants to customize generic tables. 
</P>
<P>
 So does floral designer Yeh, who starts with a minimum $55 order. "We know the 
restaurants and we make something appropriate, just to make the table look 
pretty. Sometimes it's a special occasion and sometimes it's just for getting 
together with friends. It's a nice way to entertain." 
</P>
<P>
 New reasons for saying it with blooms are a boon to the industry, explains 
Bruce Wright, executive editor of Flowers&, a national trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of competition. There are a lot of ways you can send a gift 
across the country, with overnight shipping or just about any other delivery 
service," he says. "On the other hand, as opposed to bringing to dinner liquor 
or different types of foods that may or may not be politically correct, 
depending on someone's diet, flowers are always welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more to a bouquet than people realize. It shouldn't be tossed just 
because it starts to droop or go brown around the edges. "There is beauty in 
watching the dying process," Woods says. "Let the petals fall on the coffee 
table."

FIRST PERSON: SHARING THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The toe of Emily's shoe flicked the water. The test of my values began. Her 
sneaker sankdeeper. She cast me a glance. Then she popped off both of her 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, her older sister, had studied my neutral gaze. Now she leaped onto a 
ledge and wobbled along a fine line. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving water is always temptation. On this hot morning at the Central 
Library's gardens, the allure was almost cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 I scanned the sidewalks for security guards and the trees for surveillance 
cameras. Then I reclined on a slanted wall of the "grotto fountain" and watched 
my daughters' predictable dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon a dignified woman, neatly attired, arrived clutching a book. The 
assurance with which she settled in said this nook was a favorite spot. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked in the woman's direction, expecting a wink or a scowl. But she 
focused on her one-sandwich picnic, as if the obvious tension in the unfolding 
scene were invisible to her. 
</P>
<P>
 With Emily submerged to her ankles, I asked myself questions I'd asked at 
fountains before: 
</P>
<P>
 How far will they go? How far will I let them? What will that say about me? 
For two hours we'd prowled Downtown as if exploring a lost civilization. In the 
Central Library, we'd found the heart of the archeological site. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's Maguire Gardens are tricky to describe. 
</P>
<P>
 A line of three rectangular pools flows from the library's western entrance -- 
with its odd facade honoring philosophers from Kant to Confucius -- down toward 
Flower Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In the highest pool, emblazoned with the word CLEAR , a bronze falcon perches 
on a rock. A life-size woman's head, fashioned from chrome, spouts water into a 
white basin inscribed with ancient symbols for water , woman and such. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the "Female Well," I later learned, but the girls didn't know that 
as they ran their hands over the woman's chrome lips and splashed each other 
tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower pools, marked LUCID and BRIGHT , contain sculptural icons of 
evolution: an enormous red newt, bleached amphibian bones, an eel-like ceramic 
head with a horrible, sharp-toothed mouth gushing water. 
</P>
<P>
 To my girls, 7 and 9, the place is a wild, unsettling wonder. As they skipped 
into the more tranquil grotto, they brimmed with joie de vivre.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucked off to one side, the grotto is a quiet niche framed by a multitiered 
fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 They claimed the place as if it were their own -- which, of course, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is harsh; the garden a sanctuary where people with armloads of books 
and brains boiling with big ideas can decompress in peace. But a child's 
curiosity is not of the arid intellectual sort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, with an occasional glimpse in my direction, a series of slight "accidents" 
immersed them in the aesthetics of this strange realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley waded in, feet gliding along as if probing a mountain stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Emboldened, Emily slipped off in her own direction. 
</P>
<P>
 I remained expressionless, enjoying the gurgle and splash, and the distinct 
scent water drops pull from hot concrete.  
</P>
<P>
 Again I looked at the gray-haired woman and tried to put myself in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 I imagined her as society's harpy, the relentless scold in each of us that 
seems to have gained control: "You negligent bastard! Think of the microbes! 
Your daughters will fall and drown and be sucked down the sewer and spit into 
the sea!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm," I thought, remembering permissive parents and their pariah mall-rat 
spawn -- the graffiti-scrawling young nihilists with what John Irving called 
"the leer of the world" on their mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman remained focused on her sandwich as Emily sloshed across the 
fountain's next level, ducking and rising, ducking and rising, under a series 
of arching streams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley stood knee deep in the current, squashing geysers of water back onto 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Should I reel them in, I wondered? But then I got distracted, imagining the 
chill of the water and the sensation of cold tile against their toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all this, the old woman seemed absorbed in her book. 
</P>
<P>
 When a siren sounded in the distance, I looked up nervously. But still, 
Authority hadn't found us. I still seemed to be it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of the fountain, a concrete arch spans a series of red-tiled 
pools -- a tribute to "the evolution of civil liberties," I later read. 
</P>
<P>
 But with mottoes etched in official-looking typeface, it conveys the stern 
aura of sanctity: Art, Democracy and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching almost shyly, Ashley hovered for a moment then, for the first 
time, verbalized her desire: "Can I?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" I said, to her and to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 So she hauled herself into the semi-circular pool and scrambled under the 
black granite rim, which bears this Frederick Douglass quote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did. It never will." 
</P>
<P>
 I dipped my hand in the water and watched her climb with salmon instincts up 
toward the water's source. 
</P>
<P>
 I imagined my girls as women, asserting their own constitutional demand: 
</P>
<P>
 "We demand that no Authority deny citizens full access to public fountains; 
that no attorney collect contingency fees from injuries incurred therein." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The old woman rose now and brushed out her skirt. As she headed back toward 
the library, I tried to picture her as a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she played in forbidden fountains -- or stood longingly at their edge? 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, we had the grotto to ourselves again. The girls, soaked to the 
skin and beaming, continued their silent conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, again hearing sirens, I decided to pull the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 While the girls pulled on their shoes, a security officer appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 I braced for a scolding or worse, but he stopped at the newt pond. Then, 
speaking into his handi-talky, he changed direction and walked briskly away. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing now, I saw that across Flower Street, the city had asserted its dark 
side. A police car and ambulance blocked the street. A man lay face down, pink 
belly pressed into the oil-stained asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on, Daddy?" Ashley asked, craning to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 They walked off in the other direction, giggling and dribbling profusely, 
water squishing from their shoes.

 Among David Letterman's Top 10 good things about being married to Michael 
Jackson: 
</P>
<P>
 * White sequined glove prevents greasy fingerprints on fridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * After a day with the Jacksons, suddenly your Presley relatives seem normal. 
</P>
<P>
 * None of those annoying demands for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 * His squeaky ultrasonic voice keeps away mice. 
</P>
<P>
 * As King of Pop, gets 10% dinner discount at participating Red Lobster 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * If he comes home with lipstick on his collar, you can be pretty sure it's 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never have to throw out leftovers with Liz dropping by. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on the marriage: "On the wedding night, there was a lot of touching, 
groping, loving, caressing. And that was just when Michael was alone. . . . 
Michael told Lisa Marie he wanted children. Unfortunately, he wanted them for 
his bachelor party." 
</P>
<P>
 From numerous sources: This just in from Cal Tech: The recent shakers are not 
aftershocks from the Northridge quakes. They were caused by Elvis turning over 
in his grave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on "Models Inc.," the new Fox TV show: "Do we really need any more proof 
than this that the Wonderbra cuts off circulation to the head?" 
</P>
<P>
 That fan arrested outside Madonna's house pleaded not guilty to criminal 
trespass. Comedy writer Bob Mills says the man claims he was just curious to 
see what she looks like with her clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's running shoes have been inducted into the Brockton Shoe 
Museum in Massachusetts. Comic Argus Hamilton says Clinton's jogging makes a 
lot of Americans feel better: "He proves that exercise does not result in 
weight loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury official Roger Altman apologized to the Senate Banking Committee for 
misunderstanding its members' questions. There was a real language barrier, 
says Hamilton: "The questions were all in plain English and Altman is a 
bureaucrat." 
</P>
<P>
 A Florida nudist camp made room for 29 Venezuelan baseball players, ages 
11-14, after their housing fell through just before a tournament. The boys 
later refused to leave the camp, says comedy writer Tony Peyser, until the 
governor called in a SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism, San Diego's Sea World has renewed its attempt to become the 
world's only marine park with a great white shark. No white shark has ever 
survived in captivity, Peyser reports, except for Charles Keating. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reader Trini Marquez of Sky Forest says that a beautiful young woman who used 
to work for her was approached by a man who said he was a professional 
photographer. He asked if the young woman would like a free photo session. She 
called, made an appointment and arrived for the shoot in a blue Victorian gown. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief glance, he asked her, "Do you think you could come back and 
bring a teddy with you?"  
</P>
<P>
 She left, then returned -- hugging her teddy bear.

HOT PROPS: BY DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some designers, fashion is all about creating art. These three are among 
local artists exhibiting their wares (photographs at left) at the Sawdust 
Festival in Laguna Beach through Aug. 28.  
</P>
<P>
 Culture Club 
</P>
<P>
 Fine artist Ragumbah Connolly considers making clothes from antique Japanese 
kimonos and African mud cloth just working in another artistic medium. "It's 
how I paint now -- with fabric," she says. "I'm still working with colors in 
composition and balance." Balance is a rule Ragumbah (as she's known) lives by. 
When she's not assembling pieces of old fabric into gorgeous tunics or cutting 
raw silk or ethnic weaves into palazzos, she teaches yoga to Laguna Beach 
residents. She finds vitality in the "cross-cultural" mix of materials she sews 
into easy silhouettes ($40 to $375) or molds into tip details for hair 
chopsticks ($10 per stick). "I love that feeling of something that's done out 
of love and is handcrafted," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronze Age 
</P>
<P>
 There's a sculptural quality to Irene Suess' jewelry. Except instead of clay 
or wax, she creates with molten metal. Suess works directly with raw materials 
such as bronze, copper and silver, using a welding torch to form her organic 
designs. Bronze dominates the collection, on its own or mixed with another 
metal. It's a jeweler's bronze that tarnishes less than conventional bronze and 
is a more yellow-gold in color. Suess' craft, which she learned through an 
apprenticeship in 1968, differs from the more widely used application of 
building a model and making reproductions. "There's nothing wrong with that; 
it's just a little less spontaneous," she says. Spontaneity is integral to her 
rings ($10-$65), cuffs ($35-$250), bangles ($9) and chokers ($55-$255). "I 
always start with one idea, and it leads to something else."  
</P>
<P>
 Edith's Head 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Otto dislikes mass production. "I don't have the mentality for it. I 
like to do one of a kind items. No repeats." Her tops, shawls, pouches and hats 
are eclectic. She applies vintage fabrics, Chinese embroidery and antique 
laces, buttons and beads to her pieces, which she reworks by sculpting, 
stitching, pleating and dying. After 25 years of clothes-making, Edith (who 
goes by her first name only), ventured into millinery in 1992. It was her first 
year at the Sawdust Festival, and she was voted best new artist. Her hats, like 
the rest of her collection, nod to the '20s, '30s and '40s. There are floppies 
fashioned out of retro materials and straws that Edith molds by hand. At $20 to 
$120 a hat (pictured, $45), it's art that's truly accessible -- both to wear 
and on the pocketbook. ROSE APODACA JONES

BY DESIGN; HIS FOCUS? IT'S SOLELY ON MODELS; BOOKS: HE HAD AN IDEA BUT GOT NO 
TAKERS. SO, PHOTOGRAPHER ARTHUR ELGORT PUBLISHED IT HIMSELF, AND HIS TAKE ON

<P>
 New York photographer Arthur Elgort's self-published "Arthur Elgort's Models 
Manual" is the poolside read of the summer. But if you weren't one of the first 
10,000 to snatch it up, you'll have to cool your heels. They're all gone. Sold 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The press is cranking, but it may be awhile before the second printing is 
delivered -- something about the cover and printing on plastic in the summer, 
says Elgort from his vacation house in the Hamptons. Meanwhile, waiting lists 
are forming for the $35, small-format, high-concept romp through 
mannequin-land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeals to anyone who is into glamour gazing," says John Hirschmann, who 
works at Hennessey and Ingalls. The Santa Monica bookstore sold its last copy 
of "Models Manual" this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who have bought all the copies at West Hollywood's Book Soup are 
"the archetypal California girls, and older men I will charitably describe as 
photographers," the store's Joe Goodrich says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not cheesecake, though, but rather the story of discovery Elgort does 
best in the book. He remembers the first time he met Patti Hansen, Cindy 
Crawford, Linda Evangelista and scores of others. He still has the Polaroids he 
shot the first time they came to his studio on a "go-see." He describes the 
moment he first set eyes on them in the same way romance novelists describe 
love at first sight. He lovingly photographs the transformation as they have 
their makeup done and lounge on his studio sofa in hot rollers. 
</P>
<P>
 Elgort documents each step of the process of building the fairy tale: the 
stylists, the hair and makeup people, the fashion editors -- he gives them all 
a chance to add their two cents. Then he wraps it all together and exposes the 
fantasy for what it is without losing a bit of the allure. 
</P>
<P>
 When Elgort, 54, started shopping around his idea last summer, New York 
publishers turned up their collective noses. They wanted a slick, oversize 
coffee-table tome. But Elgort would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those coffee-table-sized things make me think about retiring or a 
retrospective at the Whitney Museum," he says. "I didn't want to do anything 
grand and precious. I wanted something kids or people not in the business could 
put in their book bag or backpack and enjoy thumbing through in the car or on 
the train." 
</P>
<P>
 So Elgort published the book himself (Grand Street Press, 1993), staying true 
to his vision by using matte paper and frenetic graphics. The format is easy 
reader-style -- the stories, told in tiny sound bites, are more like captions 
to the photos. There are brief interviews and comments from fashion's forward 
guard -- perfect escapist fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their big breaks:  
</P>
<P>
 "I counted nails in a hardware store." -- Elaine Irwin 
</P>
<P>
 True confessions:  
</P>
<P>
 "I believed I was totally plain, if not on the ugly side. I've felt like an 
impostor the whole way. I was always grateful for anyone who thought I was 
attractive." -- Paulina Porizkova 
</P>
<P>
 Career advice:  
</P>
<P>
 "How do you get to the top in this business? It helps if you're blonde, have 
big (breasts) and sleep with all the photographers. . . . Just kidding." -- 
Helena Christensen 
</P>
<P>
 Fatalities:  
</P>
<P>
 "Gia was fantastic when she hit. . . . I don't know one photographer who saw 
her and didn't want to photograph her instantly. She was a very special young 
woman who had a very short modeling career. She made it short because she 
couldn't handle it. We lost Gia to drugs." -- Polly Mellen. 
</P>
<P>
 Elgort and his models also offer a little myth-busting: 
</P>
<P>
 All models are stupid.  
</P>
<P>
 "People think models are stupid. Of course they're not. They're just not 
adults yet." -- Karen Mulder 
</P>
<P>
 Models have to starve themselves to stay thin.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't diet. I just don't eat as much as I'd like to." -- Linda Evangelista 
</P>
<P>
 Models' careers are over by the time they're 21.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you last past the age of twenty-five in this business, you have to start 
working out. Everyone else you're competing with is eighteen years old. If your 
ass is on the back of your thighs, they'll get your jobs." -- Veronica Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to read a book about models.

BY DESIGN; MADE IN METROPOLIS; YOUR NEXT SUIT COULD LOOK A LOT LIKE SOMETHING 
CLARK KENT MIGHT HAVE WORN 
</P>

 Sporting a silver hoop in his newly pierced brow -- a misplaced bit of 
decadence on a boyishly handsome face -- John Bartlett asked the question, "Who 
is more glamorous -- Forrest Gump or Ivana Trump?" He answered with a 
collection that, once again, confirmed his status as the shining-est light of 
the New York menswear shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing together the bumpkinish naivete of Gump and the jaded danger of Jean 
Genet's classic, naval steamer of a novel, "Querelle," the 31-year-old designer 
cropped pants, shrunk suits, dropped the pockets of cargo pants to ankle level, 
and made pastel-green argyle sweaters and glen plaid Sansabelt-style slacks 
somehow seem alarmingly au courant.  
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the spring season was otherwise short on thrills. Except forthe 
spectacle of singer RuPaul modeling out of drag for designer Matthew Batanian 
-- a show highlighted by paper-bag-waist pants and iridescent shirts in mineral 
blue and jade green -- there were no major surprises. Actor Billy Baldwin sat 
front and center at Calvin Klein. Tommy Hilfiger didn't reinvent menswear. 
Wolfgang Joop's show was still scary. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, suits are getting sharper; lapels and neckties, narrower. Pressed, 
once again, looks better than rumpled. Loafers are gaining on sandals as the 
shoe of choice. Shine looks very fine, particularly when it's the satin pants 
shown in the Artifact line by Jon Weiser. Forrest Gump is the fashion 
inspiration most often cited, with the Las Vegas Rat Pack following close 
behind in all its pinkie-ringed splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calvin Klein's show, pants were Gumpishly hiked to the ankles and worn with 
white socks and loafers, and there were enough models in Clark Kent glasses to 
revive the whole nerd-chic thing we did in the 1980s. This was during the 
portion of his show devoted to his younger, hipper line -- CK Calvin Klein. For 
innovation, it outshone his upper-priced signature collection. The best CK 
looks were crisp linen jackets and pants worn with rumpled checked shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 In Klein's more grown-up collection, flat-front skinny-legged pants in 
pin-stripe or crinkled fabrics looked best, as did flap-pocket military and 
draftsman's jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 New Republic Clothier, a smart, retro-inspired line by Thom Oatman and Jim 
Silverman, and Basco, the well-priced line designed by Lance Karesh, both 
featured sharp suits in crisp fabrics. New Republic's green tropical wool 
"Vegas" suit and Basco's gray "modern sharkskin" suit had skinny trousers and 
narrow lapels -- both pointing to the future of tailored clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rustic is over. Low key and minimal is happening again," Karesh said during 
his presentation on the lanes of a Greenwich Village bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Karan offered something truly fashion-brave among her drawstring pants, 
high-necked linen jackets and gauzy sweaters: a gray djellaba (a nice word for 
caftan) worn with striped linen trousers.  
</P>
<P>
 The best looks in her DKNY collection were a charcoal linen tattersall suit 
with a matching sweater vest, a sand-and-cream suit worn with a white V-neck 
T-shirt, and a linen sweater in stripes of gray, beige and greige worn with 
gray trousers. Sarongs continue to be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 Boing! a line designed by Ari Fruchter and Joe Soto, began with an iron-bodied 
model in a silver Lurex twin set with a feather brooch. Silver satin shirts and 
striped satin jeans tread the same path a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone left Joop! by German designer Wolfgang Joop, talking about the 
iridescent neckties, which were among the few things that looked good. "Did you 
get it?" someone asked outside. "No," was the most common answer.

JOCKSTRAPS ARE LOSING SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a century of girding the loins of American male athletes -- 
and giving its name to those who wear it -- the jock is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jock alone may be an endangered species, it's still issued by 
many college and pro teams. And protective cups, both hard and soft -- with cup 
supporters that, with any luck, keep them in position -- have never gone out of 
style in contact sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But novel fabrics and designs have helped to create a new generation of 
athletic underwear. Undoubtedly the fastest growing jock alternative is 
compression shorts -- those skin-tight Spandex shorts made famous by college 
and pro basketball players. (Some athletes do wear jocks under their 
compression shorts.) Also edging out the traditional strap are light, 
brief-type supporters that feel and look like the underwear that athletes are 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike offers a cotton/Lycra Spandex short in assorted colors with an elastic 
waist and inside draw cord ($32). Men used it for running, aerobics, cycling, 
weightlifting, tennis and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our customers wear it as a short, and others wear it as a first 
layer. It is very supportive and comfortable, and it breathes well," says 
Maxine Haris, apparel manager at Nike Town in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all, it's the advent of new materials," says Bob Beeton, manager of 
the clinical services program in sports medicine at the U.S. Olympic Committee 
training center in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeton says jockstraps are increasingly rare among would-be Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more comfortable getting your support from something that is kind 
of a full-sleeve support rather than something with straps and bands around it 
and (that) never seems to stay where it's supposed to," says Beeton. 
</P>
<P>
 The jock is not simply another piece of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in middle age and older can remember when getting the first jock -- 
sometimes required for junior high or high school physical education classes or 
youth sports -- was an awkward rite of passage. It has been a rich source of 
rib-tickling locker-room humor: The old Ben Gay-in-the-jock rarely failed to 
get a laugh, and seniors often tried to convince unwary freshmen that the 
strange, new appliance was really a noseguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can dispute its many contributions to the colorful language of sport? Will 
it be possible to fake someone out of his compression shorts? 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that the demise of the jock would be met with anguish at the 
jock capitol of the world: the Knoxville, Tenn., headquarters of Bike Athletic 
Co., the company that developed and sold the first jockstrap in 1874 in Boston 
to protect the privates of bicycle jockeys (thus the name) who were bouncing 
over Beantown cobblestones. Bike sold its 300 millionth jock two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of different products out there cannibalizing the jock 
business," says Beth Hamilton, marketing manager for the elastics division, 
which includes jockstraps. The jock "is on the way out, but I can't tell you 
that it's gone. There are still people who prefer the traditional supporter." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Bike invented compression shorts, so it is happily competing with 
itself. The shorts were originally designed from surgical hose 15 years ago to 
reduce hamstring injuries and groin pulls among football players. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bike is further diversifying: Besides brief-type jocks and special 
lightweight numbers for runners and swimmers, Bike this summer will add a line 
of men's underwear briefs "with a mild degree of support," according to 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gfeller, senior marketing manager of Champion Underwear of Winston, N.C., 
another jock maker, calls the traditional strap "a low-end loss-leader for our 
line." It's an entry-level item, he says, but it accounts for only 5% of 
Champion's underwear business, while its Cool Jock -- one of the new wave of 
lightweight jocks, has 8%. Compression shorts are 65% of Champion's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing a move out of jocks and into compression pants," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for support is reiterated constantly by sports-medicine experts. John 
Fulkerson, head of sports medicine at the University of Connecticut Health 
Center in Farmington, echoes this advice: "If athletes don't have some form of 
protection and support, they are at additional risk of injury." 
</P>
<P>
 (Protection and support, technically, are two different things, according to 
Bike's Hamilton. A cup supporter is designed only to hold a cup in place, not 
to support the genitals. For both protection and support, she says, you need to 
wear both a cup and a supportive garment. Compression pants, by the way, make 
everything feel tight, but they don't provide quite the same support as jocks. 
Claims that they help prevent groin and hamstring injuries have not been 
clinically evaluated.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kennon Miller, an assistant professor of urology at the State University of 
New York, Buffalo, says traditional jocks can chafe some men more than 
alternatives (compression shorts are particularly chafe-proof). 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Lippman, an 18-year-old high school junior, says there is an anti-jock 
movement among teen-agers. "A lot of kids are wearing boxers now, even for 
sports," he reports. "They think you've got to hang loose."

FAUX PAS REPORT: THE BOLD SHOULDER DEFLATES A LITTLE FOR '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the big, significant '80s, women's shoulder pads were thick pieces of foam 
that lifted a blouse or dress to new heights. In the scaled-down '90s, pads are 
a little thinner and less noticeable. So why are so many women still walking 
around looking like linebackers? 
</P>
<P>
 "They still like that 'big shoulders' look, but it's hard to get the big pads 
nowadays," says Lisa Valeriano of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "Most women 
who like that look enhance their pads with tissue paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Most pad problems are caused by women who wear them the wrong way. They 
shouldn't be sticking out beyond your shoulders, making them prominent enough 
to be noticed. The modern pad should give you just enough of a lift to make a 
difference, turning rounded shoulders into squared ones. And even though you 
may be accustomed to big pads, try a smaller one on for size and see if it 
makes enough of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowdown: Athletic shoes are supposed to be functional as well as 
fashionable, and while different brands wage wars over who has the coolest 
look, a different battle occurs among the store racks: Which is the hottest 
look for shoes, high-tops, lows or mid-highs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, among cross-training and basketball shoes, the mid-high is the 
most popular," says Mike Coppin of Athletic X-Press in Buena Park. "The low-cut 
cross-trainer is also a good seller, but many people think the mid-high is more 
stylish." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't make the mistake of wearing the wrong shoe for an activity. Running in 
low-cut Avia tennies not only looks a little funny, but it can also hurt your 
feet. And playing tennis in the high-tops favored by Charles Barkley will not 
only get you some odd looks from purists, but you'll also get tired from 
lugging a pair of heavy dogs around the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiffed: The question of how starched a blouse or shirt should be comes up 
periodically, especially in the heat of summer. Some women look uncomfortable 
walking around in a stiff cotton top during a heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most women I know don't starch in summer," says dry-cleaner Wendy Grabow of 
Placentia. "They want a more relaxed, comfortable look when it's hot, even for 
the office." 
</P>
<P>
 If you enjoy that heavily starched look but want something a little more 
comfortable, have your dry cleaner use medium or low starch, then use spray 
starch when you get it home if you want to stiffen it up a bit.

SHE SAID / HE SAID: 'I LOVE TROUBLE' DOESN'T REPORT WHOLE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 W e did more giggling than gasping when we caught "I Love Trouble" -- the 
flick that has "journalists" Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte walking an 
investigative tightrope for rival newspapers. Those clothes! Most of the time, 
Julia's character didn't seem to know if she was visiting a crime scene or 
attending a sorority rush party. And Nick, well, not all male journalists wear 
a khaki trench coat all of the time.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: The scene that really cracked me up was the one where they are running 
through the woods. There's Roberts (as Sabrina Peterson), flying through the 
forest, sans one scratch, in a ribbed cotton mini sweater dress (from Ann 
Taylor, $150) and dainty flats, looking like she's on her way to a modeling 
assignment. Give that girl black leggings and a pair of lugged boots and maybe 
we'll believe she's a modern journalist on a flight for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: There are several items that give away Nolte (Peter Brackett) as an 
impostor, but the ones that nearly made me spray my Dr Pepper across three rows 
were the silk handkerchiefs. Day to day, I've never, but never, seen a 
newspaper guy wearing a handkerchief in his jacket pocket. Heck, they hardly 
ever wear jackets (except, in extreme cases, from the parking lot to the 
office, at which time they take them off forever). 
</P>
<P>
 But there's Nolte, with a succession of stylishly puffed out silk 
handkerchiefs jutting from a succession of finely tailored jackets. Internally, 
I'm screaming, "Nick, you moron! You're a newspaper guy! You're supposed to be 
a slob! You're going to get dirty!! " 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Roberts played her sartorial cards right when she showed up in full 
slacks and easygoing jackets -- clothes that gave her room to move. In my book, 
that's the look for a woman journalist who's out there risking it all to get a 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 One jacket, in particular, caught my eye (and the eye of the fashion editors 
of Glamour magazine; they discuss it in the July issue): the tan, two-pocket 
jacket with sash by Emanuel Ungaro ($358). It was not only appropriately 
low-profile -- Roberts paired it with a black turtleneck top and slacks -- but 
credible. More than I can say for her train-wreck rags. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: My quarrel with the train wreck outfit at the opening of the movie was 
that she was wearing it at all. She looked like she was getting ready to cover 
a charity luncheon. But it was a train wreck, for goodness sake! And the first 
look you get of her at this horrendous scene of death and destruction and mud 
and grease and earthmovers and sparks from cutting torches and fire and 
brimstone and muck and mire is a pair of black high heels and bare legs 
twinkling along through the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't wear top-dollar designer clothes to a train wreck. You make a quick 
detour home (or if you live far away from the office, you detour to your bottom 
desk drawer), you skin out of the good stuff and you put on crusty old jeans, 
jungle boots and a shirt you won't mind ruining. Because you will ruin it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte wasn't much better: full GQ, plus the stupid trench coat, which was 
completely unneeded in that tame weather. Trench coats are made to keep you 
dry, not to identify you as a really bitchin' newspaper guy. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Roberts' bare legs. They sure showcased 'em in this movie. But were they 
hers? Remember all the flak over her stems-substitute in "Pretty Woman"? Maybe 
that's what this movie was really all about -- proving Lyle Lovett's lady has 
nice legs. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: OK, so get her a guest shot on "Models, Inc." But if you want to see how 
newspaper folk dress day in and day out, the closest thing to the truth I've 
seen come out of Hollywood is "All the President's Men." Dustin Hoffman and 
Robert Redford are wrinkled all the time, and all the guys wear broadcloth 
button-downs, slacks, shoes they don't mind scuffing and their ties are never 
knotted up to their throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jason Robards, who played Ben Bradlee, was a fashion ham-and-egger. If 
some guy showed up in our newsroom looking as spiffy as Nolte does, he'd be 
greeted with lots of whistles and kissing noises. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'll have to hand it to Roberts' wardrobe designers for one thing -- the 
small, simple, silver-loop earrings she wears through most of the movie. They 
subtly enhanced her face, never distracting from what she had to say. Too often 
wardrobe stylists go trendy with accessories. Even a simple gold earring might 
have looked too flashy, a pearl stud too dressy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing I liked -- her wardrobe's color scheme. Pinks, purples, reds or 
yellows would have looked garish, unprofessional. She was right on the money in 
tan, cream, black and navy. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I thought Nolte had a fine wardrobe as well, perfect for a night out. He 
looked like a professional model. Camel hair blazer that appeared to be Donegal 
tweed, a long tan vest under the blazer, a casual suede jacket with a price tag 
somewhere in the ionosphere, shoes with a shine on them, upper-end, 
color-coordinated silk ties over what looked like Egyptian cotton shirts. 
Everything pressed, everything starched, everything just so. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty cool -- and true to form -- if you're a zillionaire with lots and lots 
of time to shop for clothes. Absolutely cartoonish if you're a newspaper 
type.Items such as trench coat and knotted tie reveal Nick Nolte as an 
impostor; Julia Roberts gets the basics right in a neutral color scheme.

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: PLAYBOY'S BUNNIES HOPPING FOR MAKEOVER

 These days drag queens are pretty much the only ones willing -- no, thrilled 
-- to wear the classic Playboy bunny costume and act like they mean it. So 
party girl Susanne Bartsch, famous for masterminding AIDS benefits in New York 
and Paris, has signed up a bevy of high-profile style purveyors to overhaul 
Playboy's outdated icon. The results will be unveiled at "The Hoppening," a 
$250-a-ticket benefit Sept. 17 at the Playboy Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Tyler? Yes, I spoke to Richard. Yes, he's going to do it," said 
Bartsch, who moved among the crowd at Tuesday night's kick-off party on the 
lawn of the Chateau Marmont hotel, exhorting people to sell $975 ads in the 
program for "The Hoppening." Dressed in a gold-sequined cowboy hat, sheer 
gold-mesh halter top and matching pants, she easily out-dragged the handful of 
assembled drag queens -- especially in the cleavage department. But like any 
good post-feminist entrepreneur, she stuck to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to raise money to fight a disease. Why do people get so caught 
up in these political things?" she huffed in response to suggestions that the 
L.A. event would be dominated by New York design types. (Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, 
Azzedine Alaia, Betsey Johnson, Laura Whitcomb and the artist formerly known as 
Prince have agreed to reshape the most famous of bunnies.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Chrome Hearts is from L.A., Isabel Toledo, LA Eyeworks, Abel Villarreal -- 
they're all from here. But what difference does it make?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, L.A. met New York in the evening's most exquisite attire, a custom 
leather costume Villarreal designed for New York actor/performance artist Joey 
Arias. Originally made for Arias' role as Cirque du Soleil ringmaster, the 
costume was bunny-ized with an enormous black marabou tail and rather devilish 
leather ears. We wonder what Hef would have said? 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for "The Hoppening," which benefits AIDS Project Los Angeles and the 
Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, can be purchased by calling (310)

 Summer Reading: Those who can't wait for Robert Altman's "Pret-a-Porter" for 
their fix of fashion dish can turn to Olivia Goldsmith's novel of love, loss, 
neurosis and name-dropping, "Fashionably Late" (HarperCollins, 1994). It's 
about a tall, slightly heavy, potato-faced designer who soars to the top of the 
fashion world only to see all that she's struggled for ruined by her handsome, 
artist husband/business partner. Sound like anyone we know -- or wear?  
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people have said it's Donna Karan, but I wrote this before her 
troubles began," said Goldsmith, who trolled Seventh Avenue for such nuggets of 
verisimilitude as one high-profile designer's habit of simultaneously moving 
her bowels and dictating letters. Ultimately, the writer's sympathies lie with 
the beleaguered consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to write an anti-fashion book, but I think there's something 
sick about overshopping. Every woman I talked to, from fashion junkies to women 
who don't care, felt they didn't have the right clothes. Nobody has the right 
stuff." As for Goldsmith, "nobody cares what a writer wears," she said. "But 
mostly I look like a bad version of a Dana Buchman ad."

 True Colors: "I am not a model. I have not been a model since 1989. I am a 
businesswoman." And Iman can prove it. This week she hit local JCPenney stores 
to introduce her eponymous line of cosmetics and skin-care products for women 
of color. A line she created, for a company s he co-founded, in packaging she 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by having to mix and match makeup to attain perfection, Iman 
decided to help those of us without access to professional help. The resulting 
collection is 132 items strong, with name groupings that range from 
back-to-nature (Sand, Clay or Earth) to positively scrumptious (Warm Spices, 
Roasted Nuts). 
</P>
<P>
 A sometime actress, Iman will appear in the film version of Anne Rice's S&M 
novel, "Exit to Eden," due out in October, and although she's been active in 
the film industry, "I don't want to sit by the pool and wait. I want control 
over my life. I have longevity in mind." To that end, she plans to introduce 
hair and fragrance products next year. Plus she's taking Spanish lessons to 
help her tap into the South American market. And as Iman notes, in the year 
2050, people of color will represent more than 50% of U.S. residents. If things 
go as planned, the Under Cover Agent Oil Control Lotion could well ensure her 
complete global domination. Guess she really does mean business.

 Pretty in White: Many an eyebrow was raised in the 900-year-old Holy Cross 
Abbey in Thurles, Ireland, recently when Cranberries lead singer Dolores 
O'Riordan walked down the aisle. "You could see the look on the priest's face 
as she came in, like, 'Oh, Lord,' giggled New York designer Cynthia Rowley, who 
made the racy wedding outfit to the bride's specifications. It consisted of a 
sheer opalescent silk boxer's robe with nine-foot train, tiny tank, lace 
leggings and thong panties that revealed a jewel in the bride's bellybutton. 
New platinum locks and lace-up boots completed the head-to-toe ivory ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom Don Burton wore a black leather tuxedo with tails and snakeskin vest, 
and arrived -- in what is fast-becoming a '90s cliche -- on a black stallion. 
O'Riordan, who arrived in a cart drawn by a white horse, didn't sing her 
current angelic hit "Dreams," but did sing a traditional hymn.

 Everything We Know We Learned in a Beauty Salon: Someday, the Internet will 
set aside a place in cyberspace for beauty tips. Till then, we'll just get them 
the old-fashioned way, in crash courses at the beauty parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 From our most recent visit: Put milk on a cotton ball to soothe a recently 
waxed upper lip. Dab liver spots with a good alpha-hydroxy acid twice a day. 
Make a low-calorie ice-blended coffee with NutraSweet and nonfat milk. If you 
use Christian Dior Tres Tres Dior nail polish (to match your Tres Tres Dior 
lipstick), which has been recalled to have the toxin touluene removed, buy 
Chanel's latest shade of red, Vamp. It's a favorite of models, but be prepared 
to dunk your fingers in polish remover to get the stuff off. Sebastian's new 
Stain looks like grape-sucker color in the tube, but glistens cherry red on the 
lips. And finally, washing your hair the day you color it will make your scalp 
itchy. Whew!

AH, SHUCKS! IT'S TIME FOR THE CORN FESTIVAL 
</P>

 Forty-six years ago, members of the La Habra Lions Club thought long and hard 
about fund raising. "They wanted something cheap, and members came up with 
corn-on-the-cob and a square dance," says Chuck Overbey, chairman of the annual 
La Habra Corn Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a success and it's become an annual community event -- and a 
major fund-raiser that benefits visually and hearing-impaired people. Last 
year, more than 15,000 cobs were served. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to the event than nibbling corn, though. A Corn Festival Parade 
heads down La Habra Boulevard on Saturday, with marching bands, horse groups 
and politicians. There are carnival rides, arts and crafts, and a '90s version 
of a square dance -- called line dancing -- until 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities begin Friday, 5:30-11:30 p.m. Saturday events kick off at 9:30 
a.m. with the parade, followed by the other events at El Centro Lions Park, 150 
N. Cypress, La Habra.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything is free (except, of course, the corn). (310) 691-3482. REGINA PARIS

OFFICER CHARGED IN GUN INCIDENT AT BAR; COURTS: BURBANK PROSECUTORS ALLEGE THE 
POLICEMAN ILLEGALLY DISPLAYED THE WEAPON IN A THREATENING MANNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they wanted to send a message that guns and alcohol don't mix, Burbank 
prosecutors Wednesday filed criminal misdemeanor charges against a Los Angeles 
police officer, alleging he illegally displayed a gun in a threatening manner 
in a drunken barroom confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, Peter Ceinion Jones of the LAPD's prestigious Metropolitan 
Division, also threatened a bartender at The Blue Room in Burbank who told him 
to put the gun away, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weapons and alcohol are a terrible, terrible, terrible combination. Police 
officers, if anyone, should know that, and should know better than to abuse 
their authority in that kind of way," said Burbank Deputy City Atty. Robert 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular case, it is clear that he violated the law when he pulled 
out the gun in a show of authority and flexed his police muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Terry Stevenson, head of the office's criminal division, 
said he was "very, very troubled by the fact of mixing alcohol with a weapon. . 
. . We feel it is serious enough so that we should file charges. . . . He was 
quite intoxicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 38, was not charged, however, with public drunkenness or making 
threats. A 14-year officer who now works in an LAPD mounted patrol unit, he 
faces a mandatory minimum of three months in county jail if convicted on the 
single criminal misdemeanor count of exhibiting a weapon, and a maximum of a 
year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who has twice been suspended without pay for several days by the LAPD 
as discipline following other incidents, also is the subject of a departmental 
investigation into his conduct in the bar, an LAPD spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the previous internal LAPD cases, concluded less than a year ago, 
Jones' drinking was cited as a contributing factor in his improper touching of 
a female officer who he visited early one morning with the intention of having 
sex with her, according to police documents from that case. During his 
administrative hearing, Jones said he was voluntarily seeking treatment for 
alcohol abuse, but it was not known if he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also was suspended two years ago for failing to conduct a proper weapons 
search of a suspect, which led to an officer-involved shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew Rinker, the bartender at The Blue Room, said the most recent incident 
started when Jones, who was off duty and drinking in the bar on July 19, 
boasted to several other bar patrons about being a police officer. When one of 
them asked him for identification, Jones went out to a car, came back and set 
his gun on the bar in front of him, Rinker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, citing interviews with Rinker and other witnesses, said Jones accused 
Rinker of flirting with his girlfriend, and when Rinker asked him to put the 
gun away, "he said, 'If you touch my . . . gun, I'll kill you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the case is unusual because charges of exhibiting or 
brandishing a weapon are usually filed only against those suspected of waving a 
gun around or pointing it at someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it's kind of the totality of the whole case. The way he 
displayed the weapon, what he said," Walters said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, it is a misdemeanor for a person to draw or exhibit a weapon, 
except in self-defense, whether it is loaded or not, "in a rude, angry, or 
threatening manner . . . in any fight or quarrel . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "He exhibited a firearm in a rude and threatening manner," said Walters, who 
added that the gun was loaded and that many people told police they overheard 
Jones threatening Rinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinker, 39, said he was concerned about Jones the night of the incident 
because of his actions. But he added: "He didn't appear drunk to me, and I've 
been doing this for a lot of years. I think he just had a chip on his 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was detained by Burbank police after the incident but was not booked and 
was released to the custody of Los Angeles police later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank authorities later said they did not book Jones because suspects cannot 
be arrested on a misdemeanor charge without supporting testimony from a 
witnesses, and no one in the bar wanted to be a witness against the police 
officer. The charge was filed when they later interviewed bar patrons and some 
said they would cooperate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones will be allowed to surrender to authorities when he arrives in court for 
arraignment in about a month, prosecutors said.

PARK RENAMED FOR MUSIC LEGEND VALENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ritchie Valens, the Latino kid who was born in this working-class neighborhood 
and grew to become a rock 'n' roll legend, gained new distinction Wednesday 
when a Los Angeles city commission agreed to rename a neighborhood park in his 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote by the Recreation and Parks Commission was applauded by a 
handful of Valens' relatives and friends, some of whom wore T-shirts with his 
name and smiling face emblazoned across the front and back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, I'm so happy," said Ernestine Reyes, an aunt of Valens who attended 
the meeting clutching photos of him. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose northeast San Fernando Valley district 
includes the park, supported the name change, saying it would give Pacoima 
residents a sense of pride in the success of a native son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simple gesture by the Recreation and Parks Commission to tell the 
community of Pacoima that they do produce people of substance, people to look 
up to," he said. "Ritchie Valens was one such person." 
</P>
<P>
 The only controversy was over a suggestion by recreation and parks officials 
that the park be renamed the "Ritchie Valens-Paxton Recreation Center," to 
maintain the geographic reference to adjacent Paxton Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon and Valens' family and friends shunned the idea, saying there is 
no need to retain the Paxton name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anyone who has used Paxton Park in the past 10 years knows 
who Paxton was," Alarcon said, referring to Catherine Paxton Maclay, the 
daughter of a wealthy landowner who developed the area in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed and dropped the Paxton reference. "I think the 
councilman is wrong," said Commissioner LeRoy Chase. "No one who has used the 
park in 20 years knows who Paxton was." 
</P>
<P>
 Valens, who was born Richard Valenzuela in Pacoima, gained fame in the 1950s 
but died at the age of 17 along with Buddy Holly and J.P. "Big Bopper" 
Richardson in a 1959 plane crash that is still considered one of the greatest 
single tragedies in popular music history. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens became a teen idol on the strength of such hits as "Come On, Let's Go" 
and "Donna," a love song about his high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is probably best remembered for "La Bamba," a rock rendition of a 
Mexican folk dance that was on the flip side of "Donna." 
</P>
<P>
 Valens received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990 after the movie 
"La Bamba" recounted his life, reviving interest in the young musician. A few 
years later the U.S. Postal Service issued a 29-cent stamp with his likeness.

THIS BUCK'S NOT STOPPING; MCKEON'S STRONG 1ST TERM BRINGS OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after his election to Congress in 1992, Howard P. (Buck) McKeon took a 
wrong turn and got lost on his way from the Capitol to his nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard all these stories about how bad Washington was. And I thought: 
'Well, this is it. I'm going to get killed before I ever raise my hand' " to 
take the oath of office, McKeon said, laughing at the recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 19 months into his first term, Buck McKeon is not lost any more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Republican -- a businessman and former mayor -- has quickly 
found his way in an institution that affords a freshman lawmaker, especially 
one in the minority, few chances to stand out. Indeed, McKeon's success has 
posed a challenge that he and his advisers are already pondering: What does he 
do for an encore if he is reelected, as expected, this November? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several possibilities, say those close to him. These include 
positioning McKeon for future ascendancy in the House GOP leadership or policy 
committees or, down the road, possibly even a 1998 bid for governor or the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, displaying the self-effacing demeanor that belies his inner drive, 
downplays such aspirations as either out of reach or the agenda of an overeager 
political aide. Nonetheless, he is a man who clearly looks upon his initial 
term with more than a modicum of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's early prominence has been due largely to his position as president of 
the 51-member Republican freshman class, which pushed, with occasional success, 
for congressional reform. But he also met with Ross Perot several times, and 
was wined and dined at the White House when President Clinton sought his 
support for the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in January, he became Congressman Earthquake when the devastating 
6.8-magnitude Northridge temblor was centered in his district. This gave McKeon 
more than his 15 minutes of fame as he appeared with Clinton, Vice President Al 
Gore and Cabinet officials, was interviewed on television and played a key role 
in passing an $8.6-billion emergency aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much different life is now than it was two years ago, McKeon shares 
an anecdote. 'The Man' 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy at a fund-raiser said, 'When you were running before, you were just a 
wanna-be,' " McKeon said during a lengthy interview here. " 'Now, you're the 
man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's crash course in the ways of Washington has not come without hitting 
some bumps, however. His decision to break a campaign pledge by voting for 
NAFTA angered some constituents, particularly some of Perot's legion of 
hard-core backers in McKeon's district. And he upset some constituents recently 
by expressing reservations, in retrospect, about a California term limit 
initiative that he endorsed when he was a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the unmet goals: McKeon has not prevented Elsmere Canyon, in the 
heart of his district, from being used as a landfill, though he says he is 
making headway. He has been stymied by scheduling conflicts in his bid to lure 
members of the House Armed Services Committee to the aerospace-rich Antelope 
Valley to demonstrate the importance of the region's contributions to the 
nation's security, and his efforts to encourage freshmen Republicans and 
Democrats to jointly push Gore's "reinventing government" plan has fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, McKeon has yet to get a single piece of legislation passed. But he 
points out that the goal of his first bill -- to require the federal government 
to use recycled paper -- was achieved through an executive order by Clinton. 
McKeon acknowledged the President didn't necessarily get the idea from him, but 
he still called the result "sort of a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has delivered some modest benefits to his district: He helped gain 
Palmdale its designation as a Foreign Trade Zone and he got the House to 
approve $4.2 million to widen Magic Mountain Parkway between the Golden State 
Freeway and McBean Parkway and $1.2 million to widen congested California 138 
in Palmdale. The funding measures are pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKeon, who clearly relishes his role as a federal lawmaker, insists that 
his most important progress in his first session in Congress may be intangible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do a good job over a period of time, you build respect," McKeon said. 
"And, if you build respect, you can get things done. And I think I've done 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has impressed McKeon more during his indoctrination than the 
bare-knuckles partisanship that infuses Capitol Hill, according to longtime 
friends. McKeon often expresses frustration with what he regards as the 
Democrats' heavy-handed tactics on the Education and Labor Committee, on which 
he sits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been stunned by the degree of the polarity of the politics in Washington 
and how difficult it is to do anything that doesn't run into that wall of 
differences between the Democrats and the Republicans," said Thomas Lee, 
chairman of the Newhall Land & Farming Co. and a friend of McKeon's for more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the partisan wrangling, McKeon has sought to carve out an image as a 
low-key, affable pragmatist even as he has established a bedrock conservative 
voting record. Liberal Democrats, including Rep. Eva M. Clayton (D-N.C.), the 
former Democratic freshman class president, have praised McKeon as someone with 
whom they can work despite their philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "His rhetoric is not divisive and he doesn't seem to turn feelings about 
issues into personality or ad hominem attacks," said Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), who has observed McKeon from his neighboring district and 
worked with him on the earthquake measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "In part because of his personality, he has a certain effectiveness that 
surpasses the typical very conservative Republican in a Democratic-controlled 
House." 'I Am What I Am' 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, McKeon sided with the conservative coalition on 95% of 44 votes that 
were assessed by Congressional Quarterly. He joined the Republican majority on 
96% of 391 recorded votes and weighed in against Democrat Clinton more than 
two-thirds of the time, the magazine found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am what I am," McKeon said. "And I vote and I feel that way. But I don't 
hold personal grudges and I can work with people." 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA, which cut across party lines, is a rare case where McKeon supported the 
President. But he joined all other Republicans in voting against Clinton's 
budget plan and he opposed the Brady gun-control bill and a more recent measure 
to ban assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also against the President's health care reform proposal, instead 
favoring a less far-reaching GOP health care approach. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon says that he brings to health care -- as he does to other issues -- an 
appreciation for the real-world impact of governmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he is strongly opposed to a proposal requiring employers to pay 
for 80% of employees' insurance premiums. Howard & Phil's Western Wear, the 
successful company that he ran with his brothers, provides no coverage for more 
than half its approximately 500 workers, McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't the money in it to pay to provide health insurance for 
everybody," McKeon said. "You work on the margins. It's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 James H. Gilmartin, a feisty Santa Clarita attorney, was McKeon's Democratic 
opponent in 1992 and he's running against him again in the district, which is 
overwhelmingly Republican. That has not stopped Gilmartin from nipping at 
McKeon's cowboy-booted heels with one biting news release or barb after 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his campaign slogans: "The 'Buck' Stops Here." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin maintains that McKeon has fallen prey to the "Beltway syndrome" and 
has abandoned principles that he espoused during the 1992 campaign. "The change 
has been dramatic," Gilmartin said. He cited NAFTA, term limits and campaign 
finance reform as examples. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon attributed his about-face on the controversial free trade agreement to 
a commitment he made to a voter to protect local jobs during his initial 
campaign before he knew anything about NAFTA. Later, he said, when he became 
aware of the initiative's potential economic benefits, particularly to Southern 
California, he decided to vote for the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an early lesson for Buck," said Newhall Land's Lee, a strong 
advocate of NAFTA. "He took a position early that I think he regretted and it 
was based on not having much knowledge of the issue. He found it necessary to 
change." Still Backs Term Limits 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, 55, still supports term limits for members of Congress and maintains 
that he will remain in office no more than 10 years. But he said in an 
interview last month that he now believes a California law adopted by voters in 
1992 limiting the state's representatives to six years was wrongheaded because 
it's too restrictive, and the Golden State would give up its lawmakers' 
valuable seniority. Instead, McKeon said he favors a national 12-year cap. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's office received numerous calls from constituents who, upon reading 
his ruminations, expressed ire that he had backed off his commitment. In 
contrast, Berman, a term limits opponent, found his colleague's comments 
refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guys around here who are running for their 10th term in Congress 
and screaming about term limits," Berman said. "The man has a level of 
intellectual honesty to at least acknowledge both sides of issues. There are a 
lot of people who won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 On campaign finance, McKeon signed a pledge in 1992 to Common Cause, the 
citizens lobby, supporting its campaign reform goals. This included limiting 
campaign spending, further restricting contributions by special-interest 
political action committees and providing public resources such as free or 
discounted television time, mailings and matching payments. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon then voted against the campaign finance bill supported by Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKeon maintains that he made it clear to Common Cause representatives in 
his district two years ago that he would not support public financing of 
campaigns -- which was the reason he opposed the bill. Instead, he endorses a 
Republican-sponsored alternative that would completely ban PACs and that 
fulfills other Common Cause goals. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that he was aware that Common Cause backed public financing when 
he signed its form that said: "I publicly commit to support and vote for 
anti-corruption legislation that includes all of these essential elements of 
campaign finance reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of conned into it," McKeon said. "They were basically not honest 
in their approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe Pederson, a retired school administrator from Lancaster and a Common 
Cause volunteer, confirms that McKeon expressed his opposition to public 
financing when Pederson and two other volunteers met with him in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has always opposed public financing of election campaigns," said Pederson, 
who added that he was perplexed by McKeon's contention that he was misled. "We 
both agreed campaign reform was a necessary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon does not appear overly concerned with Gilmartin, aside from wondering 
aloud about his opponent's motivation. "It seems like it's so personal with 
him," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said that he was most interested in paying off the $130,000 debt to 
himself left over from the hotly contested 1992 Republican primary. He had 
loaned the campaign $200,000. This time, he allowed, "it is a little easier as 
an incumbent" to raise campaign funds. According to McKeon's July 15 campaign 
report, he had raised $84,741 in the first six months of this year and spent 
only $56,732. Nearly half his funds came from PACs, including $4,450 from the 
National Rifle Assn. and $2,000 from the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, he is busy helping Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) in his bid to 
become the Republican whip in the next Congress. McKeon, who is on Walker's 
campaign steering committee, has written to members of the GOP freshman class 
and some Republican congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he has offered to help first-term Republican colleagues facing 
tough challenges. He has stumped for vulnerable Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside), 
has steered contributors to fellow Republicans and expects to himself 
contribute to others' campaigns, said Armando Azarloza, McKeon's district 
director and chief political adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts could benefit McKeon if he seeks to advance within the House or 
run statewide. He has spoken to Rep. Floyd D. Spence (R-S.C.), the senior 
Republican on the Armed Services Committee, about his interest in the panel's 
next opening. And McKeon said he expects to be among the 25 to 50 members that 
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is slated to become the Republican leader next 
year, plans "to rely on for different things." The Future 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Azarloza and Virginia-based pollster Frank Luntz, who has done some 
work for McKeon, have discussed the prospect of the lawmaker seeking a House 
GOP leadership post or laying the groundwork for a statewide candidacy. Luntz 
calls McKeon "calm, cool and collected" and says his only shortcoming is that 
he's "too willing to share the limelight." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've discussed is how we get his message out to possibly a 
broader audience," Azarloza said. "That message is a no-nonsense approach to 
government. That Buck is just a regular guy. That he's not your typical 
politician. That he takes an independent approach: He believes in Republican 
principles but he wants to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about any inclination to run statewide in the future, McKeon smiled 
broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Armando keeps pushing," he said with a laugh, disavowing interest in the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come here to change the direction of the country. And it's not 
just to do a political job. I said I would spend eight to 10 years doing that. 
And that's what I'm trying to do."MCKEON, HOWARD (

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; PETTING ZOO OPERATOR SUES OVER MARCH RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operator of a Reseda pony ride and petting zoo is suing the city of Los 
Angeles, two animal regulation officers and an animal-rights advocate in 
connection with a case in which the operator was suspected of cruelty to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Menary, who operates The Farm on Tampa Avenue, alleges that the 
defendants in the suit trespassed on her land March 2, when the officers 
confiscated nine ponies and horses. She is also suing the city and the animal 
regulation officers for false arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 After the raid, Menary was briefly detained at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Devonshire Division on suspicion of animal cruelty and then 
released. No charges were filed against her. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals, which were taken to the West Valley Animal Shelter, were later 
returned to Menary on condition that animal regulation officials be allowed to 
inspect the premises at any time to make sure the animals were not being 
mistreated, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contends that Menary 
"suffered severe mental and emotional pain and that the acts of the defendants 
were malicious and oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
 She is seeking $750,000 in general and punitive damages, according to Daniel 
Trippiedi, who is representing Sandra Venables, the animal-rights advocate 
named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cocek, who is handling the Menary case for the city attorney's office, was 
out of town and could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary already has another lawsuit against the city challenging its decision 
not to give her a conditional-use permit for the pony ride operation. Michael 
Klekner, a deputy city attorney, said Tuesday that that case, filed before the 
March raid, is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary could not be reached for comment on the suit, and one of the animal 
regulation officers named in the suit, Lt. Timothy Goffa, declined to comment 
Wednesday. The other officer named in the suit, Lt. Richard Felosky, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goffa did say the decision to return the animals to Menary was the result 
of a deal worked out between the city attorney's office and Menary. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the March incident, Venables told The Times that, acting on a tip, 
the day before the raid, she went to property owned by Menary in the 22100 
block of Chatsworth Street, several miles west of the pony ride. Menary was not 
home at the time, said Venables, who took pictures of the animals. She showed 
the pictures to animal regulation officials and helped them during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe that she would go out of her way to sue me," said 
Venables, who runs a Chatsworth-based nonprofit horse rescue agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Venables maintains that Menary had not been properly caring for her animals. 
Some of the horses and ponies had hoofs that had grown to 5 or 6 inches beyond 
their normal length. That could end up crippling the animals, she says. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CANOE-BUILDING KIDS GET LESSON IN ENGINEERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sink or swim, the kids in Jim Belg's Imagineering class have learned a lot 
about science, engineering and even corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25 imagineers of Belg's first-period class launched the wooden canoes that 
they designed and built on Wednesday morning in the main gym pool at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of CSUN's Summer Academic Enrichment Program for Secondary School 
Students, imagineering teaches youngsters ages 12 to 14 applications of 
science. This year's project was to construct canoes that can hold two people 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn how to build a boat and do things like define its volume," said 
Belg, who teaches science at Patrick Henry Middle School in Granada Hills 
during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the course, the students form small groups -- 
boat-building companies -- each of which is responsible for drafting the plans 
for the canoe, building a model, constructing the boat, and keeping track of 
all the labor and expenses that went into the process, said Belg's assistant, 
Marna Kagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagle, who has just finished her first year as an aerospace engineering major 
at UC San Diego, took the class six years ago and has been helping out in the 
summers ever since. "I really like that it's hands-on instead of reading it in 
a textbook," Kagle said. 
</P>
<P>
 One student, 11-year old Lily Hsu, said she prefers the hands-on approach to 
learning science. "You remember it longer. When you read it from a book, you're 
gonna' forget it," said Lily, who raced her company's canoe with fellow 
shipmate Audrey Young, to place second out of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Kaufman, the CEO of his company, was a little befuddled by his canoe, 
named the USS Minnow (after the ill-fated vessel in "Gilligan's Island") 
because the caulking was falling apart. It took last place in the race. "It's 
not exactly watertight," Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Wu, who raced the Minnow, attributed their disappointing finish to "a 
bad oar." MAKI BECKER

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; GROUP GIVES GIRLS THIRST 
FOR AMBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the rural community of Val Verde, dotted by homes with chickens in front 
yards and horse-keeping property, members of the Zonta Club of the Santa 
Clarita Valley discovered a deep kind of thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are thirsty for knowledge," said Lois Bauccio, who 1 1/2 years ago 
started the Healthy Kids Club as a joint project between the Zontas and the 
Samuel Dixon Family Health Care Center in Val Verde.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Healthy Kids Club, fifth- and sixth-grade Val Verde girls and 
their siblings, meet with Zonta members on Saturdays at Val Verde Park to learn 
about different careers available to women, as well as crafts and skills. The 
point of the club is to plant the seeds of inspiration in the girls before 
other influences -- such as gangs -- take root. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that's the last chance. They're not really grown up yet," said 
Bauccio, director of development at Chaminade Preparatory School in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley chapter of Zonta, an international organization of 
professional women that strives to improve the status of women, was started 20 
years ago. But until recently, most of the club's finances had been used by 
other groups for programs that carry out Zonta's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been trying for a long time to find a project that we could call our 
own," Bauccio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their search led them to Val Verde -- a rural community northwest of Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we presented this program to the Zonta Club, we knew it was a perfect 
match," said Peggy Freeman, executive director of the Samuel Dixon center, the 
only agency providing social services for this isolated community of 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Val Verde was founded in the 1930s as a resort for middle-class black families 
during a time of racial segregation. As racial barriers fell, Val Verde became 
a multiethnic community with a growing Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community of Val Verde is beautiful," Freeman said. "The children here 
can play under trees, and take walks down paths, something that children in 
cities forget about." 
</P>
<P>
 But the rural nature of the unincorporated town does not offer what a city 
might. Although it has a county park and a Boys & Girls Club branch, Val Verde 
has little else for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in a rural community, the kids can't run down to the local mall, or the 
local fast-food restaurant," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Saturday meetings of the Healthy Kids Club -- which last about an hour 
-- have become one of the only outlets for girls whose lives revolve around 
school and taking care of their siblings. The sessions cover issues such as 
health, hygiene, understanding the changes in their bodies as they mature, 
sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although part of the message the Zontas offer is to have more ambition than 
just being a mother and raising a large family -- as many of the girls' mothers 
have -- the Zontas also try to strike a respectful balance with family 
traditions, Bauccio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like for our girls to learn that they would like to be nurses or doctors 
or dental hygienists," Bauccio said. "But we don't wish to infer in any way 
that the path their mothers have taken is wrong. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to tell them the role of the professional is something that may be 
somehow better than what they have, but we don't want to make them ashamed of 
their roots." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have only seen small successes in their efforts. One girl may 
show an interest in computers; another may be inspired by the high school 
senior who works at the club and is trying to get into nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just little baby steps," Bauccio said. "This is not a great, grand 
scheme to change the world."

 A reserve police officer involved in a gun battle at a Chatsworth nightclub is 
recovering from a wound to the upper leg at a local hospital, where his 
condition has been upgraded, a nursing supervisor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wilson, 34, was shot by two teen-agers wearing ski masks as he left the 
Cowboy Palace Saloon late Monday night with a female friend, police 
said.Wilson, a San Fernando Police reserve officer, returned fire, striking 
each of the suspected would-be robbers several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the assailants as a 16-year-old Sun Valley resident, 
whose name was withheld, and Mjomo Abdul Anderson, 19, of North Hollywood. The 
youth is in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, and 
Anderson is being held at the USC-County Jail Ward, authorities said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; RESIDENTS IN LIMBO ON FATE OF CONDOS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than six months after the Northridge earthquake damaged 130 condominiums 
at the Sherman Court complex in Reseda, the primary lender has still not 
decided whether to rebuild or raze the property. 
</P>
<P>
 And many residents wait in limbo, not knowing whether their homes will be 
foreclosed, whether they should hand over their deeds, whether they should move 
on with their lives or wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," said Teri Feld, president of the Sherman Court 
Homeowners Assn. "Sherman Court is just sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
 With some tenants having put 50, 60 or even 100% down on their condominiums, 
members voted in May to rebuild the pink stucco structure. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, Feld said, many were so frustrated by the lack of progress -- toward 
either reconstruction or demolition -- that they voted not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 That vote was little more than a preference poll, however, as North American 
Mortgage Co. -- the largest lender for the complex -- filed suit to keep 
residents from doing either. 
</P>
<P>
 North American President Terrance Hodel said Tuesday the company is making 
deed-in-lieu agreements -- where homeowners essentially hand properties back 
over to the company in exchange for an erasure of debts -- with about 50 of the 
87 owners it provided mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- including those who had defaulted before the quake or had removed 
appliances and furnishings afterward -- may have their homes foreclosed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, said Daniel Perwich, attorney for the residents association, "They 
haven't decided to rebuild. They haven't decided not to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 As if such headaches with lenders weren't problem enough, the residents 
association is involved in litigation with the builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, the association had sued contractor Sherman Calvin 
Partners. The allegation: shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date for that lawsuit will be set in late August, but the trial will 
probably not occur until next year, said Sherman Calvin attorney Paul Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $38,000 down on her condominium, Feld was among those who wanted 
to rebuild. The majority voted against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, she said, a decision needs to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowners would like to have an answer so they can decide what to do 
with their futures." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; RESIDENTS MARCH AND RALLY AGAINST CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Max Mrohs remembers the good old days when people didn't have to hide in their 
homes behind barricaded doors to be safe from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to walk over to the market at night to pick up milk or whatever, and I 
don't even drive over there anymore," says Mrohs, who moved to Panorama City 27 
years ago from Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrohs, like many residents, is fed up with crime, so he is working to make his 
neighborhood safer. On Tuesday night, he marched with others in a neighborhood 
march and rally against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which drew about 50 people, was part of a nationwide program called 
"America's Night Out Against Crime" to promote safe neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar rally in Sun Valley drew about 200 people, said Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, who attended both rallies. He was joined at the Panorama City rally by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz of the 39th District and Fred Flores, representing 
Congressman Howard Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good people in this neighborhood," said Leslie Yamashita, 
director of the Panorama City West Neighborhood Assn., which organized the 
event. "We want everybody to get together, see each other, attach a name to a 
face, get a sense of neighborhood going." 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to realize that we can take our streets back, we can take our 
lives back," said Georgia Bender, a member of the North Hills Optimist Club, 
which helped organize the march. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants gathered in the parking lot behind the Panorama Mall, then 
split into two groups for a short march through the densely populated 
neighborhood, which, according to police, has in recent years seen an influx of 
drug dealers and gang-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that drug dealers are renting apartments in the 
neighborhood, then dealing drugs on the street to customers who come to the 
area in cars, said Tim Bergstrom, senior lead officer for the Van Nuys area of 
the Los Angeles Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Landlords could help solve the problem by being more careful about who they 
rent to, said Bergstrom, who also spoke at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need all the apartment managers to get on board and screen applicants who 
come in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some managers are hiring security guards to prevent drug dealing from their 
buildings, Bergstrom said. The guards take down the license plate numbers of 
customers who come into the neighborhood to buy drugs, then turn the numbers 
over to police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been a deterrent because buyers don't want any involvement with the 
police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Mayer, president of the neighborhood association, manages four apartment 
buildings on Cedros Avenue. He agrees that it's essential to get apartment 
managers involved in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he has had a difficult time recruiting area apartment managers to 
help clean up the area so that respectable tenants will want to live in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords "are somewhere else, living in a safe neighborhood, so unless they 
are really hurting, it is difficult to get them involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayer and others at the rally stressed that they wanted to throw a 
positive light on the situation. Mayer and others say the vigilance of 
neighborhood associations is beginning to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a feeling of change," Bender said. "Prostitutes have been 
driven off Sepulveda Boulevard" due to the efforts of a business organization 
in that area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said his office is continuing its efforts to put more street lights in 
the neighborhood to reduce crime. FRANK MANNING

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS TO DISPLAY SAFE HOUSE TRIANGLES

<TEXT>
<P>
 They may be green, but the newest soldiers in the San Fernando Valley's fight 
against crime have finally arrived. One hundred plastic green triangles to mark 
"Safe Houses" where children can flee to in an emergency are expected to appear 
in the windows of West Valley homes by September. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-inch fluorescent triangles are part of a program launched in January by 
the Los Angeles Police Department West Valley Division in response to a series 
of molestation attacks on children. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, West Valley police have been visiting schools in the area to 
recruit volunteers who have agreed to be home between 7 and 9 a.m. and 2 and 4 
p.m., when children walk to and from school.

 Volunteers are screened by police for criminal records before they can display 
a triangle. About 33 homes have already been screened, and police hope to give 
the go-ahead to about 60 more before school starts in the fall. Stephanie 
Tisdale, the West Valley senior lead officer who started the program, said 
response by parents and community members at the 10 schools she has visited has 
been very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem was, it took us forever to get the triangles," Tisdale said. 
"But now we've got them, so we're doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The triangles are marked with a complex police numbering system to prevent 
fakes. SUSAN BYRNES

 More than 300 souped-up and antique cars, specialty airplanes and hot air 
balloons will be on show Aug. 14 to raise money for books and other items for 
the Cal State Northridge library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems there are never enough materials to fill the needs the students 
have," said Susan Curzon, dean of the university library."The state has not 
been exactly flush with money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tarzana Encino Rotary Club, which is organizing the event, hopes to raise 
several hundred thousand dollars to start an Oviatt Library endowment fund. 
Other fund-raisers will be planned later, Curzon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has been closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake, but CSUN 
administrators hope to open the central part by Aug. 29. Repairs have been 
funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from the show will also be given to the Rancho San Antonio home for 
boys, which is hosting the event. 
</P>
<P>
 TV personalities Jay Leno, host of "The Tonight Show," and Tim Allen of "Home 
Improvement" have been invited to bring their antique cars, but neither has 
confirmed his attendance, Giardina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Rancho San Antonio, 21000 Plummer St. 
in Chatsworth. Tickets are $10. KURT PITZER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ELIMINATION OF QUAKE 'GHOST TOWNS' OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council gave official approval Wednesday to a 
multi-pronged plan to eliminate the clusters of vacant, quake-damaged, 
crime-infested buildings known as "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Richard Alarcon, the council unanimously approved 
the plan and instructed city workers to hasten the efforts already undertaken 
on the 12 ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and Mid-City areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said the ordinance gives workers the city's official backing to take 
such actions as boarding up and fencing abandoned buildings, painting over 
graffiti on private property and clearing out debris in vacant structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also instructs city workers to drain abandoned pools that may 
pose a drowning hazard or may be a breeding ground for mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Alarcon's behest that several city department heads joined together 
in July to form the Earthquake Ghost Town Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has already boarded up and fenced many properties and hired 
security guards to keep trespassers out of the buildings. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; FREE QUAKE-PROOFING PROVIDED FOR CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, the rolling ground turned many area health clinics into scenes of 
destruction: File cabinets fell over, medical records spilled out of shelves 
and medicine bottles smashed on the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 A public-private partnership has created a new program to earthquake-proof the 
interiors of community clinics throughout the city for free. Many clinics, 
whose role in providing medical services to low-income residents became even 
more crucial after the quake, cannot afford to have their furniture and medical 
equipment bolted or strapped down. 
</P>
<P>
 The program helps low-income neighborhoods not only by safeguarding the 
contents of clinics; it also provides jobs. The work is done by participants in 
a federally funded jobs program for young adults who were economically 
displaced by the quake, the California Conservation Corps' Northridge 
Earthquake Recovery Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, El Proyecto del Barrio's family health clinic in Arleta was a 
beehive of activity as a seven-member crew of technicians bolted file cabinets 
to walls, strapped computers to desks and strung retaining cords along shelves 
housing medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mini-laboratory, Edward Morton of Pasadena fastened a microscope to a 
"leash" that was bolted to the wall. That way, he explained, the microscope can 
be freely moved around the counter, but won't fall off in a quake. Morton said 
he planned to affix roughened pads to the bottom of a centrifuge, to keep it 
from sliding during seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton lost his job as a packer for a packaging and handling company when the 
earthquake closed the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt desperate," he says of that time. "You're looking, marketing yourself. 
This (program) was almost impossible to believe. 'That place is giving away 
jobs.' As soon as I heard about it I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima resident Christina Diaz, a former receptionist, was in a financial 
bind when the Glendale insurance office where she worked had to be remodeled 
after the earthquake. Unable to wait, she visited the state Employment 
Development Department office in San Fernando, which told her about the 
Recovery Corps. As a quake-proofing technician, she makes an hourly wage of $7, 
$2.75 more per hour than she was making before. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was initiated when Operation USA, a nonprofit, Los-Angeles-based 
relief agency, asked the Conservation Corps whether it could provide the 
workers to do the bolting and securing work. The corps, which had recently 
received a $2.1-million grant from the Department of Labor to establish a jobs 
program for quake-displaced workers, accepted. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency provided the crew with on-site supervisors, who were trained by the 
state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member crew that worked on the El Proyecto clinic was selected based 
on their skills from the 75 participants in the six-month Recovery Corps 
program. The team has already finished quake-proofing three clinics in the 
Valley and Hollywood, and is scheduled to complete work on 22 more by the end 
of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrie Alvarez, administrator of El Proyecto's Arleta clinic, said she is 
grateful for the program's services, which she said would provide peace of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, I won't have to worry about thousands of dollars being lost in 
an earthquake," she said. "We can just focus our attention on rendering medical 
care." KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NEW PERMIT SOUGHT FOR GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of the Studio City Golf Course will go before a zoning administrator 
Aug. 22 to ask for a conditional-use permit to keep the course open. 
</P>
<P>
 The course has been served an eviction notice by the property owners, based on 
the fact that its conditional-use permit expired nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weddington Investment Partnership, which owns the land, discovered this 
spring that the course's conditional-use permit expired in May, 1985. It 
contends that the expiration in turn nullified a 1955 lease that partner Guy 
Weddington McCreary has called "miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 According to that agreement, the golf course pays just $1,000 a month for the 
17.2-acres of urban property. The partnership is now seeking to sell or rent 
the property at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the golf course have said they will fight any attempts to oust 
the current operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoning hearing will be held at the Sherman Oaks Women's Club, 4808 Kester 
Ave. ERIC SLATER

<P>
 Traffic on Paxton Street from west of the Foothill Freeway to west of Lopez 
Canyon Road may slow considerably during daytime working hours for two weeks in 
September.  
</P>
<P>
 A project to resurface the existing roadway in an unincorporated area near 
Lake View Terrace will start at the beginning of the month and is expected to 
take 10 working days to complete, according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be performed under a $57,258 contract awarded by the county 
to Boral Resources Inc. of Pomona. A portion of the money will be reimbursed by 
the state under a program that administers grants to local agencies for public 
road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These improvements will increase safety, reduce maintenance costs and extend 
the service life of these roads," Edelman said. ANTONIO OLIVO

RENTER OF ROBBINS' RESIDENCE ACCUSED OF THEFT; ENCINO: LUXURY HOME WAS STRIPPED 
OF $92,000 IN FURNITURE AND FIXTURES WHILE THE EX-POLITICIAN WAS IN A FEDERAL 
PRISON CAMP.

 While former state Sen. Alan Robbins was serving his time on federal 
racketeering and tax evasion convictions, he was also becoming the victim of a 
crime, say police and prosecutors in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who rented Robbins' Encino dream home while the prominent politician 
was behind bars allegedly took almost everything but the kitchen sink -- 
although two bathroom sinks, a designer toilet and a bidet were, in fact, among 
the $92,000 worth of furniture and fixtures that Robbins reported missing, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Titmas, who rented Robbins' house in the 16700 block of Oak View Drive, 
was named Wednesday in a warrant alleging a single count of grand theft, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case for criminal charges against Titmas was strengthened by a witness 
who, according to court records, told police that Titmas offered to sell her 
Robbins' cherished Senate desk for $2,000, saying: "He's going to be in prison 
so long by the time he gets out, he won't be able to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said prosecutors would pursue the case like any other theft. "Mr. 
Robbins' proven past indiscretions don't allow others to prey on him without 
having to answer to the bar of justice," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who served two years in a Lompoc federal prison camp, said Wednesday 
that when he returned to his Encino estate after he was released from a halfway 
house in the spring, "I literally did not have a single piece of furniture. I 
didn't have a chair to sit in." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins found the cupboard was not only bare -- it was gone. And, according to 
a missing property report that Robbins filed with police, so were the kitchen 
counters, the bathtubs, Persian and Chinese rugs, a hand-carved dining room 
table and 10 chairs, big-screen television, seven sets of drapes, 10 doors, and 
antique fixtures and furniture, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of disconcerting to come back from being in a prison camp and see 
your house in that kind of stripped-down condition," Robbins said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the case initially appeared to be a civil dispute between 
Robbins and Titmas, who had agreed to rent the house with an option to buy it. 
The deal fell through, Titmas fell behind on his payments and eventually filed 
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robbins started eviction proceedings. But it took from June, 1993, 
to March to evict Titmas, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Titmas told Robbins that he was placing Robbins' possessions in storage for 
safekeeping, according to the court documents, but then Titmas fell behind on 
the storage payments and some of the furnishings were auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like Titmas was holding Alan Robbins at bay, telling him, 'You'll 
get it. You'll get it,"' Los Angeles Police Detective Tony Finchen said. "But 
Robbins got released early." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year Democratic senator said he expects to recover a coffee table, desk 
and couch. Earlier this year, Titmas returned several other items that he 
claimed that he was holding for Robbins for safekeeping, including an Olympic 
torch that Robbins carried during the 1984 Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing of theft charges is another in a string of small legal victories 
for Robbins since his release. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, he won nearly $500,000 in a judgment against former real estate 
business partners who refused to pay him money owed while he was in prison. And 
just last month, the federal government -- seeking $3.3 million in restitution 
from Robbins -- joined him in his legal quest against other former co-investors 
who tried to shut Robbins out of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency for a lot of men who are incarcerated to give up and not 
be able to fight legal proceedings on their behalf," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either I was too dumb or too stubborn to give up. I felt I was paying my 
price for what I did that was wrong and that that entitled me to come back to 
society and get back what was my property."

PLAN FOR INTERIM COUNCIL MEMBER PRAISED, BUT FERRARO SKEPTICAL; CITY HALL: TWO 
CANDIDATES FOR YAROSLAVSKY'S 5TH DISTRICT SEAT SUPPORT HIS SUGGESTION THAT 
SOMEONE BE APPOINTED TO THE POST UNTIL A SPECIAL ELECTION IS HELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's proposal to have an interim 
council member appointed to succeed him when he leaves office drew praise 
Wednesday from a variety of community leaders, including two candidates seeking 
election to his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council President John Ferraro, whose views strongly influence City 
Hall, was skeptical that the council would take such a novel step, or that it 
is even necessary. The council has not made such an appointment since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it's going to happen," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky this week said he hopes the council would appoint a temporary 
council member until the city can hold a special election. He leaves the 
council on Dec. 5 to become a member of the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If no appointment is made, a high-ranking City Hall bureaucrat would oversee 
activities in Yaroslavsky's 5th District for as long as seven months -- the 
length of time it would take to elect a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ferraro's doubts about a council appointee failed to douse the fervor of 
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. President Richard Close and other community 
leaders who say they strongly support Yaroslavsky's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Close said a caretaker council member could be critical to the success of 
ambitious city plans to rebuild quake-devastated Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Sherman Oaks and Studio City to be without a voting council person for 
seven months would be catastrophic," said Close, who added that he had warned 
Yaroslavsky weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, with Yaroslavsky's blessing, are now reviewing the possibility 
of establishing a redevelopment plan for the Sherman Oaks area, where 
apartments and businesses were badly battered by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Close said he worried that the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency might use the absence of a council member to take control of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Close said his worst fears were that the other council members would actually 
use a leadership void to "strip mine" the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city will be adopting a budget next year when the 5th District will have 
no representative," Close said. "If we've got something the others want, there 
won't be anyone to stop them from taking it. They'll be fighting over the bones 
of the 5th District." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Yaroslavsky's departure will weaken the 5th District's voice at 
City Hall in part because the longtime council member is taking his top staff 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just Zev, but his entire staff that's going to be missed," warned 
former Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub, who will be running 
next spring for Yaroslavsky's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, council staff members -- who are knowledgeable about the district 
-- often stayed behind after their bosses left office. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub said the City Council must at least make sure an interim team is 
fully staffed with qualified people. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council follows its longtime practice, it will seek to merge the 
election to fill Yaroslavsky's seat with next year's regular municipal 
elections, which begin with a primary in April. The general election is 
scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That means anyone elected to the 5th District seat next year would probably 
take office on July 1, 1995, and would serve the remaining two years of 
Yaroslavsky's four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Also supporting the appointment idea was Michael Feuer, executive director of 
Bet Zdek Legal Services and another candidate for election to Yaroslavsky's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other supporters, Feuer favors an interim appointment only if the 
appointee does not intend to be a candidate for the same seat come election 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Daniels, president of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and a 
veteran homeowner leader from Yaroslavsky's district, warned that a leadership 
vacuum could result in further attacks on open space in the large mountainous 
regions of Yaroslavsky's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fear is that developers may be in there fast to take advantage of a 
leadership gap," Daniels said. Even with Yaroslavsky in office, there is an 
ongoing war to protect the Mulholland Drive scenic corridor from development 
encroachments, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky first raised the appointment idea in an interview this week with 
Times editors and reporters. Yaroslavsky said he was considering the idea 
solely because of his concerns about the fate of quake recovery efforts in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If no appointment is made, Ron Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst, 
is likely to be named by the City Council to run the 5th District. It has been 
the council practice for 30 years to use the CLA to run vacant council offices 
until a new council member is elected. Ten such vacancies have arisen since 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deaton would have no vote on the City Council, nor would he have the same 
standing in other respects with regular council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of caretaker would be a eunuch," Close complained. "We need a 
leader, not a caretaker, or we'll get lost in the shuffle at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ferraro said the CLA system works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had complaints in the past, and during one period the CLA was 
running two vacant council offices at the same time," Ferraro said. In 1991, 
the CLA ran both the South-Central Los Angeles seat left vacant by Councilman 
Gilbert Lindsay's death and the Eastside seat left empty when former 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina was elected in the middle of her term to the Board 
of Supervisors, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Zev or the community should be worrying about this," Ferraro 
said. "I'd be here to take calls from anyone who thought the 5th District 
wasn't being treated right, and Zev himself has never been a shy person. If he 
thought something was wrong, he'd call me about it."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN OFFICER ATTACK; 
HEARING: RONALD ARNETT COLEMAN REPORTEDLY TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT HE HIT AMY 
BONILLA BECAUSE SHE PUT HER HAND ON HER GUN.

 A Palmdale man accused of trying to kill a California Highway Patrol officer 
told investigators that he made a mistake by punching the officer repeatedly, 
but said that he did so because she put her hand on her gun, according to court 
records released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Arnett Coleman, 33, appeared in Newhall Municipal Court on Wednesday 
with a cast on his right arm as he pleaded not guilty to charges against him. 
Coleman's hand was examined by medical personnel after he complained of pain, 
but it was unclear if the injury was sustained during the alleged assault on 
the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Speer said Coleman could receive a maximum sentence 
of 23 years and four months in state prison if convicted of attempted murder, 
assault on a peace officer, assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a 
firearm by a felon and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman was arrested Monday after reportedly hitting CHP Officer Amy Bonilla, 
28, in the face after she stopped his vehicle about 8 a.m. on the Antelope 
Valley Freeway near Golden Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A limousine driver and two off-duty Burbank Police Department officers stopped 
and restrained Coleman. Authorities said they may have saved Bonilla's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla managed to fire one round from her service revolver during the 
altercation, but Coleman's hands were on the barrel and the shot went into 
ground, court records said. He let go of the gun after the shot and the officer 
tried to fire again, but the weapon malfunctioned for reasons still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman told detectives with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's Santa 
Clarita Valley station that he had visited an ex-girlfriend Sunday night in 
South-Central Los Angeles, where he smoked two PCP cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was returning to the Antelope Valley when Bonilla pulled him over for 
driving about 85 m.p.h., according to court records. An argument ensued and the 
alleged assault occurred when Bonilla tried to administer a field sobriety test 
to Coleman to see if he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. She also 
told Coleman that he would be jailed if he did not cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She put her hand on her gun so I hit her," Coleman told sheriff's deputies, 
according to court records. He also said, "I shouldn't have hit her." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, a parolee with several previous convictions for drug, theft and 
weapons offenses, is in custody in lieu of $715,000 bail. A bail review hearing 
is scheduled Tuesday and a preliminary hearing to determine if he will stand 
trial on the charges against him is scheduled Aug. 15.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EX-FOOTBALL STAR PLEADS GUILTY IN COLLISION 
THAT INJURED STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Hart High School star quarterback Ryan Connors pleaded guilty Wednesday 
in San Fernando Superior Court to a single count of causing bodily injury while 
driving under the influence of alcohol in connection with a head-on collision 
that severely injured a music student last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors, 20, entered the plea as pretrial motions in his case ended, Deputy 
Dist. Atty.Stephen A. Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he will ask Judge Shari K. Silver to sentence Hart to two 
years in prison on Aug. 26. The defense will seek probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors, the state's all-time single football season passing leader, was 
accused of drunk driving after he crashed head-on into another car while drag 
racing in a borrowed Mercedes-Benz on San Fernando Road on July 23, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver, CalArts student Gregory Moore, 33, of Saugus, was critically 
injured. Moore, an aspiring composer, has had several operations to reconstruct 
his face and was scheduled to undergo surgery again Wednesday, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, Connors was planning to attend UC Davis. Police 
said that two hours after the accident his blood alcohol was 0.08% -- the legal 
limit at which drivers are considered drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991 season, Connors passed for 4,144 yards and 39 touchdowns, 
leading his team to a league title.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LITTLEROCK WOMAN DIES DURING CAMPING TRIP; 
HIKING: JANET BRADLEY, 38, SUFFERED FROM ASTHMA AND BRONCHITIS, BUT THE CAUSE 
OF DEATH IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. 
</P>

<P>
 A Littlerock woman died Wednesday after developing respiratory problems during 
an overnight camping trip in the Angeles National Forest, despite the efforts 
of her boyfriend and fire officials to save her. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Bradley, 38, died shortly after a fire department rescue team took her 
to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, said Capt. Harry Thy of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley suffered from asthma and bronchitis, but the cause of death is still 
being investigated by the coroner's office, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley's boyfriend, Jerry Sikorski, 37, also of Littlerock, said he took 
Bradley and a male friend several miles into the mountains along Bouquet Canyon 
Road north of Santa Clarita about 5 p.m. Tuesday to pan for gold.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he had been dating Bradley for less than a year and that this was the 
first such trip he took her on. "I just wanted to show them how to pan gold," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley started having trouble breathing during the trek into the mountains, 
said Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson, but "at the time they did not feel it 
warranted any type of immediate medical attention."  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's breathing got worse just before dawn and the trio tried to hike 
out, but Bradley was unable to make it up the steep hills, Sikorski said. "She 
couldn't walk out any more." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's friend, Victor Black, 26, of Baja California, stayed with Bradley 
while Sikorski hiked out to get help. He reached the Texas Canyon Ranger 
Station just before 9:30 a.m. and fire and sheriff's officials were alerted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers spent about an hour searching the canyon, using vehicles and a 
helicopter, they said. Rescuers in a ground vehicle heard shouts for help about 
five miles into the canyon and found Black standing on a trail. He led them to 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters airlifted Bradley out of the canyon, but were forced to land near 
the ranger station and take her to the hospital by ambulance because she became 
combative for unknown reasons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to take a chance of something going wrong in the air," said 
Fire Department Inspector Gil Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports at the hospital indicated Bradley was suffering from 
dehydration and asthma. But her condition worsened and she died shortly before 
1 p.m., hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Bradley's death shocked Sikorski and members of her family, who 
gathered at the hospital to get more details from sheriff's officials about the 
incident.  
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Paul Shivley of Palmdale, said he doesn't understand why she made 
the trip with her longtime health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell she was doing out gold-panning and mining is beyond me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three hikers were scratched badly from the heavy brush and other obstacles 
in the rugged hills, Thy said. "They weren't prepared for this type of 
journey."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TALENTS UNLEASHED; OWNERS DEMONSTRATE VARIED 
SKILLS OF WORKING DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tammy, a 5-year-old Labrador and golden retriever mix with light brown hair 
and eyes, is more than a companion for Jennifer Cabernoch.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabernoch, 25 years old and confined to a wheelchair, says Tammy is one of the 
most important individuals in her life. She boosts Cabernoch's confidence and 
helps her meet challenges ranging from dropped keys to high shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has made my life very happy and I am glad I have her," Cabernoch said. 
</P>
<P>
 So glad that she and Miranda Alcott founded the Working Dogs Support Group two 
years ago to educate the public as well as provide social activities for both 
animals and owners. Cabernoch and Alcott spoke about working dogs to about 30 
people Wednesday at the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to put this together because we met some resistance," said Alcott, 
a Canyon Country resident who works in film, explaining that some restaurant 
owners have been reluctant to allow working dogs indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is trying to demonstrate the entire range of assistance the dogs 
provide, beyond their service to the blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Working dogs are easy to spot in public. They wear a vest printed with "Do Not 
Pet" to discourage distractions from well-meaning bystanders. They are trained 
to remain calm in situations that would have most canines barking, running or 
otherwise out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several types of working dogs. Hearing dogs alert hearing-impaired 
people to noises, service dogs help the wheelchair-bound with physical tasks 
and social dogs interact with people who have developmental disabilities. 
Working dogs also serve in arson, K-9 and search-and-rescue operations for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Working dogs for the handicapped typically receive about two years of 
training, learning dozens of commands and actions before they are linked with 
an owner. The owner, in turn, spends two weeks learning how to reinforce the 
training and match their needs with the dog's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I drop something on the floor, she picks it up for me. If it's too high on 
the shelf and she won't knock things over, she will get it," said Cabernoch, 
who lives in the Saugus area of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcott's 18-month-old border collie, Radar, helped her adjust to the loss of 
her hearing four years ago. Radar alerts Alcott to important sounds, from her 
alarm clock in the morning to a ringing doorbell or someone calling her name. 
The dog is being trained to alert Alcott to approaching sirens on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you see a person with a working dog trying to get into a restaurant, into 
a hospital or wherever and they are having trouble, please support them," 
Alcott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Working Dogs Support Group are also aware that the animals, 
despite their specialized training, are still dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tammy knows how to open the refrigerator door and get a can," Cabernoch said. 
"She can't distinguish between Pepsi and Coors. You take your chances."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REINSTATING BUS ROUTE SUPPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Administrators of the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, who canceled commuter 
bus service to Century City after earthquake relief funds ran out, have had a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from angry commuters at a July 25 meeting and talking with them 
again July 30, bus agency officials recommended Wednesday that one weekday bus 
run to and from Century City be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 A special meeting will be held at 10 a.m. Monday to allow the agency's 
three-member board of directors to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA spokesman Tim Galbraith said a small group of Century City bus commuters, 
who prepared a detailed proposal concerning route changes and marketing ideas, 
deserve credit for persuading the agency to reconsider this service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan was bound and presented very professionally," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which runs bus service in Palmdale, Lancaster and nearby county 
areas, as well as commuter service to Downtown Los Angeles, added commuter 
routes to Van Nuys and Century City in April. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency paid most of the cost to help commuters affected in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith said riders were informed from the beginning that these new services 
would end if the FEMA money ran out and there were too few riders to justify 
its continuation by the Antelope Valley bus agency. 
</P>
<P>
 By early July, the two 45-seat morning buses to Century City together were 
carrying only about 12 to 15 passengers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their recent proposal, some Century City riders suggested that more 
passengers would use the bus if its route took it past more major employers in 
West Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing this material, Bill Budlong, executive director of the AVTA, 
recommended that the board reinstate one Century City bus each weekday morning 
and a return trip in the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fare is $7 for one trip, $110 for a 20-ride punch pass and $190 
for a monthly pass.

DETROIT EDISON SIGNS DEAL WITH 3 AUTO MAKERS; ENERGY: THE $2-BILLION AGREEMENT 
WITH FORD, GM AND CHRYSLER IS THE FIRST U.S. UTILITY CONTRACT WITH AN ENTIRE 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest move yet by a utility to stave off competition, Detroit Edison 
agreed Wednesday to sharply reduce rates charged to the Big Three auto makers 
in exchange for long-term supply contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, valued at $2 billion, is the first time a U.S. utility has 
negotiated a contract with an entire industry within its service area. Detroit 
Edison would provide power to 54 plants and offices of General Motors Corp., 
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. in southeast Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal reflects a strong response to deregulation and growing competition in 
the utility industry, as major industrial users push for more choice and lower 
prices from power providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Fedun, an analyst for Fitch Investors Service, a credit-rating 
service, said that while there have been isolated instances of utilities 
offering discounts to keep industrial users, the Detroit Edison contract is 
precedent-setting because of its scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The auto makers were looking at other power sources -- cogeneration or 
competitor utilities," he said. "Now Detroit Edison has secured a stream of 
revenue through contract. It's very significant." 
</P>
<P>
 More utilities are expected to follow Detroit Edison's lead as they seek to 
keep major customers. "The concept will spread," said Douglas Fischer, an 
analyst for A.G. Edwards & Co. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 States nationwide have been under pressure by manufacturers to end the 
monopoly of utility companies. California and Michigan are among states that 
have passed regulations that are phasing in competition among the different 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry accounts for nearly 13% of Detroit Edison's sales. The 
utility is seen as particularly vulnerable to competition because of its heavy 
reliance on auto, steel and other large industrial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These contracts represent a managed transition to a more competitive 
environment," said John Lobbia, Detroit Edison's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements, which must be approved by the Michigan Public Service 
Commission, would provide the auto makers with savings of $30 million next 
year, the utility estimates. By 1999, the figure could reach $50 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Mehra, Ford's manager of energy efficiency and supply, said the deal 
means electricity rates should on average be 20% lower for his company over the 
next 10 years than they were in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Edison said it will make up the savings offered to the Big Three by 
reducing operating expenses. It would also work with the manufacturers to save 
energy costs. The rates of other commercial customers and residential consumers 
would not be affected, the utility said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers have been leaders in finding ways to lower utility costs. 
Recently, Ford sought to form a municipal utility in Romeo, Mich., to supply 
electricity to its engine plant there, now served by Detroit Edison. Under the 
new agreement, the auto makers agreed not to create competing utilities or 
operate cogeneration facilities, except for emergency backup purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new agreement, Detroit Edison would be the sole supplier to the Big 
Three for six years. After that, the companies can reduce their power purchases 
from the utility by 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehra said he believes the Michigan regulators will approve the deal because 
they have been supportive of a slow deregulation. "They want to move to 
competition, but in a managed fashion," he said. "This does that by getting 
Edison through the transition."

PUC APPROVES INCENTIVE PLAN TO DETERMINE SDG&E PROFIT; ENERGY: IN AN 
EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO START IN 1995, THE UTILITY'S EARNINGS WILL BE TIED TO 
ITS ABILITY TO CUT OPERATING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a significant step to change the way California's electric utilities are 
regulated, the state Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a plan 
by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. that will determine the utility's profit by how 
efficiently it runs its business. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first such companywide incentive plan in the nation to be 
applied to an electric utility. It is "the beginning of the end of traditional 
rate making," SDG&E Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas A. Page said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the state's investor-owned utilities have been granted a set return 
on their investments, which provided little financial incentive to keep costs 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1995 under the five-year experimental plan, SDG&E's profit will 
be tied to the company's success in bringing operating costs down -- in part, 
using the national average for electricity costs as a benchmark. SDG&E's power 
now costs about 30% more than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Such incentive schemes are also part of the commission's proposal to 
restructure the electric utility industry in California. In one part of that 
plan, customers would be allowed to shop for electricity among competing 
producers. But other areas of operations, including transmission and 
distribution, would probably remain regulated but use the efficiency incentives 
to determine profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the commission hopes eventually to succeed with its major restructuring 
proposal, this is a crucial first step," said Steven M. Fetter, director of 
regulatory and governmental affairs at Fitch Investors Service Inc. "It breaks 
away from the traditional mind-set with regard to rate making," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts applauded the move, but several California consumer groups 
say the plan as structured won't result in lower electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under a major component of the plan, utility shareholders will benefit when 
the utility can cut costs far enough to add as much as 1% to its return on 
equity allowed by the PUC. If greater efficiency gains push that to 1.5%, 
shareholders and ratepayers -- in the form of lower power bills -- share the 
increased profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once you've started sharing 50-50 with the ratepayers, you've lowered the 
incentive," said Michael Shames, executive director of San Diego-based Utility 
Consumers Action Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Fetter and other industry experts are far more optimistic about lower power 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most utilities when they're freed up (from traditional regulation) will do 
better," Fetter said. "They've never had the incentive to run a lean and mean 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- the state's 
other two big investor-owned utilities -- have proposals for similar plans 
pending before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect that within two years, all the utilities will have 
performance-based rate making in place," said Donald Felsinger, SDG&E executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation, the utility has already begun shrinking the ranks of 
employees devoted to preparing for rate making under the traditional system. 
Felsinger estimated that SDG&E has had as many as 200 people at peak periods 
doing the paperwork necessary for the commission's rate-setting procedures, an 
effort that will end under the new rules, saving $1 million to $2 million every 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility also plans to tie part of workers' salaries -- from 10% in the 
lower ranks to 50% for Page -- to the company's business performance, rather 
than using conventional cost-of-living increases.

MAKING GREENBACKS GREENER; COMPANIES HOPE RECYCLING OLD CASH INTO NEW PRODUCTS 
PAYS 
</P>

<P>
 People have always dreamed about having enough money to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Ace Noffsinger, general manager of Log World in Coachella, is 
trying to manufacture and sell cordwood logs made out of old greenbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Log World is one of five Southern California companies negotiating with the 
Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles to recycle 1,100 tons a year of shredded 
U.S. currency into products ranging from roof shingles to freeway sound 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find a source that will take this and recycle it so we don't 
have to fill up the landfills," said Brent Duxbury, an administrator with the 
Federal Reserve in Los Angeles. "It costs us about $60,000 a year to get rid of 
it, including disposal fees and transportation fees." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will give the stuff -- which looks like green confetti packed into 
briquettes -- to any company willing to haul it away on a regular basis. 
Duxbury said the bank plans to decide by mid-August which company or companies 
will get the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Stationery maker Crane & Co., based in Dalton, Mass., pioneered the idea last 
year when it began making pale green note pads and envelopes out of shredded 
dollars and marketing them under the name Old Money. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the novelty of making things out of used dollars, manufacturers 
say the linen fibers in bills make their products stronger. They also enjoy 
helping the environment by utilizing a material that would otherwise go into a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the Fed pulls 7 billion bills -- weighing 7,000 tons -- out of 
circulation that are limp, dirty, torn or generally unfit, said John Cameron, a 
spokesman for the Fed in Washington. Each week, the bank in Los Angeles 
disposes of three 15-by-8-by-7-foot trash bins containing old bills, Duxbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Log World's Noffsinger said the shredded currency should blend easily into his 
Everglo pressed logs. He said he hopes to start production by early August. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take construction waste and all different things that are going to the 
dumps and we recycle it and grind it," he said. To that, the company adds paper 
and a small amount of resin and then presses the material into log shapes for 
use in campfires or fireplaces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Log World uses 12,000 pounds of paper to make about 10,000 logs a day and 
could easily use as much of the shredded money as the Fed will give away, 
Noffsinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gridcore Systems International has been experimenting with the shredded bills 
in its Long Beach factory, adding them to the mixture of corrugated cardboard 
and office paper that go into the company's molded fiber panels, company 
President Robert Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice color, like marble," Noble said. "We added more white paper to 
the mix with the currency to create the marble effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Gridcore panels -- which are usually beige and are available in a variety of 
thicknesses -- are used in stage sets and trade show exhibits and as ceiling 
tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, an Encinitas, Calif., company has installed 500 square feet of the 
Gridcore panels for a floral exhibit at the Los Angeles County Fair, which will 
open in September, said James Wilkinson, president of Environscape Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see where the little shreds of money are in it," said Wilkinson, who 
was attracted to the panel's look and texture. "People will get a kick out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Shake in Irwindale and Terra Roofing in Fontana are making fireproof 
roofing shingles with the shredded currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Philippe, vice president of operations at Cal Shake, said the material 
works fine as a replacement for cardboard in his company's shingle mixture. 
Terra Roofing's moneyed shingles are still being tested for strength and 
flexibility, Executive Vice President Lawrence Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But both companies said it may not be cost-effective for them to transport, 
store and process the shredded money, even though they can have it for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is, can we justify the cost of equipment to handle the 
shredded confetti versus the baled cardboard?" Philippe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer will depend on the volatile price of cardboard, which has doubled 
in the last six months. Using the old money "would insulate us from wild swings 
in the price of cardboard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Artzer, owner of Monolithic Building Systems in Oceanside, Calif., 
said he is prepared to use the shredded money as a replacement for the expanded 
polystyrene -- which looks like Styrofoam -- that goes inside the walls and 
freeway sound barriers his company builds. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are made with four inches of shredded currency wrapped in a plastic 
tube and sandwiched between an inch of concrete. They are heavier than the 
walls made with expanded polystyrene and absorb more sound, Artzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can get filler for nothing, then it's worth it to use it," Artzer said. 
"It keeps the cost of my product down, and I can pass that savings along to my 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Artzer builds about 20 miles of walls a year, though there is only enough 
shredded money to fill half of them, he said. Still, he is optimistic the 
currency will help boost his sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say my walls are worth a lot of money," Artzer said. "It's a good 
selling point."

TALLYING BUS STRIKE'S IMPACT ON BUSINESS; ECONOMY: SHOPPING AREAS CLAIM THEY 
LOST MILLIONS IN REVENUE, WHILE TAXI COMPANIES SAY THEY ENJOYED A BOOM. 
</P>

<P>
 With bus service returning to normal today, Los Angeles businesses and their 
workers are starting to recover from the nine-day transit strike that is 
estimated to have cost the community $18 million in wages, sales and 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst hit by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strike were shopping 
areas that depend on bus-riding customers and businesses whose employees 
commute to work by bus. The losses came to $1.5 million a day in Downtown Los 
Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those employees were able to piece together rides on the skeletal bus 
system and in car pools to get to work. But those longer commutes cut into 
workdays, which therefore cut into paychecks and productivity, said Jack Kyser, 
chief economist with the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 But taxi companies profited from the grounding of more than 80% of the MTA's 
fleet of 1,900 buses. Business nearly tripled at Independent Cab Co., where 
workers fielded 400 calls an hour, up from 150. 
</P>
<P>
 At Beverly Hills Cab Co., Operations Manager Vanik Zadurian said that 
"everyone was jumping in front of a cab in intersections or jumping right into 
the cabs. Our drivers were making extra money, but our steady customers were 
complaining" of longer waits for taxis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,600 commuters called Commuter Transportation Services for ride-sharing 
information during the strike -- almost double the number for a normal nine-day 
period, spokeswoman Roberta Tinajero said. 
</P>
<P>
 But car pools didn't work for everyone. At Yaohan Supermarket in Little Tokyo, 
some transit-dependent employees could not make the commute from Torrance. 
"Some of our employees started taking vacations early to avoid the time they 
were going to miss," store manager Tomokuni Seya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers stayed home too. Traffic at Eagle Rock Plaza was off 50% during the 
strike, store managers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our business comes in from the buses, and since the strike it's just 
been terrible," said Sandra Prado, a supervisor at Accessory Place in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did make it were sometimes greeted by cranky employees who had to 
commute without regular MTA service, said Keith Pickett, who works at a Santa 
Monica Place information booth and saw his commute grow from 45 minutes to 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have more of an attitude and they are a lot more worn out than normal," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel managers at area hotels welcomed the end of the strike, which made 
it tough for housekeeping employees to get to work on time. About one-fifth of 
the 250 workers at the Holiday Inn in Hollywood ride the bus, and many "were 
either late or were very tired and kind of stressed," said Otho Boggs, human 
resources director for the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the region's largest employers said they felt the least impact. 
Because of their size, they were able to organize in-house ride-sharing 
programs and provide additional parking for employees who drove to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly one-third of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s 1,500 Downtown employees 
ride the bus, spokesman Scott Loll said, "we did not feel any great impact. 
There was enough warning for people to find alternative means of 
transportation."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: IN JAPAN, THEY DIAL U.S. FOR AN UNDERTAKING IN 
SHREWDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreigners fond of whining about the outrageously high prices here these days 
had better be particularly careful about how long they complain when they call 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a recent dash of deregulation, Japan's international telephone rates 
remain among the most expensive in the world. A brief chat using Kokusai 
Denshin Denwa -- Japan's top global carrier -- can often top $2 a minute. Not 
surprisingly, KDD is one of the most profitable companies in Japan's troubled 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But gaiatsu -- foreign pressure -- is finally bringing some unexpected 
competition to Japan's $3-billion annual market in transoceanic telephone 
calls. This isn't a happy result of the sort of U.S.-Japan telecommunications 
trade liberalization talks that recently collapsed. Rather, it's a byproduct of 
the kind of market-driven Yankee ingenuity that drives Japanese technocrats 
absolutely crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining technology with chutzpah, American entrepreneurs have figured out 
how to arbitrage the arbitrarily high rates most nations set for their 
international telephone calls. These "callback services" exploit legal and 
technical loopholes in the global network in ways Japan's telecommunications 
establishment couldn't have imagined even three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They do it by literally exporting cheap American dial tones across the Pacific 
directly into Japanese telephones. In fact, these callback services will 
probably have a bigger impact on Japanese telecommunications than any deals cut 
by the U.S. trade representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mid-sized company with a monthly international phone bill of $5,000 to 
Europe and North America would now save about 40%," says Toshi Kawakami, 
president of USF Pacific, one of Japan's callback pioneers, which began 
offering its service just a year ago. "With the recession, there is the 
necessity for companies to cut their expenses rather than number of people. 
Many corporations with red figures must take drastic measures. Business is 
brisk." 
</P>
<P>
 These U.S.-based callback services -- which also do lots of business in Europe 
and Latin America -- operate by leasing large volumes of excess international 
telephone line capacity from carriers such as MCI and Sprint. They then package 
and resell the capacity to individuals in countries around the world through a 
network of sales representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to America's deregulated and highly competitive telecommunications 
market, rates for international calls originating in the United States are 
exceptionally low. In fact, America makes the cheapest phone calls in the 
world. The trick is exporting them. 
</P>
<P>
 That turns out to be surprisingly simple. A caller in Japan dials a designated 
number in the United States, lets the phone ring once or twice, then hangs up. 
A few moments later, a specially programmed telephone switch "calls back" with 
a dial tone. The individual can then dial the desired phone number in America, 
Europe or anywhere else overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, the call originates in the United States and in effect bypasses 
Japan's global carriers altogether. Essentially, callback operators have 
successfully exported America's cheap international telephone rates to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not make Japan's global carriers happy. Earlier this year, KDD -- 
along with two Ministry of Post and Telecommunications-approved rivals -- 
formally petitioned the government to investigate the callback services. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trio's complaints was that the unanswered call to the United States 
qualifies as theft because it ties up circuits without offering any 
compensation. Indeed, AT&T (which has its own callback-competitive 
international service called ATT Direct) complained to the Federal 
Communications Commission about the callback operators, saying much the same 
thing. The FCC declined to act. 
</P>
<P>
 So, surprisingly, did Japan's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, which 
is widely perceived as one of the stodgier Japanese ministries. "The trend is 
to deregulate the market," says Morihiro Machida of Cosmo Trading Corp., the 
Japanese agent of Telegroup Inc., a leading callback operator based in 
Fairfield, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (the MPT) put another regulation on callback service, that is opposed 
to the trend," he says. "So I am very optimistic about callback services, 
because I don't think MPT will impose another regulation on us." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a big victory for the U.S. telecommunications technology," 
says USF Pacific's Kawakami. "Its impact isn't only on the Japanese market; 
it's a revolutional change of almost all foreign countries' monopolistic and 
oligopolistic telecommunications policies. I feel this every day when I get 
orders from Japanese corporations and French and English companies here. . . . 
All their calls from here will go through America." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a service once perceived as a tool for American travelers -- 
particularly business people sick of high rates compounded by ridiculous hotel 
surcharges -- who want to bypass the expensive telecommunications monopolies of 
a foreign land is becoming a discount option for local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big companies like Mitsubishi and Toyota already have their own global 
networks," says Telegroup's Machida. "Our growth is going to come from the 
middle. . . . I think KDD will have trouble competing with us on price." 
</P>
<P>
 Machida and Kawakami acknowledge that callbacks currently account for only a 
fraction of today's multibillion-dollar international market. But they are 
confident that recession-weary Japanese are thrilled by the opportunity to get 
top-quality global telecommunications for less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Japanese are not so interested in trade talks," says Machida, "but they 
are interested in this."

BIDS HEAT UP FOR MADISON SQUARE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an effort to make a preemptive bid for Madison Square Garden, sources 
said Wednesday that the self-proclaimed "manifest destiny" of cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. to acquire the famous New York sports and 
entertainment complex is far from assured. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI faces serious, deep-pocket competition from several other bidders, notably 
a determined team formed by ITT Corp. and Cablevision Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids are due by Aug. 15 under the terms of an auction being staged by Viacom 
Inc., which acquired the Garden with its cable network and two professional 
sports teams as part of the takeover of Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Published reports have suggested that TCI has the edge because it could use 
the Garden as a deal-breaker for completing three other transactions with 
Viacom: a merger of two premium cable services, Viacom's Showtime with TCI's 
Encore, and the sale of Viacom's cable systems to a TCI affiliate. If these 
deals are completed, Viacom is expected to drop an antitrust suit filed against 
TCI last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone is unlikely to capitulate on the Garden, 
sources said, because he has a fiduciary duty to accept the highest bid. "This 
is going to go to the highest bidder," insisted one source, who added that 
Viacom has viewed some of the news stories favoring TCI as "an attempt to chill 
the bidding process." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom is seeking at least $1 billion, but that figure hasn't deterred 
cash-rich ITT or its partner, Charles Dolan's Cablevision Systems, sources 
said. Shoe manufacturer NIKE Inc. and Canadian brewer John Labatt Ltd. are also 
said to be in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision Systems, one of the nation's largest cable operators, already runs 
a sports channel in the New York area. ITT, for its part, is eager to invest in 
Madison Square Garden because it already owns other choice real estate in 
Manhattan and would like to offer televised sports events throughout its 
Sheraton hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 But one TCI executive has said it is the company's "manifest destiny" to 
acquire the Garden. TCI needs the New York market to create a national sports 
service linking the regional sports services it already owns. 
</P>
<P>
 One source involved in the TCI-Viacom negotiations said that no resolution is 
expected for at least 10 days. Only Viacom would comment Wednesday, calling the 
talks "very complex and continuing. No decisions have been made."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; TALK OF DRUG DEAL ENLIVENS SLOW TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Takeover speculation in the drug sector enlivened a lethargic session for 
stocks as market measures closed mixed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Merger news involving companies outside the pharmaceuticals group also lent 
support to the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which reached its highest level since 
mid-June earlier this week, ended with a modest loss of 3.56 at 3,792.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Most broader market barometers edged ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainers ended the day with a lead over losers of about 100 issues on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where trading was moderately active. Big Board volume came 
to 282.38 million shares as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared to 294.72 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug stocks were the standouts as investors bet that other companies could 
become takeover targets following American Home Products' $8.5-billion bid for 
American Cyanamid. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Cyanamid kept most of the 29 1/4 gain it made in after-hours 
trading Tuesday on news that American Home Products had made the $95-a-share 
takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
 It eased 2 1/4 to 90 3/4 from its late-trading peak of 93 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warner-Lambert jumped 3 3/4 to 72 1/4, Schering-Plough rose 1 1/8 to 67 5/8, 
Upjohn gained 7/8 to 32 7/8, Amgen advanced 1 5/8 to 51 1/8 and Johnson & 
Johnson rose 7/8 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conrail climbed 2 1/4 to 56 1/2 and Norfolk Southern slipped 1/8 to 63 5/8 
on a published report of merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unitrin rose nine to 48 3/4 in Nasdaq trading on news of a $2.6-billion cash 
takeover from American General. American General ended up 3/8 at 28 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snapple Beverage slumped 5 5/16 to 15 1/4 after its earnings fell below Wall 
Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcements of intended acquisitions encouraged buying of other individual 
stocks. ElectroCom Automation surged 3 5/8 to 9 3/4 in heavy NYSE turnover in 
response to news that AEG, a unit of German industrial conglomerate 
Daimler-Benz, signed a $10-a-share deal to buy the supplier of document 
processors to the U.S. Postal Service. Daimler rose 1 1/8 to 52 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the takeover plays, analysts said, the session was uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
 Oded Levy, head of the Genesis Merchant Group trading desk, said investors 
paused to collect profits after the mini buying binge that developed late last 
week and carried over into Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the buying will resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors who have been waiting on the sidelines have begun to selectively 
accumulate attractive equities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks bounced back after the bond market took comfort from reports of slower 
car sales in July and news that the Treasury's borrowing needs won't exceed 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly weak sales figures from the Big Three auto makers sent bond 
yields lower. The sales slowdown supported the view that the economic expansion 
has eased to a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 7.38% from 7.40% on Tuesday, 
pushing its price up 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields and prices move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising stocks on several of the major overseas markets provided a positive 
backdrop for Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican shares closed higher for a fourth straight day as investors reacted to 
a sharp drop in domestic interest rates, traders said. The Bolsa index gained 
28.79 points to close at 2,567.31. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average rose 12.53 points to close at 2,198.92, 
while in London the Financial Times 100-share average gained 2.9 points to 
finish at 3,160.4. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei ended at 20,632.73, down 27.40 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the popular U.S. market performance gauges, the NYSE composite index 
rose 0.43 points to 254.58 and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.89 to 
461.45. The Nasdaq composite index dipped 1.11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, meanwhile, the dollar slipped against leading foreign 
currencies as traders grew edgy ahead of the influential July unemployment 
report due on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against most other European currencies, but it was unchanged 
against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has given Japan two months to make adjustments in its trade 
policies, and that has taken the focus off dollar-yen for the moment, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 100.35 yen, the same as on Tuesday. The 
greenback fell to 1.577 German marks in New York, from 1.584.

LOCKHEED-LED TEAM WINS LAB CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team led by Lockheed Corp. won a $5-billion contract from the Department of 
Energy on Wednesday to take over management of the Idaho National Engineering 
Laboratory, a nuclear research center outside Idaho Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed hailed the five-year award as a major step in the Calabasas-based 
aerospace giant's effort to pare its reliance on defense spending.The contract 
is also a victory for Parsons Corp., a Pasadena-based engineering firm on the 
Lockheed team. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's selection also marks one of the initial attempts by the Energy 
Department to overhaul its contract award system. The agency had announced last 
month that it would open bidding on contracts covering its labs and production 
centers -- awards totaling $31 billion over the next five years -- to promote 
efficiency and reduce the sites' operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed award, which replaces five separate contracts that were needed to 
operate the sprawling Idaho lab, "represents a major milestone in DOE's efforts 
to change the way we do business," Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab currently has 8,200 workers and is among Idaho's largest employers. 
The 890-square-mile lab was founded in 1949 and has been a major site for 
nuclear energy research, having operated more than 50 nuclear reactors and 
related facilities at various times. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the lab helped develop nuclear-based propulsion systems 
for Navy ships and submarines and specializes in studying the treatment and 
storage of nuclear wastes. Indeed, the Lockheed team's job will include the 
environmental cleanup at the Idaho lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and the Energy Department also hope to transfer more of the lab's 
expertise to commercial ventures. The lab has been studying some products with 
commercial potential, such as how police chasing a car could use a microwave 
device to turn off the car's engine from a distance.

PANEL REJECTS U.S. CLAIM OF LUMBER BIAS; TRADE: THE RULING MAY MEAN A REFUND TO 
CANADA OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DUTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A binational panel Wednesday rejected a U.S. claim that Canadian members on 
another binational committee were biased when they overturned U.S. duties on 
imported softwood lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision may mean that the United States will have to refund hundreds of 
millions of dollars in duties to Canada's lumber industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, claiming unfair Canadian subsidies, has collected 6.51% 
duties on the lumber since mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. government source said the adverse ruling means the duties will have to 
stop, but the government has not decided if it must refund those fees collected 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. trade agencies said the duties were justified because of unfair 
Canadian subsidies, previous panels invoked under the U.S.-Canada Free Trade 
Agreement have twice overruled the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member panel with representatives from both Canada and the United 
States, affirmed rulings made by previous binational reviews in 1993 and 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Extraordinary Challenge Committee is made up of three retired 
judges, two from Canada and one from the United States. Both Canadians ruled 
against the U.S. complaint, with the U.S. member dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada provides about one-fourth of the lumber used in the United States. 
Canadian forestry companies hailed the panel's ruling, saying it will mean a 
refund of about $576 million in duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken nearly three years, but our position has been fully and finally 
vindicated," said Tom Buell, chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ottawa, Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren welcomed the ruling. MacLaren 
said he expects the United States to return the duties now that the 
Extraordinary Challenge Committee has dismissed the allegations of conflict of 
interest and incorrect application of U.S. law.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the U.S. Administration to implement the findings as quickly as 
possible, which will result in refunds, with interest, of the approximately 
$800 million (Canadian) in cash deposits that have been paid to date," he said. 
</P>

 Washington requested the formation of the Extraordinary Challenge Committee on 
April 6. It contended that two Canadian members of the binational panel were 
biased and that the group overstepped its authority in deciding that neither of 
two Canadian subsidy programs were subject to duties.  
</P>
<P>
 At issue were so-called stumpage fees and a log export ban in British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Justice Gordon Hart, a member of the challenge committee, rejected 
U.S. charges that the two Canadians on the panel had not revealed possible 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it is my view that there was no intentional refusal to reveal 
any matter that would justify the opposite party in removing either panelist, 
and the request by the U.S. government for an extraordinary challenge should be 
rejected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said that because the decision was made by the Canadian majority with the 
American member dissenting, he hoped it would not be interpreted as "based on 
national interest."

$550-MILLION CHEVRON TAX ACCORD REACHED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chevron Corp. all but cleared its books of nine years of tax disputes by 
reaching a $550-million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement adds roughly 10% to the company's federal tax payments between 
1979 and 1987, with the bulk of the $550 million representing net interest on 
the tax adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron, which had set aside reserves exceeding the settlement total, expects 
a "fairly significant benefit" to third-quarter earnings, said Laurie 
Sachtleben, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with this outcome," said Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman and 
chief executive. "The settlement moves us strongly toward our goal of becoming 
current in our tax audit and resolving all tax issues in a timely manner."

 Scott Paper Co. Unveils Deeper Job Cuts: The company said it will cut deeper 
and quicker into its payroll than originally planned, laying off a third of its 
work force -- 10,500 people -- worldwide by year's end as part of its 
restructuring efforts.An original restructuring plan called for cutting 8,300 
workers within two to three years. The layoffs, which will trim Scott's payroll 
to 24,000, will affect 20% of hourly production workers and half of those on 
weekly salaries. A third of the layoffs will target Americans, the company 
said. The rest will be spread across Scott facilities in 20 other countries.

 Hughes Seeks Higher Damages in Patent Case: Hughes Aircraft Co., which was 
awarded $114 million in June in a patent infringement suit against the U.S. 
government, said it appealed the amount as too low. Hughes had sought more than 
$1 billion in the case, in which the government was found to have violated 
Hughes' patent covering the device that pioneered communications satellite 
technology. Hughes, a Los Angeles-based unit of General Motors Corp., said the 
royalty rate on government satellites using the device -- which was used to 
determine the damages -- was neither fair nor just compensation.

 USAir Pilots Offer Restructuring Proposal: The USAir Master Executive Council 
of the Air Line Pilots Assn. International put forth a sweeping plan offering 
$750 million in wage concessions in exchange for a 25% employee stake in 
Arlington, Va.-based USAir Group Inc. The action came in response to a USAir 
proposal to cut annual operating expenses by $1 billion through labor and other 
means. The airline wants half the cuts to come from wage and benefit 
concessions from its unionized employees, who make up nearly half the work 
force. The pilots union represents 5,200 pilots, or 12% of the work force. 
Analysts said the pilots' proposal is an opening gambit in what are likely to 
be lengthy, difficult negotiations. USAir Group Inc. has been plagued by losses 
and fierce competition on the East Coast.

 TWA Eliminating 3,380 Jobs: The carrier said it will lay off 500 employees 
immediately and another 2,500 within the next month as part of the "tough 
decisions" it must make to be competitive. Trans World Airlines Inc. also said 
it plans to eliminate 300 jobs in a restructuring of its international 
operations and 80 domestic management positions. A spokesman for the St. 
Louis-based airline said the bulk of employees receiving the first layoff 
notices are machinists working out of the Kansas City overhaul base.

 PUC Acts on Cellular Matters: The California Public Utilities Commission said 
it will apply to the Federal Communications Commission to continue its 
regulatory authority over the cellular telephone business. In a victory for 
cellular resellers, who buy circuits in bulk from the major carriers such as 
McCaw Cellular and AirTouch Communications and resell them to customers, the 
commission also ruled that the carriers must now resell bulk circuits with less 
onerous conditions. The resellers said the two related decisions could cut 
cellular rates by up to 30%, but the major carriers say continued regulation of 
the cellular industry will ultimately stifle competition and keep prices 
higher.

 American Cyanamid Will Consider Takeover Bid: The Wayne, N.J., drug and 
agricultural products company said it will review the surprise $8.5-billion, or 
$95-a-share, offer by rival American Home Products Corp. of Madison, N.J. 
Cyanamid stock jumped more than 40% in New York Stock Exchange trading, rising 
$27 to close at $90.75. It had climbed as high as $93 in after-hours, 
off-exchange electronic trading Tuesday after American Home announced the 
offer.Analysts said Cyanamid stock could go higher if other drug companies bid 
for all or part of the firm. Industry watchers in London ruled out a counter 
bid by British drug giant SmithKline Beecham, which had reportedly been in 
talks about a spinoff deal. American Home's stock rose 62.5 cents to $57.375 on 
the NYSE.

ECONOMY STILL GROWING, BUT SLOWLY; FORECASTS: LEADING INDICATORS INDEX POSTS A 
0.2% GAIN IN JUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BERRY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. economy was still expanding last month "at a solid pace," but there 
were scattered signs of slower growth and little evidence of rising retail 
prices, according to a nationwide Federal Reserve Board survey of economic 
conditions released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The California economy , which accounts for about one-eighth of the U.S. 
total, was described as "sluggish." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other reports out Wednesday, one from auto makers and the others from 
the Commerce Department, also support the notion of slower economic growth. 
Commerce said its index of leading indicators, whose changes often foreshadow 
those of the overall economy, rose 0.2% in June, following a 0.1% rise in May 
and no change in April. The 0.3% increase over three months is significantly 
lower than the 1% gain from December to March and the 1.6% from September to 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "The June data are indicative of an economy that is growing at a reasonable 
but not steamy pace," said Ray Stone of Stone & McCarthy, a financial markets 
research firm in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed survey results, part of the information Fed policy-makers will use at 
their Aug. 16 policy-making session, leaves open the question of whether the 
central bank will raise short-term interest rates for a fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Fed districts reported that manufacturers and builders are paying more 
for components and materials. At the same time, however, the survey summary 
notes that "a majority of districts report that retailers are holding the line 
on price increases." 
</P>
<P>
 The sector seeing the biggest slowdown is housing, which has suffered in most 
of the country because of rising mortgage interest rates, the survey found. In 
the other reports, auto makers said that sales of domestically produced new 
cars fell last month to an annual rate of 6.4 million units from 7 million in 
June and that sales of light trucks -- a category that includes minivans and 
sport utility vehicles -- dipped to a 5.2-million-unit rate from 5.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department also reported that new orders for manufactured goods 
rose 0.8% in June to $279.6 billion. Orders rose 0.8% in May as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rising number of orders underscores the current health of the 
manufacturing sector, orders are not coming in as fast as they were late last 
year and early this year. Index of Leading Indicators

CHASE TO ACQUIRE AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan Corp. said Wednesday that it has agreed to buy American 
Residential Holding Corp., a La Jolla-based mortgage lender, for $348 million 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase will make Chase the nation's fifth-largest mortgage company, with 
$11.5 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 American Residential, which has 100 branches in 32 states, offers single- and 
multifamily residential mortgages of $212,000 or less. These mortgages are 
known as "conforming" because they have characteristics that enable them to be 
sold to the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp., government-sponsored mortgage agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase has concentrated on making so-called jumbo mortgages -- loans that 
exceed $212,000. With American Residential, the company will expand its 
conforming loan business, said Bob Hunter, the head of Chase's consumer finance 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition is Chase's second major purchase of a mortgage company. Last 
year it bought Troy & Nickels, a regional firm based in Monroe, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement with American Residential, a Chase subsidiary 
will begin within a week a tender offer for all of the firm's outstanding 
common stock at $28.25 a share. At least 80% of American Residential's stock 
must be tendered for the deal to proceed, Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition is the latest in a flurry of takeovers in the mortgage 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates have pummeled the once-burgeoning business of mortgage 
refinancing. Many independent mortgage companies have seen business shrink and 
stock prices fall, making them ripe for takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Large banks have been scooping them up. Chemical Banking Corp. recently bought 
New Jersey-based Margaretten Financial Corp. for $330 million, while PNC Bank 
Corp. agreed to buy the servicing rights to $10 billion in mortgages from 
Associates Corp. of North America, based in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks have also been hit by a shrinking number of refinancings, but they 
control a large share of the new mortgage business and have other businesses 
contributing to profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase plans to eliminate virtually all of American Residential's support 
divisions because the bank's Tampa, Fla.-based mortgage subsidiary will handle 
the servicing and accounting of the firm's mortgage accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said the company will continue to be headquartered in La Jolla and will 
retain its name. American Residential had 2,200 employees. Chase will retain 
1,500 involved primarily in sales and may keep more after reviewing staffing 
needs, Hunter said.

 South Korea Refuses to Lower Tariffs: Seoul will not comply with a U.S. demand 
for further tariff reductions on foreign cars, but it will try to stimulate 
sales by other means, the government said. South Korea offered last month to 
reduce tariffs on American cars from the current 10% to 8% next year, but the 
United States wants them to fall to 2.5%.Of the 2 million cars South Koreans 
bought last year, only 1,850 were foreign vehicles, including 1,463 from the 
United States. South Korea exported 639,000 vehicles in 1993, and 134,764 went 
to the United States. Seoul said it will eliminate car ownership in tax 
documents and launch a media campaign and joint activities with U.S. auto 
makers, such as car shows and seminars.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; AFRICA, THE LAST FRONTIER, DRAWS HERD OF BULLISH 
INVESTORS; MARKETS: WALL STREET FIRMS ARE SETTING UP FUNDS. INTEREST IS DRIVEN 
BY STRONG PERFORMANCE OF NATIONS' STOCK EXCHANGES.

 Judith Aidoo remembers the time not long ago when talk about the virtues of 
investing in Africa was like trying to peddle a bitter pill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception was that Africa was a country plagued by many problems -- 
certainly not a place to commit millions in investing dollars," said Aidoo, a 
31-year-old former Goldman, Sachs & Co. securities lawyer and founder of the 
Aidoo Group, a Wall Street-based investment banking boutique. Now Aidoo's firm 
is besieged by inquiries about investment opportunities in Africa from as far 
away as Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors are looking beyond headlines about turmoil in places such as 
Rwanda and Somalia. In fact, some specialists in emerging markets -- poorer 
nations that are just beginning to modernize -- are confident that Africa is 
the next and last frontier for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Markets everywhere have been conquered," said Justin Beckett, president of 
the Durham, N.C.-based management investment firm New African Advisers, a unit 
of Sloan Financial Group. He said the investor interest is not social but 
economic. "There is nowhere to go but Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Even giant Wall Street firms are bullish on Africa. Morgan Stanley & Co.'s 
50-page report on investing there says the continent "is poised for growth. Of 
its 50 countries, 28 have economic reform programs in place. Thirteen stock 
markets are up and running, with four more planned within the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Stanley is putting money where its mouth is. The firm's $200-million 
African Investment Fund went public on the New York Stock Exchange in February. 
Unlike regular mutual funds, these "closed-end" funds have a fixed number of 
shares that are traded on major stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This investment is a reflection of our confidence in the long-term growth of 
Africa," said Marianne Hay, who manages the fund for Morgan Stanley. "We see a 
parallel situation with the Latin American emergence in the late '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Africa-oriented closed-end funds have been established by Alliance 
Capital, Robert Fleming Inc. and Emerging Markets Management. According to the 
International Finance Corp., a member of the World Bank Group, it has received 
inquiries from 15 fund managers considering African funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind their interest is the dramatic performance of African stock markets. 
According to a second-quarter report on emerging markets compiled by 
Washington-based Kleiman International Consultants Inc., a group that monitors 
global emerging markets, most African stock markets went up by double-digit 
figures in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The growing number of funds targeting the region is a reflection of the 
strong performances of the stock exchanges," said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing 
partner at Kleiman. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other emerging markets, Aidoo said, the attraction of Africa is the 
prospect of high returns for being an early participant in the market and 
diversifying a portfolio. Aidoo, who urges selectiveness, is bullish on 
Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thomas Herzfeld of Miami-based Thomas Herzfeld Advisers, an investment 
management firm that specializes in closed-end funds, said investors should be 
aware of the risks with country funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to normal risks, country funds come with political, currency and 
illiquidity problems," he warned. "Country funds are OK for speculators. For 
those investing with their life savings, I suggest they look elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that most country funds are the closed-end type. Since the 
funds trade on the stock market, that means investors must pay commissions on 
top of the managers' annual fees. Also, the shares often trade at a price above 
the actual value of the stocks in the portfolio, which is like paying $11 for a 
$10 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the premium has no value. A major problem in investing in 
Africa is the difficulty of finding shares to buy, according to IFC, which 
teamed with Emerging Markets Management to create the Africa Emerging Markets 
Fund. "In many markets, investors hold on to their shares and do not trade 
them," said Teresa Barger, manager of IFC's Capital Markets Division. "This is 
changing, however, as stock prices begin to go up, and there is evidence that 
foreign investment in an emerging market stimulates local interest in trading."

 China Details Copyright Crackdown: The government trumpeted the success of a 
recent clampdown on such violations, following pressure from the United States 
to improve protection of foreign intellectual property rights.In the first half 
of 1994, authorities seized about 5.94 million books and magazines that 
violated copyright laws or spread violence and pornography, the New China News 
Agency said. It did not specify how many were copyright violations. About 
200,000 pirated compact discs and 750,000 video- and audiotapes were also 
confiscated, it said. About 7,000 people were arrested and 56 factories and 
shops were closed.

 Argentine Inflation Jumps: The rate reached a 14-month high in July as higher 
hotel prices helped boost consumer prices 0.9%, the government said.The 
increase was more than double June's and the highest since the 1.3% in May, 
1993. Planning Secretary Juan Llach said 70% of last month's increase was 
caused by increases in hotel costs and other prices charged tourists during the 
winter vacation period. The rate should fall in coming months, he said. 
Inflation in Argentina, which reached a world record of 5,000% in 1989, is now 
well below that of other Latin American countries.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: MONTEBELLO; LAWSUIT ACCUSES POLICE OF RACIAL BIAS IN ARREST

<P>
 A Chinese couple who allege they were arrested after defending themselves in a 
confrontation with three teen-age girls have filed a lawsuit accusing 
Montebello police officers of racial discrimination and mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jinshu Zhang, his wife Yuan Fu and their 4-year-old son were accosted 
by three teen-agers at a Burger King at the Montebello Town Center mall, 
according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.But instead 
of arresting the girls, police jailed Zhang and Fu, both 35, on battery 
charges, the suit said. The Monterey Park couple spent about an hour in jail, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks damages of at least $1 million and names the city, Police Chief 
G. Steve Simonian, and Officers Daniel Barron and Stacy Heckers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang, a securities attorney, contends the arresting police officer, a Latino, 
never interviewed him, and believed the teen-agers' version of events because 
they also were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and a deputy district attorney said Zhang and Fu were arrested 
because other witnesses supported the teen-agers' claims that the couple 
initiated the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy District Atty. Alexis de la Garza said the couple agreed to complete a 
course in cultural sensitivity in exchange for having the battery charges 
dropped. Paul L. Hoffman, an attorney representing Zhang and Fu, said their 
agreement to take the course was not an admission of guilt. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CITY HALL JOURNAL: NORWALK PLANNING COMMISSIONER HONENDAL RESIGNS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city planning commissioner who had vigorously opposed plans for a Hindu 
temple in his neighborhood resigned three days after the controversial project 
was approved by the City Council, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Honendal, who had served on the commission for six months, offered no 
explanation for the action in his July 22 letter of resignation, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Honendal had been a vocal critic of the proposed temple at Pioneer Boulevard 
and Fernia Street before becoming a planning commissioner earlier this year. 
When the issue was presented to the planning commission in June, Honendal made 
the unusual move of stepping down from the dais and joining more than a dozen 
residents to speak against the plan. Residents in the neighborhood said they 
feared traffic and parking problems if the temple was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved the project. Honendal abstained from voting.

 Hotel Will Be Converted to Senior Citizen Home 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton Ramada Hotel, once touted as a centerpiece of the city's economic 
renewal, has been sold to a developer who intends to convert the private rooms 
into a senior citizens' residence. 
</P>
<P>
 A divided City Council agreed to sell the nine-story hotel. According to the 
agreement, the first four floors of the Ramada will remain as they are: a few 
hotel rooms, ballrooms, restaurants and a gift shop. The remaining rooms will 
house ambulatory senior citizens. The project is scheduled to be completed in 
about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers agreed to pay $24.4 million for the hotel, at least $10 million 
below its appraised value. The sale leaves Compton without a major hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was sold to Cal-State Progressive Development Inc., an Altadena 
company that filed incorporation papers in June. The company agreed to make a 
down payment of $3 million and pay the remainder over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members approved the sale. Mayor Omar Bradley and Councilman 
Ronald J. Green, who balked at the plan to give the developer 10 years to pay 
off the balance of the purchase price, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work. These people are going to be up and gone long before that 
note is paid," Bradley complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Compton's hotel has followed a twisting plot that included 
financial indiscretions, city takeovers and low occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The city originally paid $15 million to developer Naftali Deutsch to build the 
city-owned convention center and parking facility that are part of the hotel 
complex. Compton also loaned Deutsch and his Lazben Financial Corp. more than 
$5 million to complete the hotel, which overlooks the Redondo Beach (91) 
Freeway. Deutsch never made a payment on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The city took over management of the hotel within two years of its opening in 
the fall of 1989 and began foreclosure proceedings. The hotel has suffered low 
occupancy rates and managerial problems, causing council members to view their 
former prize as a white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has been appraised at $35 million to $40 million, but because of a 
depressed real estate market, council members -- including Bradley and Green -- 
said they were pleased with the sale price. EMILY ADAMS

CITY COUNCIL LOCKED IN A CONTROVERSY OVER KEYS; PICO RIVERA: NEW COUNCILWOMAN 
SAYS LOCKS TO CITY HALL WERE CHANGED BECAUSE COLLEAGUES SUSPECT HER OF 
SNOOPING. SHE HAS MOVED OUT IN PROTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen O'Hara didn't expect a key to the city after her shocking election to 
the Pico Rivera City Council four months ago. After all, she admits, she was a 
political outsider with no friends in city government. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, she contends, she doesn't even have a key to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A fuming O'Hara accused her colleagues of changing the locks because they 
suspected her of snooping around desks on evenings and weekends, a charge she 
heatedly denies. O'Hara and her council colleagues have been given new keys 
that allow them to use their council offices, but make other city offices 
off-limits after-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara now has moved out of the building in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no reason to change the locks," she said. "Supposedly, we're the 
bosses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Beatrice Proo said she ordered the change in locks after cleaning crews 
reported O'Hara lingering around city employees' desks after-hours.  
</P>
<P>
 "Janitors were concerned that she was going through desks at night," Proo 
said. "I thought the best thing to do was to restrict access to the whole City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
 When Proo asked the council members to turn in their old keys for new ones 
giving them access only to their council offices, O'Hara refused. O'Hara said 
she now works on city business out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The key flap is just the latest sign that things haven't changed much for 
O'Hara, a longtime council critic who lobbied tirelessly -- and generally 
futilely -- for a variety of causes before she was elected four months ago. She 
stunned politicians and even some of her own supporters by topping a field of 
11 candidates vying for three council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara never had a honeymoon with fellow council members. Shortly after her 
election, she antagonized the council by supporting an unsuccessful legal 
challenge to Councilman Gil De La Rosa's election. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, O'Hara's pet proposals to expand homeless services and create more 
committees were soundly rejected by council members, who said her ideas were 
unworkable. The council also turned down her proposal to televise council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at the last meeting, she voted against the other council members on 
nearly every item, giving little explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fed up," De La Rosa said. "She doesn't want to work with any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said he often finds O'Hara suspicious of city 
staff and uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been nothing but professional and polite," he said. "I've been in the 
business for 30 years, and I've never encountered this situation before. It's 
been bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Even O'Hara's supporters admit her political style can be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to call her a 'bull in a china shop,' " said Adriane Jepson, a 
longtime friend. "She can do a lot of damage if she doesn't think. She has a 
lot of heart, but she's not polished." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara was considered a long shot in the April council election. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old businesswoman and mother of two had never run for political 
office. She decided to run after she, her husband and two sons were evicted 
last year from a mobile home park in Pico Rivera and forced to spend three 
months living in a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Garcia, manager of the Westland Estates mobile home park, said O'Hara was 
evicted because she failed to pay $5,000 in back rent and frequently feuded 
with neighbors. Garcia said one neighbor accused O'Hara of throwing a can of 
dog food through her front window during a dispute -- a charge that O'Hara 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara ran a low-budget campaign that emphasized her long history of 
challenging the city. Two years ago, for example, she participated in 
unsuccessful recall efforts against Councilmen John G. Chavez and Garth Gardner 
after they voted for an unpopular utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ballots were counted in April, O'Hara led with 1,949 votes, 324 more 
than second-place finisher Chavez. De La Rosa, a former council member who had 
lost four years earlier, captured the third seat. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara said she won't change her style. After the dispute over office keys, 
she fired off letters to local newspapers accusing fellow council members of 
"mindless leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been called a 'gadfly' and 'rabble-rouser,' " she said. "I still wear 
those names like badges of honor."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; ABC TRUSTEES TO SETTLE WITH EMBATTLED SUPT.

<P>
 The ABC School District board approved a $275,000 settlement Tuesday night to 
resolve a prolonged contract dispute with embattled Supt. Larry L. Lucas, who 
has been on paid leave for five months. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began early in March, when four members of the seven-member board 
abruptly voted to place the superintendent on leave. The board majority said 
that Lucas, who had headed the district since 1988, had become autocratic. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Cecy Groom, who supported Lucas' departure, said the 
settlement is fair and is considerably less than Lucas had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement, the district will set up a fund for Lucas 
and deposit $233,893 over two years. Lucas will also receive about $20,500 in 
vacation pay and $21,000 in health benefits, Groom said. Lucas also has 
received about $50,000 while on leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Three board members who opposed the March decision to remove Lucas also voted 
against the settlement. They were Robert Hughlett, Dixie Primosch and Jim 
Weisenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement still must be approved by the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas was unavailable for comment. His attorney, David C. Larsen, said Lucas 
was pleased with the agreement. Larsen initially had argued that the school 
board violated Lucas' rights by ousting him with three years left in his 
four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the school board hired a consultant to help search for a new 
superintendent. The search is expected to take about four months. PSYCHE

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST AREA; CHALLENGER BOWS OUT OF ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only challenger facing Democratic Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. has 
withdrawn from the November race for the 52nd Assembly District, clearing the 
way for the incumbent to serve a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Richard A. Rorex, 57, of Gardena said he withdrew last 
week after being hired as a maintenance mechanic with the U.S. Postal Service 
processing center in Bell. Postal Service attorneys advised Rorex that postal 
workers cannot hold partisan political office. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray was considered a strong favorite, anyway, in the heavily Democratic 
district that includes Gardena, as well as the Southeast communities of 
Compton, Paramount and Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rorex's name will still appear on the November ballot, county elections 
officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; BIRDLAND JAZZ CLUB CLOSES ON A BLUE NOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach nightclub owner Al Williams has hosted his last jazz show at 
Birdland West. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams closed his jazz club Sunday night after years of struggling against 
declining ticket sales and a bad economy.Several jazz ensembles were featured 
at the closing bash.  
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old drummer said he decided to close the club after months of 
trying to find a buyer. In February, Williams initiated Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings in an attempt to reorganize his debts. In June, he announced the 
club was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said this week he was still considering offers from two prospective 
buyers who are interested in reopening the nightclub. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdland opened in 1986, soon after Williams closed another club he owned, the 
Jazz Safari, which was located near the Queen Mary. During its eight-year 
history, Birdland hosted such jazz greats as Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers 
and Les McCann. Williams said he was tired of managing the club and wanted to 
return to playing with his own band, the Jazz Society. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; BRIDGE LIGHTING PROJECT GETS $50,000 FROM L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fight to string lights on the Vincent Thomas Bridge, a 6,060-foot link 
between Long Beach and San Pedro, got a $50,000 boost recently from the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Harbor-area residents has fought since 1988 to illuminate Southern 
California's longest suspension bridge, which spans the main channel of the 
Port of Los Angeles.They argue that the bridge, which fades from view at night, 
could be a perfect welcoming monument for visitors arriving by air or sea.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the Golden Gate (Bridge) is the welcoming sign to San Francisco, 
the Vincent Thomas Bridge will be the welcoming sign to L.A.," said Louis 
Dominguez, the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee can at last move ahead with a design to light the bridge's span, 
cables and roadways, Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the port communities have donated $20,000 toward the expense, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is expected to be $300,000, so the committee continues to lobby city 
officials for $144,000 set aside for a harbor monument. The money was donated 
to the city by a Japanese firm, Shuwa Corp., several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kruesopon, a spokesman for Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., said he believes 
the city will contribute more funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters Union officials have set up picket lines at a newly unionized 
cemetery to try to break a contract impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of protesters have been picketing daily at various entrances to the 
2,600-acre Rose Hills Memorial Park at 3900 S. Workman Mill Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the cemetery's 62 gravediggers and maintenance workers voted to 
be represented by the union last December. Union officials and Rose Hills 
managers have since been negotiating their first contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and Rose Hills managers have reached agreement on several issues, 
including grievance procedures, seniority, job retraining and health benefits 
but have deadlocked over pay and one other issue. The union is seeking 
across-the-board pay increases, while cemetery managers want to award raises 
based on merit. The union also has demanded that all eligible employees be 
required to join the union, a demand that Rose Hills management calls unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to picket, that's fine," said Sandy V. Durko, executive vice 
president of Rose Hills. "But we're not going to change our positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the union and the cemetery are scheduled to meet with federal 
mediators Friday. JOHN D. WAGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten high school students have been hired for gardening and maintenance jobs as 
part of a city workfare program created for underprivileged teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Students enrolled in the pilot program are spending their summer recess 
tilling city land for $5.18 an hour.They work 28 to 30 hours a week pulling 
weeds, landscaping and removing debris from public parks and city property, 
said Richard Leahy, deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of four girls and six boys also paints, makes minor repairs and helps 
seniors who are unable to attend to basic home upkeep, Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only students from low- or moderate-income families with grade-point averages 
greater than 2.0 were considered for the project, Leahy said. City officials 
interviewed 20 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which ends Sept. 2, has a budget of $45,000. The City Council 
will evaluate its success in October or November and determine whether it 
should be continued year-round, Leahy said. JOHN CANALIS

COVER STORY; A SENSE OF HOPE; LONG BEACH HAS ENLISTED SCHOOLS, THE POLICE, THE 
BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS, AND THE YMCA IN AN EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO AT-RISK KIDS IN 
SOME OF THE CITY'S TOUGHEST AREAS AND GIVE THEM . . .

<P>
 Javier Collado, 15, a good kid with hard-working parents, lives in one of Long 
Beach's poorest, most violent neighborhoods. Bodies are found in dumpsters, 
crack houses are as common as liquor stores and youthful rebellion can lead to 
a prison term or a pine box. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Javier seemed destined to become another crime statistic. He 
began staying out until midnight, failing at school and ignoring his parents' 
pleas to stay off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed, though, when he joined a basketball team at the downtown 
YMCA and found a friend in Bob Cabeza, the YMCA director. Cabeza helped Javier 
reconcile with his parents and encouraged him to improve his grades and 
behavior. Today, Javier is a tutor for the younger neighborhood kids and hopes 
to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier and other teens who are in danger of going astray have spurred the city 
of Long Beach to join forces with agencies such as the YMCA to provide youth 
programs in some of the city's worst neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are turning vacant lots into playgrounds and roaming 
neighborhoods in vans filled with sports equipment so kids can play in places 
without parks or fields. 
</P>
<P>
 They're organizing teen-agers to pick up trash and erase graffiti. They're 
offering art classes, midnight basketball games and workshops to help kids find 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have enlisted the schools, the police, the Boys and Girls clubs and 
foundations -- tapping into existing programs, like the one at the YMCA, and 
creating new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 This comprehensive effort will serve as a model for other cities, said Ce Etta 
Crayton, associate professor in the department of leisure studies at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Youthful crime will affect everyone as these kids become adults," she said. 
"What Long Beach is doing is realizing that kids need attention, so they're 
providing more programs for youth at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, mostly on the city's western section, 
bars cover the windows and doors on rows and rows of apartment buildings, 
graffiti mars walls and bus benches, and more than a quarter of the families 
live below the federal poverty level. On any given day, private and public 
child welfare workers battle the forces of poverty in these crowded, poor and 
violent neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays and Tuesdays in MacArthur Park, at Anaheim Street and Walnut 
Avenue, the park's drill team practices maneuvers for its next competition 
under the guidance of a part-time counselor. At the downtown YMCA and at three 
schools within walking distance, youths spend a couple of hours a day with 
neighborhood children, tutoring, talking and playing games. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a bail bondsman's shop at 3rd Street and Magnolia Avenue, a city worker 
arrives in a van with portable play equipment and transforms a raggedy plot of 
land into basketball courts filled with chattering children. At Martin Luther 
King Jr. Park, city recreation leader Connie Odon can be found daily counseling 
girls about everything from sex to child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began mobilizing its efforts four years ago, at a time when the crime 
rate was soaring and the recession began depleting city coffers. The recreation 
department alone faces a 9.1% reduction this year in funds that pay for park 
programs and youth services. But the city has vowed to preserve services for 
the children who need it most, even if the cuts will mean fewer staff members, 
weedy parks with brown grass and delays in repairing aging buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put youth first. If any investment is going to be made, it's going to made 
in young people," said Kelton Reese, superintendent for the community parks 
program. "We have a problem with youth. They are the future and we have to deal 
with the problem in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Tyrone Malone, 15, arrives at the downtown YMCA in the morning and 
collects his charges, 10 elementary school students who live nearby in a 
neighborhood where nearly half of the residents are supported by welfare. From 
hundreds of applicants, the YMCA selected Tyrone to be one of 40 high school 
and college leaders in the Youth Club Collaborative Program for At-Risk Kids, 
what YMCA director Cabeza calls "an inner-city Peace Corps." Tyrone acts as 
counselor, mentor, tutor and role model for the black, Latino and Asian 
children assigned to him during summer day camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone relates to the children, Cabeza said, because he is growing up in 
similar circumstances. Before settling in Long Beach, Tyrone moved seven or 
eight times. He walks 30 minutes from his house to the Y because he cannot 
afford bus fare. Three of his six brothers and sisters live with him and his 
mother, who is unemployed. He rarely sees his father, who lives in Riverside 
County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone said his younger brother, now 13, hit a pregnant teacher and has been 
in juvenile hall and a group home for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighborhood is never good. There's gangsters, shootings, lots of dope 
selling. When I go to wash clothes, I see them -- smoking weed, shooting dice, 
being up all day and night, making noise. If you say something, you never know 
what will happen. You know they got a gun, but you don't know what they'll do," 
Tyrone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he started going to the Y a year ago, he almost always stayed inside to 
avoid the danger of the streets. "But I was bored," he said. "I needed to keep 
busy. I wanted to do some good." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to taking college preparatory classes at Long Beach Poly High 
during the school year, Malone works and tries to be a father figure to his 
siblings. "It's hard," he said, sighing. "Sometimes it's really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyrone is such a bright, wonderful kid with a great sense of humor," said the 
YMCA's Cabeza. "He talks about going to college so he can get out of the 
ghetto. If you give kids like him a chance, if you give them responsibility and 
a challenge, you're going to make successful citizens out of all of them." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Foundation gave the YMCA's Youth Club program a $230,000 grant, and 
the city contributes funds as part of its Neighborhood Improvement Strategy, a 
four-year-old project that targets the worst neighborhoods in Long Beach and 
provides youth services, more police protection, low-cost loans to property 
owners and a crackdown on building-code violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on such factors as crime, the number of welfare recipients and the 
percentage of absentee landlords, the city selected six of the worst areas and 
created neighborhood associations. Officials solicited advice from residents, 
and many attributed the areas' problems to the lack of organized activities for 
kids, said the parks department's Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhoods voiced the same concern with the same solution: We need to 
do something for our young people," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that effort, innovative programs evolved. Counselors visit the streets 
to talk to gang members and wanna-bes, helping them find alternatives to crime 
and violence. An artist has launched a mural project to redirect graffiti 
vandals toward creating large-scale public artworks. Recreation leaders try to 
keep most inner-city parks open on weekends and in the summer so kids have a 
place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Police Department started the Police Athletic League "to help 
give at-risk kids something to do beside hang out on street corners," said 
police information Officer Karen Kerr. The league maintains a warehouse-sized 
sports center in an industrial part of 9th Street and staffs it with seven 
police officers who run the sports programs and arrange field trips. In the 
summer, the kids go sailing in a donated boat. In two years, participation in 
the program has grown from 75 to 1,000 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the center, the Long Beach Unified School District holds 
classes for "last-chance kids," Kerr said. The Long Beach schools play an 
important role in the web of activities designed to keep kids out of trouble, 
said Dennis J. Thys, Neighborhood Services Bureau Manager for the Department of 
Community Development and coordinator of the Neighborhood Improvement Strategy 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's youth programs are anchored at Washington and Franklin 
middle schools, located in what the city four years ago named the two worst 
neighborhoods in town. Washington Middle School, for example, has become a 
neighborhood center where residents go for family and youth counseling. A 
probation officer helps students on probation stay in school. A part-time 
worker from the district attorney's office helps students who are chronically 
truant. And the Long Beach Police Department has an office on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Washington Middle School neighborhood is no longer the worst in 
Long Beach. It now ranks number seven, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's success in the Washington School neighborhood mirrors a 1992 
Carnegie Corp. study that found that American children often fall victim to 
gangs, drugs and premature sexual activity largely because they have so little 
to do after school and in the summer. The study challenged businesses and 
federal, state and local governments to provide greater resources for sports, 
recreation and after-school programs, especially for low-income teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation leader Odon, 34, grew up in Long Beach, the daughter of a single 
mother who raised six children with very little money. When she was a kid, the 
parks were a second home to her and her friends, Odon said. The counselors were 
extended family, serving as aunts and uncles who supervised theatrical pageants 
and sporting events and provided help with typical teen-age problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were having female problems, there was a lady to talk to. Back then, 
we'd go early in the morning and stay late at night. There were a lot more 
adults around to keep kids out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Proposition 13 drastically reduced the property taxes that 
paid for those programs and made future tax increases much tougher to get. In 
Long Beach, youth and recreation programs were among the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, youthful crime has continued to increase: Gang warfare accounted 
for about half of the record 137 murders last year, compared to 1987, when only 
four homicides were gang-related, according to police. In the last three years, 
juveniles arrested for grand theft auto have nearly doubled, from 233 to 437. 
And from 1992 to 1993, the number of juveniles arrested for robbery increased 
70%, from 142 to 241. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Odon counsels as many teen-agers as possible, success, especially among 
the girls, has been limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I preach to them, take them home, feed them, nurture them. They get out of 
high school, start in college and then they show up here pregnant. We have rap 
sessions, and I find out almost all of them are having sex, some as early as 
12." 
</P>
<P>
 She says the girls need structure. "They're living in tough neighborhoods 
where you're odd if you join the volleyball team, but it's cool to sit around 
and do nothing. You don't have to be that way because you're poor. My mother 
didn't have a lot of time to spend with us. She was working too hard to support 
six kids, working so we wouldn't have to struggle like she did. We made it. 
We're not all doctors and lawyers, but we made it. And we grew up in the same 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference? Odon blames an overburdened, underfunded and ineffectual 
school system, the media for perpetuating racial stereotypes that focus on easy 
money, and rap music that encourages kids to disrespect each other. She also 
attributes the difference to absent parents, increasing violence, gangs and 
peer pressure at a time when kids have less and less to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although hundreds of children and teen-agers use the parks, every year the 
money gets tighter and tighter. Today, Odon is the only full-time staff member 
at King Park, which she keeps open till 6 p.m. on weekdays during the summer. 
"After that, they go on the street," she said. "What we've done is let them 
loose on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation center at King Park is closed on weekends, she said, due to 
budget constraints. "When you cut people, you cut services. Like instead of 
having six soccer teams, I have two. The person who coaches soccer also has to 
watch the park. We didn't have spring day camp this year because we didn't have 
the money. You cannot tell us to come in at 90% of the budget and keep all 
services. Because that's 90% of what we had last year. And that was only 90% of 
what we had the year before. Every year, we're constantly being cut." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is doing the best it can with dwindling funds, said parks program 
superintendent Reese. An estimated 35,000 disadvantaged kids live on the 
western section of Long Beach, and 8,000 participate in youth sports citywide, 
he said. But 20 of the city's parks also provide free drop-in programs after 
school where staff members supervise kids playing games, working on arts and 
crafts projects, and doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six elementary schools have an hour of supervised free play after 
school. And in the summer, the city and schools co-sponsor a free playground 
program at 21 schools from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (which ends Aug. 12), said 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the (economy) improves in the next two years so we won't have to 
sustain the cuts. We're looking toward attempting to expand," Reese said.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A LOVE AFFAIR WITH THAI COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Hansa Gunnasoot was at beauty school in Japan, she used to daydream about 
her mother's cooking back home in Thailand. She went on to open her own 
business in Bangkok, but her heart was still in the kitchen. After saving up 
and moving to California, she realized her dream in 1978 by opening the Dear 
Heart Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the first Thai restaurants in Long Beach, the Dear Heart has built 
up a faithful clientele, many of whom manager Raungsak Sirichoke (Ron, for 
short) greets on a first-name basis. Diners eat in a pleasant, homey room 
decorated with Oriental dolls, framed posters of Thailand and silk flower 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizers include tod mun pla ($6.45), a deep-fried cake of pureed fish, 
curry paste and green beans served with a cucumber sauce; sate ($5.75), six 
bamboo-stick skewers of beef, pork or chicken, barbecued and served with a 
peanut dipping sauce; and angel wings ($5.45), fried boneless chicken wings 
stuffed with so much ground pork and mushrooms that they look as if they've 
been working out with the Bulgarian weightlifting team. 
</P>
<P>
 As at most Thai restaurants, soups are an integral part of the menu. There's 
the popular tom kha kai ($3/$5.95), a chicken soup flavored with coconut milk, 
mushrooms, chiles, lemon grass, lime juice, onions and galangal , a relative of 
ginger. Tom yum ta-le ($7.45) is a spicy hot-and-sour soup of shrimp, scallops 
and squid, fragrant with lemon grass and basil.

WILSON SPRINTER IS LIVING IN FAST LANE; PREPS: LAKEISHA BACKUS, A RELATIVE 
NEWCOMER TO TRACK, HAS ALREADY REACHED ELITE STATUS IN THE SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At 5 feet 2 inches, LaKeisha Backus, a self-proclaimed tomboy, learned early 
that it was speed, not size, that separated her from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played every sport when I was younger," said Backus, a 17-year-old who will 
be a senior at Long Beach Wilson High in the fall. "I wish I was a little 
taller, but I don't consider it much of a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly wasn't a disadvantage for Backus the past track season. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, she won the State 200-meter title and also joined Michelle Nelson, 
Mary Harris and Kinshasa Davis on Wilson's victorious 400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Backus timed 22.88 seconds to place second in the 200 at the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation World Junior Championships at Lisbon, 
Portugal. Heidi Seyerling of South Africa nipped Backus at the wire to win the 
event in 22.80 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprinters were aided by a 2.2-meter per second tail wind, nullifying 
Backus' time for record purposes. Nonetheless, her time ranks as fourth-fastest 
by a U.S. high school athlete under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Marion Jones of Thousand Oaks High, the national record-holder at 22.58, 
Chandra Cheesborough (22.64), a 1984 Olympic silver medalist at 400 meters, and 
Wendy Vereen (22.75), a member of the 1993 U.S. World Championship team, have 
run faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt normal and I didn't think I ran that fast," said Backus, who ran a 
legal-best of 23.21 at June's State meet. "I wasn't really worried about my 
time or intimidated by the competition, I was just glad for the experience to 
travel outside the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, the experience was an unforeseen opportunity for Backus, who 
has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA, USC, Louisiana State, Arkansas, 
Tennessee, Nebraska, Indiana and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Backus had planned to conclude her season after the state meet. Instead, she 
accepted an offer to compete the next week in the Golden West Invitational in 
Sacramento, where she won the 100 and 200. Then came an invitation to compete 
in the USATF Junior National Championships at Tallahassee, Fla., the qualifying 
meet for the World Junior Championships, in the last week of June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked real hard to win State and after that I was going to stop," Backus 
said. "It has been my longest season and I didn't feel that good. I didn't 
really feel I had a 22.88 or a big (personal record) in me. I'm just glad I can 
take a training break now." 
</P>
<P>
 Backus' performance in Portugal also helped erase a disappointing season in 
the 100, her preferred event. 
</P>
<P>
 She was disqualified for a false start in the Southern Section Division I 
finals in May. In July, Backus finished seventh in the Junior National meet 
after she slipped at the start on a rain-slicked track. 
</P>
<P>
 Backus, however, rebounded to place second in the 200 at the Junior National 
meet and earn a spot on the U.S. squad. The top three finishers qualified for 
the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to qualify in the 100," said Backus, who has a best of 11.65 for 100 
meters. "I like it because it is shorter and I'm the kind of runner that likes 
to get out hard. But I guess for now, the 200 might be the best race for me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth grade, Backus was racing down the football field as a tailback 
for a local flag football team. It was there, she first discovered her talent 
as a sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first season of track, she placed third in the 100 meters in the age 
14-15 division in The Athletics Congress national championships competing for 
the California Flyers track club. Backus also won the 100 and 200 in the 
Amateur Athletic Union regional and district finals. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore in 1993, Backus was fourth in the State meet in the 100 and 200 
and lowered her time in the 200 from 25.05 -- her best time as a freshman -- to 
23.96.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT: HUGE TREE STUMP FOUND ON 
M STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NEW NEWS: Here it is, folks, hot off the presses, the first edition of 
Wilmington's own community paper, "Harbor Journal." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 copies of the 12-page August issue, published by longtime 
resident John Roberts, have hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't (print) anything controversial unless it's in our community," Roberts 
said. "There's enough O.J. Simpson and Menendez brothers. . . . I'll pick up 
all the little stories that fall between the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's the lead story of the first edition? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the headline "Dump Skunks Beware!" writer Richard Tracey doses out some 
heavy criticism to the people who dumped a tree stump in front of the 
Wilmington Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "An enormous tree stump was dumped on M Street by some idiot without any 
concern for this community's welfare," the article states.

 The next edition will be out Sept. 10.

 SOAP UP, PAY UP: The Avalon City Council has a remedy to what seems to be an 
infuriating problem for tourists: corroded coin boxes in the public showers by 
the sea on Casino Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get soaped up and the coin box jams up, and then there's no water to 
rinse the soap off," City Clerk Shirley Davy said. "They can get pretty mad, 
and they start beating on the coin boxes to try to make them work." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend more than $14,000 for 12 new stainless-steel coin boxes, 
specially designed to withstand the corrosive elements of water, and any other 
kind of abuse, said Finance Director David Batt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists pay 50 cents for a two-minute shower. The city collected $24,401 from 
the coin boxes last year.

 WATCH THE WALLS: After running an item that the San Pedro Municipal Building 
might crumble in a major earthquake, Around the South Bay contacted Los Angeles 
City Hall officials to determine the risk to people still working in the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, constructed in the 1920s, probably wouldn't fall down in an 
earthquake, but some interior walls could crumble, said city architect Bill 
Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was an earthquake like the Northridge earthquake, I'd say there would 
be some injuries," Holland said. "But anything (below that), no." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend $5 million on seismic and safety improvements, and the 
work is expected to take a year, he said. Work should start in January, but a 
decision on whether to relocate workers or move them to other parts of the 
building has not been made, he said.

 CHANGING COLORS: Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. is getting out 
of the paint business. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich said marine paint distributor Don Crouthamel, who owns C-Worthy 
Specialties in San Pedro, is buying Svorinich's Industrial Paint Co. store on 
Avalon Boulevard in Wilmington for an undisclosed sum.  
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich has spent much of his life in the paint business, starting out as an 
employee at the paint store as a youth and eight years later buying the store. 
So he says he has mixed feelings about leaving it behind. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Crouthamel had hinted he was interested in the business before the 
City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, with me devoting all my time to City Council, we came up with a mutually 
beneficial arrangement," Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the only change the councilman has made recently. Last week he also 
moved, but only four blocks from his previous residence in San Pedro. QUOTE OF

JOY RIDERS THREATEN EL SEGUNDO PRESERVE; ECOLOGY: VANDALS ON ALL-TERRAIN 
VEHICLES MAY DESTROY THE HABITAT OF THE ENDANGERED BLUE BUTTERFLY THAT LIVES IN 
THE 200 ACRES NEAR L.A. AIRPORT, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY. 
</P>

 If the largest remaining site of coastal dunes in Southern California is hard 
to find, it isn't because it's remote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shadow of Los Angeles International Airport, the El Segundo Dunes Blue 
Butterfly Nature Preserve is home to 11 threatened varieties of flora and 
fauna, including its endangered namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eight years since it was established, the 200-acre preserve has 
also become the target of a troubling breed of vandal: late-night joy riders on 
all-terrain vehicles who have repeatedly savaged the delicate landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident July 21 caused environmentalists to express fear for the 
future of the fragile ecosystem and prompted Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter to criticize the security provided by the Department of Airports, 
which owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say a vandal or vandals used heavy bolt cutters to enter a 
little-used gate, then plowed through several of the highest dunes, seriously 
damaging plants and seedlings considered vital to the rare butterfly's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve, on a narrow coastal strip at the end of the airport's runways, 
is home to most of the estimated 5,000 El Segundo blue butterflies known to 
exist. Much of the area was cleared of houses when LAX was built in the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The butterfly's survival depends almost entirely on the delicate coastal 
buckwheat, which butterflies depend on for nectar and shelter. OFficials said 
the plant was among the most heavily damaged by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tragic," said Irena Mendez, project scientist at the preserve. 
"When you kill one of these plants, you effectively kill the butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in eight months that trespassers on all-terrain 
vehicles, commonly called ATVs, have entered the state-funded preserve, and the 
fifth such incident in five years, said Adriano Mattoni, its chief restoration 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst incident last November, vandals caused an estimated $25,000 
damage to equipment, seedlings and habitat, scattering thousands of seeds that 
Mattoni had hoped to use for the next planting season. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter, who played a key role in designating the dunes as a protected area 
and securing restoration funds, expressed outrage over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only have these idiots severely damaged an environmentally sensitive 
area, but they have destroyed the work of hundreds of concerned people," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman was especially critical of the Department of Airports, saying 
the incident "reflects very poorly" on its efforts to provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has several important pieces of 
navigational equipment at the preserve, including a transmitter that enables 
aircraft to lock in on the airport from as far as 300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said that, besides the environmental damage, the incidents raise 
questions about the Department of Airport's ability to protect the navigational 
equipment, which she said "poses a threat to millions of passengers flying in 
and out of LAX." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Department of Airports said that airport police have 
stepped up patrols of the preserve and intend to assess what additional 
measures may be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Cora Fossett said that the department's general manager, John 
Driscoll, and Galanter intend to meet Monday to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are as distraught as anyone when these things occur," Fossett saiD, adding 
that the department is "eager and willing to formulate any new security 
strategies that may be needed."

POLICE TO USE COPTERS CITED IN SAFETY REPORTS; AVIATION: FEDERAL PANEL IS 
SEEKING AN FAA PROBE OF CHARGES THAT R-22 AIRCRAFT, USED IN GARDENA AND 
HAWTHORNE, MAY BE UNSAFE. BUT FIRM BLAMES PILOTS FOR CRASHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hawthorne and Gardena police officials say they will continue to use the R-22 
police helicopter despite a National Transportation Safety Board report that 
the craft may be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments in both cities began using the helicopter as an airborne 
patrol unit Friday, only a week after Federal Aviation Administration officials 
were asked to investigate possible problems with the helicopter's rotor blades. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We've queried (Robinson Helicopter Co.) and consulted other departments using 
the helicopter and found no reason to alter our plans," Hawthorne Police Chief 
Stephen R. Port said. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board's report, issued July 21, examined 21 incidents involving the 
two-passenger lightweight helicopter since it went on sale in 1981. In those 
incidents, 32 people were killed, according to safety board records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the design of the helicopter may be flawed. In 
several of the incidents, high speeds may have caused the rotor blades to hit 
the body of the helicopter, causing it to crash.  
</P>
<P>
 The R-22, which is a little less than 9 feet high and can fit into a large 
living room, was approved by the FAA in 1979. It has passed every certification 
requirement and review since then, according to the report.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety board officials sent a copy of the report to the FAA recommending that 
the advised top speed of the craft be reduced, further tests be performed on 
the craft's rotor blades and that owners and operators should be warned of 
possible problems. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials were aware of possible problems with the R-22 before the report 
was issued and had independently issued a safety alert about the same time the 
report was released, FAA spokesman Henry Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current recommendations from the safety board are under consideration by 
FAA officials and no date for action has been set, Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Robinson, president of Torrance-based Robinson Helicopter Co., which 
manufactures the R-22, said the craft has no design flaws and the accidents 
should be attributed to other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the safety board, Robinson said that in all the accidents in 
question, the pilots were either students or pilots with little experience in 
the aircraft.  
</P>
<P>
 The police air support program, started in 1991 and run by Long Beach-based 
U.S. Helicopters in conjunction with local police departments, uses the small 
helicopters to assist patrol cars in chasing suspects, surveying crime scenes 
and identifying drunk drivers, said Anthony L. Carone, a U.S. Helicopters 
spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the company supplies an experienced pilot, fuel and 
maintenance, while the police departments supply a flight-trained officer who 
rides as an observer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program "is the greatest thing in the world. . . . It catches a lot of bad 
guys," Carone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The R-22, which makes up 70% of U.S. Helicopter's fleet, is preferred by law 
enforcement agencies because it is relatively inexpensive, Carone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now cities can afford air support," he said. Jet helicopters cost about 
$800,000 and are expensive to maintain, Carone said. A fully equipped R-22 
costs $130,000, said Bob Muse, an R-22 pilot.  
</P>
<P>
 Muse, who said he flies an R-22 five times a week and has almost 3,000 hours 
of flight experience in the R-22, said safety and reliability are the main 
reasons the company continues to use the craft. U.S. Helicopters has never had 
one of its helicopters crash, Muse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought there was a problem with the R-22, I wouldn't fly it," he said.

AFTER 5 YEARS, CITY BALKS AT BASEBALL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Pedro company's plan to turn a dusty 15-acre lot into a bustling 
baseball complex with five state-of-the-art fields struck out this week when 
Los Angeles city officials terminated its lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite raising more than $400,000 in five years, San Pedro Baseball Inc. 
failed to construct a single base path on the city-owned site in the 1900 block 
of North Gaffey Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that it's absolutely a crying shame that this money has produced 
basically nothing," said Barry Glickman, a spokesman for Los Angeles City 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro. Svorinich wrote a 
letter to the city General Services Department in April calling for the lease 
to end Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The money, including a $250,000 donation from Unocal Corp., has been spent on 
plans and preliminary work, and the project is $10,000 in debt, said Gary 
Miley, president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro Baseball Inc. signed a $1-a-year lease with the city in 1989 with 
the understanding that baseball fields would be built for area youth. The 
project was dubbed "Field of Dreams," and collection cans were placed in shops 
around town. 
</P>
<P>
 But, over the years, the company raised less than one-third of its 
$1.6-million goal, and completed only an initial grading of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to say the community wasn't really behind this project 100%," 
Miley said. "I think that's disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than minor improvements to the grounds, the only indication of a dream 
on the site today is a large sign on a grassy knoll that faces traffic on 
Gaffey Street. But like the worn letters on an old, beat-up baseball jersey, 
the paint heralding the future "Joan Milke Flores San Pedro Baseball Complex" 
has faded over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miley said his dream to build fields is still alive. The San Pedro 
longshoreman disputes the city's termination of the lease and still hopes a 
portion of the project can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter terminating the lease, city officials said the company violated 
the agreement because it failed to build any fields on the site and provide 
proof of insurance, and because company officials admitted they allowed another 
party to store sand on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miley said the city never imposed a deadline for construction of the 
fields and insisted the firm does have adequate insurance coverage. In 
addition, he said the company received a donation for allowing sand to be 
stored on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Miley said he delivered a letter to City Hall last week detailing his 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 He said San Pedro Baseball Inc. is awaiting a $5-million donation from an 
international trust company in San Diego that has requested anonymity. He told 
city officials last year he was awaiting the funds, but the money never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the lack of progress on the site, Miley said the project became mired 
in red tape and unexpected construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company signed the lease, Miley said he was unaware of the problems 
posed by a nearby flood control channel, railroad tracks and underground 
pipelines. He was surprised to learn the company would have to pay $100,000 to 
build railroad crossing gates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every turn of a corner, we just ran into a ton of obstacles," Miley said. 
"It just seemed like it was always something." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Unocal Corp., which has a plant in nearby Wilmington, originally pledged 
$300,000 toward the project, but oil company officials elected not to donate 
the remaining $50,000 last year because of the lack of improvements to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's failure has disappointed San Pedro sports enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such an obscene need for any recreational space," said Mel Bobich, 
chairman of the San Pedro recreational task force. Baseball players in the area 
have a difficult time finding places to play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman said the city likely will solicit proposals to build fields from 
other groups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to regroup and give (the land) to some organization that will 
deliver," he said.

INFORMATION SOUGHT ON WASTE DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State investigators are hoping to determine who dumped oil refinery wastes in 
pits in Gardena more than four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Toxic Substances Control is asking people to come 
forward if they recall the waste dumping at the so-called Gardena Sumps at the 
southwest corner of Artesia Boulevard and Normandie Avenue.The dumping of 
petroleum and its byproducts occurred there from 1938 to 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators want to talk to truck drivers who might have hauled the 
waste to the site, those who witnessed the dumping and those who worked at 
companies that produced the wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state already has spent $220,000 for a plastic-nylon temporary cap to 
cover the wastes, part of the more than $500,000 it has spent at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, officials hope to remove the wastes so that the site can be 
developed, said Rich Varenchik, a spokesman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with information about the dumping are urged to call the department or 
leave a message at any hour at (310) 590-4959. People also can call (310) 
590-4913 or (916) 255-2127 collect from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. A caller's identity 
can be kept confidential.

CITY HALL NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; CITY COUNCIL OKS STIFFER BUILDING CODE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of unreinforced masonry buildings will be required to strengthen the 
structures under an ordinance passed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 Hermosa Beach buildings will require the improvements, which include 
the installation of parapet bracing and wall anchors before the buildings are 
retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate the cost to upgrade the buildings at $3 million. The 
project is scheduled to be completed by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owner Perry Arnold, who opposed the plan, said the $40,000 it will 
cost to retrofit his Hermosa Avenue building, built in 1928, will not guarantee 
its safety in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my best bet is just to tear it down," he said. JAMES BENNING

CITY HALL NEWS: CARSON; COUNCIL OKS BONUS FOR WORKERS, BUT NO RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although no municipal employees will get a raise this year, the City Council 
has approved a one-time payment of $500 for each city worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members excluded themselves from the payment, which is funded from a 
surplus in last year's budget. The payment is in consideration for a 90-day 
extension of employee contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lorelie S. Olaes voted against the payment because of the city's 
financial problems and cuts in the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than spend the money on a onetime payment, she said she would favor 
spending about $147,000 to retain seven part-time workers scheduled to be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The item passed on a 4-1 vote. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; PLAN OUTLINED TO MEET BILINGUAL GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials have approved a plan to bring the district into compliance 
with state and federal regulations for bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
 A report issued in March by the California State Department of Education found 
that five out of six schools surveyed in the district this spring had 
substantial problems complying with regulations for bilingual programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the areas cited were the availability of bilingual textbooks, the number 
of certified bilingual teachers and a failure to complete reports on student 
testing and progress, said Norman C. Gold, manager for bilingual compliance for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, (district officials) didn't know which students needed what 
services," leaving some students in the wrong class, Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
 If these violations are not corrected, the district could lose about $1 
million of its bilingual education funding, Gold said.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan, created by an 11-member task force, overhauls the district's 
bilingual policy and adds new programs such as crash-course study sessions for 
teachers working on bilingual certification. It also creates a guide for 
employees who assess student ability and need, said task force member Elizabeth 
Flynn, an Orange County bilingual curriculum consultant who is working with the 
district on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has started to solve some of the problems, Gold said. To meet 
state standards, district officials are allowing nearly 200 trained bilingual 
teachers, who have not yet been certified by the state, to supervise bilingual 
classrooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures, only 40 of the district's 600 teachers 
are certified to teach the district's 5,500 bilingual or limited-English 
students, Gold said. Adding those 200 teachers has helped, but the district may 
still be falling short in other areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still kids who go without bilingual texts and materials," Gold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are scheduled to meet with state inspectors this month to 
discuss compliance, Gold said. JON GARCIA

</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Bill Applegate spent $74,490 in a losing bid for mayor.His 
opponent, Dee Hardison, spent $46,663 on the race, which she won by fewer than 
500 votes in the March 8 election. 
</P>

 In the race for three open seats on the City Council, Dan Walker spent the 
most money, $50,074, and came in second. Marcia Cribbs spent $20,229 and

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; PIER'S TOP LEASEHOLDER WILL SELL OFF HOLDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The largest leaseholder of the Redondo Beach pier has put his property up for 
sale for $2.5 million, saying he has been unable to agree with city officials 
about plans for the pier.  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say it is economics, not conflicting visions of the pier's 
future, that prompted the "For Sale" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that I can drive this project," said Steve Shoemaker, general 
partner of Redondo Horseshoe Pier Co., which acquired the pier property for 
$1.2 million in 1991, three years after the pier was devastated by fire. "I 
think somebody else can." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker said he has had long-standing disagreements with city officials over 
what kinds of businesses to put on the 1,000-foot-long pier after a $10-million 
reconstruction project, paid for by the city, is completed later this year. 
Shoemaker wants to put a "family attraction" such as a carousel or an aquarium 
on the pier, while city officials would prefer upscale restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "(City officials) want a sedate village kind of place," Shoemaker said. "But 
what the pier needs is some kind of first-class attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shoemaker said his dreams of putting in a popular attraction have been 
stymied by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying we don't have the right to do anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just interested that there be some qualityin the development," Redondo 
Beach Harbor Director Ray Koke said. Koke added that Shoemaker's plan to sell 
the project "has everything to do with economics." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker acknowledged that if he sells the pier property he could realize a 
substantial profit and not have to invest $1 million to $2 million in 
improvements to the pier. But he said money isn't the reason he wants out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an issue of money," Shoemaker said. "It's an issue of dreams."

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; CHALLENGER BOWS OUT OF ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only challenger facing Democratic Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. has 
withdrawn from the November race for the 52nd Assembly District, clearing the 
way for the incumbent to serve a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Richard A. Rorex, 57, of Gardena said he withdrew last 
week after being hired as a maintenance mechanic with the U.S. Postal Service 
processing center in Bell. Postal Service attorneys advised Rorex that postal 
workers cannot hold partisan political office. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray was considered a strong favorite, anyway, in the heavily Democratic 
district that includes Gardena, as well as the Southeast communities of 
Compton, Paramount and Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rorex's name will still appear on the November ballot, county elections 
officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR AREA; REPORT ON IMPROVING TRUCK TRAFFIC APPROVED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Harbor Commission has approved an environmental report on Port of Los 
Angeles plans to improve the flow of truck traffic through Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The port is considering several ways to provide a truck route between the 
Harbor Freeway and Alameda Street.One option was criticized during a public 
hearing Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Gwen Butterfield, secretary of the Wilmington North Neighborhood Assn., said a 
recommendation to build a 20-foot-high sound wall along C Street would close in 
the Wilmington community like a prison wall. 
</P>
<P>
 And outgoing Commissioner Gertrude Schwab, a longtime Wilmington activist, 
said the community option is to have a natural buffer with commercial 
development, not a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the only commissioner to vote against the environmental report.  
</P>
<P>
 "We might as well put up barbed wire and machine guns on top and tell the 
community to stay out," Schwab said. The wall "will block the view of the port 
and stop airflow from coming into the community and only be an eyesore." SUSAN

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency will hold a public hearing 
today on the future of two commercial developments in San Pedro and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beacon Street Redevelopment Project, adopted by the City Council in 1964, 
is a plan to revitalize 60 acres of San Pedro's commercial core. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wilmington, redevelopment efforts since 1974 have transformed an oil field 
into a 232-acre site known as the Wilmington Industrial Park. The area has 70 
businesses employing more than 1,000 workers, said Marc Littman, an agency 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The projects are ongoing, but under state legislation that became effective 
in January, public hearings must be held on what the game plan is and how much 
money is going to be spent over the next five years," Littman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will begin at 9 a.m. in the second-floor boardroom of the Los 
Angeles Harbor Department, 425 S. Palos Verdes St., San Pedro.

LANGUAGE COMES ALIVE; UNIQUE SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAM USES SONGS, COOKING 
LESSONS AND FIELD TRIPS TO HELP TEACH ENGLISH TO IMMIGRANT STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several immigrant students in a Gardena High School classroom are working on 
an English lesson. Their assignment: assemble a cardboard castle. 
</P>
<P>
 While the students follow English instructions to fashion turrets and piece 
together walls, the conversation strays from how peculiar sounding are words 
such as moat and turret to talk of their own countries -- Mexico, Honduras, 
Guatemala and El Salvador -- and the difficulty of adjusting to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Esmi De Leon's) turn to talk. Speaking in Spanish, he describes how in 
the Guatemalan night sky, the full moon shines so clear and close that 
stargazers can make out the sketch of a huge tree spreading out its branches 
from the moon's center to its edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds funny, but it's true," said De Leon, a 14-year-old who moved 
to Gardena last November. "And with the tree in the middle there, it looks 
almost like a coin shining in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," he says, with an air of disappointment, "it is just white." 
</P>
<P>
 No one makes fun of De Leon's description of the moon. The other students 
agree with the larger point: that everything is different from what they are 
used to -- not just the language or the food or the way people dress. But 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 And the biggest hurdle is learning to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, De Leon and 80 other immigrant students at Gardena High 
School are spending the summer in a type of English summer camp where they sing 
songs, bake cakes and even go to McDonald's -- activities that are anything but 
traditional when it comes to learning foreign languages.  
</P>
<P>
 The students are there to practice speaking English, but the program's scope 
is more than just holding creative vocabulary lessons. The directors and 
teachers hope that through first-hand experience with the language, in 
activities and field trips, students will become more comfortable and confident 
in their new community.

Congress in 1984 and begun in Los Angeles a year later, is meant to help states 
with large immigrant populations supplement classroom education and give new 
arrivals the language and cultural skills that are not typically taught in the 
classroom. To be eligible for the program, students must be born outside the 
United States and not have attended school here for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the vast Los Angeles Unified School District, the Gardena program is 
touted as one of the best, mainly because of teachers Linda Ritchie-Daza and 
Ayako Motoyasu. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many excellent teachers doing wonderful things with this program 
all over," said Lila Silvern, head of the school district's program. "But the 
teachers at Gardena are some of the most experienced and creative ones we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, students work solely on speaking English, learning it 
through field trips to museums, cooking classes, arts and crafts and tours of 
the city police and fire departments. Classes run from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., 
and students participate voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of students -- 95% -- are Latino, a few are Asian 
and from the Pacific Rim. Because most do not yet speak English well enough to 
hold extended conversations, students often speak in their native languages. 
Still, they say, the program does boost their English. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely serves to teach you English, especially when we take trips and 
go to museums, or when we do cooking classes," said Karla Abogabir,14, from 
Honduras. "When you do things with your hand, then you remember the words, like 
frosting or sifter ." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say that cooking meals or singing songs helps the students 
learn everyday English words. But as important are the lessons in American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles offers the classes at 66 middle schools and high schools and 32 
elementary schools. The program is also offered during vacation breaks. A total 
of 14,000 students participate. This summer, about 5,000 students are taking 
the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible to teach the classes, teachers are asked to attend several 
workshops a year and must use vacation days to go to field trip sites before 
they take the students. In return, teachers in the program are given almost 
complete creative freedom in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for teaching English through cooking lessons came from Banning High 
School teacher Frank Silvino, and it is now a popular activity at many schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a project created by Motoyasu and Ritchie-Daza last year -- a scale 
model of Gardena -- has been emulated by teachers at other schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The model, which is in the program office in Bel-Air as an example of 
outstanding work by both students and teachers, includes a freeway, police and 
fire departments, schools and houses. Girls even crocheted tiny curtains for 
the windows, and the basketball courts have tiny nets. Each item in a project 
teaches a nuance of English and American culture, Ritchie-Daza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie-Daza and Motoyasu teach bilingual education during the year and say 
they have an affinity for students who are new to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I don't really like teaching the regular kids," Motoyasu said. 
"These kids are really motivated and they're here because they want to learn. 
And they're grateful for whatever you give them or whatever you teach them -- 
they haven't learned to be American yet," she said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 639,687 students in the Los Angeles school district, two out of 
every three come from homes where a language other than English is spoken. 
About 67,000 have lived in the United States less than three years. Of those, 
only 18% speak fluent English. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the language barrier, students in Gardena's classes routinely say 
they are surprised at how much easier education is here than in their native 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I went to school in Mexico, it was very serious and there was 
absolutely no playing around like there is here," said Sadie Ortiz, a student 
aide in the class. "You had to stand up when giving an answer, and then you had 
to take a test to go on to the next grade. If you didn't pass the test you 
couldn't go to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the favorite lessons in the summer school are the cooking classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only does it give us the chance to go through vocabulary like 'This is a 
spoon, this is a carton of salt,' but it also breaks down some cultural 
barriers in terms of men doing some cooking," Ritchie-Daza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the class -- divided into two groups of 40 students -- baked and 
frosted birthday cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group, baking rectangular, square and heart-shaped yellow cakes, 
navigated its way through English measurements, ingredients and temperatures. 
The second group made the frosting of confectioners' sugar, butter, milk, 
vanilla and salt, following Ritchie-Daza's instructions from the front of the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this butter or margarine?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much is one stick?" she continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of it are you going to use?" 
</P>
<P>
 As Ritchie-Daza speaks, hip-hop music blasts from a radio in one corner while 
throughout the room, boys and girls flirt with each other. Others pop out of 
their seats to admire the freshly baked cakes and poke at their sponginess. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie-Daza finally blows a whistle. Then she holds up a slim bottle of 
flavoring and asks them what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanilla," the class answers in unison. No one uses the Spanish pronunciation 
for ll (which is y ) and even the short i -- a sound that does not exist in 
Spanish -- is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, excellent pronunciation!" Ritchie-Daza says, and teaches the words 
spatula and electric mixer as the students use each item. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregarious and outgoing, Karla moves to a table full of boys to direct their 
efforts. But the boys need no help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cook at home," said Juan Ochoa, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "No! You cook? I don't believe it. Of course you don't cook," Karla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do too. I make beans and tortillas and tacos," said Juan.  
</P>
<P>
 The cooking class leads to good-natured ribbing about the variety of names for 
food in Latino countries. 
</P>
<P>
 While pavo is a generic Spanish word for turkey, guajolote is more common in 
Mexico and chompipe is accepted in El Salvador. Corn is called maiz in some 
countries, but when it's cooked, it's called choclos in others. Avocados are 
paltas in some places and aguacates in others. To some, a chile is a cool green 
bell pepper, not a jalapeno. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lived any place where there were so many different cultures and 
different kinds of people -- and that's just with Latinos," said Sandra Arias, 
a 14-year-old from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it takes work for people from the various Latino cultures to communicate, 
program officials say, it can be equally difficult for people new to teaching 
students with limited English to Get their message across. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Diaz, an assistant program director, goes to museums and other sites to 
show workers how they can teach a lesson entirely in English so the students 
will still understand them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, at Malibu Lagoon, first I gave them a small lesson in Spanish, 
and I spoke at a normal rate," Diaz said. "They could see that even though they 
know the material I'm talking about, they didn't understand what I was saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I did it at a slower rate, still in Spanish, using drawings and hand 
motions and I repeated words again and again. Then they could understand." 
</P>
<P>
 When the students took a field trip to Malibu Lagoon, one docent -- using 
exaggerated hand gestures and dead fish for props -- taught students how the 
fish survive at different levels of the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate how fish use their gills, she flapped her arms and explains 
that plankton filter through and get stuck on the openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how do they eat that plankton? They stick out their tongues," she said, 
sticking out her own, "And lick it off! Yum!" The Gardena students laugh, but 
she has made her point. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading another group of students to the lagoon's edge, naturalist Oscar Ortiz 
of the Topanga Resource Conservation District waded into the foamy waters and 
turned to face the group. From there he explained that fresh and salt water mix 
in the lagoon, creating optimum conditions for many types of young fish. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he told them that the lagoon once belonged to the Chumash tribe, which 
lived there for 10,000 years before Europeans arrived. Then the students helped 
him collect a sample of water and test it for pollution. It showed he was 
probably standing in water contaminated with a small percentage of human waste. 
The whole group winced. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see white foam on the water, that's human waste," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 They walked behind Ortiz, eating plants as he pointed them out -- first 
licorice-tasting tubes of fennel, then little flowers of mustard. He stopped to 
point out rabbit footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Footprints was a new word for some. "You put shoes on the rabbits?" one 
surprised student asked. Ortiz explained that he meant tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 Then he taught them how the sea anemone can eject its stomach if food becomes 
scarce, growing it back when food returns. And how sea urchins need to eat 
constantly because they have no stomach at all. Sea stars, Ortiz said while 
holding up a dead one, latch onto their prey and dissolve them with digestive 
fluid secreted from their stomachs. He gave the lesson in English, but 
occasionally would answer their questions in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Before students boarded the bus back to Gardena, Ortiz had them pick up a 
handful of golden, glistening sand and look at it under a magnifying glass. 
Under the magnifying glass, the sand is not golden but a mixture of red pieces 
of shell, black bits of iron, crystal-looking quartz and many other colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, it's not really one color at all," Ortiz says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming days, teachers Motoyasu and Ritchie-Daza will lead the students 
on other outings. 
</P>
<P>
 They will visit a nearby MacDonald's, where they will learn how a restaurant 
functions. They will tour the Gardena post office to see the mail system. 
Already they have been to the Gardena Library to apply for cards and to the 
Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum for lessons in genealogy and life in the Old 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this summer, the students will go to the J. Paul Getty Museum and the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trips are invaluable in terms of showing them how much they have in 
common with people they've never met before or maybe even heard about," 
Ritchie-Daza said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also remind students, she said, of something you don't need a classroom 
to learn: 
</P>
<P>
 "That people from all different kinds of places really aren't all that 
different."

HEARING ON PLAN TO DREDGE CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to dredge contaminated material from the entrance channel to Marina del 
Rey and store it on the ocean bed of the Port of Los Angeles will be discussed 
at a public hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers wants to dredge more than 500,000 cubic yards of 
material, which has accumulated to about 10 feet below the waterline and is 
creating a navigational hazard, said Larry Simon, a California Coastal 
Commission staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said the commission's staff will oppose the proposal to dump the debris 
in a landfill associated with the port's Pier 300/400 project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The material is severely contaminated with pollutants, mainly metals," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ballona Creek drains an incredibly large area of Los Angeles and anything 
that's on the street or in a storm drain gets washed into the ocean (at Marina 
del Rey)," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is set for 10 a.m. at the Hyatt Regency, 200 S. Park Ave., Long 
Beach. SUSAN WOODWARD

NOTEBOOK / ROB FERNAS; SOCCER TEAM'S QUEST FOR TITLE FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A South Bay team's dream of winning a national championship in its last game 
together came up short Sunday as the Torrance United Waves lost to the Greater 
Boston Bolts, 6-2, in the 19-and-under girls' final of the U.S. Youth Soccer 
tournament in Blaine, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat ended a successful eight-year run for the Waves, an all-star club 
team that formed in 1987 and finished with a 399-33-25 record. The team is 
disbanding because most of the girls are approaching the age limit for youth 
play and will begin college in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance reached the final with a 3-0 victory Friday over a team from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A stellar pitching performance helped West Torrance's Babe Ruth baseball team 
win the Southern California title and qualify for the Pacific Southwest 
Regional tournament starting today in Taylorsville, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Brandon Marks, a sophomore at West High, combined with Mike 
Cotter on a five-hitter Friday in an 8-0 victory over La Crescenta in the 
Southern California championship game at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks pitched six innings and improved to 4-0, continuing an impressive summer 
that has caught the attention of West High coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a shot at being a starter (next season)," West assistant Mike 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's saying a lot. West returns two All-Southern Section pitchers in Kirk 
Bolling and David Delgado, who combined for 19 victories and helped West reach 
the Division III final last season as juniors. Bolling, who also played third 
base, was The Times' 1994 South Bay Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said Marks and junior George Delgadillo, who pitched well this summer 
on West Torrance's American Legion team, both have a chance to crack the 
starting rotation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo American Legion baseball team, district champion for the third 
time in four years, will play Chino at 7 tonight in the first round of the 
Southern California tournament at Upland Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Upland meets Arcadia in the first game at 4 p.m. The double-elimination 
tournament continues through Saturday, with a game Sunday, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo (26-9) won the District 19/Area 4 title by beating Gahr, 8-4, July 
28 at Blair Field in Long Beach. El Segundo pounded out 15 hits, including a 
home run by Morgan Ensberg, and pitchers Dan Croxall and David Reed combined on 
a seven-hitter. Croxall improved to 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California champion advances to the Eighth Region tournament in 
Albuquerque, N.M., on Aug. 19-23. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Jimmy Harris has left Loyola Marymount and has transferred to 
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, where he intends to continue playing 
basketball, Lion Coach John Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a graduate of Ocean View High in Huntington Beach, was a backup point 
guard for Loyola last season after losing the starting job to another freshman, 
former South Torrance standout Jim Williamson. Harris averaged 2.8 points and 
ranked second on the team in assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, one of the state's most successful community college 
programs, is coached by former El Segundo and USC guard Dana Pagett. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Three South Bay girls were part of two beach volleyball teams that won state 
and national junior titles last weekend at San Juan Capistrano. Teri Zartman of 
Hermosa Beach and Kristin Sigel of Manhattan Beach won the 10th-grade-and-under 
division title Saturday and the 12th grade-and-under title Sunday, beating 
teams from Orange County in both finals. Saturday, Chrissie Zartman, Teri's 
sister, and Tracey Lindquist of Fountain Valley won the eighth-grade-and-under 
title with a victory over an Orange County team. It was a combined event for 
the California Beach Volleyball Assn. and U.S. Junior Olympic championships. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of Southern California boys, most from the South Bay, recently won the 
12-and-under national title at the Youth Basketball of America tournament in 
Winterhaven, Fla. The 4D Stars, coached by Reinaldo Henry of Torrance, beat a 
team from Alabama, 64-43, in the final July 23 to finish the tournament 8-0. 
Andrew Zahn of Hermosa Beach led the 4D Stars in the title game with 16 points 
and was named to the all-tournament team, as were teammates John Mosley of 
Inglewood and Stephen Moss of Torrance. Ryan Mollins of Rancho Palos Verdes won 
the hot shot contest, making six three-point baskets in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach Hot Shots, a 10-and-under girls' soccer team, won the 
division title at the Disney Cup, the largest youth soccer tournament in the 
world. Redondo Beach edged Chino Hills, 3-2, on penalty kicks after the teams 
played to a scoreless tie in the championship game July 23 at the Rose Bowl. 
Kendall Brower scored the decisive penalty kick. The Hot Shots, representing 
American Youth Soccer Organization Region 34, rebounded from an 0-2 start in 
the tournament to win their last five games by shutout. Goalkeeper Danielle 
Seibel, daughter of Coach Larry Seibel, had 28 saves in the semifinal and 
final. Candace Stalder was the team's high scorer. The tournament attracted 
more than 6,000 players from the United States and abroad.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: PALATIAL TREASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people are lucky at business and unlucky in love. With Inderjit Singh, 
for a long time it was the other way around. Five minutes after he met his 
future wife, Manjit, near the English town of Stratford-on-Avon, they were 
planning their marriage. But it took many years of struggle, and long 
apprenticeship at some well-known Indian restaurants, before they could open 
their own restaurant: The India Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Inderjit first went to San Francisco, where a cousin helped him get a job at 
the well-known Indian restaurant Gaylord. There he learned to cook in the 
barrel-shaped clay oven called tandoor . Then he moved to Santa Monica and 
honed his skills at Nawab of India. In 1991, when a coffee shop attached to a 
Torrance motel went out of business, the Singhs leased the Pacific Coast 
Highway location and The India Palace was born.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's decor has been changed little since its coffee shop days, 
apart from the addition of some Indian art to the walls. But in place of 
ketchup and mustard, the tables are now set with two chutneys -- one a chunky 
mix of mint, cilantro and green chile, the other a sweet-and-sour blend of 
tamarind, sugar, salt and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, consider the onion baji ($4): onions dipped in garbanzo flour, 
zapped with red chile powder and fried. Vegetable samosas ($2.50) are filled 
with potatoes and peas seasoned with cumin and chile powder. The South Indian 
soup mulligatawny ($3) is a hearty chicken stock with lentils, chicken, curry 
and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian cuisine's reputation for spiciness is borne out by the chicken vindaloo 
($9), a scorchingly hot stew of boneless, skinLess chicken dosed with lots of 
red chile powder and vinegar. Less daring palates might try the chicken tikka 
masala ($9), tandoor- roasted chicken breast served with a mild tomato sauce 
thickened with a touch of cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight is the lamb saag wala ($9.50), leg of lamb sauteed with 
spinach, coriander, cumin, garlic, onions and ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 The India Palace is at 4111 Pacific Coast Highway, Torrance. Open daily 11:30 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m., (310) 378-7089. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

LAUGH LINES; A FEW CHANGES AND WOODSTOCK WILL BE FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN COWHERD, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was 17 in 1969, but I didn't make it to the original Woodstock for a number 
of reasons, the main one being that I was a jerk who spent that weekend working 
in a pharmacy in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't go to any concert," the boss said. "There's no one to fill in for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "A chimpanzee could fill in for me," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no chimpanzees in this area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was just my luck, of course. Here the seminal event of my generation was 
taking place just 40 miles away, and I was stocking shelves with milk of 
magnesia. A quarter of a million people were sitting around this huge field, 
listening to music and smoking dope and making love. Me, I was stomping around 
and snarling at customers: "Nose drops? Aisle 3. Get 'em yourself, pal." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 25 years later, they're holding another Woodstock. I'd love to go. But as 
I'm a few years older now, I have a few small requests of the concert 
promoters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do we have to sit on the ground this time? I don't know whether you've 
noticed, but the ground is very hard. I guess a person can handle this when 
he's 17 and zonked out on acid. But when you're 42 and the strongest thing you 
take is Bayer, you quickly lose circulation in your legs. I know this would 
probably be expensive, but if you could provide 250,000 or so BarcaLoungers, it 
would make folks my age very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not to beat this to death, but I'd prefer not to sleep on the ground, 
either. Is there a Ramada or Sheraton in the neighborhood? A Holiday Inn would 
be fine, too, although there you run the risk of bumping into people in the 
lounge line-dancing in cowboy outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 * They tell me there was a lot of pot smoking at the last Woodstock. This 
time, could we have a no-smoking policy? Cigarette smoke really bothers my 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * I know a focal point of this gathering is music, but do we have to play the 
music so loud? Instead of cranking those guitar amps all the way up to 10, 
could we keep them on, say, four? This would be appreciated by many of us 
fortysomethings, especially those of us with cellular phones who are checking 
with our stockbrokers or ordering pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speaking of music, is there any way we can wrap things up each night by, oh, 
10 or so? See, I can't stay up real late anymore. I can make it through 
"Seinfeld" OK, but by the end of "Frasier," I'm nodding off big-time. 
</P>
<P>
 * The traffic won't be too bad, will it? God, I hate traffic. At the last 
Woodstock, they had to close the New York State Thruway. I hope things are 
better organized this time. Look, I don't care if it's Dylan, the Dead and 
Springsteen on that stage together -- 15 minutes before the set ends, I'm 
heading for the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * What are we going to do if it rains? I hate to sound like a worry-wart, but 
that's a very real possibility. As I understand it, people just sort of sat 
there in the rain and mud in '69 and got into the music, with the help of a 
headful of peyote, of course. Me, I'm not a rain and mud guy anymore. Perhaps a 
large tent or awning-like material could be erected over the field to keep us 
all dry. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * It would be helpful to have an ATM somewhere on the grounds for those of us 
who run out of cash buying souvenir T-shirts or stocking up on running shoes 
and athletic gear at the Nike booths. 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm assuming someone has done something about the mosquitoes. I'm not 
sitting out in the middle of some stinking field slapping at mosquitoes for 
three days. Uh-uh. Forget it.

 * As I recall, the food at the last Woodstock wasn't all that nutritious. 
People ate things like hero sandwiches, potato chips, Slim Jims, et cetera. Do 
you realize the fat content in that stuff? Would it be possible this time to 
have healthy foods such as yogurt, fresh vegetables, garden salads, pasta 
dishes, bran flakes, et cetera available? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, if we iron out a few these details, it sounds like this new Woodstock 
could be a lot of fun.

 We did more giggling than gasping when we caught "I Love Trouble" -- the flick 
that has "journalists" Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte walking an investigative 
tightrope for rival newspapers. Those clothes! Most of the time, Julia's 
character didn't seem to know if she was visiting a crime scene or attending a 
sorority rush party. And Nick, well, not all male journalists wear a khaki 
trench coat all of the time.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SHE: The scene that really cracked me up was the one where they are running 
through the woods. There's Roberts (as Sabrina Peterson), flying through the 
forest, sans one scratch, in a ribbed cotton mini sweater dress (from Ann 
Taylor, $150) and dainty flats, looking like she's on her way to a modeling 
assignment. Give that girl black leggings and a pair of lugged boots and maybe 
we'll believe she's a modern journalist on a flight for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: There are several items that give away Nolte (Peter Brackett) as an 
impostor, but the ones that nearly made me spray my Dr Pepper across three rows 
were the silk handkerchiefs. Day to day, I've never, but never, seen a 
newspaper guy wearing a handkerchief in his jacket pocket. Heck, they hardly 
ever wear jackets (except, in extreme cases, from the parking lot to the 
office, at which time they take them off forever). 
</P>
<P>
 But there's Nolte, with a succession of stylishly puffed out silk 
handkerchiefs jutting from a succession of finely tailored jackets. Internally, 
I'm screaming, "Nick, you moron! You're a newspaper guy! You're supposed to be 
a slob! You're going to get dirty!! " 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Roberts played her sartorial cards right when she showed up in full 
slacks and easygoing jackets -- clothes that gave her room to move. In my book, 
that's the look for a woman journalist who's out there risking it all to get a 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 One jacket, in particular, caught my eye (and the eye of the fashion editors 
of Glamour magazine; they discuss it in the July issue): the tan, two-pocket 
jacket with sash by Emanuel Ungaro ($358). It was not only appropriately 
low-profile -- Roberts paired it with a black turtleneck top and slacks -- but 
credible. More than I can say for her train-wreck rags. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: My quarrel with the train wreck outfit at the opening of the movie was 
that she was wearing it at all. She looked like she was getting ready to cover 
a charity luncheon. But it was a train wreck, for goodness sake! And the first 
look you get of her at this horrendous scene of death and destruction and mud 
and grease and earthmovers and sparks from cutting torches and fire and 
brimstone and muck and mire is a pair of black high heels and bare legs 
twinkling along through the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't wear top-dollar designer clothes to a train wreck. You make a quick 
detour home (or if you live far away from the office, you detour to your bottom 
desk drawer), you skin out of the good stuff and you put on crusty old jeans, 
jungle boots and a shirt you won't mind ruining. Because you will ruin it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte wasn't much better: full GQ, plus the stupid trench coat, which was 
completely unneeded in that tame weather. Trench coats are made to keep you 
dry, not to identify you as a really bitchin' newspaper guy. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Roberts' bare legs. They sure showcased 'em in this movie. But were they 
hers? Remember all the flak over her stems-substitute in "Pretty Woman"? Maybe 
that's what this movie was really all about -- proving Lyle Lovett's lady has 
nice legs. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: OK, so get her a guest shot on "Models, Inc." But if you want to see how 
newspaper folk dress day in and day out, the closest thing to the truth I've 
seen come out of Hollywood is "All the President's Men." Dustin Hoffman and 
Robert Redford are wrinkled all the time, and all the guys wear broadcloth 
button-downs, slacks, shoes they don't mind scuffing and their ties are never 
knotted up to their throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jason Robards, who played Ben Bradlee, was a fashion ham-and-egger. If 
some guy showed up in our newsroom looking as spiffy as Nolte does, he'd be 
greeted with lots of whistles and kissing noises. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'll have to hand it to Roberts' wardrobe designers for one thing -- the 
small, simple, silver-loop earrings she wears through most of the movie. They 
subtly enhanced her face, never distracting from what she had to say. Too often 
wardrobe stylists go trendy with accessories. Even a simple gold earring might 
have looked too flashy, a pearl stud too dressy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing I liked -- her wardrobe's color scheme. Pinks, purples, reds or 
yellows would have looked garish, unprofessional. She was right on the money in 
tan, cream, black and navy. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I thought Nolte had a fine wardrobe as well, perfect for a night out. He 
looked like a professional model. Camel hair blazer that appeared to be Donegal 
tweed, a long tan vest under the blazer, a casual suede jacket with a price tag 
somewhere in the ionosphere, shoes with a shine on them, upper-end, 
color-coordinated silk ties over what looked like Egyptian cotton shirts. 
Everything pressed, everything starched, everything just so. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty cool -- and true to form -- if you're a zillionaire with lots and lots 
of time to shop for clothes. Absolutely cartoonish if you're a newspaper type.
