 FROM SOUTH POLE . . .: When the new "Antarctica Live" series beams into 
classrooms and homes today, viewers across the country will see naval officers 
from Ventura County's two bases, Port Hueneme and Point Mugu. . . . The 
four-part public TV series, which focuses on scientific research in the 
"coldest, windiest, iciest" place on Earth, will also introduce a few of the 
Navy men and women supporting the researchers. Local bases send pilots, weather 
forecasters, doctors, lawyers and chaplains to the frozen continent. Local 
channels don't plan to air the series, but teachers and viewers can get tapes 
by calling (800) 626-LIVE. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . TO NORTH POLE: At the other pole, Santa Claus is preparing for an 
onslaught of mail. E-mail, that is. The Internet provider for Ventura County is 
offering an electronic address for dear old St. Nick. . . . Last year, the 
service drew 9,000 to 11,000 letters from around the world. "It was a 
tremendous response," said Timothy Twinball, of the RAIN Network. The firm sent 
out a mass computer response to most children last year and is setting up a 
committee to send more personal replies. To reach Santa, type: 
santa(at)npole.rain.org 
</P>
<P>
 SLEIGH RIDE: There's no snow to dash through. And the two Belgian draft horses 
don't do much dashing, anyway. Still, Party Animals Farm is trying to create an 
authentic Christmas experience (B4). . . . Visitors to the farm near Moorpark 
sing Christmas carols in the back of a wagon and drink cocoa in front of a 
fire. "It's an old-fashioned way to have a good time," founder Krissie Breck 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLDEN DREAMS: At first, Golden Systems Inc. lived up to its name. After one 
year in business, the Simi Valley firm was selling $4.5 million worth of 
computer power-switching devices. Two years later, sales had risen to $29.4 
million (Valley Business, Page 4). . . . But early this month, the gold lost 
its glitter as defects prompted the firm's largest customer to ship back $5 
million in goods. Now the firm is scrambling to fix the equipment and survive 
the setback.

AL MARTINEZ: THEY WERE DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a column about rites of passage and about the little girls who dance 
in and out of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw them over the weekend in celebrations as old as the wind and as new as 
each day's sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched them spin in the blurred speed and color of a Degas painting to 
music as varied as Tchaikovsky, the hora and "Jailhouse Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 I heard them laugh, I saw them cry and I joined them in remembering pain 
beyond belief suffered by those whose anguish weighs heavily upon the world's 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a weekend of reflection and revelation, combined in both the ritual of 
a bat mitzvah and in the seasonal tradition of "The Nutcracker" ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bat mitzvah honored the coming of age of Shavonne Wieder, the 13-year-old 
daughter of Les and Tyree Wieder, in a rite of passage that dates to the 2nd 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in ceremonial custom, one says farewell to infancy, and turns in the 
direction that leads to adulthood. Every culture acknowledges that moment in 
the process of growing up, but Shavonne's was special because it paid homage to 
both religion and race. Her mother is black, her father white. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the roof of Northridge's Temple Ahavat Shalom, the history of two 
peoples, Jews and African Americans, was blended in serenity and tradition in 
the first steps of a dark-eyed girl's journey into adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 She began the trip by remembering family losses both to Nazism and to slavery, 
and by embracing the truths of Moses and Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she danced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I saw "The Nutcracker" ballet the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was presented for the 14th consecutive year in a cavernous Topanga 
Community House that has echoed with both acrimony and high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddings have been held there, and carnivals, and debates over land use that 
have clanged with the resonance of clashing swords. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the old building rang with the music of Peter Tchaikovsky and 
dazzled a packed house with dances choreographed by Sherry Jason. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dancers was a glowing little mouse named Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 There were others onstage too, of course, in a cast of children and adults 
that transformed a tradition into magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their costumes of brilliant reds and pastel pinks shimmered in the spotlights 
as they soared like butterflies and pranced like gazelles in a mosaic of dance 
reminiscent of a study by Edgar Degas. 
</P>
<P>
 He painted ballerinas in rich oils, and caught them in motion, capturing life, 
as he once said, in its essential gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention 8-year-old Nicole because of her style, because of her smile, 
because of her ebullience . . . and because, well, she's my granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a mouse, a little cousin and a naughty child in this year's 
"Nutcracker," her fourth year of participation in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 I have watched girls become young ladies in the progress of their 
performances, and the mice become snowflakes. Nicole grows as she dances, in a 
rite of passage enhanced by music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing is a fundamental element of celebration. It always has been, keyed 
first to the rhythms of nature and then to the nuances of culture. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ceremony for Shavonne was over, the music began. Even here there was 
tradition. The first dance of the bat mitzvah party was the hora, a circular 
dance which, through hand-holding, joined its participants together. 
</P>
<P>
 The hora was never intended as a metaphor for linking races, but that it did 
on this night of passage. Blacks joined with whites to lift a daughter of both 
races on a chair above the crowd, in a celebration of unity that someday may be 
more than a dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Into a circle created by a young girl coming of age was drawn many dancers, 
each as similar as the costumed little mice of "Nutcracker," but as different 
as the music that followed the hora. 
</P>
<P>
 We went from "Fiddler on the Roof" to the chicken dance, and the proper young 
participants of an ancient ritual were suddenly flinging off ceremonial 
constraints and letting it all hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched the bat mitzvah on Saturday and the "Nutcracker" on Sunday, I 
realized how quickly our little girls become big girls, and how easily they 
dance out of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But I realized too how much hope they represent for a world whose history is 
littered with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll remember this weekend vividly as I grow old in the business of writing. 
I'll see the little girls as clearly as if it were yesterday, costumed and 
vivacious, as bright as morning. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be dancing.

RUDOLPH STEWART, VETERAN BUSINESS LEADER, DIES AT 89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service is planned Jan. 5 for Rudolph Schiffmann Stewart, who 
carried on the long traditions of two family businesses. He died after a short 
illness Nov. 28 in Laguna Niguel at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Also known as "Hap" for his happy and free-spirited nature, Stewart graduated 
from Oregon State University and then joined his grandfather's business, R. 
Schiffmann Asthmador, a tobacco firm in Los Angeles that was founded in 1867. 
He was the last family member to carry on in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in World War II as captain in the medical corps. Upon his return, he 
pioneered a packaging company called Los Angeles Custom Packaging, serving as 
president for both companies.  
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Marilyn, three children, nine 
grandchildren and a brother. The family asks that any contributions be donated 
to the AIDS Services Foundation in Irvine, or any other charities in Stewart's 
memory.

HEIDI FLEISS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll rest easier tonight knowing Heidi Fleiss is off the streets ("Fleiss 
Convicted on 3 Pandering Charges," Dec. 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Now I wonder if the same 20 or so officers who had to endure the danger of 
watching four women undress during their sting would care to take their time 
and resources to the streets where gangs are in control and innocent victims 
are being mugged, robbed and shot.Maybe they could set up a sting to catch a 
carjacker "in the act." But probably not -- it seems far too dangerous. 
</P>

<P>
 I find it outrageous that Fleiss should be sent to jail on charges of 
pandering while the sleazy men in the entertainment industry (her purported 
customers) go free. It is they who create the commercial demand for women's 
bodies; they are the ones who actively prostitute women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fleiss case is yet another example of how our judicial system protects the 
interests of men to the detriment of women. Once again the judicial system 
sends the message that women are the sexual property of men and what men do to 
women is outside the purview of the law.

 Re "Prosecution or Persecution?," Commentary, Dec. 6: 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Allred and Lisa Bloom make an excellent, logical, rational, economic 
and just case for the legalization of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes me wonder what would have happened if the police had made a deal with 
Fleiss to use her in a sting of her wealthy and powerful customers, in exchange 
for not prosecuting her. It just might have brought enough pressure on 
lawmakers to repeal the anti-prostitution laws.

MOLYNEUX ON DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "12-Step Program for Recovering Democrats," by Guy Molyneux, Opinion, Dec. 
4: There is much wisdom in Molyneux's advice to Democrats to admit that they 
have a problem, to stop defending the past and to take the long-term view. But 
there is also folly in his exhortations to continue to define the Democratic 
Party as the party of the middle class and the working people. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than thinking of themselves in bankrupt ideological terms, Democrats 
should redefine themselves as the party that has: 
</P>
<P>
 * The guts to drain the swamp of PACs and special interests in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tenacity to invest in preparing Americans to work and prosper in a 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The wisdom to adopt policies addressing the causes, not just the symptoms of 
the country's social breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no illusions about the fact that in the win-lose game of politics 
parties must adopt whatever strategies they feel will help them compete for 
votes. I am only suggesting that courageously addressing core issues may prove 
to be a better strategy, not only for the Democrats, but for the country as a 
whole. 
</P>

<P>
 Molyneux's analogy of Democrats as vampires was initially amusing, until I 
recalled that it is the blood of the middle class being so greedily extracted. 
I beg Molyneux to refrain from encouraging Democrats in this activity, already 
one in which they have no peer. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan for re-establishing the preeminence of the Democratic Party is both 
cunning and divisive. First the facts must be carefully reconstructed (i.e., 
twisted) in order to label the GOP as the "real majority party" for the past 25 
years. Then the plan is to fan the flames of public indignation, now so 
conveniently redirected, for the trespasses of big government by openly 
encouraging class warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Having deliberately misled the electorate, and then promoted the anger of 
those he would deceive, the admonition for the Democrats to "face the world 
honestly" was disingenuous at best. As Molyneux quotes, "the truth can set you 
free," but one should first be able to recognize it.

 McGovern, Carter, Mondale, Dukakis and now Clinton: Until Nov. 8 the Democrats

roll-over-and-play-dead gang.

 Explain this to me -- slowly. What's so bad about big government? Is there 
something wrong with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid -- all federal 
programs that save people's lives every day? How about the FBI and Customs and 
the armed forces? Can we get along without these organizations? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there some argument against the government stepping in to help flood, fire 
and earthquake victims or safeguarding us from environmental contamination or 
establishing food and drug standards? Am I being blind in not recognizing that 
we'd all be better off without these government services? Is there some good 
that I don't appreciate in giving up life-sustaining help from Washington? No, 
I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big government" are bugaboo words calculated solely by the Republicans to 
demonize the Clinton Administration. Repeated often enough, like some mantra, 
they penetrate the unconscious and deny scrutiny. In truth, they offer 
absolutely nothing but some undefinable fear. What a shame that so many people 
have unthinkingly accepted the notion that reduced government contributes to 
their welfare. And what a sham on the part of the Republicans.

FREE TRADE IS WONDERFUL, BUT . . . ; PROMISING HEMISPHERIC ACCORD IN MIAMI ALSO 
RAISES NAGGING DOUBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last month alone the resolutely commerce-oriented Clinton 
Administration has pushed a dramatic free-trade agenda that included the 
ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a gradual 
dismantling of regional barriers among Asian Pacific Economic Council members 
and, just this past weekend, a landmark agreement among 34 Western Hemisphere 
nations to create the world's largest free-trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember President Clinton's famous campaign slogan, "It's the economy, 
stupid." Clinton has now taken that domestic slogan international. 
</P>
<P>
 No question, the prospects from free trade do look promising. Booming exports 
undoubtedly helped the United States weather the worst of the recession, not to 
mention the disruptive ratcheting down of the defense industry. More foreign 
markets basically mean more places to peddle American goods and services. That 
should translate into jobs for those who produce goods and services here that 
are in demand abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 So why isn't everyone happy? If free trade and open markets are supposed to 
help to bring economic security to the United States, why then do so many 
people feel insecure these days? Because what's in store is not clear at all 
and the benefits to be reaped might be uneven at best. What about those 
industries that may not be able to compete profitably against cheaper imports? 
While President Clinton chirps cheerily about the number of jobs world trade 
creates, and it will indeed create many new jobs, there has been a lot of 
debate about whether all this new employment will assure a better or worse 
standard of living than the old jobs, or the same. No one, including the 
President, seems willing to discuss the fear that booming trade may be better 
for consumers than for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 So as the U.S. economy recovers nicely, we all desperately want to believe the 
luminous vision of a more bountiful America, thanks in part to forward-looking 
free-trade agreements symbolized by this weekend's Summit of Americas. But so 
much of the free-trade dialogue seems conducted with upbeat buzzwords that tend 
to gloss over the new worries. Life, after all, is not just about business.

 Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration has received more than its 
share of criticism for not moving swiftly enough on airline safety issues. So 
its recent order grounding certain commuter planes, while inconvenient for many 
holiday travelers and airlines, is a welcome departure from previous FAA 
foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday -- two months after an American Eagle ATR-72 commuter plane crashed 
and disintegrated in a cornfield near Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 passengers 
aboard -- the FAA announced a ban of all European-built ATRs from flying in icy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 When ice accumulation before take off caused Air Florida 737 to plunge into 
Washington's Potomac River on a snowy January day in 1982, for example, the FAA 
failed for more than a decade afterward to institute stringent ground-based 
de-icing procedures recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
Meanwhile, as the bureaucracy slept, 23 planes crashed in icing-related 
incidents and more than 100 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice is particularly dangerous because even minute amounts can distort wing 
shape, reducing an aircraft's lift. In the past, most commercial airliners have 
encountered problems with ice during takeoffs. But recent tests on the ATR 
indicate that ice buildup could send the plane into a roll during flight.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the NTSB was so concerned about the problem that it issued an 
emergency advisory strongly recommending that the government prevent the 
46-seat ATR-42s and 68-seat ATR-72s from flying in icy weather. Some 
Chicago-area pilots refused to fly the planes altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, commuter planes carried 51 million passengers, about 12% of the 
nation's air travelers. Now commuter airlines such as American Eagle, whose ATR 
fleet serves major hubs like Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, will have 
to scramble to find planes. Still, as one Chicago passenger said recently, "So 
I lose a few hours of sleep; if it saves people's lives, I'm all for it." Amen.

400,000 STUDENTS DESERVE AN ANSWER; SAVE SCHOOLS FROM ORANGE COUNTY'S FISCAL 
CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last dozen years the state Legislature has bailed out a number of 
school districts with loans ranging from $10 million for Oakland to $600,000 
for the San Francisco Bay Area community of Emeryville. It proved to be money 
well spent; all the loans have either been or are being repaid, even though 
state officials said it was the school districts' fiscal mismanagement that 
caused the initial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the governor's office and the Legislature should be ready to help Orange 
County's public schools, which face massive financial problems that are not 
entirely of their making. The schools have more than fairness on their side; 
they also have a state Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 There is understandable uncertainty over what Orange County's bankruptcy 
filing last week will mean for the county's 31 school districts and 400,000 
students. The districts invested $1 billion in the county fund that lost 
billions of dollars. But they did not invest completely by choice; under state 
law, they were forced to entrust their money to the fund run by county 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who has since resigned. Sacramento 
must be ready to help should the county's and schools' situation worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature can act without forcing a takeover of local school systems; 
that must be only a worst-case scenario. Loans would be one source of help. 
Orange County's superintendent of schools, John F. Dean, reminds Sacramento, 
correctly, that by law the state must keep the schools open, which means paying 
the bills if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court ruled unanimously two years ago that state officials 
have a broad constitutional duty to step in when a local school district faces 
insolvency and provide students with the same basic education as other pupils 
in the state. Gov. Pete Wilson argued unsuccessfully that state intervention in 
the Richmond Unified School District case in 1991 would abrogate local autonomy 
and local accountability for fiscal mismanagement. However, the justices did 
say that the state Education Department could not hand over unappropriated 
money; it said the Legislature would have to specifically appropriate money for 
a school district in the event of a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to know exactly how much money might be needed in Orange 
County. The state took over the Richmond schools when they were close to 
insolvent. There may be a bit more time in the Orange County situation, but the 
state is better off helping out now with loans and avoiding even the 
possibility of a takeover.

<P>
 The Alameda Corridor project took another giant step forward early this month 
when the California Transportation Commission voted to spend $80 million in 
state funds to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The corridor, already many years in the planning and many more still from 
completion, will enormously speed the movement of goods to and from the Los 
Angeles/Long Beach ports and Downtown rail links.Currently, the glacial 
movement of cargo jeopardizes the ports' continued dominance of the West Coast 
shipboard trade and, hence, this region's key competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The state funds were set aside for this project by voters when they approved 
Proposition 116 in 1990; this money will permit construction of four overpasses 
crossing the corridor south of the 91 Freeway. Commission approval awaited 
negotiation of a tentative operating agreement among three competing rail lines 
for joint use of the improved corridor. That agreement was forged earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is not imminent. State agencies may need as long as two years to 
comply with environmental regulations and to acquire the additional land 
parcels required for overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the commission action represents an important gain. Once 
completed, the overpasses will speed surface transit with or without corridor 
improvements. Moreover, the unanimous vote should provide momentum for local 
congressional representatives to obtain the millions more in federal 
transportation funds necessary to improve the rail line itself.

JURY DUTY

<P>
 Re Lawyer Jerome Haig's letter (Nov. 28) concerning his client's third strike: 
I recently completed a stint as a juror and was on a remarkably similar or 
possibly the same case. Though I have served as a juror in the past and always 
felt it to be a positive experience, this time I felt that I and the system did 
more harm than good.The client was accused of selling a minute quantity of a 
controlled substance. The only witness was a paid police informant, who 
admitted to being a drug user. Although three of us felt quite strongly that we 
had no abiding conviction of the defendant's guilt, we finally caved in to the 
other nine who kept pressing us for a reasonable scenario of why the witness 
would have lied. It was only shared with us that this was a three-strikes case 
after it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 I've learned something unpleasant about myself through this experience -- 
having thought myself to be a person who would stick to her principles under 
pressure. I've also learned something about the system and the three-strikes 
law, which I voted for. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately these lessons do little for the poor soul I helped convict.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; NOW SIERRA CLUB THREATENS WETLANDS; AFTER THE AMIGOS DE 
BOLSA CHICA GROUP NEGOTIATED A RESTORATION PLAN, A NEW 'TASK FORCE' COULD 
SCUTTLE THE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

biology at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, and a past president of

 Sierra Club's local activism threatens wetlands restoration in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As an environmentalist fighting for wetlands restoration for 24 years, I 
always believed my opponents were land developers. However, with important 
conservation agreements in place at Bolsa Chica in Huntington Beach and the 
Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, it appears those standing in the way of 
restoration are "anti-growth" activists with unrealistic positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the environmental group Amigos de Bolsa Chica successfully negotiated 
the coalition agreement, ending a 20-year battle over a Huntington Beach 
coastal area. Together with the city, the county, the state and the landowner 
(now Koll Real Estate Group), Amigos ensured that more than 1,000 acres of 
degraded wetlands would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Another citizens' group, Friends of Ballona Wetlands, completed an agreement 
to restore a significant amount of the Ballona Wetlands that cleared the way 
for the Playa Vista project in Los Angeles County. Because the wetlands in 
question are degraded, each agreement ensured more wetlands would be protected 
than required by law (i.e., no net loss of wetlands). 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of their efforts, the groups' successes are threatened by a 
self-appointed "task force" in the Sierra Club's Angeles chapter. This group 
has chosen to attack the projects, the conservation agreements, and the 
credibility of the Amigos and Friends groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime member of Sierra Club, I support their broad policies. In 1992, 
its California chapter published a "Green State of the State Report," which 
urged "policy before planning" as a growth management solution. They urged 
agencies to adopt policies encouraging urban in-fill developments instead of 
urban sprawl, and promoting affordability by planning varied densities instead 
of just large-lot single-family subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica plan embraces the report's policies. It is an in-fill 
development with varied densities, and 75% of the site will become a system of 
wetlands, parks and trails. Planners for Playa Vista also consulted Sierra Club 
policy extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, activists at the Angeles chapter are either unaware of or have 
chosen to ignore the report's recommendations, as they pursue identical 
strategies to block the two projects. The inconsistency between policy and the 
activists' behavior calls attention to a major flaw in the Sierra Club's 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club allows individual members, regardless of their technical 
background, to organize a local "task force" on any particular issue. The local 
task force has authority to develop policy and represent Sierra Club without 
accountability to state or national policy. This leaves anyone trying to 
interpret Sierra Club policy in a quandary and has cost them credibility among 
public policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Amigos and Friends slugged it out with the landowners, Sierra Club 
stood on the sidelines. Only when resolution was near did the Sierra Club 
become involved. First, representatives offered to "take over," renewing the 
fights that had ended. Met by a cool response, the task force attacked the 
groups as having "sold out" and being "in bed" with the developers. They have 
criticized both projects without offering a feasible alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, a Sierra Club representative asked me if Amigos would relinquish its 
battle, as he was confident they could negotiate with the landowner to set 
aside 500 to 600 acres. Today, Amigos has an agreement to preserve more than 
1,100 acres of wetlands for restoration. Yet the Sierra Club "task force" 
continues to attack that agreement and Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
 It is both curious and ironic that a Sierra Club task force would attack the 
very organizations that achieved protection of the wetlands in the first place. 
Especially since it claims to be an "environmental" group, yet fights against 
binding agreements to restore wetlands -- even when the agreements exceed what 
regulatory efforts could accomplish. One has to ask if this amounts to 
"environmentalism" or "obstructionism." 
</P>
<P>
 I believe there's a place for Sierra Club in helping to set the nation's 
agenda for the environment. However, groups such as Amigos de Bolsa Chica and 
Friends of Ballona Wetlands have a greater knowledge and commitment regarding 
local issues. After years of good faith negotiation with all of the interests, 
the groups' agreements should be allowed to move forward.

COLUMN LEFT / TOM HAYDEN: SACRIFICING THE BAY FOR LITTLE GAIN; ENVIRONMENTAL 
GROUPS PAY A HIGH PRICE TO BE INSIDE PLAYERS IN THE COASTAL RESTORATION PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAYDEN, State Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat representing parts of West Los 
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, is chairman of the Senate Natural 
Resources Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For five years, the public has been lulled into believing that Santa Monica 
Bay pollution would be solved by a restoration plan that is the product of a 
happy consensus between industry and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, approved last week by Gov. Pete Wilson, is a retreat from tough 
regulatory controls to protect the ocean. If approved by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, the plan's voluntary approach will become a national model. 
Here also is a case study of what happens when environmental groups surrender 
their independent voice to become inside players. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan will not restore the bay. Instead, it proposes "maintaining current 
emission levels" of pollutants flowing into the bay. Its $67-million price tag 
is for further management, not cleanup, and has scant foreseeable funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Its priority actions are hazy suggestions to the very government officials and 
regulators responsible for decades of pollution: Rather than reductions of 
polluted runoff, setting limits would only be "investigated"; enforcement 
mechanisms would perhaps be created "where necessary"; toxic hot spots would be 
"evaluated for the purposes of characterization." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does not propose: 
</P>
<P>
 * Greater safeguards on the hundreds of oil tankers that use Chevron's bay 
facility. One spilled 29,000 gallons of oil three years ago, as the plan was 
being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dealing with the 9 million cubic meters of cancer-causing DDT and PCBs off 
Palos Verdes since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warning people that 200,000 pounds of DDT-PCB-laced white croaker are sold 
in local markets every year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Protecting billions of fish eggs and larvae destroyed by 1 billion gallons 
of "cooling water" discharged daily by power plants owned by Southern 
California Edison and the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is feeble at its core because Chevron, Edison, DWP and sewer agencies 
had veto power in the committee that wrote it. The plan focuses on public 
education, research and voluntary measures because that was all that industry 
and environmentalists could agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a bay watchdog, the restoration project became a lap dog of the 
very regulators it should have criticized. The project itself is funded by and 
physically housed in the regional water quality control board and its executive 
director is a top employee of the regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional board appointed by Wilson is woefully lax on enforcement. The 
governor, an apostle of "regulatory relief," is tough on crime except for 
violators of environmental laws. Then his appointees turn liberal and try to 
rehabilitate the lawbreakers through incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional board has one person to watchdog 20,000 firms with industrial 
discharge permits. In 1993-94, its storm-water regulators issued no fines or 
abatement orders. Its occasional environmental gestures arise from media 
pressure or lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way to clean up Santa Monica Bay without cleaning up the influence 
of polluters and dischargers over the regulatory process. The political 
appointees to the boards can even earn up to 10% of their personal income from 
those they regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry agenda toward the plan was clear: contain the hot issue of ocean 
pollution, placate public opinion and head off reform. The governor's agenda 
was clear, too: a pro-industry plan packaged as environmentalism to challenge 
"excessive" federal clean-water regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But why have some respected coastal advocates supported this flawed document? 
The simplified answer is they were co-opted in the sticky swamp of consensus. 
They got lots of money for valid research and small grants for streambed 
repair. They helped facilitate a beach-closure protocol. For such minor gains, 
they gave their seal of approval to a plan that lets dischargers and polluters 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the "new consensus" leads to a respected group like Heal the Bay taking 
money from Chevron, and the American Oceans Campaign lending its good name to 
joint projects with Unocal, the largest despoiler of our coast. 
</P>
<P>
 There are environmental dissenters from this pro-industry consensus. The 
Natural Resources Defense Council and Baykeeper have urged the EPA not to 
certify the plan unless it is strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with banning DDT in 1972, to sewage cleanup orders in the 1980s and 
'90s, down to the recent court decision that Caltrans must prevent street 
pollutants from washing into the bay, there has been one lesson: citizen 
action, legislative pressure, media exposure and lawsuits have made all the 
difference in healing the bay.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; ZEDILLO IS BETTING ON THE STATUS QUO; COUNTING ON 
POPULAR RESISTANCE TO CHANGE, THE NEW PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED REFORMS ONLY IN 
THE JUDICIARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist who teaches 
at Mexican and U.S. universities. His latest book is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin 
American Left After the Cold War (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the 1960s, outgoing Mexican presidents have left office under a cloud. 
Since the '30s, incoming leaders have blended change and continuity in just the 
right doses to ensure both a break with the discredited predecessor and the 
survival of the political system and machinery that brought the successor to 
power. Ernesto Zedillo, last week inaugurated as Mexico's 11th consecutive 
full-term, full-powered and single-party president, is playing by the rules -- 
and doing so with all the skill and ingenuity his forerunners have 
traditionally demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican presidents since 1934 have sought to reform the one-party, 
authoritarian political system. Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, they have 
proved remarkably successful at changing just as much as necessary to ensure 
the system's survival. All of them have initially hesitated between being the 
last in the line of the system's saviors or the first in line of the architects 
of the new system. So with Zedillo: He is intelligently moving to preserve the 
system, perhaps going further than others because more is needed, but not to 
bury it and build something new. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic premises of his actions are self-evident: First, the system can be 
saved with significant but feasible repairs; second, the Mexican people do not 
believe the system is in crisis, are not fed up with it and, given some 
changes, prefer continuity to transition.  
</P>
<P>
 On the first count, Zedillo has installed the first coalition government -- of 
a sort -- in years by naming a leader of the right-of-center Partido de Accion 
Nacional (PAN) as his attorney general. This widely praised appointment lends 
credibility and viability to Zedillo's second stage of the system's overhaul: 
the announcement of a major reform of the country's judicial process, believed 
to be the most flawed, corrupt and despised of the nation's institutions. While 
the reform's details remain vague and effectiveness in question, simply by 
acknowledging the deficiency and promising to amend it, Zedillo has reversed 
part of the political system's discredit. He will, on this score, still be 
judged by the results he delivers in the investigation of Mexico's two 
political murders this year, but reforming law enforcement and the 
administration of justice is a fine way to begin his term. 
</P>
<P>
 The third crucial step Zedillo has taken is to reestablish "diplomatic 
relations" with the other opposition, the left-of-center Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), which supported Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' run for the 
presidency in 1994. During the entire presidency of Carlos Salinas, the 
country's chief executive and its then main opposition did not even talk 
publicly, let alone cooperate. Zedillo has taken advantage of the consequences 
of Cardenas' devastating defeat in the August elections to build bridges with 
the PRD congressional caucus. For now, Zedillo's honeymoon with PRD members is 
contributing to a lowering of tension in Mexico's cities if not Mexico's 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes are considerable; a sea change they are not. Indeed, Zedillo's 
message seems to belie the gravity of the system's crisis: Everything else is 
business-as-usual. The rest of the new president's Cabinet is lackluster. His 
inaugural speech, though dotted with moving passages, was mostly uninspiring. 
Beyond the rhetoric of dialogue and reconciliation, there is so far scant 
substance. Zedillo appears to believe that there is nothing terribly wrong with 
Mexico and that a majority of Mexicans agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be right. The August vote produced an ample Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) majority, albeit with some tampering. Mexicans are scared of too 
much change and the turbulent events of this year -- an armed uprising, two 
kidnapings, two assassinations, an election and several splits in the PRI -- 
have not irreparably upset the party's legendary hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Zedillo is wrong, he is playing with the proverbial fire. The cost the 
country has paid in the past for each president's success in saving the system 
has been high; in recent decades, exorbitant. If the system is in fact beyond 
repair or if the Mexican people have had their fill of it, business-as-usual, 
however peppered with imagination and verve, will not do.

OBESITY GENE DISCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Gene Found That May Lead to Obesity," Dec. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 As dramatic as the discovery of a "fat gene" in mice may be, few among us 
should be lulled into laying the blame for an ever-present spare tire to some 
bad genes inherited from our parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains that the overwhelming majority of those among us who are 
overweight are that way because we have become less physically active and 
because we eat too much of the wrong food. A few may have a genetic malady, and 
for them this discovery gives some hope. The rest of us can easily do something 
about it now. 
</P>
<P>
 From taking personal responsibility to get physically active on a regular 
basis with family or friends, to focusing on life's small luxuries -- like 
elevators and escalators when stairs will do, and nearby parking spots that 
shortchange us of what little physical activity many already get -- there are 
countless opportunities in everyday life that anyone can take advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
 Our only reward will be better health, lower weight, more energy and a 
realization that, for most of us, the power to control our lives -- and our 
waistlines -- is within our reach and at our feet.

 Am I alone in wondering if discovering and altering the gene that causes 
obesity is such a good thing? Is it not possible that this gene may be present 
in some people for a reason? 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a few thousand years ago that the Earth released itself from a 
prolonged Ice Age. Many geologists theorize that the Earth may again slowly 
head toward a significant glacial period in the next thousand years. By 
considering alteration of the genes that cause obesity, is it possible we might 
inadvertently eliminate an evolutionary trait of humans that allows us to adapt 
to changing climates? Moreover, is it wise to alter human genealogy, evolved 
over millions of years, in the name of this short-term desire for thinness? 
Researchers should think long and hard before messing with human genes. Some of 
these genes, unbeknownst to us, may be essential to the long-term evolutionary 
survival of our species.

DODGERS GET WALLACH AT LESS THAN HALF-PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers, acknowledging their fear of opening the season with a 28-year-old 
rookie third baseman, reached a tentative agreement Monday with veteran third 
baseman Tim Wallach on a one-year, $1.5-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, 37, coming off one of the finest seasons of his career, believes that 
he exemplifies the difficulty veteran free agents are facing in the marketplace 
this winter. Although he can earn an additional $600,000 in incentives, his 
base salary will be less than half of his $3.3-million earnings in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd see the day where a third baseman could hit .280 with 23 
homers and 78 RBIs by mid-August," agent Alan Meersand said, "and have to take 
a pay cut like this. But it's a market full of third basemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dodger General Manager) Fred Claire told me this is the best we can do. He 
told me that the club will be a lot younger and the payroll will be a lot less 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Listen, if Tim doesn't accept this offer, we'll just go out and 
find someone else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who also has a $1.5-million option for the 1996 season, will be paid 
an additional $4,800 for every game he starts until he reaches a maximum 125 
games. The Dodgers then must decide within two days upon completion of the 1995 
World Series whether to exercise the 1996 option. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim sacrificed a lot of money to stay with the Dodgers," Meersand said. "This 
is an example of a player wanting to stay with his hometown team and play for a 
manager who loves him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach said Monday that he was not promised the starting job, but certainly 
is expected to be the incumbent. He will be competing with rookie Ron Coomer, 
who hit 22 homers with 123 runs batted in at triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had hoped that Coomer would become their everyday third baseman in 
1995, but he struggled defensively in the Arizona Fall League.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is time for the most routine play in football, the conversion kick, to be 
eliminated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, pro, college and high school teams should line up at the three-yard 
line after touchdowns and try to pass or run for a one-point conversion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That was nice balance the Raiders showed on offense against the Denver Broncos 
-- 32 rushes and 31 passes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, they still committed far too many penalties -- 12 -- and these 
stupid, repetitious errors could keep them out of the playoffs or get them 
eliminated early. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Have you ever seen a team line up offside as often as the Raiders? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Versatile Hugh Millen was the Broncos' leading passer and rusher Sunday. He 
ran once for 24 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You know Chuck Knox is near the end of the line when his 4-10 Rams are guilty 
of trash talking. His teams in L.A., Seattle and Buffalo used to show a lot 
more class and win a lot more games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Please don't tell me that the Dallas Cowboys don't miss Jimmy Johnson at least 
a little bit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson would have had them playing with more intensity against the Cleveland 
Browns on Saturday. Working hard the last eight or nine minutes might get the 
job done in the NBA, but not in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham needs a change of scenery. For that matter, so does Rich 
Kotite. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young finally is getting his due -- at least outside San Francisco. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The first NFL game played indoors was the Chicago Bears' 9-0 victory over the 
Portsmouth Spartans on Dec. 18, 1932. A crowd of 11,198 saw the league 
championship game played on an 80-yard field at Chicago Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Al Michaels described a spectator at a recent Monday night game as "Santa 
Claus wearing his throwback uniform." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 24 should be an interesting Saturday in the NFL in Southern California -- 
Kansas City vs. the Raiders at the Coliseum, Pittsburgh vs. San Diego at Jack 
Murphy Stadium, and Washington vs. the Rams, probably playing their last game 
at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Last add UCLA-USC football game: This was the first time that a UCLA team that 
finished with a losing record beat USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC recruiting in Texas should be helped by the Trojans' appearance against 
Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado and Colorado State both are 10-1 in football, North Carolina and 
North Carolina State 8-3, Virginia and Virginia Tech 8-3, and Washington and 
Washington State 7-4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sportscasters' cliche: "It's time for someone to step up and get it done." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Freshman guard Cameron Murray is giving USC what it needed -- an explosive 
shooter with good ballhandling skills. Besides, he set a school record for 
steals in a game against Cal State Sacramento. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another 6-1 Cameron who plays guard in this city, UCLA's Cameron Dollar, is a 
coach's dream who does many things well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Harrick is probably going to have to find room in his starting 
lineup for freshman forward J.R. Henderson, who is the best shooter on the team 
and has surprisingly good perimeter skills. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' next game at Pauley Pavilion is Dec. 22 against George Mason, 
coached by Paul Westhead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in the Hollywood Park press box could remember a bigger winning margin 
on grass than 2-year-old American Day's 13-length score in a maiden race 
Saturday. He is Best Pal's half brother. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among those elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame for 1995 
are Ken Holtzman, Ed Newman, Bud Greenspan and the late Jimmie Reese. The Hall 
of Fame museum is at the campus of Wingate Institute in Netanya, Israel. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 highest-salaried baseball players, only one is a pitcher. David Cone 
is 13th. . . . A charity hockey game featuring former NHL stars and show 
business personalities will be played Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Forum. It 
will be followed by a college all-star game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 During the Clippers' losing streak, Coach Bill Fitch was asked if they could 
make the playoffs. "My name is Fitch, not Houdini," he replied.

NBA ROUNDUP; RODMAN PUTS SPICE IN SPURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When green-haired Dennis Rodman roared up to San Antonio's Alamodome in his 
white Jeep, a few dozen waiting fans cheered. When he stepped onto the 
basketball court, a few thousand admirers did the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial forward stole the show Monday night as the San Antonio Spurs 
defeated the Washington Bullets, 122-101. Rodman played in his first 
regular-season game after two suspensions and a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I add spice, so people like to see somebody different," Rodman said before 
the game. "They should love it. They should feed off it." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, with five rebounds and six points in 27 minutes, didn't approach his 
17.3 league-leading rebounding average of last season. But he got a standing 
ovation from many fans when he entered the game late in the first period. And 
he dazzled the crowd with a dunk in the second quarter and behind-the-back pass 
in the fourth. He also committed five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson led the Spurs with 21 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman brushed off questions about whether he could follow team rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no guidelines for Dennis Rodman. Period. I will do what I'm going to 
do, and that's to help this team be successful this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 128, Orlando 101 -- The Nets ended an eight-game losing streak 
against the Magic by making 61% of their shots in the first three quarters at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando came in with a league-best 15-3 record and a four-game winning streak, 
but made only 26.1% of its free throws, fourth-lowest in an NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 90, Golden State 84 -- Charles Barkley had 18 points, nine rebounds 
and seven assists to lead the Suns at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 101, Portland 89 -- Karl Malone scored 27 points at Salt Lake City to 
help the Jazz end a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 122, New York 111 -- Glen Rice scored a season-high 38 points to lead 
the Heat at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 113, Denver 103 -- Pervis Ellison, sidelined all season while 
recovering from knee surgery, scored 19 points at Boston in his Celtic debut. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Coach Chris Ford will undergo colon surgery and is not expected back on 
the Celtics' bench for three weeks. . . . Jay Humphries of the Utah Jazz was 
fined $3,500 by the NBA for throwing an elbow at San Antonio's Vinny Del Negro 
on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaiah Rider of the Minnesota Timberwolves, blasted by Coach Bill Blair after 
scoring only three points Saturday night against Phoenix, said it's his coach 
who needs to understand about maturity. Frustrated by Rider's inconsistency and 
on-court antics, Blair said Saturday that Rider has "got to grow up."

 U.S., Japan Reach Accord on Flat Glass: U.S. trade officials said a weekend 
agreement with Tokyo will help open Japan's $4.5-billion flat-glass market to 
foreign companies and that Washington expects to see results within a year. 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Japan's agreement to end 
discriminatory practices is "another step in the right direction" in resolving 
trade differences with the United States. "This agreement meets all our goals 
and is enthusiastically welcomed by our industry," Kantor said in a statement. 
In Tokyo, Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the agreement is 
significant because it avoids numerical targets.

MUNICIPAL BOND PRICES DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal bond prices fell amid lingering concern about Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing and rising rates among benchmark government securities, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think people are afraid there will be another Orange County," said 
Paul Hylle, who manages about $1.6 billion in funds at IDS Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 While few issues traded hands, yields on actively traded bonds rose, traders 
said. They were tracking the rise in yields on Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds with Orange County names were priced below comparable bonds issued 
outside the county, traders said, but the difference is getting smaller. And 
Orange County-insured bonds are being priced as much as 30 basis points higher 
than non-insured bonds, after going as much as 40 basis points higher last 
week, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 General obligation municipal bonds maturing in 20 years and rated AA are 
yielding 6.72%, or 85% of similar Treasury bonds.

 Maybe it's end-of-the-millennium jitters. In the shadow of the year 2000, we 
have an urge to look back, sum up, compare. Recent books such as "The Alienist" 
by Caleb Carr or E.L. Doctorow's "The Waterworks" remind us that decades ago, 
no sensible New Yorker would walk into Central Park after dark. We're 
reassured, in a peculiar sort of way, that violent death in the city isn't 
unique to our half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while reading that someone's throat has been cut is horrible in 1994, a 
throat cut in 1903 or 1923 can be interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest example of Manhattan murder in sepia comes from William Hjortsberg, 
whose earlier novel, "Falling Angel," was made into the movie "Angel Heart." In 
"Ragtime" fashion, Hjortsberg's "Nevermore" follows the real-life magician 
Harry Houdini and the real-life author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle through several 
months in 1923, as they set their minds to the problem of finding a serial 
murderer. The killer has a penchant for Poe settings -- a body stuffed up a 
chimney a la "Rue Morgue," a cat walled up with a corpse, an attempted burial 
alive in a wine cellar -- thus, the title, referring to the one-note bird in 
"The Raven." 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Arthur is in the States promoting spiritualism, his post-Sherlock 
obsession. He believes that mediums can speak to those who have died and 
derives comfort from apparent communication with his own beloved mother, who 
reassures him that everything's fine back of beyond. Hjortsberg's subplot 
involves friction in the Houdini-Doyle friendship. The magician thinks mediums, 
seances and Ouija boards are all fraudulent -- that their apparent marvels can 
be explained as gags of one kind or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Hjortsberg's forte is describing the gags or tricks behind Houdini's 
performances. The silk packet, for instance, a literal gag, "smaller than half 
a stick of gum," hidden between the magician's cheek and lower jaw. He loves 
describing Houdini's yogic control, the ability to control his breath and heart 
rate, allowing him to survive in and escape from water-filled milk cans, sunken 
coffins or the carcass of a giant squid. 
</P>
<P>
 One muscular trick -- the truly weird ability to slide that silk packet of 
needles and thread halfway down his esophagus -- brings out the best in 
Hjortsberg's writing: "The needles and thread remained clenched in his throat. 
He plucked at the end of his tongue, pulling a single thread from his mouth. 
Threaded needles dangled every inch or so, a lethal silver fringe glittering in 
the spotlight. Houdini's arm extended full length, prompting wild applause from 
the astonished audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Hjortsberg takes an obvious delight in historical detail -- New York 
real estate, fashion designers of the '20s, cars (Jordan Playboy, Apperson 
Eight), the newspaper columns of Damon Runyon. Hjortsberg is a man who has had 
a lot of fun reading microfilm.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it works, as in one lyrical passage in which a young woman we know 
to be doomed takes a bus down Fifth Avenue and then walks home through 
Greenwich Village, listening to a little boy on the bus, watching the children 
in Washington Square, smelling the bread outside a Sicilian bakery.  
</P>
<P>
 (For really bittersweet nostalgia there's this: On a visit to Hollywood, Sir 
Arthur's children ride out to the beach at Santa Monica every afternoon on the 
Red Line trolley.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the two famous historical men, "Nevermore" features one fictional 
woman: Opal, a simple farm girl who announced at 15 that she was the 
reincarnation of Isis, the ancient Egyptian fertility goddess. 
</P>
<P>
 As is every simple farm girl's dream, she married a 63-year-old textile tycoon 
with a bum ticker; now she lives alone in a Fifth Avenue chateau. Opal starts 
out in the Aimee Semple McPherson mode, but as the story progresses turns into 
someone you might have met at Big Sur in 1971, complete with massage oil, an 
ankh on her stationery, Kama Sutra isometrics and gestalt therapy ("Let all the 
poison and fear flow out."). An encounter with her leads both Hjortsberg and 
Houdini to lose their good sense, culminating in the following purple sentence: 
"A lifetime of puritanical self-control left the magician unfamiliar with the 
labyrinthine delight of depravity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevermore" trembles on the brink of some interesting observations about the 
nature of celebrity, the need to believe in the afterlife, and the line between 
miracles and well-done fakery. But Hjortsberg resists the temptation to delve 
into the profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for one intriguing observation that pops up apropos of nothing in 
particular. Damon Runyon, in his cameo appearance, recalls his friend and 
colleague Bat Masterson, who, after riding with Wyatt Earp, became a 
sportswriter for the New York Morning Telegraph. According to Runyon, the last 
words Masterson typed late one night in an empty newsroom (before he keeled 
over) were: "In this life we all get an equal share of ice. The rich get it in 
the summer and the poor get it in the winter."

NATIONAL AGENDA; MULLAHS LOSING GRIP IN IRAN; PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI'S FAILURE TO 
CREATE A UTOPIA THREATENS HIS POLITICAL FUTURE AS WELL AS THE POWER OF THE 
CLERGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ever since he emerged in the mid-1980s as the real power behind the Islamic 
Republic, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani has been known among diplomats in Tehran 
as the "Teflon mullah." 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's shrewdest politician, he secretly swapped arms for hostages with the 
United States, confessed -- and survived. He overhauled the economy, even 
reviving Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's banned stock market -- and then got other 
mullahs to invest. And when he wanted to run for president, the constitution 
was conveniently rewritten to abolish the premiership and create an executive 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 But today the Iranian president -- not unlike Bill Clinton -- is captain of a 
storm-tossed boat, facing an upstart, conservative Parliament and fighting for 
his political life. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Rafsanjani goes, so go the direction and pace of change in the Islamic 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rafsanjani era has not ushered in the dawn of progress, as many 
anticipated," said a Western diplomat in Tehran. "In the past, he has 
brilliantly manipulated the system to achieve his ends. But now it appears to 
be manipulating him." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Rafsanjani's problem is timing. Plummeting oil prices have created 
havoc with the regime's budget and its five-year plan to rebuild the economy 
after the crippling 1980-88 war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafsanjani promised too much," Hadi Semati, an analyst at Tehran's Center for 
Scientific Research and Middle East Strategic Studies, said in his downtown 
office. "People were ready to accept troubles after eight years of war with 
Iraq, but he made a lot of promises and undertook grandiose projects. Then he 
couldn't deliver. And things have instead gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafsanjani's plight represents, on a wider scale, the declining status of 
Iran's clergy. Once widely visible on Tehran's streets, the mullahs are now in 
retreat as public opinion turns hostile. The Iranian Revolution is turning on 
its priests. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Tehran wedding, the master of ceremonies did a 20-minute routine 
ridiculing the clergy -- in the presence of a table full of mullahs. Taxis in 
the Iranian capital often pass them by, cabbies sometimes even running their 
fingers across their throats to signal their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's only theocracy may have given vast new powers to the clergy, but 
their failure to create a utopia has made them vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clergy were once just interpreters of God's word," said the Western 
diplomat. "Now they have to account for the state's acts -- which has turned 
out to be tougher. Politics has tainted them." 
</P>
<P>
 The most damning and daring public criticism of the clergy was issued in 
September by a former general, Azizollah Amir Rahimi, in a letter published in 
Europe and circulated privately in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Iran was on the verge of imploding, he noted: "The clerics who 
have ruled the country for years are responsible for this misery. . . . The 
only way to save the country is through deep changes in the way the country is 
run. And if Rafsanjani is not capable of doing this, he should concede to a 
national salvation government." 
</P>
<P>
 The former general called on the government to release political prisoners, 
allow free elections with no examination of candidates by clerical bodies, 
reinstate military officers purged since the 1979 revolution and end the 
"regime of censorship, denunciation and the rule of the mullahs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rahimi, who headed the military police after the revolution, is known in 
Tehran as a bit of a gadfly who has written letters to the government since the 
shah's era. But this letter resonated throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime was quick to move. Rahimi, who is in his mid-70s, and his son were 
both detained. The government charged that the general was an opium addict and 
incompetent to stand trial for slander. 
</P>
<P>
 But his was not a lone voice. This fall, 134 prominent Iranian writers, 
publishers and translators issued an open letter appealing for an end to 
censorship and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our basic natural, social and civil right that our written work . . . 
reaches our audiences without any interference and impediment," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter evoked sharp criticism from Tehran's press, even though the 
contents were never published inside Iran. Several of the signers told The 
Times that they had received threatening calls or pressure to withdraw their 
names. Ten did. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ominous signal of official displeasure, Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani, a 
leading dissident, died in detention in November, eight months after he was 
charged with espionage and drug abuse. Officials said Sirjani died of a heart 
attack, although family members said he had no history of heart or drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirjani was a best-selling writer of Iranian history and folklore and was a 
guest lecturer at Columbia University in the 1980s. An outspoken activist 
against censorship who also wrote letters to officials, Sirjani saw his books 
banned in 1991 after he wrote about Iran's pre-Islamic history and that era's 
respect for human rights -- an indirect rebuke of the practices of Iran's 
theocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafsanjani supporters contend that the president, whose Cheshire Cat smile has 
made him seem more accessible than many stern-faced mullahs, is largely a 
victim of the open discourse that his rule introduced and tolerated. Critics 
claim that the regime should be held accountable. Either way, Rafsanjani 
appears to have lost his veneer of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession to conservatives, many of his reforms this year have been 
scrapped or put on hold indefinitely, while key loyalists, including a UC 
Berkeley-educated brother, have lost their jobs or been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrutiny by Tehran's often feisty press also has turned nasty. After a 
Rafsanjani sermon at Friday prayers last month, Jahan Islam, a Tehran 
publication, reported that the speech "provided a pretext for misleading and 
rabble-rousing propaganda" and was full of "polemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jahan Islam did not name Rafsanjani, there was no doubt about the 
target of its subsequent criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know," it said, "is that those who have parted company with the people 
and who are giving, in appearance, slogans in support of the deprived and 
downtrodden actually live in very expensive houses, ride the latest makes of 
cars, have villas, orchards and palaces around Tehran, are involved in almost 
every economic activity and have import-export companies at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 A former student of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Rafsanjani has impeccable 
revolutionary credentials, including multiple stints in the jails of the late 
shah. 
</P>
<P>
 But since coming to power, the son of a pistachio merchant has moved, as have 
his grown children, to wealthy north Tehran. His sons, at least one educated in 
Europe, are thriving businessmen. A daughter chairs the women's Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The family pistachio business, run by another brother, is now heavily into 
exports. And the Tehran grapevine contends that one son is the largest importer 
of lucrative satellite dishes, although he officially denies it to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafsanjani was first elected with 95% of the vote just a month after 
Khomeini's death in 1989 and, facing only token opposition, was reelected last 
year in a lackluster turnout for his second and, according to Iran's 
constitution, final term. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his reelection, Rafsanjani's main political challenge has come from the 
man he replaced: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was chosen by the Council of 
Experts to succeed Khomeini as Iran's spiritual guide, a lifetime post, in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the two men worked together at critical junctures, Rafsanjani as 
parliamentary speaker and Khamenei as titular president. 
</P>
<P>
 Khamenei was often seen as riding on the more charismatic Rafsanjani's 
coattails. But their current jobs often put them at odds. 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry has played out most visibly over economic policy. Rafsanjani, a 
free-market mullah, pushed private ownership of business, subsidy cutbacks and 
debt repayment to get the economy back on track. He placed Western-educated 
technocrats in top jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Khamenei pressed for "social justice" and stronger state intervention in 
the face of hardships. To build his own power base -- in part because his 
religious credentials are widely viewed as insufficient for the job -- Khamenei 
has allied himself with religious conservatives and hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 "As president, Khamenei was more open-minded," said a leading political 
scientist in Tehran. "But his role and constituency changed, and he is now more 
conservative. Old allies have increasingly become new rivals." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim of a tape recorder bomb that cost him the use of one arm, Khamenei 
is also now jockeying for position to lead the entire Shiite Muslim world after 
the death last month of Grand Ayatollah Ali Araki, who was more than 100 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Just Wednesday, the Islamic preempted the normal procedure by declaring 
Khamenei to be the marja ala , or supreme head, of the world 100 million Shiite 
Muslims, a move that could be rejected by Shiites elsewhere. The dispute could 
lead to a split within the Shiite world. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Rafsanjani -- once nicknamed "Akbar Shah," an allusion to his 
king-like powers -- is now a lame duck with an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tehran's ever-churning rumor mill contends that he has even tried to resign 
three times over the past year, a report that he denied at a news conference 
this summer when he pledged to "serve the system" for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent proposal to allow him a third presidential term, which would 
require a constitutional amendment, has been sharply and widely attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit of such an action -- moving in the direction of establishing a 
permanent presidency -- is disagreeable and reproachable, for it lays the 
foundations for an authoritarian and autocratic government," warned Gozaresh 
Hafteh, a Tehran paper. "Our country is not North Korea, Syria or Libya to have 
a lifelong president." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Rafsanjani, however, many diplomats in Tehran think that the chances 
of significant change in the regime are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 And without change, Iran faces a hard future. "He's the only one who has the 
power and the personality," said an Asian diplomat in Tehran. "If he can't pull 
off economic and political change, no one can." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of Iran without Rafsanjani, who was the major influence in the 
day-to-day running of government even during Khomeini's life, already has led 
to speculation about who is next. The majority of possible successors are more 
conservative than the current Iranian leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections are not scheduled until 1997. But the scuttlebutt in Tehran 
currently favors the man who inherited Rafsanjani's last job: Speaker of 
Parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, a cleric and former Interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Nateq-Nuri has been stumping the country as if on a campaign. Pressed by 
Kayhan, a Tehran newspaper, last month, he barely concealed his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "These trips are just part of my responsibility. If one day I am to serve at 
another post, I will take it on, just as I have never failed so far to take on 
any responsibility," he told Kayhan. "I believe I am capable of handling that 
job too." 
</P>
<P>
 While on the same tour, he also effectively nixed a third term for Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the constitution is to be altered so easily, then it will lose its legal 
credibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with Rafsanjani, who prefers an open foreign policy, free markets and 
a middle-of-the-road political course, Nateq-Nuri is widely viewed as a social 
conservative and a religious ideologue with strong anti-Western views. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other possible candidates are long-serving Foreign Minister Ali 
Akbar Velayati, who has weathered several policy storms in an attempt to keep 
Tehran's door open to both East and West, and Deputy Speaker of Parliament 
Hasan Rouhani, chairman of the foreign affairs committee and a member of the 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet diplomats caution against writing Rafsanjani off as long as the clerics 
retain power. 
</P>
<P>
 Still believed to have the widest following of any mullah, he is unlikely to 
cede his influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as criticism of constitutional change was coming in, the English-language 
Iran News -- which first floated the idea of a third term in an interview with 
one of Rafsanjani's vice presidents -- planted the idea of his return after an 
interval: 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitution clearly states that, after two terms of presidency, one must 
step down and stand aside, that is, for only one intervening term, and after 
that, one could be nominated again. The good thing about his interval is that 
one will have a refreshing opportunity to study . . . the working of government 
in the past and the present." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, experts on Iran contend that even that option would require a 
constitutional change.

NEXT STEP; POST-COLD WAR IDENTITY CRISIS LOCKS SANDINISTAS IN BITTER POWER 
STRUGGLE; FEUD'S LATEST VICTIM IS NEWSPAPER EDITOR FIRED FOR PUBLICATION'S 
IMPARTIAL TACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day he was fired after more than a decade as editor of Barricada, the 
newspaper of Nicaragua's Sandinista movement, Carlos Fernando Chamorro packed 
up a portrait of his crusading-newsman father and a statue of the revolution's 
hero and namesake, Augusto Cesar Sandino. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousted by hard-line Sandinistas in October, the 38-year-old scion of one of 
Nicaragua's most storied families stood in the newsroom and said an emotional 
goodby to friends, colleagues and a political vision. In the days that 
followed, most of Barricada's veteran reporters were purged, and the paper, 
which had evolved into Nicaragua's most professional, was thrown into 
journalistic anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an act of extreme political intolerance," Chamorro said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro and Barricada are the latest casualties in a divisive Sandinista 
identity crisis. Fifteen years after they came to power in an armed revolution, 
and as they begin to plot their return to power, Nicaragua's Sandinistas -- 
arguably the single most powerful political and social influence in recent 
national history -- are locked in a bitter struggle that threatens to split the 
movement forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinista crisis mirrors the internal battles of the left throughout 
Latin America, where onetime guerrilla armies have moved into civilian politics 
but must redefine their roles, direction and goals in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the Sandinista rupture are moderate party reformers such as 
Chamorro and Sergio Ramirez, vice president during the 1979-90 Sandinista rule. 
They want to modernize the party and move it closer to the center to attract a 
wider following. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side is the traditional core leadership, including stalwarts such 
as former President Daniel Ortega. They speak of defending the achievements of 
the Sandinista revolution, but their real commitment to democracy and 
nonviolent protest has been called into question. 
</P>
<P>
 The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN, which maintained 
formidable unity during its war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels throughout the 
1980s, has been torn by internal debate ever since its stunning loss to a 
center-right coalition in 1990 elections that delivered the presidency to 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, mother of Barricada's ousted editor. 
</P>
<P>
 But never before have the disputes been so public and so acrimonious as now, 
with the Barricada episode as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the debate: What does it mean to be a Sandinista today? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Ortega faction -- which by all accounts still commands most of 
the party apparatus and grass-roots following -- say the leadership is charting 
a path of self-destruction. Many of the party's best-known intellectuals are 
being driven out or have opted to leave as the quarrels feed widespread 
disillusionment with politics in general in a country still recovering from a 
decade of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting what critics see as their authoritarian tendencies, Ortega and the 
rest of the hard-liners have sought to stifle moderate voices in recent weeks: 
taking Barricada from Chamorro; ousting Ramirez from his seat in the National 
Assembly, where he led the Sandinista legislative delegation, and stacking 
internal leadership posts with their own supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Cardenal, the famous poet and priest who served as culture minister in 
the Sandinista government, accused Ortega of hijacking the FSLN and, in a 
dramatic gesture, renounced his party membership. "This," he said, "is not the 
Sandinista front that we fought for, that so many martyrs died for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinistas started out as a motley army of young rebels who fought and, 
in 1979, finally toppled the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship. The 
victorious, Soviet-backed Sandinista government drew fire from Ronald Reagan 
Administration officials, who launched an insurgency by supplying arms to 
former members of ousted President Anastasio Somoza Debayle's National Guard 
and thousands of disaffected peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contra war of the 1980s claimed about 30,000 lives and ended with Ortega's 
electoral loss to Violeta Chamorro in 1990. Support for the Sandinistas eroded 
further in the waning days of their government as officials and militants made 
off with the titles to hundreds of properties, houses, businesses and goods. 
The pinata , as the seizures became known, was followed by reports of other 
ways in which the Sandinista commandantes had become rich while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while Ramirez and his moderates portray themselves as true proponents of 
a democratic system based on law and justice, Ortega and his faction claim to 
be the protectors of the poor from the current government's free-market 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line faction maintains that it is the authentic nucleus of Sandinista 
ideology. Many of the diverse groups that joined the FSLN to oust Somoza were 
not committed to social revolution, this faction argues, and it is natural that 
they gradually leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega and others accuse the moderates of trying to dilute the socialist 
legacy left by the Sandinista regime. Specifically, the hard-liners mention the 
moderates' enactment of laws that would return most confiscated property to 
original owners. Meanwhile, the moderates also insist on the disavowal of 
violence as a political tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the moderates) think that, to be a viable political (force), you have 
to 'de-Sandinistacize' the party as quickly as possible," said Rene Vivas, the 
former Sandinista police chief who was recently elected to the National 
Directorate, which oversees the FSLN. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can call themselves whatever they want," he said, "but if we see (them) 
dismantling the social gains of the revolution . . . then that is a new type of 
Sandinismo that has nothing to do with our Sandinismo." 
</P>
<P>
 But others argue that the hard-left Ortega approach is outdated and will only 
further isolate the FSLN, reducing it to a hard-core, faithful -- but small -- 
number of Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent sign-up campaign, the FSLN registered almost 340,000 members, 
making it the largest party in the country. But the number represents only 16% 
of Nicaragua's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The front could become a ghost ship, with the same loyal crew but without any 
passengers," said Silvio Prado, a Sandinista political analyst and dissident 
who is critical of both sides. "People are beginning to understand the 
difference between the Sandinista front and Sandinismo. . . . What could die is 
the front, not Sandinismo, which is a tradition, a way of seeing the world and 
of organizing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinista crisis is intensified by presidential politics as the jockeying 
begins for the 1996 national elections. It is no secret that both Ortega and 
Ramirez have designs on the presidency, which under a new set of constitutional 
reforms requires a candidate to receive more than 45% of the vote to avoid a 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega and Ramirez are men of completely different styles. Even as they 
governed as president and vice president through most of the past decade, 
Ortega was the fiery revolutionary, Ramirez the learned novelist lending 
international credibility to a movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has the conflict that engulfs Sandinismo been more visible than at 
Barricada. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousted editor Chamorro and other leading Sandinistas founded the newspaper in 
1979 as the official party mouthpiece, a role that it fulfilled throughout the 
Contra war. But after the 1990 Sandinista loss at the polls, Chamorro changed 
the paper into a more professional, pluralistic publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro's family has been at the center of the political intrigue that has 
marked modern Nicaraguan history. His mother is the country's president, and 
the 1978 murder of his father, publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who ran the 
newspaper La Prensa, helped galvanize the forces opposed to dictator Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was divided during the 1980s into pro- and anti-Sandinista camps. 
Carlos' sister Cristina runs La Prensa, now a conservative paper and often shut 
down by the Sandinistas when they were in power. His uncle Xavier Chamorro 
publishes the vaguely pro-Sandinista Nuevo Diario. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where most newspapers and radio and television stations follow a 
strident political line, Barricada, remarkably, evolved into a balanced 
journalistic outlet. Even U.S. diplomats, once sharp opponents of the 
Sandinistas, said Barricada gave them the fairest treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ortega and the hard-liners decided they wanted back a vehicle for the 
party line, and they knew Carlos Chamorro would not go along with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party did not need an impartial newspaper," said Victor Hugo Tinoco of 
the National Directorate. "It needed a newspaper that reflected its point of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Borge, the former Interior minister and lone surviving founder of the 
FSLN, appeared at Chamorro's office one morning in October and read out the 
letter of dismissal. By the end of October, 17 reporters -- almost the entire 
staff -- had quit or been fired. But that came only after the reporters and 
Borge argued day and night over headlines and stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite longstanding personal animosities between them, Borge and Ortega 
became allies in this fight. The new Barricada suddenly began to publish harsh 
editorials -- on its front page -- against the moderate Ramirez, and coverage 
of the National Assembly's debate of constitutional reforms, most of which 
Ortega opposes, was decidedly one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro and the others, who had guided Barricada from the clandestine 
underground to a respected paper, felt betrayed by the men they once revered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began work at this paper, many as young people, with a project in mind. We 
designed it, carried it forward, defended it," said Sofia Montenegro, who quit 
as editor of Barricada's weekly supplement, Gente. "Everything we achieved in 
the last four years fell apart in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Montenegro and the other journalists have begun legal proceedings against 
Borge. When he appeared in court early last month to respond, the scene that 
unfolded would have been unimaginable just a short time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liar! Liar!" several of the out-of-work Sandinista reporters shouted at Borge 
as he left the courtroom. One challenged him on the wealth he has allegedly 
secreted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "How dare you make such accusations!" a tense, grim-faced Borge retorted. The 
man who had once been as feared in some quarters as he was worshiped in others 
left quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Montenegro said the goal that she and other dissident Sandinistas now share is 
to demystify the legendary Sandinista figures like Borge. "It is the best favor 
we can do for Sandinismo," she said, "and for the country."

THE WEEK AHEAD: OURO PRETO; MERCOSUR CHIEFS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay will gather Friday 
in the Brazilian city of Ouro Preto to put the finishing touches on their 
southern Common Market, the so-called Mercosur.Duty-free trade among the four 
Mercosur countries is scheduled to begin Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercosur has its origins in an economic integration agreement signed by Brazil 
and Argentina in 1988. In 1990, Paraguay and Uruguay joined the group, which 
has reduced tariffs by stages. It is the only South American economic bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade among the four partners has grown from $2 billion in 1988 to more than 
$10 billion in 1993. They have a total population of nearly 200 million and a 
combined gross domestic product of $415 billion.

THE ENVIRONMENT; COST CONCERNS GET RUSSIA RECYCLING; THOUGH THE MOTIVE IS MORE 
FINANCIAL THAN ECOLOGICAL, MUSCOVITES ARE REUSING DISCARDS SUCH AS PAPER, SCRAP 
METAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eco-marketing means little to Mikhail Ostreyov. A veteran Soviet papermaker, 
Ostreyov suspects that pushing a product as "environmentally friendly" isn't 
the way to make money in the Russian market, where price is everything and 
ecological correctness counts for little. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does believe that recycled paper may be profitable in Russia simply 
because it is cheaper to produce. Old paper, he says, sells for half the price 
of raw papermaking materials. 
</P>
<P>
 His new papermaking company, Khimlesprom, recently began experimenting with 
Russia's first office paper recycling project. The idea came from Ecologia, an 
East European-American nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecologia sponsored a study showing that such a project could make money in 
Moscow. When Oleg Cherp, Ecologia's program director in the former Soviet 
Union, approached Ostreyov with the idea, the papermaker wasn't convinced. But 
now he is willing to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the money we earn from different types of work we do, then 
currently recycling brings in very little," Ostreyov said. "But I feel that in 
the near future it will make economic sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostreyov's rule of thumb is a reliable guide for the small but growing number 
of environmental groups trying to promote recycling in Russia's emerging market 
economy: If it won't turn a profit or at least pay for itself, don't even think 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Soviet Union was one of the world's worst eco-offenders, it had a 
system for recycling and reusing the few consumer goods it produced. In some 
years, one could not get a full vodka bottle without turning in an empty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverage bottles were washed and reused, comrades exchanged used paper for 
coupons with which they could get hard-to-find books. Communist Young Pioneers 
collected scrap metal to make train cars.  
</P>
<P>
 With the market economy came an onslaught of imported goods packaged in 
plastics, laminated paper, aluminum cans and glass bottles in Western shapes 
and sizes that cannot be reprocessed here. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists say, the old collection system broke down, and 
the old rewards don't interest people anymore. There is no shortage of books 
now, and the Young Pioneers have disbanded.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Russia today is awash in garbage. Moscow alone will produce about 
18 million tons of domestic waste this year, according to the capital's 
regional waste management department. Almost all of that garbage just gets 
dumped -- along streets and in empty lots as well as in municipal dumps outside 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If office paper recycling proves profitable, at least some of the new garbage 
will not wind up in the dumps. Cherp sees the venture as a way to close the 
recycling loop -- a challenge met neither by the Soviets nor by many 
Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 "An environmentalist probably wouldn't call (the Soviet system) recycling, 
because they didn't produce paper from paper. They produced cardboard and some 
building materials and very low-quality wrapping paper," he said. "They didn't 
have the facilities to do good-quality paper from recycled paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Khimlesprom is one of the few companies in the former Soviet Union that can 
produce high-quality paper from post-consumer scrap. Ostreyov says he can 
recycle office paper up to seven times, and oversaw a test run for Ecologia at 
a factory north of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project is still in the experimental stage. Cherp found a commercial 
hauler to collect and store scrap paper, contract out the recycling into office 
paper and sell it back to organizations recruited by Ecologia. So far, more 
than 1 1/2 tons of waste have been collected. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough offices buy the recycled paper in bulk, the project will become 
commercially viable and Ecologia will pull out, leaving office paper recycling 
to expand or contract with the market.. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper donors so far are Russian environmental organizations and Western 
offices, including the U.S. Embassy. Ecologia started with organizations 
already in the habit of sorting and whose employees may welcome environmentally 
friendly products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately or unfortunately, Russian businessmen copy a lot of things from 
the West, and they try to have a very good image among Western partners," Cherp 
says. "So I think they would copy this attitude to recycled products."  
</P>
<P>
 But the whims of the market often interfere. This fall, for example, 
Khimlesprom interrupted the recycling project for a more profitable one -- 
producing paper for textbooks for the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new, small-scale recycling projects in Russia are finding that the 
economics of recycling are as important as the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in a village in Bashkortostan, in the Urals, wanted to collect glass 
and paper to keep them from ending up in dumps in their streets and a nearby 
swamp. But local authorities couldn't help pay to haul the stuff to a 
processing plant a few hours' drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they have too many other things to do," said Marina Laskina, a 
former teacher there. 
</P>
<P>
 Laskina got a start-up grant from the Institute of Soviet-American Relations, 
a U.S. nonprofit organization, and many of the village families agreed to pay 
3,000 rubles (just under a dollar) per person per year for pickups that started 
in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 But that money in addition to what the plant pays for the glass and paper is 
not enough to cover the students' transport costs, and Laskina acknowledges 
that the project may be in trouble when the grant money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kazan, an industrial city on the upper Volga, a recycling club of youths 
known as "Ants" has solved the economic question by picking up scrap metal, 
which is valuable and plentiful in Russia. The club can easily make $1,000 per 
week selling it to factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are throwing money on the street," said club leader Alexander 
Dorofeyev. "It used to be all communal property. But now they're beginning to 
realize they can't just toss it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorofeyev has secured contracts with two large factories that want all the 
metal the Ants can collect. He doesn't reap the profits. They are used to 
maintain the club's truck, finance environmental expeditions and pay the kids 
who gather the scrap. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a dozen adolescents collect scrap each day in the winter, quadruple 
that number in the summer, says Dorofeyev, who organized the club to keep the 
streets clean not only of trash but of idle kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a strong mafia in Kazan," he said. "This gives structure to 12- or 
14-year-old kids with alcoholic fathers, or no fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling projects that do not break even won't fly in Russia -- including 
some that might be workable in a less confusing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 When environmentalists with Earth Day Russia learned that the country had no 
technology to recycle aluminum cans, they tried to send them back to Western 
Europe where they came from. But export tariffs on metals made it too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum cans are one of the most abundant pieces of trash in the new Russia. 
Once so unusual that they were displayed in Russian living rooms as decoration, 
beer and pop cans now litter city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 While few local or regional governments in Russia have any money to start 
recycling projects, some remain from the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Experimental Factory of Mechanized Household Waste in St. Petersburg, 
which turns about 900,000 cubic meters of garbage per year into compost, is the 
only state-sponsored facility of its kind in the country. The compost is sold 
to farms, but sales don't nearly cover costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentally sound habits survive from the Soviet era too. One is the 
tradition of bringing your own bag to the market. Sturdy plastic bags cost 10 
to 15 cents in most shops, although they are free at a few Western-style 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Russians wash and reuse their plastic bags until they are full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Soviet-built bottle-washing sites cannot handle imports, people can 
still get a few rubles for turning in Russian-made beer, vodka or wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Russia's new poor spend their days at garbage dumps, scavenging for 
these treasures. More on Ecology

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: CABLEVISION TO DISTRIBUTE 2 TURNER PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turner Educational Services' "CNN Newsroom" and a new Turner series, 
"Adventure Learning," will be included in the interactive programming that will 
be offered by Ventura County Cablevision, the cable firm and its partners have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was announced by New York-based ACTV Inc., an interactive TV software 
producer and key mover in the "L. A. Project." The project is planned to 
provide interactive sports and educational programming as well as advertising 
to viewers in Ventura County and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turner unit will supply the project's educational programming, and Prime 
Ticket Network will provide sports coverage. The partners will survey consumers 
and schools to determine pricing, programming and marketing strategies for the 
regional network, which they hope to launch in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is extremely important for our industry to recognize the importance of 
education in the development of interactive programming," said Gary R. Rowe, 
Turner's senior vice president. "ACTV provides us with a meaningful way to find 
out how teachers can use television more effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce J. Crowley, ACTV's president of distance learning, said: "The cable 
industry has done an excellent job providing educational programming to 
students in over 64,000 schools. Our goal is to improve the educational 
experience for students through personalized television." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his company's interactive learning programs can be carried on existing 
cable and satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ACTV technology was introduced in May, students in Washington 
responded to questions posed by a teacher in Denver. The system enables 
students to communicate with their teacher by means of headsets, key pads and a 
TV set. It's estimated that a classroom system for 20 students will sell for 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Educational Services, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., says 
it distributes "CNN Newsroom" to more than 29,000 U. S. schools. The Adventure 
Learning series will explore nature, science and history through live telecasts 
and other programming.

 Compaq Computer Corp. has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Westlake 
Village-based Packard Bell Electronics Inc., charging that Packard Bell 
willfully infringed upon three patents used in producing Compaq's desktop and 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell denied the charges and said it will defend itself against the 
action, filed late last month in U. S. District Court in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The patents cited in the suit are involved with power functions and video 
display systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Compaq is one of the world's largest producers of personal 
computers. Packard Bell, which has announced that it plans to move to the 
Sacramento area, has emerged as one of the biggest players in the highly 
competitive consumer PC market. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Mal Ransom, Packard Bell's vice president for marketing, said 
the firm "believes that Compaq has no basis for its lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Packard Bell stands behind all of its products and rights, and intends to 
defend the company vigorously against what we consider groundless claims," he 
said.

 Siemens Solar Industries, based in Camarillo, has won an award given annually 
by a state agency to recognize outstanding waste-reduction efforts by 
California businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Integrated Waste Management Board presented Siemens with its 
Waste Reduction Award, citing the company's efforts in waste prevention, 
recycling and procurement of recycled products. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency encourages firms to reduce waste and the amount of material sent to 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens estimates that it has cut its waste production by 50% as a result of 
an integrated, companywide program. The company recycles such office waste as 
paper and glass and also recycles production wastes, including silicon used in 
making its solar cells. The recycled silicon is used in aluminum production. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to receiving state recognition, the Siemens waste program has been 
honored twice by the city of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens, the world's largest supplier of solar cells and modules, exports more 
than 70% of its products to customers worldwide. It is part of the Siemens 
Solar Group, which also has units in Germany, Japan and Singapore.

A SECOND CHANCE; IN BELARUS, BABY WAS EXPECTED TO DIE; U.S. DOCTORS, OTHERS 
OFFER SERVICES TO SAVE HER

 Elen Kuchuk stood beside her 3-month-old daughter in the neonatal intensive 
care unit, gently caressing the infant's tiny fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchuk, 23, a resident of Belarus, once part of the Soviet Union, is hoping 
for a chance at life for her daughter, Xenia, who suffers from a rare 
intestinal condition. She says it's a miracle that her daughter is being 
treated in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchuk, her daughter and Xenia's physician arrived in Orange County on 
Saturday after traveling 36 hours to get the baby the medical care she needs to 
save her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in the city of Minsk, the 10-pound, 2-ounce baby had no chance of 
survival, said her physician, Dr. Vadim Ten, a pediatric anesthesiologist and 
chief of the neonatal group at Minsk Surgical Children's Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt the baby would have died," Ten said, explaining that he turned to 
the doctors at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Xenia's treatment is being made possible by a team of doctors who are donating 
their services, including the costs for surgery. The hospital is also waiving 
costs for her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of others have donated services or provided discounts to the family, 
including Lufthansa German Airlines, which flew mother, daughter and doctor to 
the United States; Schaefer Ambulance Service, which transported the baby from 
Los Angeles International Airport to the hospital, and Mead Johnson Corp., 
which makes the special nutritional formula Xenia needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that everybody is willing to donate," said Dr. Richard H. 
Meidell, director of the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit who is leading 
the team of doctors. "Everyone said, 'Absolutely. We'll do what it takes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Curtis, a hospital spokeswoman, said the value of the donated medical 
services is about $100,000. She added that the costs could change, depending on 
the care the baby actually ends up receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope she'll have a good outcome and that we can help her," said Kathy 
Smith, a neonatal intensive care nurse who is among the hospital staff 
attending to Xenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchuk, whose husband, Oleg, works in a tractor factory, also has a 4-year-old 
son. Ten said the mother is overwhelmed and astonished by the whirlwind visit 
to this country -- her first trip abroad -- as well as by the outpouring of 
generosity and concern for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me (it felt like) she fell down from the moon to the Earth," Ten 
said. He added that he is thankful "that a country like this exists in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ten interpreting, Kuchuk said she is hoping that "everything will be OK" 
with her baby. Kuchuk is staying at the Ronald McDonald House in Orange, and 
Ten has been invited to stay at the home of a Huntington Beach family. 
</P>
<P>
 Meidell first learned about the baby's life-threatening condition from Jenny 
Saavedra, 34, of Huntington Beach, a Western Medical Center employee who was in 
Russia performing humanitarian work at Ten's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Saavedra contacted Meidell via fax and told him that the Russian doctors 
wanted advice on how to treat the baby. Meidell didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was decided that bringing the baby here for treatment would increase 
her chances of survival, Meidell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby's a baby -- it doesn't matter where she's from," Meidell said of the 
decision to bring her here. "It's only one world, and we have to start thinking 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby suffers from a form of Hirschprung's disease, which generally affects 
small portions of the colon and can result in bowel obstruction. In the United 
States, Meidell said, one in 5,000 babies is affected with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Meidell said he sees two or three children a year with the intestinal 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Xenia, both her small and large intestines are affected, 
Meidell said. "This is the worst case I've ever seen. This is rare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Xenia, a happy and smiling baby, is being kept alive through intravenous 
feeding, Meidell said. She has already undergone three surgeries in her own 
country and nearly died last month from an infection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important that we determine what parts of the intestine work normally 
and which ones don't," Meidell said. "We will try to save as many of the parts 
that do work and create an intestinal tract so she can absorb enough food so 
she can eat, grow and thrive." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the worst case is if "we can't do anything for her." But he said he is 
optimistic after tests Monday showed that portions of her bowel are working 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel we can do something for her," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meidell said the baby is in good condition and is tentatively scheduled to 
have surgery today. 
</P>
<P>
 Saavedra, who is in Germany recuperating from a heart condition and will come 
home Thursday, said in a telephone interview that she is elated the baby is 
getting treatment here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how I feel," she said. "There is hope. Miracles do happen. 
Her life is 100% better now than (facing) a 100% risk of death. We have a 
special gift this Christmas season -- that's the gift of life."

O.C. STUDENTS MAKE GRADE ON ADVANCED TESTS; EDUCATION: THE RATE AT WHICH 
JUNIORS AND SENIORS IN COUNTY ARE PASSING COLLEGE-LEVEL EXAMS HAS SOARED DURING 
THE PAST DECADE. 
</P>

<P>
 The rate at which Orange County high schoolers succeed in passing the tough 
Advanced Placement tests in classes such as calculus, French literature and 
physics is three times greater than it was 10 years ago, providing evidence -- 
officials say -- that the state's push for schools to offer their top students 
more rigorous instruction is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials are to announce today that the passing rate for 
Orange County juniors and seniors in the tests of college-level knowledge was 
nearly 18%, well above the state average of 11%. Although all but three of the 
county's 15 school districts surpassed the state average, the Irvine and Laguna 
Beach school districts particularly fared well, with rates of 42% and 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've extremely pleased with these results, because Advanced Placement tests 
more closely measure what goes on in the classroom than scholastic tests" like 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test, said Paul M. Possemato, superintendent of the 
Laguna Beach Unified School District. "They're testing subject areas, and this 
shows how well our teachers are doing in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate is the number of examinations with a score of 3 or better on a scale 
of 5 per 100 public high school juniors and seniors. That rate was 3.4 in 1984 
and 10.8 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of every district in Orange County increased over the past decade, 
with Irvine and Laguna Beach showing gains of 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 At University High School in Irvine, 1,023 Advanced Placement exams were 
taken, said Principal Diana Schmelzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received a letter from the college board saying we were ranked eighth in 
the country in terms of the number of AP exams taken," Schmelzer said. "We 
offer really high-quality courses, and we have a community that values 
excellence in education. We've built a tradition of students taking those exams 
and doing very well on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmelzer said the school offers 14 different Advanced Placement courses in 
such subjects as art studies, computer science and European history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason more students are taking the exams is because parents are 
realizing they can save money if their children earn college credits while 
they're still in high school," she said. "Students also know that colleges look 
upon them favorably if they take the hardest classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide also, the scores were three times greater than a decade ago. 
Officials said students of all ethnicities shared in the gains. The rate at 
which African American and Latino students qualify for college credit remains 
far below that of Asian Americans and white students, but is far above what it 
was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying rate for African American students last year was 1.7%, but that 
was more than triple what it was a decade earlier. The rate of Latino students 
more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say the Advanced Placement tests measure only one aspect of school 
district performance. They point out that some districts are too small to offer 
the many specialized classes that prepare students for the tests or that too 
few students are interested in taking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one piece of a whole puzzle . . . but it's not a complete picture by 
itself," said Pat McCabe, an administrator with the state Department of 
Education's research and evaluation division. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite showing gains over the past decade, the rates at the Anaheim Union 
High, Garden Grove Unified and Santa Ana Unified school districts fell well 
below the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased and delighted for those students who took and passed their 
Advanced Placement exams," said Vergil Hettick, director of research and 
evaluation for the Santa Ana school district, which posted a 5% rate. "But 
we're not in a contest with other districts. We're more focused on working with 
individual students and trying to meet their needs." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said school districts offered nearly 6,000 advanced placement 
classes statewide, with an enrollment of nearly 160,000. The most popular 
examinations among California students last year were U.S. history, English 
literature and composition and calculus. High-Scoring Students 
</P>
<P>
 The rate at which California high school juniors and seniors pass various 
Advanced Placement tests to qualify for college credit has tripled in the past 
decade. Here are the changes in Orange County during that time, per 100 high 
school juniors and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Percentage of examinations taken by high school juniors and seniors that 
qualified them for college credit: 03,31,10,13 Class of Change from District 
93-94 83-84 Orange County 17.5% +12.0 Anaheim Union High 9.6 +6.1 Brea-Olinda

SICKOUT PROTESTING PROP. 187 FIZZLES; LABOR: MAJOR EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS SAY 
THEY DID NOT HAVE HIGHER THAN NORMAL REPORTS OF WORKERS STAYING HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A sickout Monday by opponents of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration 
measure approved by state voters last month, failed to produce any measurable 
impact in Orange County, according to a survey of businesses and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Announced two weeks ago by Los Amigos of Orange County, a grass-roots Latino 
organization, the sickout was supposed to have been a showing of the economic 
strength of the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effort seemed to have fizzled as a result of a lack of organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was very well-intentioned, but it wasn't organized in a detailed 
fashion," said Angela Keefe, president of the 5,000-member Hotel Employees and 
Restaurant Employees Union Local 681. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, president of Los Amigos, who was reached at work Monday, said the 
group distributed flyers announcing the sickout. However, he said, Los Amigos 
did not conduct any large media push. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the idea had some merit to build an awareness," David said, but 
"we're cognizant that to do a '187 flu sickout' we would have to make an 
awesome effort to reach people in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, David said, he intended to work only half a day before leaving his 
ceramic tile business to attend church. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, some 200 farm workers in Oxnard who heard about the sickout in 
radio reports walked off their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Laborers from BUD of California, a Dole subsidiary, left their seasonal 
$100-a-day jobs picking and packing celery about 7:30 a.m. to proclaim that 
immigrants -- even illegal immigrants -- contribute to the economy and their 
families deserve public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 were encouraged to call in sick Monday to protest 
the passage of the measure, which seeks to end education, social services and 
non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants. Implementation of the measure, 
however, has been blocked by the courts as a result of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the sickout occurred following the Nov. 19 death of Julio Cano, 
the 12-year-old Anaheim boy whose illegal immigrant parents said they delayed 
seeking medical treatment for their son because they feared the passage of 
Proposition 187 meant hospital officials would report them to immigration 
officials. The boy died of acute leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, major employers such as the county, Disneyland and 
Disneyland Hotel, as well as labor unions, said they did not have higher than 
normal reports of workers calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard of anything like that," a spokeswoman for the carpenters 
union in Orange said. "Contractors have not called to complain. And believe me, 
if we had some problems, they would have called by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members were busily at work at the Santa Ana offices of Hermandad 
Mexicana Nacional, a national immigrants' rights organization. The group's 
director, Nativo Lopez, said it was his understanding the sickout was directed 
toward private industry and not "necessarily service organizations" like his. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of Orange County's voters approved the proposition in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 David said that Los Amigos intends to schedule another sickout in Southern 
California, tentatively scheduled for May 1.

EMBATTLED REFUGE; QUAKE: VETERANS PROTEST THE UPCOMING CLOSURE OF THE DAMAGED 
SEPULVEDA VA HOSPITAL. SOME OF ITS PROGRAMS ARE MOVING TO THE WEST L.A. CENTER, 
WHICH THEY SAY IS TOO FAR AWAY AND OFFERS LESSER CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before the Northridge earthquake gravely damaged it, the stately Sepulveda 
Veterans Administration Medical Center had an unusual reputation among many 
local veterans: They liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many VA facilities are held in low esteem by veterans. But Sepulveda -- with 
its serene, park-like grounds, committed staff and respected rehabilitation 
programs -- was viewed as a caring refuge for those bearing the physical and 
mental scars of service in America's military. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a safe place for me," said Dan Tinder, 45, a Vietnam veteran from 
Reseda who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. "When things got really 
bad, I had my psychiatric unit to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the quake wreaked tens of millions of dollars in damage on the 
39-year-old, red brick federal medical complex, VA officials have made sweeping 
changes that have left Tinder and other veterans fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor wrecked Sepulveda's 431-bed hospital and knocked out heat and 
water supplies in the rest of the 51-building complex. More than 300 patients, 
many of them elderly and infirm, were hurriedly evacuated to several other VA 
facilities in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, citing the high costs of rebuilding the Sepulveda hospital, U.S. 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown announced that it would be torn down 
and replaced by a $65-million ambulatory care center offering no long-term beds 
but a range of outpatient services. The structure is scheduled to open in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sepulveda's inpatient substance-abuse and psychiatric programs have 
been transferred to the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center in Brentwood, 15 
miles away over the congestion-prone San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes at Sepulveda coincide with a drive by the VA -- the nation's 
largest health care system -- to convert from high-cost, hospital-based 
treatment to outpatient care. VA officials contend that the switch will allow 
more veterans to get treatment at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But many San Fernando Valley-area veterans are angry about the Sepulveda 
changes. They say the elimination of its emergency room could jeopardize 
veterans' lives. And they complain that West Los Angeles offers lower-quality 
care, is hard to get to and treats them like ciphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the vets said the hardest battle we'll ever fight is against our own 
government," said Ryan Smith, a 24-year-old Marine veteran from Toluca Lake who 
participated in a street-corner protest by veterans outside Sepulveda last 
week. "That is so true." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, Sepulveda has dramatically downsized its staff, 
dropping to 1,123 employees from a pre-quake level of 1,855. About 360 
employees were permanently reassigned to West Los Angeles; nearly 400 others 
retired, took buyouts or transferred to other VA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With its operating rooms shattered and its brick walls cracked, Sepulveda's 
still-standing hospital, Building 3, remains the most visible symbol of the 
quake's destructiveness. But damage is apparent throughout the sprawling 
medical center, clustered atop a low hill and flanked by long, rolling lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda's Olympic-sized pool -- once used for physical rehabilitation -- 
remains closed to veterans. Half of its gymnasium is occupied by displaced 
medical records, reducing volleyball and basketball games to half-court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown said Sepulveda's 120-bed nursing home would reopen by mid-May, 
elderly residents were not moved back in until just after Thanksgiving, their 
return delayed in part by unreliable utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials insist the planned ambulatory care center will be a 
state-of-the-art facility, providing cardiology, neurology, rehabilitative care 
and other services, as well as minor surgery. Patients requiring major surgery 
will be sent to West Los Angeles or other VA hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sepulveda treated about 20,000 veterans in its inpatient and outpatient 
programs in the fiscal year before the quake, the ambulatory care center will 
provide outpatient care to 22,500 veterans in its first full year in operation, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda must remove low-level radioactive isotopes from the hospital before 
it can be demolished, a process that will be supervised by the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. Groundbreaking for the outpatient center is expected to 
take place in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the hospital's inpatient programs in mental health and drug and alcohol 
abuse were transferred to West Los Angeles after the quake, Sepulveda continues 
to provide outpatient care in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda Director Perry C. Norman said the transfers produced few hitches. 
With an outpatient configuration, she said, Sepulveda will be able to care for 
more veterans. She cited studies indicating that 60% of all VA inpatient 
surgeries could have been handled on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the closure of Sepulveda's hospital, psychiatric wards with more than 100 
beds and the inpatient chemical-dependence unit has sparked disappointment and 
bitterness among many local veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with chronic drug and alcohol problems said Sepulveda's treatment 
programs served as a sanctuary for them, allowing them to check in for brief 
hospitalizations during periods of stress and later check out and resume their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is so different. The staff cares so much," said Doug Gowdy, a 
29-year-old Coast Guard veteran who has been treated for alcoholism and drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, veterans said, they face staff indifference, waiting lists and 
broken appointments at West Los Angeles, the biggest of the 171 hospitals 
operated by the VA nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lacock, who served as a Marine corporal in Vietnam and lives in 
Northridge, said West Los Angeles doctors canceled three appointments with him 
before he was able to get surgery on a finger that healed crookedly after an 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all honesty, it didn't get worse," he said. "But it's aggravating as far 
as wasted time. Man, I wasted days upon days." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie E. Gogerty, a recovering alcoholic from Van Nuys who served as an Army 
private in Saigon, said inpatient substance-abuse programs at Sepulveda were 
more in-depth, structured and effective than those at West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles VA officials said a small number of appointments with 
Sepulveda veterans have been flubbed. They acknowledged that there is a 
two-week waiting list to get into the alcohol treatment program, but said there 
is no wait for inpatient psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a small family there; we are a larger family here," said West Los 
Angeles spokeswoman Harriett Bordenave. But, she added, "No one is denied care 
that they need." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the closure of Sepulveda's emergency room, the hospital now maintains 
an "urgent care center" -- essentially a first-aid station -- that is staffed 
during the day but not at night. For veterans in medical crisis, Sepulveda 
staffers dial 911 and send them to nearby private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 80 veterans have been dispatched to outside hospitals since the 
quake, with no medical complications, Sepulveda Director Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley veterans said the biggest obstacle for many of them is simply getting 
to the West Los Angeles hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these guys are semi-homeless; they're just out of recovery," said 
Don Williams of North Hills, a recovering alcoholic who served three combat 
tours in Vietnam as an Army sergeant. "They have to take the bus, and that can 
take three or four hours to get over there. A lot of them don't have cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Bordenave said West Los Angeles operates a shuttle service between the two 
medical centers that carries 15 patients per week. She added that the Disabled 
American Veterans runs a van service as well. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials argue -- and leaders of some veterans groups agree -- that as the 
veteran population ages and treatment technology advances, it makes sense for 
the VA to place more emphasis on outpatient care, and less on inpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the VA is trying to take something away, they're trying to give them 
something back," said Terry Tracy, the Los Angeles-based state service officer 
for the American Legion, who also praised the VA for not shutting down 
Sepulveda altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Some veterans' advocates concede that complaints about Sepulveda's conversion 
to outpatient care "aren't earth-shattering," as one put it. 
</P>
<P>
 But they argue that health care for veterans should not be disrupted at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who gave us a country," said Lawrence C. Caird, Sepulveda's 
administrative officer for psychiatry. "They gave us a free press. They gave us 
our suburbs. They gave us all the things we take for granted every day." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable to me to make a decision to make access to medical care 
less convenient to them. I can't imagine why you would do that to veterans. 
They are so special."

REPORT WARNS OF NEED TO CUT SCHOOL STAFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half of Los Angeles Unified School District campuses may have to cut 
staffing costs within the next 2 1/2 years to meet conditions of a 1992 lawsuit 
settlement that sought to even out school spending, according to a report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed eight years ago by a group of African American and 
Latino parents upset about perceived funding inequities between richer and 
poorer areas. It is expected to dramatically change the way Los Angeles Unified 
funds its schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report, presented to the school board by district staff, does not 
clearly prove the suit's assumptions that the district consistently pays more 
for better-qualified teachers and administrators in affluent areas. Instead, 
staff spending inequities largely were related to school size, with smaller 
campuses spending more per student and larger schools spending less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Size is the prevailing issue, there's no question about that," said Gordon 
Wohlers, assistant superintendent for school reform. Wohlers said all schools 
require a basic core administrative staff, which raises the per-student cost at 
smaller schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of what became commonly known as the Rodriguez consent decree, Los 
Angeles Unified must equalize per-pupil spending at nine out of 10 schools by 
July, 1997. The decree included provisions for compensating smaller schools for 
higher administrative costs but did not spell out exactly how that should 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 54% of the 564 schools surveyed exceed the average per-student cost 
for staff. The remaining schools fall below that average -- which ranged from 
$1,406 per year for an elementary student to $1,681 for a high school student 
-- and would be entitled to spend more under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, board members will begin discussing which schools face the largest 
cuts and how to make them. Ultimately, many staffing decisions will be left to 
the individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But several board members said they are beginning to worry about the urgency 
and scope of the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that we set benchmarks for (school) improvement," said board 
member Leticia Quezada. "Otherwise, what I'm afraid of is that all schools will 
wait until the last three months, and then they'll say, 'We can't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The top-spending elementary school campuses were Bellagio Newcomer School, 
which is in Brentwood but buses in newly arrived students from all over Los 
Angeles, and Coeur D'Alene School in Venice, which has a large program for 
homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the spending list were Crescent Heights School in the 
Wilshire district and Emelita School in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 For middle schools, Burbank and Pacoima middle schools headed the spending 
list, and 32nd Street -- USC's performing arts magnet school -- was at the 
bottom. For high schools, Wilson High on the Eastside, Banning High in 
Wilmington and Fairfax High spent the most. The least was spent by Los Angeles 
Center for Enriched Studies in the Wilshire district and the Downtown Business 
Magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some district officials noted that the report does not provide a complete 
picture of relative school expenditures because it only includes staff salary 
categories covered by the settlement. Neither the report nor the settlement 
took into account a myriad of other local, state and federal money.

PANEL ASKS LAPD WHERE IT WILL FIND ROOM FOR NEW HIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel Monday directed the Police Department to 
promptly document its future facility needs amid growing concerns that the 
department is ill-prepared to accommodate the additional officers it plans to 
hire under Mayor Richard Riordan's public safety plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This report, due back to the council's Public Safety Committee within 30 days, 
could present further obstacles to implementing the Riordan Administration's 
ambitious plan to hire 2,855 additional officers by mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's hearing, Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public 
Safety Committee, worried aloud that the mayor's plan could swamp the LAPD's 
existing 18 stations. She requested the facilities report. 
</P>
<P>
 After the report was commissioned, Police Protective League Director Dennis 
Zine told the panel that police are now crammed into "cubbyholes and closets" 
in some divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an isolated problem, but a routine one," Zine told the committee, 
chaired by Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot pack more sardines into this can," Zine said in an interview. 
"It's shortsighted planning. I'm not blasting Riordan or the City Council 
though. The blame must fall on 20 years of neglect under (former Mayor Tom) 
Bradley." 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. David Kalish, head of the LAPD's facilities construction unit, said the 
problem will be most pronounced in the department's older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's newer facilities have been built to accommodate expansion, "but in 
many others it will be very difficult" to fit in more officers, Kalish said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be more crowded than they are today -- and some are quite crowded 
now," Kalish said. "It is very important to have a long-term approach to 
expanding and maintaining our facilities, especially because of the Project 
Safety Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley said the mayor's office welcomes the report. "It's 
a good idea to consider facilities expansion," Keeley said. "We need to match 
our hiring needs with space planning in the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting concerns about the safety plan's effect on LAPD facilities arose 
Monday as the police committee also questioned how the city is spending the 
proceeds from 1989's Proposition 2 bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $176 million raised by that measure to fund police facility 
improvements, only about $25 million remains available for new projects, Kalish 
told the committee. Altogether, 11 capital projects are being financed by the 
bond measure, including purchase of a recruit training center in Westchester 
and construction of new stations for the North Hollywood, Newton and 77th 
Street divisions, and expansion of the Foothill, Southwest and Wilshire 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, the LAPD learned that it will have to use the bond proceeds 
to pay fair market value to another city agency, the Department of Water and 
Power, for a 45-acre site that it has long planned to acquire as an emergency 
vehicle and firearms training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The land may cost the LAPD as much as $6 million, it has been estimated. Until 
recently, the Police Department believed it had a gentleman's agreement with 
the DWP to lease the facility for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the agencies plan to use an independent appraisal of the property's value 
as the starting point for negotiations to set a final price. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's most pressing current facility needs include expansion of the West 
Valley and Harbor stations, replacement of the outdated Hollenbeck and Rampart 
stations and additional parking for the Van Nuys and Northeast stations, Kalish 
said. "We also need a 19th and 20th station," he said, beyond the city's 
current 18 police divisions. During the Proposition 2 campaign in 1989, 
sponsors said it might result in construction of a station in the mid-Wilshire 
area and another in the north-central San Fernando Valley.

DEPUTIES' USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE DECLINES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
MONITOR ALSO REPORTS THAT BLOCK'S RECRUITING POLICIES POINT TO MORE DIVERSIFIED 
FORCE. BUT REFORMS BEGUN IN '91 REMAIN FRAGILE, HE NOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what he calls a "generally upbeat report," a monitor appointed by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors to keep track of reforms at the Sheriff's 
Department declares in a document due out today that the department has made 
substantial progress in controlling the use of excessive force by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Merrick J. Bobb, in his third semiannual report, also found that 
within the limits of fiscal constraints, Sheriff Sherman Block has set in place 
recruiting policies that promise ultimately to fashion a more diverse uniformed 
force -- with both more women and more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb said in an interview that his own on-site inspections, plus recent 
newspaper articles he has read, have persuaded him that the Sheriff's 
Department "is several steps ahead" of the Los Angeles Police Department and 
the city's Fire Department in the reform process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sherman Block has permitted and is presiding over substantial and positive 
institutional change, putting his department at the forefront in many areas of 
police administration," Bobb declares on the opening page of the 134-page 
report to be submitted today to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Bobb has adopted the style of previous reports, mixing 
praise and criticism -- with the praise often in the summaries and the 
criticism in the details. 
</P>
<P>
 His report points to a considerable number of criticisms of the pace of 
progress, particularly in such areas as the handling of citizen complaints, 
excessive force investigations, canine policies and the integration of women in 
the department's patrol functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb was the top staff member under retired Superior Court Judge James G. 
Kolts in preparing a report 2 1/2 years ago that was highly critical of the 
Sheriff's Department in controlling the use by deputies of excess force against 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says in today's report, shooting and serious force have dropped 
substantially since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers of suspects and citizens wounded by the Los Angeles Sheriff's 
Department has dropped by more than a third from the yearly rate in 1991," he 
declares. "The number killed has dropped by more than a fourth. The number of 
deputies killed in 1994 through November is zero. The number wounded has 
dropped from 10 in 1991 to two for 1994 as of late November." 
</P>
<P>
 Also possibly reflecting less use of force, the number of lawsuits filed 
against the department in this regard has recently shown a decline, from 86 in 
fiscal year 1991-92 to 52 in fiscal year 1993-94, although, due to lag time, 
the cost of settlements has increased from $3.6 million to $6.2 million in the 
same years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman said Block would decline comment on the 
report because the sheriff had not received a copy as of Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although complimentary of Block in the new report, Bobb remarks: "We also must 
stress the fragility of the Kolts reforms. In substantial part, the progress to 
date rests on the shoulders of a small handful of key individuals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The changes in culture, rigor, accountability and risk management have, in 
all candor, not yet penetrated deeply and could prove evanescent." 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the findings in the new report: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although little gain has yet been made in advancing the percentage of women 
and minorities on the sheriff's force -- with women up only from 12.5% to 12.7% 
in the last 2 1/2 years, African-Americans from 8.9% to 10% and Latinos from 
16.2% to 17.5% -- the statistics for new recruits undergoing training show more 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, of the 95 recruits training at the Sheriff's Academy, 19% are 
female and 24% are Latino. Only 8% are black, however. In the applicant pool of 
1,639, 20.5% are women, 14.5% are black and 36.2% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans, 2.2% of the sworn force now, are 5% of the academy class and 
3.4% of the applicant pool. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Bobb notes that only 8.4% of the deputies in the 
department's prestigious field operations are women, compared with 12.7% in the 
entire force. Yet, he is complimentary about the promotion of women to high 
positions, including an African American, Helena Ashby, to one of only eight 
"chief" positions within the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb acknowledges in the report that the LAPD has a higher percentage of women 
on the force, a total of 15.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 * There appears to be some inconsistency in the reports of citizen complaints 
at various sheriff's stations, and some tendency to not specify that complaints 
are about undue use of force when they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * The percentage of suspects bitten by canines in search and apprehension 
operations has declined slightly in the latter part of this year, from the 
previous 27% to 23%. But revised policies of announcing that canines may be 
about to close on a suspect still fall short of the changes recommended in the 
original Kolts report.

JUDGE LETS CITY JOIN PROP. 187 LAWSUIT; COURT: LOS ANGELES, WHICH ARGUED THAT 
IT SIMPLY WANTS TO CLARIFY THE NEW LAW'S EFFECTS, WILL BE PART OF THE 
OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE'S IMPLEMENTATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite indicating that she was perplexed by the vague position being staked 
out by the city of Los Angeles, a federal court judge nonetheless granted the 
city permission Monday to intervene in a major legal challenge to Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer notified the city late Monday 
afternoon that it can join a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups, which have 
attacked the constitutionality of the measure approved by voters last month. A 
written order explaining her decision is expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Francisco L. Orozco said the upshot is that the city will be 
represented in a crucial court hearing Wednesday -- and in all future hearings 
-- on the fate of the illegal immigrant ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our goal, and we've accomplished that," Orozco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) we were surprised," he acknowledged. "She seemed so predisposed based 
on her questions. . . . There was a feeling she was headed in a denial mode." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has led efforts to halt city involvement in 
anti-Proposition 187 lawsuits, said late Monday that he was disappointed that 
City Atty. James Hahn continues to move forward in court. But he admitted that 
he lacks the votes to end Hahn's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, my reading is a majority of the council wants to put the 
responsibility onto Hahn and doesn't want to get any more involved in this," 
Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's direction, Hahn sought to join in the legal battle in order 
to seek clarification of the anti-illegal immigration measure's impact on 
public services. The best way to accomplish this, Hahn has said, is to 
intervene on the side of the ACLU and the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund (MALDEF), which are seeking to scuttle the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing began with Judge Pfaelzer asking Orozco to state the city's 
position on Proposition 187. "We're still moving forward," Orozco replied. 
Orozco said the city wanted to know how its social service programs would be 
affected if the ballot measure took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, pressed by the judge to clarify, Orozco said the city also believed 
that the ballot measure, which would bar illegal immigrants from public 
education, non-emergency health care and social welfare services, was "unduly 
vague and overbroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer indicated that the city seemed to have a vague position and, at one 
point, suggested Los Angeles might need to file its own lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the city seek to enter on the side of the plaintiffs, Pfaelzer asked 
Orozco, if it is only seeking an interpretation of the initiative? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what you mean by clarify ," the judge told Orozco, later adding, 
"I do have a problem letting the city in when I don't know what (its) position 
is." It was unclear late Monday why the judge ruled in favor of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the confusion is a shifting series of directives issued by the 
City Council on how to react legally to the passage of the divisive initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the November election, the council directed Hahn to pursue any and 
all legal action necessary to overturn Proposition 187. But after a flurry of 
heated phone calls from constituents angry about the use of tax dollars, the 
council softened its position, asking Hahn only to seek clarification in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Hahn presented the council with several additional options, 
including filing a friend of the court brief asking for clarification of the 
proposition, asking the attorney general's office for instructions or 
requesting that federal agencies specify any conflicts with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the council could reach no consensus to change its request that Hahn, 
using his discretion, seek clarification of the measure's legal effect on the 
city. And so Hahn's deputies went forward Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office, which is defending the ballot measure, 
asked Pfaelzer not to allow the city to intervene, saying the state is already 
representing the interests of municipalities across California. 
</P>
<P>
 After the judge's ruling, attorney general's spokesman David Puglia responded, 
"We respectfully disagree with the judge." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for MALDEF said the civil rights groups would welcome the city's 
involvement in the legal fray, noting that the case, which involves four 
separate lawsuits, would otherwise be tried without the perspective of local 
governmental entities that would be dramatically affected by Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Pfaelzer is due to rule Wednesday on whether to issue a preliminary 
injunction blocking implementation of the initiative until its legality is 
determined in lengthy court hearings. Most major portions of Proposition 187 
are on hold as a result of a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. 
District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisive ballot initiative was approved by a nearly 3-2 margin in the Nov. 
8 state election.

SCOTT HARRIS: AGEISM IN HOLLYWOOD IS AN OLD STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time I met Milt Rosen he was wearing a Chairman Mao cap, complete 
with red star. Communism may be out of fashion, but on a 72-year-old man with a 
mane of gray hair and a white beard, the effect was jaunty. He looked like a 
character from "Reds," ready to spin yarns about revolutionary days with John 
Reed and the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surprise to learn that Milt Rosen lives in Northridge, not Venice or 
Berkeley. He's a writer who witnessed and encouraged the rise of the evil 
empire that is television. And though Milt insists that he is really and truly 
a leftist at heart, he now makes a bit of money penning one-liners for a 
Republican by the name of Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the one Arnold told during the last campaign, introducing Gov. Pete 
Wilson at a fund-raiser: "Kathleen Brown says she's going to create a million 
jobs. So how come her brother isn't working?" 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Rosen was a junior high school English teacher in the Bronx when he 
started writing routines for stand-up comics in the '50s. His career in TV is 
long and varied -- comedy, drama and variety shows. Now that he writes for 
Arnold, Milt's wife accuses him of prostituting his talents, but she doesn't 
mind spending the money. Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt believes in comedy for comedy's sake. He figures a good line is a good 
line, whether it's written by a 72-year-old guy who hung out at Lindy's in the 
'50s or a 21-year-old whiz kid fresh from the Harvard Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was his point over lunch the other day -- to rail against "the gray 
wall" of show biz, "the barrier against older writers, older directors, older 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon the pun, but ageism is an old story. In a Hollywood obsessed with being 
hip and youthful, it's not hard to understand Milt Rosen's complaint. Some 
stars may be allowed to age gracefully, but people who put words in their 
mouths receive no such indulgence. He sadly told a story about a famous TV 
producer, himself in his 70s, who surveyed a room of writers and declared: 
"There's too much gray hair in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it, Milt wonders, that Hollywood believes that only the young deliver 
new ideas? Why is it that so many movies are now sequels? Why is it that so 
many new shoes are retreads of the old? "The networks feel people over 30 are 
not aware with what's going on, as if the new shows are so unique," he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt says one of the touted new series "is about a family of five orphans in 
the West." Well, in the '60s, Milt wrote "The Monroes." That series, which 
survived but one season against the tough competition of "The Virginian," was 
about a family of five orphans growing up in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Milt is plotting a new revolution. And that's why we had lunch the 
other day, so he could share this wild hair of an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think is that all the older writers, directors, producers, musicians 
-- everything -- should put their money together to make a network. We could 
get it together if we had somebody like Michael Milken to help." 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, people laugh at Milken," Milt said, "but without him, there'd be no Ted 
Turner today. Michael Milken dealing his junk bonds made CNN possible. . . . We 
could own the network. Those who want to work could work. Those who don't want 
to don't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the drivel on TV, there certainly seems room for something more, 
though I really wasn't sure what Milt had in mind. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This wouldn't be a senior citizens' network," he reassured me. "We're not 
just going to do shows about arthritis." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Milt Rosen's idea is up the flagpole, the question is whether anyone 
will salute. In the meantime, Milt will keep tapping away at the keyboard, 
ghosting for Milton Berle and helping Arnold from time to time. He's also at 
work on his memoirs, including the sweeter moments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his favorite scripts was an episode for "Mr. Novak" in the '60s. 
Drawing on his own classroom experience, Milt wrote of a teacher who clowned 
his way through the courses, who entertained his students without teaching. The 
principal is about to fire him, but Mr. Novak, played by James Franciscus, 
rises to the defense of the teacher, played by Herschel Bernardi. It's agreed 
that the teacher can finish out the semester on one condition: "No more jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose you want me to thank you," the teacher says to Mr. Novak later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that would be nice," Mr. Novak says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't. You took away my Teddy bear and turned out the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, while Bernardi was touring in "Fiddler on the Roof," 
Milt Rosen saw the actor in a restaurant. At his wife's urging, Milt walked 
over and introduced himself, explaining that he'd written that old "Mr. Novak" 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi remembered the script after all those years. In fact, he looked up at 
Milt and said this: 
</P>
<P>
 "You took away my Teddy bear and turned out the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Those moments, Milt says, make it all worthwhile.

HARVESTING ANGER; OXNARD LABORERS LEAVE FIELDS TO MARCH AGAINST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Saying that the children of illegal immigrants should not be deprived of an 
education or medical care, about 200 Oxnard farm workers walked out of the 
celery fields Monday and marched from Plaza Park through La Colonia to protest 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Laborers from BUD of California, a Dole subsidiary, left their seasonal 
$100-a-day jobs picking and packing celery about 7:30 a.m. Monday to proclaim 
that immigrants -- including illegal immigrants -- contribute to the economy, 
and their families deserve public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, passed by voters in November, seeks to withhold education, 
public services and most medical care from illegal immigrants. The ballot 
measure is on hold after a series of lawsuits questioning its constitutionality 
were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're living in a rich country that is wealthy because of our cheap labor," 
said Jose Rojas, who described himself as an undocumented worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already been exploited enough," said Rojas, who said his two young 
children are about to enter school. "We feel our children should be treated 
fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting "Education for the children!" and "We all pay taxes!" the 
demonstrators -- some with toddlers in tow -- were escorted by police as they 
walked from Plaza Park through La Colonia before disbanding peacefully. No 
arrests were made, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the protesters asked that their names not be used because they are 
undocumented. Dole officials did not return repeated phone calls asking for 
comment Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers, bitter over the passage of Proposition 187, said Latinos are 
being unfairly targeted as the source of California's woes and that they must 
band together to oppose the measure's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot of discrimination against Hispanics, not just those who 
are undocumented," Rojas said. "If you are not a white, you are being treated 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 As the farm workers passed Cesar E. Chavez School and the Colonia Village 
housing projects, residents walked out of their homes and cheered, and about a 
dozen elderly men and youngsters on bicycles joined the procession. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time someone starts doing something," said Ida Rivera, who watched 
the protest from her mother's La Colonia apartment. "Illegal or not illegal, 
everybody has a right to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said Mexican immigrants have long done the work that others would not 
do, yet many of them are suddenly deemed expendable.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for them, who would be working the fields?" Rivera said. "You 
don't see any white people out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Morales, 40, said he has worked the fields since 1972 and has yet to 
see immigrants earn any respect for their labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work like dogs, and they still say we don't belong here," Morales said. 
"I've never burdened the government. I've never collected welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the marchers said the idea to walk out of work to protest 187 came 
from KOXR, or Radio Lobo, a Spanish-language radio station in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio proposals apparently came after Los Amigos of Orange County, a 
Latino advocacy group, attempted to initiate a Dec. 12 sickout to show the 
economic strength of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County event apparently fizzled due to lack of organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Radio Lobo held a weeklong call-in show on whether Ventura County's 
Latinos should show their clout by not going to their jobs or buying anything 
Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands called in, with most saying the county should take part in the "187 
Flu Brownout," said Radio Lobo owner and general manager Albert Vera. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera said his station received calls from hundreds of people Monday saying 
they did not go to work or knew of someone who had not gone to work because of 
the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
 But local union officials and authorities said they had not heard of any 
sickouts or walkouts in Ventura County other than that by the BUD farm workers.

MAN AT ODDS WITH CITY OVER SHELTER; THOUSAND OAKS: DAVID M. RUSSELL, WHO IS 
HOMELESS, MAY LOSE HIS MAKESHIFT HOUSE-ON-WHEELS BECAUSE OF CODE VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man who once spent three years secretly living in the attic of a 
Thousand Oaks office building is on the verge today of losing his second 
makeshift dwelling, a two-story house-on-wheels he erected from trash-bin 
scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Russell, 41, who has lived on the streets in the Westlake area of 
Thousand Oaks since 1978, has until 8 a.m. today to move the patchwork of wood 
and metal beams -- replete with two refrigerators, a television and two 
microwave ovens -- that is parked at Foothill and Sunset drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, the 15-foot-high, one-ton structure had been taking shape 
under a palm in the parking lot behind a technology firm at 2301 Townsgate 
Road. But the city of Thousand Oaks informed the firm that the ramshackle home 
violated building codes, so workers towed the structure onto the street last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is not removed today, the city will have no choice but to haul it to the 
city's impound yard, said David Pimentel of the city Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll be the Grinch after this," he added. "The irony of the thing is 
the man has got talent . . . I don't know why he's not using it somewhere, why 
he's not working for someone." 
</P>
<P>
 That had been Russell's plan, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of unchecked energy and two discarded file cabinets, the skillfully 
crafted jumble of discarded wood and wire slowly evolved in Russell's mind as a 
prototype for a cabin in a houseboat or schooner that could be produced on a 
mass scale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the rough and tumble of the business world, which he had shunned 
since dropping out of a pre-dental program at UCLA, seemed less daunting and 
maybe even worth a try. "I got to thinking, why not?" Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others encouraged him, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to us like a homeless person who was trying to better his life, 
trying to do something good with it," said Phil McMillin, controller of PDX 
Technologies Inc. "He wanted to try to get it commercialized." 
</P>
<P>
 Before learning that the growing structure violated building codes, McMillin 
and others had allowed him to work and live in the parking lot "because we were 
trying to be good Samaritans." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Russell, he said. Russell would clean up garbage and do other small 
jobs, as he had for other area businesses. "He was trying to earn his keep," 
McMillin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, who is commonly seen pushing his shopping cart along Townsgate Road, 
was philosophical after reading Pimentel's posted warning as rain began to fall 
Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Square 1 all over again," he said, voicing little confidence that the 
city could tow the structure without damaging, if not destroying, it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go back to where I started, which is where I am now, at this moment, at 
the mercy of the weather," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Eleanor Russell, 68, of Seal Beach said the former high school 
wrestler has "got so many talents, he could have been anything he wanted. But 
he won't conform to our society. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not lazy. He works all the time, but only doing what he wants to do. He 
won't take orders. He just wants to do his thing," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, his thing has drawn wide notice in its Westlake neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw it, I thought it looked like somebody was building a float for the 
Rose Parade," said inspections supervisor Buck O'Shea of the city Building and 
Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't this a beauty?" said Scott Cameron as he drove by. "It's the Winchester 
House on wheels."

CAMARILLO WILL CONSIDER STRICT LANDSCAPE MEASURE; HOMEOWNERS: THE ORDINANCE 
WOULD GIVE RESIDENTS ONE YEAR TO PLANT, IRRIGATE AND MAINTAIN THEIR YARDS OR 
FACE FINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly concerned over unsightly yards in Camarillo, the City Council 
will consider strict new rules Wednesday that would give residents one year to 
landscape, irrigate and maintain their front and side yards or face civil 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which would amend the city's zoning code, would force owners of 
new and previously owned homes to landscape those portions of their front and 
side yards visible from the sidewalks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules also require that homeowners have lawn hoses or sprinkler 
systems, and that they maintain the landscaping -- be it simply grass or the 
more decorative rocks and reflecting pools -- once it is installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a big problem now, but it could become one," Mayor Michael Morgan 
said. "We have an increasing number of rentals in the city and it seems like 
we're seeing a trend where the owners and tenants are starting to let things 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said she could not support the ordinance as 
written. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong. I think we should do those things that encourage people 
to take better care of their properties," Craven said. "However, I just think 
this delves too far into people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven -- who said she was not sure if her own cactus-filled, Xeriscaped front 
yard violated the terms of the proposed code amendment -- said that often 
first- and second-time homeowners have difficulty financing the expense of 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people throw every penny they have into their homes and often have 
little or nothing left over for the yard," Craven said. "I think we should be 
sensitive to this because it's a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Burrow, the city's senior planning officer, said there are about 11,000 
detached single-family homes in the city that would come under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted by the council, owners of homes in recently built tracts would have 
one calendar year from the time their utility services were hooked up to comply 
with the law. All other homeowners in the city would have a year from the time 
the ordinance, if approved, is made effective Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrow said homeowners violating the proposed ordinance would be issued 
several warnings before being cited and fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our code enforcement officers work with residents so they will comply with an 
ordinance voluntarily," Burrow said. "They will only write a citation as a last 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said citations would range from $100 for a first offense to 
$500 for a third offense. Fourth and subsequent citations are considered 
misdemeanors and carry $1,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council is set to debate the code amendment Wednesday, Camarillo 
homeowners Janice Daurio and Paul Ford said they applaud the city's effort to 
ensure that homeowners keep their properties landscaped and well-maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "This requirement will do much to enhance the beauty of the city," Daurio and 
Ford stated in a letter to city officials. "Careless, sloppy people who do not 
care about appearances will think twice before buying a home here."

SIMI FALLING SHORT IN MINORITY HIRING; AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: DESPITE PROBLEMS IN 
REACHING SELF-IMPOSED GOALS, CITY OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE PLEASED WITH PROGRESS 
BEING MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although half the new workers employed by Simi Valley over the past year were 
women or minorities, none was hired as a top administrator or police officer, 
causing the city to falter in reaching its own affirmative-action goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 70 employees hired by the city in 1994, 15 were white women and 20 were 
minorities, according to a report presented Monday to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But only eight of those were considered affirmative-action hires under the 
city's five-year plan to fill certain positions, including administrative jobs, 
with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said that despite the shortfalls, he is pleased with the 
progress the city has made in hiring minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "These goals we set up are really rather arbitrary," Stratton said. "The fact 
is that we are making a strong effort to attract well-qualified minorities, and 
that effort is paying off."  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley has surpassed its affirmative-action goals for maintenance workers 
and clerical support. But to reach its five-year goal of 33 affirmative-action 
hires, the city must fill 12 targeted jobs with women and minorities in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, the city has hired just two Latinos in top 
administrative and professional positions. The plan calls for the hiring of 
three more Latinos by the time the program ends next December. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1995, the plan also directs the city to hire four minorities and 
two women as police officers.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, no minorities and just one woman have been hired as officers since 
1990. Since 1991, the percentage of white men working as police officers has 
risen slightly from 85.3% to 85.7% 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said the city has a hard time attracting minority 
candidates, who may not be interested in working in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we advertise for these jobs, we certainly go outside of Simi Valley," 
Davis said. "Unfortunately, I think a lot of people still consider us to be out 
in the boonies, so we don't always get the diverse application pool we might 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, Simi Valley's highest-ranking African American police 
officer filed a federal discrimination suit against the city, alleging he was 
stuck for 16 years at the rank of a sergeant because of his race. The suit was 
settled in August for $20,000, and the officer has retired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming year, the city, whose population is 80% white, plans to step up 
minority recruiting efforts through job fairs and advertisements in trade 
magazines, said Laura Herron, director of general services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city's 522 employees, 79% are white and 54% are white men. Four years 
ago, when the affirmative-action plan went into effect, the city employed 490 
workers. Of that, 81% were white and 55% were white men. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the city hired white males to fill openings for a new police 
chief and a new deputy city manager. Both jobs were vacated by white males. 
Herron was promoted from deputy city manager to head the General Services 
Department, the first woman to hold that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is making a good-faith effort," Councilman Paul Miller said. "The 
turnover is low and the job market is such that Simi Valley can pick the cream 
of the crop. That means the city can hire the best candidates, regardless of 
race or gender."

HORSE-DRAWN NOSTALGIA; OLD-FASHIONED WAGON RIDE FILLS WITH CAROLERS AND CHEER 
</P>

<P>
 It just sounds like Christmas in the orchards off Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On cold, clear evenings, strains of "Jingle Bells" and "O Holy Night" waft on 
the cold wind through the Tierra Rejada Valley. The tunes are accented by the 
clomping hoofbeats of two giant Belgian draft horses, their harnesses jingling 
with each step as they haul a load of carolers through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Top that with a fresh pine scent drifting from the Tierra Rejada Ranch 
Christmas Tree Farm, the sweet smell of hot cocoa, and the smoky aroma of a 
roaring fire, and you have a Christmas wonderland, Ventura County style. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what Krissie Breck, 20, was hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 Breck and her boyfriend, Evan Mackey, 24, run Party Animals Farm, which takes 
groups on nostalgic Christmas caroling wagon rides on the rural outskirts of 
Moorpark.  
</P>
<P>
 "People really seem to like it," she said. "It's an old-fashioned way to have 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair began to build a business around their love for horses last January, 
after touring around the country in separate horse shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from South Dakota, Breck spent time in Alaska and Florida traveling 
with her trick horse Magic, who can tap out with its hoof the solutions to 
simple math problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey worked with horses on his father's ranch in New Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're both horse people and when we found this place we decided to stay," 
Breck said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they bought the pair of draft horses -- Daubin and Rowdy -- the fledgling 
business branched out from pony rides and birthday parties to include fall 
hayrides. And when the Christmas season rolled around, Breck and Mackey looked 
for something else to keep the business going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just sat down and brainstormed ideas until we came up with this," Breck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the month, the couple have booked nine twilight 
caroling trips.

<P>
 While business is not booming, a steady stream of people have come in for the 
trip each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening, it was a youth group from the Simi Valley Bible Community 
Church. About 25 teen-agers and a sprinkling of parents spent an hour belting 
out all the Christmas tunes they knew. Occasionally they would substitute a few 
lines in a song, as in "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones 
I've never known." 
</P>
<P>
 When the long, slow ride over dirt roads and through Christmas tree farms was 
over, the group warmed up around a fire with some hot chocolate, talking with 
their youth minister, Tony Marotta It was Marotta who first thought of taking 
the group on a wagon ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this would be pretty fun," he said. "And it sure turned out that 
way."

<P>
 A Newport Beach housing developer has backed out of a deal to buy surplus 
property owned by the Fountain Valley School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees in October selected Kaufman & Broad-South Coast Inc. as their first 
choice to buy the vacant John B. Bushard School site for $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But soil studies recently done on the 10-acre property showed that about $1 
million in remediation work needs to be done, said John Ryan, senior vice 
president at Kaufman & Broad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said that the property has peat deposits. Soil would have to be imported 
to the site and compacted before homes could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got concerned with the site and essentially bowed out," Ryan said. "The 
cost and timing of getting the work done on the site were both of concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Larry Crandall has said that the district believes it can come up with 
a remediation plan that is less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall added that it is unfortunate the deal fell through. "We thought it 
was money in the bank . . .," he said. "Am I worried? No. We have 20-some 
developers who are interested in the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Other trustees also expressed disappointment but said that they too are 
confident the district will find another buyer for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't resolve some of the problems they had with the site, and we felt 
it would be better to look at all the bids again," said trustee Catherine 
Hacker. "There are lots of people interested in it, and I'm sure someone will 
make an offer the district will be comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent for administration and business, said 
that the district did not enter into a final sales agreement with the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 City approvals have already been granted to build 58 single-family homes on 
the site. DEBRA CANO

<P>
 An Orange man was ordered Monday to stand trial on three child abuse charges 
for failing to intervene as his wife allegedly tortured and sexually abused 
their 10-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Medina, 45, has pleaded not guilty.He reportedly told police he did not 
abuse the boy but admitted once holding his nephew's arms as his wife was 
beating the boy with a miniature baseball bat, according to testimony during a 
two-day preliminary hearing in Municipal Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's wife, Cynthia, 31, claims she was insane during the September attack 
in which police say she also used the bat to sexually abuse the boy as 
punishment for touching an ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina also is accused of punishing the boy by searing his tongue with 
a heated butter knife. She has pleaded not guilty to three counts of felony 
child abuse and one count of torture, marking the first time in Orange County 
history someone has been charged with torturing a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medinas were caring for their nephew because his mother could no longer do 
so. The boy has since been placed in foster care and the Medinas' son is now 
living with his grandparents. RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; NEW OFFICE WILL FOCUS ON DISEASE

<P>
 The first satellite office of the national Parkinson's Disease Foundation will 
be inaugurated tonight at UC Irvine with a support group meeting for the 
patients most often overlooked -- those in their 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment of the branch office of the New York City-based nonprofit 
organization on the UC Irvine campus coincides with the arrival of Dr. Michael 
Dogali at the UCI Medical Center.Dogali was appointed chair of the university's 
neurosurgery department last month and is considered a pioneer in surgical 
procedures for treating Parkinson's patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogali and neurologist Dr. Daniel Truong, director of the UCI Parkinson and 
Movement Disorders Program, will be guest speakers at the meeting, scheduled 
from 6:30 to 8 p.m. in the campus Medical Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get some awareness in the community of the new research and 
the new procedures available for Parkinson's patients," said Gloria Pekala 
Hanrahan, West Coast coordinator for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, which 
was founded in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, Parkinson's is not diagnosed. People ignore the tremors until it 
gets so bad that they have trouble walking and they can't ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Parkinson's support groups focus on older patients, according to 
Hanrahan. "This support group is open to everyone, but our emphasis is toward 
people who are in their 40s and 50s," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson's is caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the brain, according to 
the foundation, which estimates that there are between 500,000 and 1.5 million 
Americans who have the disease.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAGNET SCHOOL SURVEY EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura school board is expected tonight to approve a survey determining 
whether any elementary schools want to convert to a back-to-basics magnet 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey to go out in January will ask parents and teachers whether they are 
interested in adhering to the tenets proposed for the school, which would 
include students wearing uniforms and parents signing contracts agreeing that 
their children will abide by school rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents would also have to volunteer at the school for at least 12 hours each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys will go to all elementary school teachers, as well as parents of 
children in kindergarten through fourth grade -- the age group that would be 
eligible for magnet school for kindergarten through fifth grade next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just waiting to see what kind of response we get and if it's enough to 
convert a school site," said Gerald Dannenberg, assistant superintendent for 
the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school officials say the back-to-basics school would provide parents 
with more alternatives in the public education system, the proposal has drawn 
strong criticism from some teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 John Weiss, president of the Ventura Unified Education Assn., said that even 
though the local teachers union is taking no position on the issue, a handful 
of teachers have written expressing their concerns about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 These teachers worry, Weiss said, that the school will only serve children 
whose parents have the time and willingness to volunteer at school. And that 
may rule out families with only one parent or where both parents work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at this as an elitist school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of such concerns, school officials have said they would make every 
effort to ensure the school has a diverse population of students. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VOLUNTEER TOY STORE HAD A MODEST START 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One night in 1979, Joan Gendreau and Patty Hulsey sat in the garage of 
Gendreau's Ventura home and wrapped hundreds of toys as Christmas gifts for 
underprivileged and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sat up well past 3 that night.The toys, mostly used, were strewn 
throughout Gendreau's home. They had to be cleaned and repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years later, dozens of volunteers collect and distribute between 7,000 
and 10,000 new toys each year for an estimated 2,000 children. Two nonprofit 
agencies, Child Abuse and Neglect Inc. and the Children Services Auxiliary, 
have combined forces to continue what Gendreau and Hulsey started. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Gendreau, the volunteer project has become a full-time job each 
holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after Thanksgiving, I put on my jeans and sweater and I don't take 
them off until the day after Christmas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers collect toys daily at "Giving Trees" in three county shopping 
malls. The toys are then taken to the Child Abuse and Neglect Toy Store, where 
they are sorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and foster parents who have appointments are then allowed to shop for 
the children. "We let the parents do the wrapping," Gendreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the table stacked highest with toys is the one holding Barbie 
dolls. The Paint 'N' Dazzle Barbie is proving to be the most-desired request of 
preteen girls, Gendreau said. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers action figures are 
the hottest item for preteen boys, while teen-agers are requesting boom boxes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gendreau said this year will probably be the biggest year for the Toy Store. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand keeps going up each year," agreed Diana Caskey, of Ventura 
County's Children's Protective Services. She attributed the growing need to the 
county's expanding population, coupled with the state's lingering recession.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY AGREES TO HELP BUILD EATERY AT PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura will spend $830,000 to help build a fish restaurant at the base of the 
city's long wooden pier, the City Council decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved construction and lease agreements with Eric Wachter, a 
local restaurateur.Wachter plans to move his Eric Ericsson's Fish Co. from its 
Seaward Avenue site to the Ventura Pier when the restaurant building there is 
ready sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease agreement, which Wachter still must sign, gives the restaurant owner 
a 10-year lease on the structure and the option to demand that the city buy him 
out if it refuses to negotiate a new lease with him when the old one expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease is set up that way because the city charter stipulates that Ventura 
cannot enter into a lease longer than 10 years on a waterfront property. The 
City Council tried to amend the charter this fall with a ballot measure that 
would have allowed leases as long as 30 years, a move that would have brought 
Ventura more closely in line with other coastal cities in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, however, failed at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements state that Wachter must spend at least $200,000 of his own 
money on the restaurant's furnishings, equipment and fixtures. His annual rent 
payments will either be a portion of the city's construction costs or 6% of the 
business' gross receipts -- whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreements, Wachter will also lease and manage the pier's snack and 
bait shop, paying Ventura 4% of the shop's gross receipts for rent. CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; GROUP URGES BOARD TO REJECT DRUGSTORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists in Ojai have renewed their fight against a proposed discount 
drugstore, saying the outlet would worsen traffic on California 33 and increase 
air pollution in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In an appeal filed Monday, the president of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai 
asked the Board of Supervisors to overturn the county Planning Department's 
approval of a PayLess drugstore in Mira Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon-based chain wants to open an 8,000-square-foot store in the 
building previously occupied by the Valley Market on California 33, and the 
Planning Department signed off on the project in August, viewing it as a 
routine change of tenants in an existing building. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest appeal against PayLess comes after the Planning Commission rejected 
a similar request during a hearing last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal will now go to the supervisors for a decision sometime in January, 
said county planner Emily Habib. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one-page document filed Monday, Stan Greene, president of Citizens to 
Preserve the Ojai, said PayLess would attract customers from a much larger area 
than the Valley Market did. As a result, he said, traffic on the already 
congested thoroughfare would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic study commissioned by PayLess concluded that a drugstore would add 
23 fewer cars to the highway at peak traffic times than the Valley Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Moore, a commercial real estate developer representing PayLess, 
acknowledged that the discount store will draw customers from a regional area. 
But he said the Valley Market also attracted patrons from a larger area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People simply go to drugstores less frequently than they go to supermarkets," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the project surfaced in Ojai last July, PayLess has been at the center 
of a debate over discount and chain stores. Fearing that such outlets would 
drive smaller merchants out of business, some environmentalists and merchants 
have lobbied for stricter planning regulations to block such development. JULIE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
BREWERY'S VICTORY MAY KILL WATER RECLAMATION PLAN

<P>
 A $25-million project to turn sewage into drinking water for 1 million San 
Gabriel Valley residents could be headed down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chief opponent, the Miller Brewing Co., has persuaded a water board to 
drop a policy compelling the firm to use the reclaimed water over other 
sources.The water board would have been the only buyer for the reclaimed water, 
and opponents and supporters agree that without the guarantee of a steady 
customer, creditors will hesitate to finance the project proposed by the Upper 
San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is a victory for Miller, which for more than a year has fought to 
keep the treated sewage water out of the water supply it uses to make beer at 
its Irwindale plant. If the project were to go ahead, Miller faces the public 
relations nightmare of having to convince the public that beer made with 
treated sewage water is just as pure as Rocky Mountain spring water. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't only a victory for Miller. It's a victory for health of the 
valley," said Terry Kelly, an attorney for Miller, which maintains the project 
would pollute the water supply and poses unknown health risks. Proponents argue 
that treated sewage water has been used elsewhere for years without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy change was made last Wednesday by the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster Board, which oversees underground water supplies throughout much of 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district has challenged the policy change, and a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge will rule on it in January. RICHARD WINTON

TEST RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advanced Placement tests are offered in 16 subjects, including European 
history, calculus and physics. To become eligible for college credit, students 
must score at least 3 out of a possible 5 points on the test. The rate at which 
high school juniors and seniors qualified for college credit by taking the 
tests has more than tripled in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 10 years ago, the statewide percentage was 3.4%, meaning that 
fewer than four students per 100 earned college credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are results for the state, Southland counties and Los Angeles County 
school districts: 03,12,25,16 Passing exams per % point change 100 students in

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; LEVELING THE PLAYING 
FIELD FOR DEAF KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The deaf can be so easily misunderstood, said Sylvia Rodriguez, a San Fernando 
mother whose 7-year-old son, David, is hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 While driving in her car, Rodriguez sometimes is afraid to communicate with 
her son in sign language, just in case the gestures might be mistaken as some 
obscure gang signal. When she brought David to a local park, he was picked on 
and hit because the other kids did not understand why he would not talk. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to do something to create understanding between those who can hear 
and those who cannot, Rodriguez last year started the Mainstream Sports League, 
in which hearing-impaired children play softball, basketball, volleyball and 
other sports with hearing children. It is also a way for the San Fernando 
Valley's small population of deaf children to get to know each other, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It builds up their self-esteem," said Rodriguez, remembering the first 
organizational meeting she held at the Panorama City Recreation Center in the 
spring of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 The deaf children who were among the small number of people attending the 
initial meeting recognized each other from other groups. "Their little hands 
started moving so fast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's organization is called the Mainstream Sports League because it 
strives to bring deaf children into the mainstream of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rodriguez started the league, she had about 32 children in the program -- 
of about 150 deaf children in the Valley. The number has dwindled to a handful 
now, and Rodriguez said she needs parents to get more involved in the program 
to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 She also needs volunteer coaches and sign-language interpreters. But the 
Mainstream Sports League is not just an athletic program, as other parents have 
learned. They also call Rodriguez to ask for help and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a support group," said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who do not get involved with their children through signing and other 
activities contribute to the breakdown of the family unit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is also starting a Spiritual Signing program through her church -- 
the San Fernando Valley Christian Fellowship -- so that she can tell Bible 
stories to deaf children using sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 She also hopes that programs such as hers will "help bring sign language out 
into the open." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez started to learn sign language in February, 1989, shortly after 
being told her son was deaf. She also has taught sign language to her 
3-year-old daughter, Sara Lee, and the little girl is already helping to 
translate for her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very much like the translating help that she sees occurring on the 
playing field between the deaf and hearing children in the Mainstream Sports 
League. "It's truly bridging a gap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach Rodriguez, call (818) 361-0035. The number is equipped with a 
telephone device for the deaf (TDD).

 Volunteers are needed at the Antelope Valley Community Arts Center in Palmdale 
to work as ushers and assist in the box office as well as with concession 
operations. Volunteers also are needed to learn to use sound and lighting 
equipment for the center, which opened in September. For more information call 
Cultural Arts and Theater Manager Dee McAllister or the volunteer director, Ed 
MacKenzie, at (805) 267-5684.

 Project Caring Strokes, which runs art workshops for children who 
areHIV-positive or have AIDS, needs volunteers to run weekly, individually 
tailored art workshops. Volunteers will help students create art that can be 
made into greeting cards and sold. Volunteers also are needed to help arrange 
exhibitions of the artwork and to help with fund-raising. Those interested 
should call Elizabeth Gorcey at (213) 931-5703.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PEN PALS MEET FOR LANGUAGE, UNDERSTANDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura High School Spanish teacher Aline Grossman instructed her students to 
exchange letters with Spanish-speaking children to help the teen-agers overcome 
Latino stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 And her idea seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two groups met for the first time Monday, many seemed more aware of 
their similarities than their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High sophomore Robert Napolitano gave his pen pal, 10-year-old Jesus 
Silva, a framed baseball card and some chewing gum for Christmas, along with a 
word of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make sure you chew it at home," 15-year-old Robert said. "I don't want your 
teachers to get (upset)." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the older boy shared even more of his hard-earned wisdom. "You'll really 
like high school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much better than fifth grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Jesus met at a party in Grossman's classroom, one of five 
get-togethers the teacher held throughout the day for her five Spanish classes 
and their young pen pals from Will Rogers School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups have been writing letters back and forth this fall in a program 
to enhance the high school students' cultural sensitivity and Spanish 
proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The children from Will Rogers are in bilingual classes and many are native 
Spanish speakers just learning English. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children, who are in second through fifth grades, wrote their 
letters in English. But many others penned their missives in Spanish, taxing 
the knowledge of the high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 As ninth-grader Rachel Cirricione said: "I had to use my dictionary a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger children also benefit from the letters, getting a thrill from 
corresponding with older students, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children even have pictures of their pen pals taped to their school 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Perez, a fifth-grader with deeply dimpled cheeks, said she liked having 
ninth-grader Sarah Schwan as a pen pal because "usually I only have friends my 
age." 
</P>
<P>
 And 14-year-old Sarah said the enjoyment was mutual. "It's kind of fun to have 
someone look up to you." MAIA DAVIS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STUDENTS' REWARD PACKS A PUNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at a local elementary school watched in awe Monday as young martial 
artists demonstrated punches, fighting techniques and smashed wooden slabs with 
bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
 About 190 fifth- and first-grade students at Greenville Fundamental School 
watched the tae kwon do demonstration as part of their reward for raising money 
for the campus' Drug Abuse Resistance Education program.Students at the school 
raised $360, more than any other campus in the district, Principal Melanie 
Champion said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the performance, several youngsters from a local martial arts studio 
offered demonstrations of fighting prowess that culminated in an exhibition of 
board-smashing punches and kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children really enjoyed it. Even though they weren't doing something 
hands-on, they were participating by seeing something live and not seeing it on 
TV," Champion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during the morning assembly, students were treated to a puppet show by 
DARE officer and ventriloquist John Reed, who sang songs about the dangers of 
alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials also awarded a bike to Jonathon Distor, a first-grade student 
who raised $110 on his own. Jonathon raised more money than any other student 
at Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised will be used to support DARE programs districtwide, Champion 
said. JON NALICK

<P>
 A 13-year-old boy taking a shortcut home by crossing a freeway was struck and 
killed, a California Highway Patrol officer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Moreno of Santa Ana died about 7:30 p.m. Sunday after he ran in front 
of a vehicle traveling north about 55 m.p.h. in the fast lane of the Santa Ana 
Freeway at Broadway, CHP Officer Angel Johnson said. "It was dark and the 
driver didn't see him coming," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old boy "right behind him" was not injured, Johnson said. Both boys 
had been shopping at MainPlace, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic in a five-mile stretch from the accident scene was backed up for more 
than two hours, Johnson said. The driver was not cited.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
DEPUTY SHOT BY MAN ON SKATEBOARD HAS SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy shot in the head by a skateboarder who 
later committed suicide underwent surgery Monday to clean a head wound, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Belanger, 29, was shot in the head and foot Saturday after stopping a 
car that contained the suspect in an assault incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Koetters, a spokeswoman for Queen of the Valley Hospital in West 
Covina, said Belanger was operated on to remove bone fragments from his head. 
She could not say whether doctors also attempted to remove the bullet lodged in 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Belanger had stopped a car in Rowland Heights containing Gregory D. Powell, 
18, and a teen-age girl, authorities said. The officer recognized Powell as a 
suspect in an incident involving an assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 After handcuffing Powell and placing him in the patrol car, Belanger was 
questioning the girl when a friend of Powell's, 20-year-old Matthew Hagemann, 
cruised up on his skateboard and shot the officer, authorities said. Hagemann 
later fatally shot himself in the head.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-LAPD 
OFFICER TO BE TRIED IN ARMED ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Municipal Court judge on Monday ordered former Los Angeles Police detective 
Michael D. Brambles held for trial in a series of armed robberies that began 
even before his official retirement last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing at which a number of robbery victims identified 
Brambles as their assailant, Judge Mary E. Waters found sufficient evidence to 
proceed to trial on 23 counts against the onetime organized crime detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles, 45, remains in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail pending arraignment 
Dec. 27 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the robberies, which stretched from January to May, were at closing 
time at restaurants and shops around the Westside and San Fernando Valley. 
Store clerks described a lone gunman clad in a blue jeans jacket and baseball 
cap, and women at two of the locations said they were sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles' attorney, Anthony Brooklier, argued that the identifications were 
flawed because the victims originally had given police widely divergent 
descriptions of the robber. Waters noted, however, that witnesses often give 
varying accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles faces separate charges in Ventura County, where four counts were 
filed last month stemming from an April 19 robbery in which he allegedly 
sexually assaulted his victim.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; OFFICIALS TO 
GIVE PUBLIC REPORT ON PACT WITH MOBIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance officials, stung by criticism that they have weakened a safety pact 
overseeing the Mobil Oil refinery, will report publicly tonight at a City 
Council meeting on recent changes in that agreement. Some opponents have 
contended that the changes make it easier for the refinery to continue using 
toxic hydrofluoric acid instead of switching to a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 The refinery was rocked by a Oct. 19 explosion that injured 28 workers. The 
cause of the accident, which occurred near the unit that uses hydrofluoric 
acid, remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The acid ranks as one of the most toxic chemicals being used in the Los 
Angeles Basin, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about hydrofluoric acid helped fuel a 1989 city lawsuit against Mobil. 
Both sides signed a consent decree calling for the refinery to stop using the 
acid by the end of 1997 unless it could devise a safe form by the end of this 
month. But the city recently agreed to allow Mobil to continue using the acid 
as long as a study of a newly modified acid -- due by Dec. 31 -- shows it is 
safer than the chief alternative, sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What amounts to a public safety question is being handled behind closed 
doors," said environmentalist Fred Millar. But the city and Mobil say that a 
comparison of the two acids will yield valuable information about which is 
safer.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EL MONTE; MAN WHO 
ALLEGEDLY POSED AS DOCTOR HELD IN RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Baldwin Park man is in custody on suspicion of posing as a doctor and a 
dentist and sexually assaulting at least three women in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo DeJesus Arcia, 35, is being held in county jail on $500,000 bail on 
suspicion of penetration with a foreign object and sexual consent by fraud.He 
was arrested on Nov. 3 after making house calls where he improperly examined or 
sexually abused the women, El Monte Police Detective William Fetner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcia, who allegedly passed out business cards that say he is a doctor, a 
dentist and a flying instructor, is believed to have assaulted at least three 
women since January. Arcia uses the name Dr. Rodolfo Arcia Mendoza on his 
business cards, Fetner said, adding that the suspect is not licensed by the 
California Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcia is Latino, 5 feet 9 inches tall, 190 pounds with a mustache and hazel 
eyes. He wears wire-rimmed glasses. Anyone who believes they may have been 
molested by Arcia is asked to call detectives William Fetner or Victor 
Hernandez at (818) 580-2110.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SCHAFER, WORTHINGTON JOIN SANITATION BOARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arlene Schafer, a former Costa Mesa mayor, and Dan Worthington, a business 
owner, have officially assumed their positions on the Sanitary District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer, the first woman to serve on the city's Planning Commission, becomes 
the first woman on the Sanitary District board since its was formed 50 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Worthington, the elected seat is his first in Costa Mesa, after having 
run unsuccessfully for the City Council six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Both new directors met Monday at City Hall for a briefing on the district's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," said Schafer, 57, a public relations consultant who received 
11,978 votes in the Nov. 8 election. "I always thought it would be a challenge 
to run and be on a board that didn't have a woman at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington, 59, who garnered 12,088 votes, said he ran because "I had the 
time to give to the job and I wanted to be involved in the city, and this 
looked like a good thing to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington and Schafer succeed Mike Scheafer, who gave up his seat in an 
unsuccessful bid for City Council, and Jim Wahner, a 14-year board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The new attorney on the board is Alan Burns, who was selected from a field of 
30 candidates. He succeeds Roy June, who served as the board's attorney for 30 
years. TOM RAGAN

 The Literacy Volunteers of America of the Buena Park Library were commended by 
the city recently for helping hundreds of adults learn to speak, read and write 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 From July, 1993, to July, 1994, the volunteers spent 3,839 hours tutoring 44 
adults ranging in age from 25 to 60.That work would have earned the tutors 
about $49,907 if they had charged current market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutors may also be helping to bring down the crime rate. About 80% of the 
felons in California jails today are illiterate, according to the Literacy 
Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is required to have specialized education to be a tutor -- just the 
ability to read and write English and the desire to help others learn.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY PANEL TO STUDY CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has formed a committee to study a year-old campaign reform 
ordinance, looking to fine-tune local election rules by perhaps changing limits 
on contributions and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired optometrist Gordon Shanks, a committee member and campaign treasurer 
for Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings during the last election, said the 
current campaign ordinance is too complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was done by some people who were very well-intentioned, but it's way too 
complicated for a small city like this," Shanks said. "It could scare somebody 
off from running." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has a $5,000 spending limit for primary elections and a $3,000 limit 
for runoffs. During the last city elections in March, some candidates 
complained that the limits were too restrictive. Some candidates found 
themselves unable to spend money to replace all their stolen signs, Shanks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has a history of sign wars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates have also complained about rules preventing donations during the 
final week of campaigning and campaign expenditure reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's current campaign reform ordinance was created out of concerns that 
the high cost of campaigning might discourage some from seeking office It was 
put in place before this year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Laszlo, a longtime campaign reform advocate, said the new 
ordinance did not live up to expectations. "Those involved felt there are still 
some problems with the ordinance," he said. RUSS LOAR

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ORCHESTRA CONTINUES, UNPLUGGED, AT 
PLAZA

<P>
 For more than two decades, the Conejo Symphony Orchestra's annual Christmas 
concert was held in a sweaty, stuffy gymnasium, where rain hit the old tin roof 
with a harsh plinking that drowned out dainty melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the orchestra moved into an elegant new home -- the purple-hued 
auditorium of Thousand Oaks' $86-million Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxuriating in their new hall, the musicians bounded through a joyous 
Christmas program Saturday night -- until the state-of-the-art technology they 
had so long coveted abruptly failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A $40 transformer burned out midway through the program, cutting off all power 
to the auditorium's much-touted sound system. Conductor Elmer Ramsey tried to 
stall for time. Stage crews could not replace the transformer or bring power to 
the amplifiers, however, so the show went on, unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
 With all microphones muted, the symphony still managed to fill the hall with 
rich music. But soloist Sylvester Blue and the Sherwood Singers did not fare as 
well, straining to project their voices to all crannies of the packed 
1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members, who paid $10 to $45 a ticket, grumbled about the sound 
failure after the performance. Yet they rewarded the singers' gritty 
performance with a standing ovation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience was wonderful -- so understanding," said Everett Ascher, the 
symphony's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's technical director, Gary Mintz, said the broken transformer was 
replaced Sunday morning at no charge to the city. Electrical engineers are now 
designing a backup system to bypass the transformers in case of a future 
blowout, he said. But he emphasized that Saturday's power failure was a freak 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things do happen," Mintz said. "There's an infant mortality rate as 
you're wearing in a new system -- a certain percentage of your electronics die 
young. The rest will normally last up to fruitful old age." STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 A teen-ager and a young man robbed a Thousand Oaks theater at gunpoint and 
escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash, Ventura County sheriff's deputies 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Conejo Twin Theater in Janss Mall were cleaning up after 
closing at about 11 p.m. Sunday when a youth tapped on the front glass doors, 
said Sheriff's Detective Frank O'Hanlon. 
</P>
<P>
 When an employee went to the door, the youth showed a small black handgun and 
demanded to be let in, O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee opened the door, and the gunman and another man came inside and 
took an undisclosed amount of cash from the till, he said. Then they went to 
the safe -- which was open at the time while employees worked on the night 
deposit -- and took more cash, O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the two robbers fled on foot and were last seen running 
west on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrived within minutes, but were unable to find the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the first suspect was a white youth of about 16, with a 
medium build, about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing about 170 pounds. He had 
hazel eyes, and the hood of his black jacket was pulled over his head, O'Hanlon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second was a heavily-built white man about 27 years old, standing 5 feet, 
10 inches tall, weighing about 220 pounds. He had brown hair and hazel eyes and 
was wearing a gray baseball cap, dark-framed glasses and dark clothing, 
O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for 
information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the robbers. Anonymous 
tips will be taken at 494-TALK in Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. MACK REED

 His official retirement from city government began just last week, but former 
Mayor Alex Fiore is already getting a new role in Thousand Oaks politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she plans to appoint Fiore to an open seat on the 
Performing Arts Center Board of Governors during tonight's City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Governors oversees programming, scheduling and fund-raising for 
the Civic Arts Plaza auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore and one other person applied for a seat on the board left vacant by 
Larry Sparrow, who moved from the area in November. Lazar said she chose Fiore 
on the basis of his extensive financial and government experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applied for it, so I'm anxious to be on it," Fiore said. "I made 
commitments to the city to run that theater with no drain on the city's general 
fund, and that's what I intend to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar also said she plans to ask the council to confer upon Fiore the honorary 
title of "mayor emeritus" during tonight's meeting. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; REWARD OFFERED IN RAPE, ROBBERY

<P>
 Ventura County Crime Stoppers is offering up to $1,000 for information leading 
to the arrest of two men who raped and robbed a Pasadena woman after kidnaping 
her in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old woman was driving her van to work in Thousand Oaks about 6:30 
a.m. Sept. 6 when a faded brown 14-year-old Chevrolet Impala stopped in front 
of her at Townsgate Road and Westlake Boulevard, Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Latino men left their dented car, got into the woman's van and pushed her 
into the back as they drove to an unknown area, where they raped her, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men later forced the woman out of the van at the Ventura Freeway and 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland Hills, then sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, about 25, was described as being of medium build, about 5-foot-11 and 
wearing a ponytail and full beard, with a blue tattoo on his left arm. The 
other, about 30, was described as stocky, about 5-foot-7, with a mustache and 
wearing a Casio watch. Both have black hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the crime is urged to call 494-TALK. Callers may 
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 If the information leads to an arrest and the filing of a criminal complaint, 
the caller could be eligible for a reward of as much as $1,000. GREG RIPPEE

<P>
 A man who died Sunday after jumping naked from a second-story hotel balcony 
and then running from police was identified by investigators Monday as Gregory 
Lee Jensen, 37, of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of his death is unknown, pending toxicological tests, Orange County 
Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said."There was a number of conditions suggesting 
that he may have been under the influence," Martini said. "His behavior was 
quite bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said they saw him standing naked on the balcony of Friendship Beach 
Inn in the 18100 block of Beach Boulevard about 4:30 p.m. Sunday. After they 
ordered him several times to return to the hotel room, Jensen jumped off the 
balcony onto a parked car, crushing its roof and shattering the rear window, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen then ran west on Beach Boulevard, police said. Officers chased him 
across the street and used pepper spray in an attempt to restrain him. The 
spray had little effect on Jensen, who continued running, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen finally fell to one knee on the sidewalk, where officers pinned him and 
handcuffed him. Paramedics arrived and noticed that he was having trouble 
breathing and took him to Huntington Beach Medical Center, where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen was registered as a guest at the Friendship Beach Inn, according to 
police. Neither he nor the hotel would say when he checked in or whether he was 
alone. THAO HUA

 City and school leaders will give separate reports tonight about the effect 
Orange County's financial crisis may have on Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt.Paul M. Possemato said Monday that the district's report will outline 
cost-saving measures it may have to take to keep schools operating. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said his report to the City Council will not be 
complete until just before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Without knowing exactly what steps the county will take next, the Laguna Beach 
Unified School District is developing survival scenarios. The goal is to devise 
a cash-flow plan to keep schools operating through June. 
</P>
<P>
 While not offering details, Possemato said expenses may have to be "markedly 
reduced in order to reach graduation day." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would mean the end of supplies and all other types of major expenditures," 
he said. Possemato said he expects the district to continue to meet payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has already stopped work on the reconstruction of Thurston Middle 
School classes damaged during the 1993 firestorm. Possemato said a project to 
upgrade the Community Learning Center, an alternative school site on the Top of 
the World Elementary School campus, will likely be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board meets at 6 p.m., but the first hour has been set aside to 
address parents' concerns about a microwave tower at El Morro Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meets at 505 Forest Ave. at 7 p.m., an hour later than usual.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ACTIVIST HAS 2-PART PLAN TO HELP NATIVE 
AMERICANS ON RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delbert E. (Black Fox) Pomani is asking for help in collecting gifts, clothes 
and food for orphans on Native American reservations throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to drive to the reservations with other Native Americans to hand out 
the goods just before Christmas. The drivers will rent trucks to make the 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomani's goal is part of a vision he had when he was 13, growing up on a 
reservation in North Dakota. The other part is to compile all treaties signed 
by the U.S. government and Native Americans in an effort to unite tribes 
throughout the nation and urge that the treaties be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the treaties of the late 1800s call for free health-care services, 
education and housing for all Native Americans living on reservations in 
exchange for an end to fighting. The fighting stopped, but many reservations 
are so poor that there is no running water, electricity, schools or hospitals, 
said Pomani, a full-blooded Hunkpapa Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomani, 34, lives in a Fullerton apartment, where he has headquartered All 
Nations Gathering of Treaties, a new nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Pomani and other Native Americans from tribes all over the country have 
collected the treaties, the group plans to hold a conference and later present 
the treaties to the United Nations and President Clinton to demand better 
living conditions on the reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our overdue right," Pomani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Native Americans agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew (Haump-Ha-Nazhee) Cleveland, Bear clan chief of the Hochunk Nation on 
the Winnebago reservation in Wisconsin, said the main purpose of the treaty 
gathering is to promote unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are fighting for so dearly is to get our treaty rights so we can 
retain our Indian traditions, values, principles and languages," said 
Cleveland, who is coordinating the treaty gathering conference, which will take 
place some time in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the most beautiful thing if all the nations could come together 
as one," said Frank Graywolf, supportive services coordinator for the Southern 
California Indian Center. "We are all one. We all have the same things in our 
heart and if we could just come together to look after each other and take care 
of each other, than everything around us would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs 
said that California treaties were never ratified and, therefore, are not 
valid. Other treaties may be challenged in court, said Silas Ortley, a tribal 
operations specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not sure if there's still time to file suit," he said. "As far as 
(unsatisfactory) services, they need to bring it to the attention of Congress, 
who may not be aware" of poor living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomani and Cleveland said they will notify Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot that needs to be done for the Native Americans," said Amye 
Williams, secretary of the treaty gathering group. "It's time that somebody 
made people aware of the way Indians live in their own land. What Delbert is 
doing is really good." MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL MAY NAME DALY'S SUCCESSOR TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, which has had an empty seat for two weeks, will try to name 
a fifth member today. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing the new member is crucial as the city grapples with the county's 
financial crisis, which could affect landmark proposals such as a new baseball 
stadium, a new or renovated football stadium and the proposed $3-billion 
expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy was caused by an election quirk that arose after a 1992 charter 
amendment changed the mayoral selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, mayoral candidates had to be sitting council members and they 
competed for two-year terms. This was the first year that the mayor was elected 
at-large for a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mayor Tom Daly was in the middle of his council term when he was 
reelected Nov. 8, two years of his council tenure remain. His seat had to 
remain vacant during the election in case he lost the mayor's race, according 
to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council cannot agree by early January on a candidate to fill the two 
years remaining on Daly's term, one will be selected in a special election, 
which the city clerk's office estimates could cost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly has said that a logical choice would be Shirley A. McCracken, the 
chairwoman of the city's budget advisory commission, who finished third among 
16 candidates in the November election. Other council members have not publicly 
supported any candidates. GREG HERNANDEZ

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOSPITAL CERTIFICATES SALE TO BE DELAYED 
</P>

 Citing a number of problems that could drive up the project's costs, Ventura 
County's Public Facilities Corp. decided Monday to delay at least until March 
the sale of bond-like certificates to fund a $51-million expansion at the 
county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which initially planned to issue certificates of participation as 
early as February, has until September to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of money involved," said Facilities Director Norman Blacher. "I 
don't see any reason for the corporation to rush into this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Facilities Corp., whose five members are appointed by the Board of 
Supervisors, was established by the supervisors in 1974 as a separate entity to 
sell bond-like certificates. Approval by the board is required before the 
county can raise money for improvements at the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacher said he wants time to consult with finance experts to determine 
whether Orange County's financial crisis could harm the county's credit rating, 
which would make it more expensive to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacher also said he wants confirmation that the state will indeed pay 70% of 
the expansion costs at Ventura County Medical Center before issuing the 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is concerned that Proposition 187 -- the voter-approved initiative 
that bars non-emergency public health services to illegal immigrants -- could 
mean fewer patients at the county hospital and, as a result, fewer state 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacher said he also wants to study a consultant's report on the possible 
consolidation of county hospital services and those of neighboring Community 
Memorial Hospital. Community Memorial, which commissioned the report, has sued 
the public hospital over what it charges are unfair competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
 By consolidating services, Blacher said the county could dramatically reduce 
the cost of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But John F. Fay, another member of the Public Facilities Corp., warned that 
the agency is not an elected body and should not be delving into policies set 
forth by the Board of Supervisors. CARLOS V. LOZANO

PANEL ACTS TO CURB ABANDONMENT OF BUILDINGS; CITY HALL: COMMITTEE ORDERS 
DRAFTING OF LAWS TO IMPROVE SECURITY AT STRUCTURES LEFT EMPTY. SHIFTING LIENS 
ON SUCH PROPERTY TO TAX BILLS ALSO IS CONSIDERED AS A DETERRENT.

 Reacting to a problem that has worsened with recession and earthquakes, a Los 
Angeles City Council committee took preliminary steps Monday to discourage 
building abandonment and to hasten procedures for protecting or demolishing 
vacant structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to send out a message to the whole city, to every property owner, 
that we are serious about stopping this deterioration," said Councilman Marvin 
Braude, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, which discussed the 
matter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee directed the city attorney's office to draft ordinances that 
would replace the traditional plywood boarding at abandoned buildings with more 
secure metal grating to keep out the homeless and vandals, require 
eight-foot-high fencing around all abandoned property, give police more 
authority to arrest squatters and establish a toll-free telephone number for 
residents to report trouble at vacant buildings. The measures were expected to 
go to the full council soon, committee members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee deferred discussion on dozens of other proposals for coping with 
the growing number of abandoned buildings and to criticism about the city 
bureaucracy's seemingly sluggish and confusing nature. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan would allow only 20 days (instead of the current 75) between a 
citizen's complaint about a vacant building and the time the city arranges for 
its boarding and fencing. It also would shorten to 75 days (from 140) the time 
it often takes to demolish a hopelessly damaged structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, costs for boarding and demolition usually are borne by the city and 
placed as liens to be repaid when the property is sold. But unpaid liens now 
total about $3 million, and some officials are urging reform that would shift 
liens onto annual property tax bills. That would allow the city to more quickly 
gain control over abandoned buildings and possibly give them to nonprofit 
organizations for affordable housing. Officials hope the threat will discourage 
abandonments. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters reported that there are hundreds of abandoned 
buildings in her Downtown and South-Central Los Angeles district.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are like horror movies," Walters said, displaying photos of badly 
vandalized houses and stores. "People are forced to live side by side to these 
year after year. And to many people, it feels like the city is doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 As real estate values declined over the past two years, the number of 
abandoned properties monitored by the Los Angeles Department of Building and 
Safety increased 28%, to 1,381, about 80% of those single-family houses. In 
addition, about 1,800 other buildings remain uninhabitable because of damage 
from the Northridge earthquake last January.

TAKING CHARGE; RECOVERY: FORMER MENTAL PATIENT WILL MANAGE SUBSIDIZED-HOUSING 
COMPLEX FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. VA HOSPITAL IS CREDITED FOR TURNING HIS 
LIFE AROUND. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dennis Bullock's life almost has come full circle in the past decade. After 
his fiancee broke off their marriage plans in 1984, Bullock lost a home in the 
affluent black neighborhood of View Park, and gave up active church membership. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He lost his job as a machine operator when he started coming in late and 
intoxicated and began living in his car. Eventually, he wound up in a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the point where I was hopeless and helpless," Bullock said. "All I 
wanted to do was numb my feelings with alcohol and tooting (cocaine)." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, just two years after Bullock got out of a semi-independent 
facility for recovering mental patients, he was named resident manager of the 
Berendo Apartments, some of whose residents are former mental patients. The 
refurbished complex on Berendo Street offers subsidized housing to 48 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is sponsored by A Community of Friends, a nonprofit group that 
develops affordable housing for people with special needs in Southern 
California, and by Portals Mental Health Rehabilitation Services. It was 
financed with state and private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bullock, managing the building won't be just a job -- it will be a chance 
to prove that he can continue to rise above his former addictions and mental 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A Vietnam veteran, Bullock credits the Veteran's Administration Hospital here 
with starting him on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point was one day when I was sitting with all these pills in my 
hand and wanted to drink myself into oblivion," he recalled. "But something 
told me to call the Veteran's Administration Hospital. And that's when they 
helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 After outpatient treatment at the hospital, he checked himself into a mental 
institution. With a steady stream of support from other patients and growing 
confidence in himself, Bullock was discharged and began living in a 
semi-independent housing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 While addressing the small crowd on the roof of the Berendo Apartments on 
Monday, Bullock reflected on how important it will be to again receive a 
regular salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having this job is freedom for me," Bullock said. "It's a big step up from 
where I was just a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Herrera, director of program services for Portals, said it is important 
to give former mental patients a chance to regain control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a place they can call their own is something that all people want," he 
said. "Homeless individuals with psychiatric disabilities have an equal 
opportunity to demonstrate that it is an achievable goal."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TESTIMONY ENDS IN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors heard the final testimony Monday in the 6-week-old murder trial of Mark 
Scott Thornton, the Thousand Oaks man accused of slaying Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The only new witness -- Ray Chakmajian, the owner of a dry-cleaning company -- 
testified that he gave Thornton a job last year, but said the defendant quit 
after working only a day and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense witnesses had told the jury that Thornton had been homeless and unable 
to find employment before the nurse's death. But Chakmajian, testifying as a 
prosecution rebuttal witness, said he hired Thornton after the defendant was 
referred to him by Conejo Valley Youth Employment Services. 
</P>
<P>
 On his second day at work, Thornton asked to leave early and never returned, 
Chakmajian said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the prosecution rested, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath ordered 
closing arguments to begin Wednesday. The arguments will last the remainder of 
the week. The jury should get the case for deliberations next Monday, lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is accused of fatally shooting the 33-year-old nurse during a Sept. 
14, 1993, carjacking. He is also charged with a string of other crimes, 
including kidnaping his former girlfriend and shooting at her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of murder during the course of kidnaping or robbery, he could be 
sentenced to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was arrested five days after the nurse was killed in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. He was in possession of her truck and the weapon used to kill the 
woman, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense did not admit or deny the slaying during the trial. Thornton did 
not take the stand but has told police and relatives that he did not kill the 
nurse. DWAYNE BRAY

POWER TO THE PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a result of the recent appellate court decision, which informed the council 
of Thousand Oaks that it erred in appealing and overturning a Planning 
Commission decision, all city councils must give the future considerable 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, councils must appoint with considerable care commission members who are 
in harmony with the council. It is safe to say that those cities where each 
member selects a commissioner will have less of a problem. The commissioners, 
too, will need to have a fair understanding of that city's General Plan and the 
limitations of law. The council needs to bear in mind that the planning 
commission may make a decision that will stand, regardless of the majority of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows the councils to appoint themselves to serve as the planning 
commission. There may be some merit to this, in that the elected decision 
makers (who are responsible to the public and charged with the fiduciary 
responsibility) would actually have the opportunity to address the process from 
the beginning. This well might shorten the entire procedure, a result devoutly 
to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision mentioned that the council had responded to the "hue and cry of 
the crowd." It is the rare council or council member who does not respond, 
especially in an election year. Such a response may even be proper, if it 
really represents what is best for the city as a whole. It is not proper when 
it impinges on any legal rights of another. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, councils have brought a planning decision to the council because it 
does not reflect the council's interpretation of community goals. Perhaps the 
process should be altered to allow a group, willing to pay a nominal fee, to 
file an appeal on behalf of city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, this decision will be appealed and very likely your city and mine 
will join in the appeal. In all reasonableness, the decision might be more 
rational, were the planning commissioners elected, rather than appointed. As 
the system now stands, councils may find themselves frustrated by the very 
people they have appointed.

<P>
 The recent ruling of the state court against the city of Thousand Oaks is a 
travesty against all the people of California. The council heard the people and 
overturned the Planning Commission's approval of an overly built development 
because it met the General Plan that Thousand Oaks created over 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We blame the city for having outdated zoning areas and the Planning Commission 
for squeezing by environmental issues on an obviously sensitive wetland 
project. But for a state court to imply that council members can't listen to 
the "roar of the crowd," makes us angry. How else can the citizens of Thousand 
Oaks be heard besides going to the council meetings and speaking up against any 
issue? The three judges said the "city trampled on the developer's 
constitutional rights." What about the rights of the people in the community 
that will have a commercial development that is not needed and doesn't conform 
with the surrounding bedroom-community environment? 
</P>
<P>
 We implore the new council members to send this case to the California Supreme 
Court. Hopefully, they will hear the "roar of the crowd." We would also 
encourage the council to either ax the Planning Commission or see to it that 
the Planning Commission has neighborhood or homeowners group representatives on 
each development plan that goes before it. There should also be a committee 
formed to review outdated zoning areas. It would be nice if all these people 
would be elected officials.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 3% WATER RATE INCREASE EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Customers of Calleguas Water District will probably see a rate increase of 
about 3% next year, General Manager Donald R. Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district supplies water to about 75% of the residential customers in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said an expected increase of between 6% and 10% was averted by a 
restructuring of the rates by the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional revenue will pay for capital improvements to the water system, 
including a second feeder line to back up the main line that brings Northern 
California water to Calleguas customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact amount of the increase will be set by the Metropolitan Water 
District board this month, finalized in March and take effect in July, Kendall 
said. IRA E. STOLL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Westlake Village is asking its residents to think green by 
recycling their evergreens. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Dec. 27, Christmas trees can be discarded in trash bins at Bennett 
Park, 31800 Village Center Road, and City Hall, 4373 Park Terrace Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled trees will be turned into chips for mulch used in weed abatement 
and erosion control, according to the city planning director's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees should be stripped of metal stands and decorations, so far as 
possible. For information, call (818) 706-1613. MAKI BECKER

LEMON ORCHARD VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I attended a public hearing before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on 
the Oxnard Union High School District's request for a land variance. The 
district was attempting to satisfy an earlier contract agreement by selling 
back approximately 27 acres of lemon orchards to the original owner of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 4 to 0 and a loss of approximately $2 million to the Oxnard Union 
High School District, the supervisors, in agreement with representatives from 
the League of Women Voters and the Oxnard Beautiful Committee, made it 
perfectly clear that "maintaining the integrity of Oxnard's agriculture" was 
far more important than the education of Oxnard's youth. As a matter of fact, 
while maintaining the integrity of our agricultural areas, it was suggested 
that the Oxnard Union High School District teach its children to be lemon 
pickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time your children come home complaining there weren't enough textbooks 
to go around or classes were too crowded, take a drive down Wooley Road and 
show them the district's lemon orchard.

HELPING THE NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the era that I grew up ('30s and '40s), charity was a part of everyone's 
life. Those that had, gave, and those that were in need, received and gave 
thanks.In those days my family received more than they gave, and we were always 
thankful for the help we received. 
</P>
<P>
 As I grew older and became more successful in life, I found out how the givers 
felt when they actively donated time and material things to a person, family or 
charitable organization. Call it satisfying one's ego, but one feels something 
special when actively donating to a charity one believes is helping those who 
are in need and grateful for the help. I cannot remember a time when I, or 
others I knew, didn't give, with love in their hearts.  
</P>
<P>
 If you believe as I do, that actively giving gives satisfaction, then why do 
we support a system that gives to the needy through federal, state and local 
government taxes? I don't know one person who feels satisfaction when paying 
taxes. However, the political and social bureaucracies that take your taxes and 
distribute most to the so-called needy are feeling the satisfaction we should 
be feeling and are getting paid for it. We taxpayers must love misery instead 
of the satisfaction of actively giving because we keep feeding the bureaucrats' 
egos more each year.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PARENTS SEEK REMOVAL OF SCHOOLYARD TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of parents who have fumed for a year over a 90-foot microwave tower at 
El Morro Elementary School will formally air their complaint before school 
board members tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, who have organized under the banner of PEST, Parents for the 
Elimination of the Schoolyard Tower, say such equipment might pose a health 
risk for children and doesn't belong on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Paul Possemato said Monday that the equipment poses no health 
hazard, but the board will hear the parents and may take some action on the 
subject at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch Cellular, previously PacTel, installed the tower -- which allows 
cellular telephones to operate in the area -- and a microwave satellite at the 
school in August, 1993. A contract between the district and the company allowed 
AirTouch to lease the school property for $18,000 per year. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; FUND CRISIS, FOOTHILLS PROJECT AWAIT MAYOR

 Budget uncertainties in the wake of the county bankruptcy and a master-planned 
residential community proposed for the foothills within Brea's sphere of 
influence are among the issues facing Bev Perry as she begins her one-year term 
as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a huge responsibility," said Perry, who was named mayor last week 
by a unanimous vote of her City Council colleagues.Perry had served as mayor 
pro tem for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perry does have to worry about the $9-million Brea has tied up in the 
county investment pool, it could be worse. The city had $17 million in the pool 
in September but began withdrawing funds in response to a hike in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest planning issues during Perry's term will be the 284-acre 
Olinda Heights project planned for the foothills northeast the city. A revised 
environmental impact report is due out in January for the proposed community of 
up to 867 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving as mayor pro tem for the next year will be Burnie Dunlap, who is 
beginning his second four-year council term. In choosing Dunlap for the job, 
the council majority snubbed Kathryn E. Wiser. She is halfway through her first 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser said that she would have been "pleasantly surprised" to receive the 
mayor pro tem appointment but that she was not expecting council members to 
support her. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Perry, Dunlap and Wiser on the council are Glenn G. Parker and Lynn 
Daucher. Parker, the previous mayor, was elected to his second council term in 
November. Daucher, the only council newcomer, was the top vote-getter in last 
month's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring from the council was Carrey J. Nelson, who first joined the 
legislative body in 1978. ALAN EYERLY

DUI SUSPECTED IN MULTI-CAR FREEWAY CRASH; ACCIDENT: FIVE PEOPLE ARE INJURED IN 
CHAIN COLLISION SET OFF AFTER CAR HITS CENTER DIVIDER. TWO DRIVERS ARRESTED.

 A man suspected of drunk driving crashed into the center divider on the 
Riverside Freeway early Monday, triggering a chain-reaction accident that left 
five people injured and five vehicles demolished, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael J. Lindsey, 23, of Yorba Linda was heading east on the freeway when he 
lost control of his pickup truck about 1 a.m. and veered into the center 
divider at Weir Canyon Road, CHP Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other motorists, including another alleged drunk driver, tried to swerve 
out of the way but ended up smashing into one another, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the passengers suffered pretty serious scalp lacerations and head 
injuries," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified passenger was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
while four others were treated and released at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey and Gustavo Valdivia, 23, of Highland were arrested on suspicion of 
drunk driving. Monday's accident was the second in as many days involving 
alcohol and multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:30 a.m. Sunday, a man suspected of drunk driving plowed head-on into 
another car while traveling south in a northbound lanes of the San Diego 
Freeway near Harbor Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people were injured, and two men were arrested on suspicion of driving 
under the influence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accidents involving drunk drivers can happen any time," said Reidel Post, 
director of the Orange County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But during this time of the year, the chances are greater because there's an 
increase in the number of parties, where part of the celebration often includes 
intoxication," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 66 people were killed in Orange County in alcohol-related 
accidents, MADD statistics show.

RESTAURATEUR ARTHUR WHIZZIN DIES AT 88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Whizzin, famed owner of the now-defunct Chili Bowl restaurant chain and 
later the Canyon Club off Kanan Road in Agoura, has died. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Whizzin, a 14-year resident of Camarillo's Leisure Village, died Sunday from 
complications of Parkinson's disease, said his son, Bruce Whizzin of Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad was known for what he did in the restaurant business, but he was also a 
good athlete and outdoorsman," Bruce Whizzin said. "He was a good father and 
we're going to miss him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Whizzin opened his first restaurant, the T&T Cafe on Pico Boulevard in 1927. 
He did so well there that three years later he opened his first Chili Bowl 
restaurant at Crenshaw and Jefferson boulevards, the first of what would become 
nearly two dozen Chili Bowl locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chili Bowls were famous at the time," Bruce Whizzin said. "If you were in 
the movie business that's where you would hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Whizzin, who was born in Brooklyn, moved to California when he was 16 years 
old and held a series of different jobs before finding his niche in the 
restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Whizzin said that his father survived the Depression because of his keen 
business wits and because he always insisted upon owning the land where his 
eateries were located. At the time of his death, he owned property throughout 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, Whizzin developed what many Ventura Freeway commuters now know as the 
Canyon Club off Kanan Road as a small food store. Subsequent makeovers of the 
facility changed the small store to a cafe to the present modern restaurant, 
bar and entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Arthur Whizzin is survived by a daughter, Nancy 
Bleicher of North Hollywood; brothers Charly and Albert Whizzin, and sisters 
Frances Wasserman and Evelyn Benton. He is also survived by nine grandchildren 
and four great-grandchildren. Whizzin was married to the former Shirley Cohen, 
who died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held at 1 p.m. today at Adat Ari El Synagogue, 120 Burbank 
Blvd., North Hollywood. Burial will follow at Eden Cemetery in Sylmar.

MAN WOUNDED IN SHOOTING DISPUTE ABOUT PET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday arrested a man who allegedly struck a dog with his car 
and then shot a neighbor in a dispute over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Addington, 39, of Trabuco Canyon was being held at County Jail on 
suspicion of attempted murder after deputies used pepper spray to subdue him at 
his home on Pine Street, said Lt. Jay Mendez of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 2 p.m. when Timothy Benson, 34, of Trabuco Canyon saw 
Addington strike a neighbor's dog and then drive away, the resident later told 
police. When Addington returned to the site on Trabuco Oaks Drive later, Benson 
got into his car and pulled alongside Addington's to confront him, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two got into an argument, and Addington pulled out a handgun and fired 
twice, Mendez said. One of the shots hit Benson in the hip, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson was in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center 
in Mission Viejo, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies who later tracked Addington to his home in the same neighborhood used 
pepper spray when he refused to indicate he was no longer armed, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog survived the collision, he said.

PRO FOOTBALL; PLAYOFF ANALYSIS; WITH PARITY, IT'S ALL POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parity became parody this weekend as one of the most hair-raising Decembers in 
recent NFL history suddenly became one of the most confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see if we have this straight: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buddy Ryan still might make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Diego Chargers might not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Buffalo Bills are going away. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Fontes is not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If 73 different things happen, among them something that has to do with the 
alignment of the planets and Dan Reeves' necktie, the New York Giants will make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the Raiders can't summon the courage to finally beat the Kansas City 
Chiefs, they won't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Philadelphia Eagles have lost five consecutive games, but can make it 
all better with two consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have won three consecutive games for the first 
time in 12 years, yet were officially eliminated in the middle of that third 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first weekend of the NFC playoffs could consist entirely of teams from 
the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The quarterbacks for the final weekend of the AFC playoffs could be named 
O'Donnell and Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the league office, with 22 of the 28 teams still eligible for the 
Super Bowl, this ranks as the NFL's wildest finish ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, New Orleans Saints 
and Denver Broncos are among those 22 teams, that also ranks as one of the 
NFL's most misleading statistics ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still chaotic. Just ask the Dallas Cowboys, who must have been 
studying tiebreaking procedures before the final play in their 19-14 loss to 
the Cleveland Browns on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Troy Aikman had completed a five-yard pass to Jay Novacek that wound up 
inches short of a potential game-winning touchdown, a question was raised: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who was the primary receiver on the play?" 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Switzer, the coach, said it was Kevin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman, the quarterback, said it was Daryl Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Zampese, offensive coordinator, said it was Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 And the man who caught the ball? 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek said the primary receiver was Michael Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say what you want about the rest of the season, but the only measure 
of a team is what happens to them late in the year," said Leslie O'Neal, 
defensive end for the fading Chargers. "This is the time when you just cannot 
make mistakes. This is the time when great players make big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 And then cheer for other great players to mess up. 
</P>
<P>
 The most compelling scene of last weekend was not in Dallas, but in adjoining 
San Diego hotel rooms, where 49er linebackers Gary Plummer and Ken Norton Jr. 
were watching the Cowboys on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Testaverde has never had such enthusiastic fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have thought the wall was coming down, the way we banged on it," 
Plummer said. "Ken would bang on it from his side of the wall, then I would 
bang on it from my side. Toward the end of that game, we were so excited, we 
were beating on the wall the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this matters now. 
</P>
<P>
 After several weeks of calisthenics, the Cowboys and 49ers will meet in San 
Francisco on Jan. 15 in a Super Bowl disguised as an NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't know that for sure," Aikman protested last weekend. "That game 
is not on our schedule yet. We might not even see San Francisco again this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mind him. He's as unsettled as every other NFL observer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only theory that makes sense is that two years of mass player movement 
because the new free agency and salary cap have created a balance that was 
never before possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A system that had been criticized by all is now being applauded by fans and 
appreciated by those who play for losers turned winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Minnesota, visiting (club President) Roger Headrick, and he was 
saying that our agreement has enhanced competitive balance more than anything 
in the league," said Gene Upshaw, executive director of the players' union. "If 
a team has a four-game winning streak, next thing they know, they have a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "People write off Arizona, and then Arizona is back in it. New England was out 
of it, and now they are back. It really is true that any team can beat any 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the playoff picture: AFC 
</P>
<P>
 In: Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Any day now: The Chargers need only a victory over the demoralized New York 
Jets Sunday to clinch an AFC West title. If they can't win that game, they 
don't deserve to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mess at the bottom: The Raiders, Chiefs, Bills and New England Patriots 
are battling for the final two spots. Thanks to a bit of scheduling luck, the 
survivors here will be decided on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The game this weekend in Buffalo between the Patriots and Bills -- with Frank 
Reich replacing Jim Kelly as the Bills' quarterback -- probably will determine 
one wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Christmas Eve showdown between the Raiders and Chiefs 
probably will determine the other. What the Raiders have done to the Denver 
Broncos, the Chiefs have done to the Raiders, winning eight of their last nine 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't think sore-footed Joe Montana has received any get-well cards from 
Winston Moss. On second thought, maybe he has. 
</P>
<P>
 Probable playoff pairings: No way the Chargers win their remaining two games, 
not with the Steelers coming to town Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Chargers play host to the Patriots in the first round, while the 
Raiders visit the Browns and quarterback Testaverde in the first playoff game 
to end in a 0-0 tie after regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting to play second-round games at home would be the Dolphins with Dan 
Marino and the Steelers with, uh, Neil O'Donnell. NFC 
</P>
<P>
 In: The Cowboys and 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Any day now: A victory by the favored Minnesota Vikings in Detroit Saturday 
will give them the NFC Central title. 
</P>
<P>
 The mess at the bottom: The Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Chicago Bears, 
Giants and Eagles will fight for the wild-card spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Either the Giants or Eagles will be knocked out when the teams meet this 
weekend. Common sense would favor the Eagles, but then again, Bubby Brister has 
just been installed as their new quarterback, replacing Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Brister said he kept awake during his years on the sideline by 
"drinking lots of beer." If the Eagles win, they need only a victory at 
Cincinnati to ensure a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Another spot should go to the Bears, who could split remaining home games 
against the Rams and Patriots and still finish 9-7 and with tiebreaker 
advantages over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, with Steve Walsh's poor recent play, the Bears have finally been 
given an excuse to get Erik Kramer back into the lineup. And few quarterbacks 
are as good in December and January as Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope the final NFC spot will go to the Lions and Coach Fontes, whose 
personal resurgence is matched by his team's. Earlier this year, he stood on 
the sidelines looking confused. Now he looks downright cuddly. 
</P>
<P>
 But that spot will probably be stolen by the superior talent of the Packers, 
who need victories over Atlanta in Milwaukee and at Tampa Bay in the season 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Probable pairings: It should be a pedestrian first weekend, with the Bears 
visiting the Vikings and the Packers at the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The second round will not be much, either. The only team that can defeat the 
Cowboys at home is the 49ers. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 But that third weekend at Candlestick Park! Only then will the confusion end.

PRO FOOTBALL; NEED ANSWERS? RAIDER DEFENSE SUPPLIES THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen weeks ago, they took the field with a lot of question marks. Sunday, 
they came off the field with nothing but exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
 The two goal-line stands by the Raider defense against the Denver Broncos on 
Sunday made the headlines. But the play of the Raider defense is not news. Not 
to any of the last 10 teams that have faced the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has not yielded more than 21 points in a game since the fourth 
week of the season. Only one of its last eight opponents -- the Pittsburgh 
Steelers -- has rushed for more than 100 yards in a game. Excluding the Steeler 
game, in which the Raiders surrendered 175 yards on the ground, they have given 
up an average of only 58.6 yards a game to their last seven opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, there were many questions about the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would replace retired Howie Long on the defensive line? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would replace Greg Townsend, let go at the start of training camp, at 
defensive end? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would replace Joe Kelly, released largely because of salary-cap 
considerations, at middle linebacker? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would provide the leadership for a relatively young defense? 
</P>
<P>
 All the questions seem to have been resolved, some with unexpected answers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the key figures in Sunday's goal-line stands have been the key figures in 
the defensive surge. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerry Ball, defensive tackle. An eight-year veteran, Ball was signed as a 
backup for a defensive line that already seemed set. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Scott Davis, trying to come back from a two-year retirement, 
disappeared, first from the team for two weeks, then from the starting lineup 
permanently, Ball stepped in, all 300-plus pounds of him, exceeding even Coach 
Art Shell's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that he was that good a pass rusher," Shell said after 
watching Ball in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chester McGlockton, defensive tackle. McGlockton certainly can't be labeled 
a surprise, but his first two years in the league were hampered by injuries, 
which led to inconsistent play. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton started to come on at the end of last season before getting injured 
in the playoffs, but he has grown into one of the premier defensive tackles in 
the league, and he should expect a spot when this year's Pro Bowl team is 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan Harrison was moved from defensive tackle to end to replace Townsend, 
leaving the middle to McGlockton and Ball. That's more than 600 pounds of bulk 
for any ballcarrier to try to fight his way through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Biekert, middle linebacker. Biekert proved he had the toughness to 
replace Kelly in the middle in the first week of the season. Not on the playing 
field, but on the practice field. He had a fistfight with Davis, taking a punch 
that split the bridge of his nose. But he didn't miss any playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more this guy plays, the more you learn to appreciate his talent," Shell 
said of Biekert. "He's very smart, he makes very few mistakes. . . . He's a 
force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 There was some question whether Biekert, a second-year player, was ready to 
step in for Kelly with so little experience, but not in Shell's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having (former Raider linebacker) Matt Millen come into your 
organization," he said. "All he has to do is learn exactly what has to be done 
and let him go play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Albert Lewis, cornerback. When he was with the Raiders, defensive back 
Ronnie Lott provided leadership for his unit. When he left after the 1992 
season, veterans Terry McDaniel and Lionel Washington remained to fill the gap. 
But Lewis, signed as a free agent in the off-season and now in his 12th season, 
brought with him from the Kansas City Chiefs a more open style. When there was 
a need to criticize, Lewis wasn't hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
 He started in an uncomfortable position, replacing the popular Washington in 
the starting lineup. But Lewis succeeded through hard work and an honest 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raider defense seemed unable to sustain its effort into the fourth 
quarter of crucial games, Lewis called it a lack of maturity on the part of 
teammates he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie linebacker Rob Fredrickson, second-year safety Patrick Bates and 
short-yardage specialist Aundray Bruce have also contributed, as have the 
established veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our territory. You are not going to get in," Shell said in describing 
the mental approach the defense took on Sunday's goal-line stands. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an approach the defense has been taking more and more as the Raiders 
battle for a playoff berth.

IT'S NOT HEAT, IT'S HUMILITY; MINER LOSES MIAMI STARTING JOB, NOT POSITIVE 
APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sometimes Harold Miner merely wants to be normal. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to be a prisoner to his dream any more. He doesn't have to be 
"Baby Jordan." He won a dunk contest and it didn't change his life. He 
certainly doesn't need another night coming off Kevin Loughery's bench, or 
walking into an empty house a continent away from Inglewood and home. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about it last season when four Miami Heat guards played more than 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
 He's thinking about it again, even if he's too polite to say so, having 
recently lost his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the whole life," Miner, 23, said recently, smiling his sad smile. "It's 
hard to deal with. Constantly moving around, never knowing where you're going 
to be, year in, year out. That makes it hard. I'm a family-oriented-type 
person. I like to be around my family. Being away from them . . . it's very 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as hard as it was then (1992-93, his rookie season). It's just 
that I'm a lot older now, I'm more mature, I'm able to deal with it better but 
it's still hard because L.A. is my home." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Harold. Someone has to be different and it's you. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a star-struck world, normal kids didn't dream the way you did. Even in 
a neighborhood where everyone spent his waking hours on the playground, no one 
matched your devotion. Who else do you know who grew up to be 6 feet 5, 214 
pounds, with a pair of magic legs that could carry him aloft, to hover over the 
basket like some giant bird of prey? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody has to stand out, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Miner played behind Steve Smith. Then the Heat made a weird 
series of deals that sent away Smith and Rony Seikaly and brought in Kevin 
Willis and Billy Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Once logjammed at shooting guard, the Heat was now logjammed at small forward. 
But at least Miner was going to get a shot out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Harold is ready to step into a starting berth in the NBA," Loughery, 
the Miami coach, said after the Smith deal. "This is a tremendous opportunity 
for him to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was always a rush with Harold, coming in. He was very heralded. I 
think everybody wanted to rush Harold, forgot how young he was. And I think he 
had to learn the game. And now he's reached the point where he's going to get 
that opportunity. We feel he's at that level. And now he's gotta step up and do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seikaly: "It's been real hard for him. He was in a program (USC) where he 
was the man. He had to take a back step. It was definitely very hard for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why sometimes he came in and didn't really play like he should play 
because he really didn't have any enthusiasm to play. Because he knew if he 
came in and missed a couple of jumpers or didn't play defense well, he's going 
to come back out. He always had that leash on his neck.  
</P>
<P>
 "We always talked to him because we knew he was so good. Like in practices and 
stuff like that, he was basically unstoppable. We said, 'Don't worry about it, 
your time is going to come. Just be patient, keep working.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally his time has come. And now that he can just play and he could take as 
many shots as he wants, he's gonna up his game. He's a very good defensive 
player when he wants to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Wants to play? No one wants it the way Harold Miner does. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, after his nothing season, he came home and worked with a zeal 
that frightened his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was telling me, 'Calm down, slow down,' " Miner says. "I was working 
eight, nine hours a day in the summer, running on the track, running on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go running early in the morning with my trainer and then I'd come home, 
do 1,000 crunches. And then I'd put in a tape of one of my commercials or 
something and I'd feel guilty. I'd feel like I didn't deserve it. So I'd go out 
there and work a couple few more hours, earning it. She was telling me to relax 
sometimes, don't take it so seriously. But it's hard 'cause you know what it 
takes to be a great player so you just want to go out and work constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've learned to relax sometimes too. Sometimes I think I work a little 
too hard, running constantly. . . . I don't want to take a day off. If I take a 
day off, I feel like I'm cheating myself so it's kind of a mental thing. I just 
like to keep going, once I start something, full force into it." 
</P>
<P>
 A month after he went into the starting lineup, Miner came out. 
</P>
<P>
 In 13 starts, he had averaged 11 points and had given up more, while the Heat 
went 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find anywhere else to play the 6-9 Owens -- they had tried him at 
the point and both forward positions -- Loughery made him a shooting guard. And 
Miner became a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last start, Miner had two points in 19 minutes in a loss to the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some games I play real well and some I don't," he said. "I've gotten into 
foul trouble in a few games while trying to get adjusted to the new rules.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of games I've been playing well when I've been taken out, 
which is tough to deal with. But as a team, I don't think we're playing as well 
as we can play. I guess that's why they decided to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, he was the man, all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner was the sun and the rest of the players were the planets. The basic play 
was for Miner to take the ball and make something happen. He moved, his 
teammates reacted. On defense, they covered for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurt me a little bit," says Miner, who averaged 23.5 points in three 
seasons as a Trojan. "I was asked to do so much offensively that some other 
things may have been overlooked, in terms of rounding out my total game, but I 
don't have any regrets about it. I mean, I'm here, I'm in the NBA, I'm happy. 
It's just a matter of trying to grow. A lot of things I missed, I just have to 
take my time and gradually pick 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked pretty funny, a rookie waiting for his veteran teammates to clear 
out of his way so he could go one on one. Even if Miner put on some amazing 
shows -- his specialty was a breakout against the Lakers or the Clippers when 
family and friends could see -- the Heat had other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 His rookie season (a 10.3 scoring average in 73 games) was hard, but he 
expected it to be that way. His second season (10.5 in 63) was a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 His third season was a surprise. They handed him the job. He couldn't keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating at times," says Miner, who is averaging 10.1 
points. "I mean it's hard, to be perfectly honest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard 'cause I know what I can do. Everybody else knows what I can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an open question whether he will get another chance to do it in Miami, 
where the owners are selling, the coach is on a short leash and the team is in 
the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner, ever the good soldier, says he won't ask to be traded, will continue to 
play hard, try to do what's asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where we leave him, trying to catch up to their program and his dream.

JIM MURRAY: ELOQUENCE BELONGS TO NO ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why can't a woman be more like a man?  
</P>
<P>
 -- Prof. Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. 'Enry 'Iggins should have hung around a while. Women race cars, ride 
thoroughbreds, make putts, serve aces, play point guard, hit home runs, go into 
space, direct movies, run corporations, even run countries nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 They not only play sports, they write them. They go into battle, sit in the 
Senate, make our laws, judge them and set our policy. Santa Claus might turn 
out to be a woman next. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the secrets of the sports world for a long time was that women were 
often the biggest and most dedicated group of fans in any sport. Baseball put 
"Ladies Day" into the scene early in the game and those of us on the sports 
desk who checked our daily mail were well aware women made up the bulk of the 
readership some days. 
</P>
<P>
 It was women, really, who first embraced pro basketball and it was nothing to 
see fully half the spectators courtside at the Forum female. Doris Day and Dyan 
Cannon were Hollywood representatives at games long before Jack Nicholson and 
Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before they wanted to do more than watch and cheer. They wanted 
to comment, advise, second-guess, be a part of the sports scene. It wasn't long 
before women were as familiar a sight circulating in a sports locker room as 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 They had first cracked the barrier of sports journalism giving the "woman's 
angle." Turned out the woman's angle on a home run or an end run or an Olympic 
run wasn't significantly different. A home run was a home run, a goal was a 
goal, and, of course, an adverb was an adverb. Also, a "No comment!" or a "Get 
out of my face!" knew no sex.  
</P>
<P>
 There were some contretemps. Some athletes had as much trouble with gender 
equity as some editors. Some lawyers had to find court rulings that were 
conspicuously sexless but, of course, lawyers have no trouble finding what 
suits them or their clients.  
</P>
<P>
 So, it's altogether appropriate that a colleague, Ron Rapoport of the Daily 
News, should see fit to collect and publish an anthology of sportswriting by 
women and show the craft is in good hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Ron's collection is not "You've come a long way, baby." It doesn't treat the 
subject as Barbie Doll journalism. He notes that Mary Garber, who was to 
sportswriting what Amelia Earhart was to aviation, once presented several 
articles at a seminar of sports editors and asked them to identify the authors 
by sex. No one could.  
</P>
<P>
 The book is called "A Kind Of Grace" and it offers a compilation of 73 pieces 
from the women's side of sports viewing. It is good stuff. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Page 223, Joan Ryan of the San Francisco Examiner begins her piece, 
"Nine years before Mary Bacon put a bullet in her head at a Motel 6 in Ft. 
Worth, Tex., she had already begun to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon ever say it better? John Lardner? 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Page 104, Claire Smith of the New York Times is holding forth: "Steve 
Palermo and Dr. Lonise Bias would not seem to have a lot in common, one being a 
major league umpire (shot and paralyzed by an armed robber), the second being a 
doctor of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bias has also suffered grievous wounds in her life, having lost two sons, one 
to a drug overdose, one to murderous gunplay. Len Bias, Bias' talented 
basketball player son, died of a drug overdose on the eve of a professional 
career with the Boston Celtics.  
</P>
<P>
 "She speaks to athletes, most recently to major league rookies who gathered in 
Dallas last weekend. 'You have a responsibility on this earth. Will you cause 
other young men to be a curse upon this earth or will you cause them to be a 
blessing? For, you see, good advice with poor example is very confusing. You 
are educators whether you want to be or not. You will influence the decision of 
someone sitting at the table with you or someone who will be sitting in a 
ballpark looking at you. Either you will lead them to a life of prosperity or 
one of death and destruction.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs Dickens?  
</P>
<P>
 Take another Joan Ryan piece on page 332 on the other side of the Super Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wendy Kusuma walked last Sunday afternoon through downtown San Francisco, 
which was quiet and nearly empty. So many people were home watching the 
49ers-Dallas Cowboys game. 'I had this feeling of dread: Before the night's 
over we'll have more battered women in either Dallas or San Francisco,' she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Football Sundays are heavy workdays for battered women's shelters. A woman is 
battered by a husband or lover every 15 seconds of every day. One-third to 
one-half of all female murder victims die at the hands of spouses or lovers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Next week's Super Bowl Sunday could be the worst day of the year for battered 
women. It usually is. A wife or girlfriend steps in front of the television. 
She doesn't fetch his beer quickly enough. She can't keep the children quiet. 
She contradicts him in front of his friends. Anything can trigger the beating. 
But it's usually the beer, the betting, the bruising and banging of players on 
TV that lead the way. The athletes on screen -- men often admired to the point 
of reverence -- reaffirm the batterer's belief of what it takes to be a man: 
aggressive, dominant, physical." 
</P>
<P>
 Go, Raiders! 
</P>
<P>
 On Page 114, Michelle Kaufman of the Detroit Free Press zeroes in on a 
familiar figure. "Her father bought her a .22 rifle when she was in 
kindergarten and chopped off the stock so it would fit her tiny hands. Her 
mother has been married seven times. A drunk half-brother once tried to kiss 
her; she retaliated by burning him in the neck with a curling iron. Twice in 
the past two years, she filed for divorce and sought restraining orders against 
her hot-headed husband. Three months ago, police seized a handgun from her 
after it went off during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Less than a month before the Winter Olympics, Tonya Harding faces the 
toughest chapter of her tough life.  
</P>
<P>
 "Harding's background contradicts every image associated with figure skating. 
The new U.S. champion enjoys drag racing, rebuilding engines, playing pool, 
hunting, fishing. She smokes cigarettes, despite a serious asthmatic condition. 
While other skaters choose classical music, Harding has skated to such tunes as 
'Wild Thing' and 'Funky Cold Medina' and her skating dresses are a far cry from 
designer beauties." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. How's that for who, what, when, where and why, the journalist's fab five?  
</P>
<P>
 On Page 360, Helene Elliott of The Times takes the high road: "When he was a 
rookie, and other players mocked his devout Christianity, and his decision to 
abstain from sex until marriage, A.C. Green's steadfast faith helped him 
silence his doubters. 'One thing about me is, I don't feel I have many 
limitations. I feel I can really do anything. The Bible tells me -- and I 
really believe the Bible -- Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all things through 
Christ, who strengthens me," and this Scripture I take to heart.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Green runs a summer camp for children and someday he'd like to establish a 
home for unwed mothers. 'There has to be more emphasis put on self-control and 
responsibility. If there's so much sex education going on in schools, why are 
teen-age birth rates and abortion rates on the increase? There's a lot of 
things that weigh on my heart.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, was Dr. Bob Schuller more eloquent at the Crystal Cathedral?  
</P>
<P>
 A powerful argument for gender equity is this book. Of course, these women 
never hit a major league home run, scored a touchdown in the NFL, served aces 
at Wimbledon or high-sticked Wayne Gretzky. Come to think of it, neither did 
we.

PRO BASKETBALL; LEARNING THEIR LESSONS; CLIPPERS SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER 0-16 
START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach George Karl of the Seattle SuperSonics bowed as he passed Clipper Coach 
Bill Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Master Fitch, Master Fitch," Karl said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl might have been joking, but he genuinely admires the job Fitch has done 
in rejuvenating the Clippers, who have won two of three games after an 0-16 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way you want anyone to go through what they were going through," Karl 
said. "I was 2-19 my rookie season in coaching (with the 1984-85 Cleveland 
Cavaliers). I remember winning my third game on Christmas Day. There's not much 
you can do except work hard and coach hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a process of building, and every time I've seen them they're 
doing that. They're running the offense better and defensively they're more 
solid. And I think he's finding out about his players too. Everybody thinks you 
can do that in eight games in the exhibition season, but you can't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll be a decent basketball team by the end of the year. I don't 
know if that's 15 wins or 25 wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-oldest coach in the NBA, Fitch, 60, displayed patience with the 
Clippers at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a lesson that applies to most of life," Laker Coach Del Harris 
said. "If you stay at doing something with effort, you're going to improve. I 
think Fitch has shown a patience with them and I think they've shown a 
determination to continue to play hard through the good and bad times. If you 
(persevere), the good times, or better times, are close at hand. That's what 
impressed me about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when they were in the worst part of the streak, they played very hard 
and were giving themselves a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 One loss away from tying the NBA record for most at the start of a season, the 
Clippers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in overtime last Wednesday, 96-94. Then, 
playing with increased confidence, they defeated the Lakers by 25 points last 
Friday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Saturday, after losing to the SuperSonics by 25 points at the Tacoma 
Dome last month, the Clippers overcame a 14-point deficit and took Seattle to 
double overtime before losing at the Sports Arena, 132-127. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers earned respect by playing well against Seattle, which had the 
NBA's best record last season. Accustomed to being booed during their losing 
streak, the Clippers received several standing ovations for the gritty effort 
against the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch cautioned, however, that it's too early to determine whether the team 
has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won a couple games and people think we've automatically become miracle 
workers," he said. "But I don't think we were ever as bad as people made us 
out. People automatically think you're just terrible when you're 0-15. If you 
haven't been in that position in the NBA, you don't realize how easy it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have improved. Even if we lose the next 15 games, we should be better than 
(when) we were losing the previous 15. We're small and we're playing without a 
proven center and that's tough to do in this league, but in losing we'll be 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Elgin Baylor agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team has played better," he said. "In the beginning, we were a new team, 
a new bunch of young people who had never had the opportunity to play a lot of 
quality minutes and it takes a while to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-youngest team in the NBA and with six new players on the roster, 
the Clippers needed time to mesh. Most coaches determine a playing rotation by 
the end of training camp, but Fitch didn't come up with his until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a while to start jelling and learning each other," guard Pooh 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who struggled after being traded from the Indiana Pacers to the 
Clippers last summer, seems more comfortable now. He averaged 10.8 points and 
7.5 assists during the 16-game losing streak, but has averaged 20.3 points and 
12.7 assists in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers also needed time to adjust after losing center Stanley Roberts, 
who suffered a season-ending Achilles' tendon injury in their final home 
exhibition game. Guard Gary Grant, who has yet to play after undergoing knee 
surgery in September, joined the team in practice Monday and is expected to be 
activated before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides injuries, the Clippers also had to deal with distractions caused by 
center Elmore Spencer, who apparently is having emotional problems. He walked 
three miles back to the team hotel after storming out of a practice at training 
camp, and Fitch sent him home from practice the day before the Clippers' home 
opener. He didn't allow Spencer to practice after he was late for a workout 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who was expected to start in place of Roberts, then was put on the 
injured list last week while he receives treatment for emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Charles Outlaw, who had a career-high nine blocked shots against 
Seattle, said the Clippers never gave up on themselves despite losing 20 
consecutive games over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a team," Outlaw said. "People don't play with us, they just watch us. 
As long as we stick together, then we're all right. If we start getting down on 
ourselves, then that's not good. We stayed together through the hard times and 
we stayed together through the good times and we're going to stay together all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Terry Dehere said the Clippers didn't lose their work ethic during the 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept the spirit up through the 0-16," Dehere said. "We still came to 
practice after the 16th game and worked just as hard as in training camp. There 
wasn't anyone dogging it or taking the day off because of the 0-16. And that's 
what you've got to be more proud of. We came in each day and worked and we got 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught, who took the losing streak hard, has helped trigger the 
Clipper revival by playing with increased intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring a career-high 30 points and getting 14 rebounds in the Clippers' 
first victory, Vaught had 19 points and a season-high 15 rebounds against the 
Lakers. He had 20 points and 14 rebounds against the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaught credits Fitch for the Clippers' improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been patient with us," Vaught said. "He sits there with the videos and 
he gives us very detailed reports on the (opponents) so we pretty much know 
what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was patient with players at first and when the time came, he had enough 
courage to change the lineup. So he's shown some faith in rookies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers' surge coincides with the emergence of rookie forward Lamond 
Murray, the team's top draft pick. The Clippers are 2-1 since Murray replaced 
rookie center Matt Fish in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Massenburg, who started at power forward for the first 16 games, moved to 
center and Vaught switched back to power forward, the position he played last 
season, so that Murray could play small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Swingman Malik Sealy, who has started the last two games in place of Dehere, 
sidelined with a sprained right ankle, has also played well. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the Clippers have improved, they are still more likely to 
challenge the Philadelphia 76ers' all-time worst record (9-73) than they are 
for a playoff berth.

BETTMAN GETS OK TO CANCEL; HOCKEY: NHL OWNERS GIVE COMMISSIONER AUTHORITY TO 
FORGO SEASON IF 50 GAMES AND FULL PLAYOFFS CAN'T BE COMPLETED BY JULY 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL on Monday moved a step closer to shuttering its rinks, after its Board 
of Governors passed a resolution authorizing Commissioner Gary Bettman to 
cancel the 1994-95 season if he determines a 50-game season and full slate of 
best-of-seven playoff series cannot be completed by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman did not issue a deadline to the players' union for avoiding what he 
called "the horrible prospect" of canceling the season. However, the calendar 
will soon impose a deadline for him.  
</P>
<P>
 To cram a 10-day training camp, 50 games and two months of playoffs into the 
time frame set by the governors, Bettman said a collective bargaining agreement 
must be reached within seven to 10 days. Given their differences over salary 
arbitration and a proposed payroll tax, every minute they're not negotiating 
makes cancellation ever more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think we have that much time," said Tony Tavares, president of 
the Mighty Ducks. "My gut sense is that it's too late. I'm not speaking for 
everybody else. Personally, I feel that is really pushing it.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to assume you're going to get a deal before Christmas and open 
camps and people are going to forgo Christmas and the New Year's holidays. I 
think it's got to be (settled) before that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bettman: "At some point in the not-too-distant future we're going to run 
out of time. The date is coming. Some morning we're going to wake up and the 
schedule-maker, if we don't have a deal, is going to say, 'You're out of time. 
We can't get the schedule in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The lockout, which began Oct. 1 and has cut the season from 84 games to 60, 
appeared to be nearing an end when common ground was reached last week in 
defining entry-level salaries, rookie salaries and free agency. That progress 
halted last Tuesday, when the NHL, claiming players' concessions did not 
sufficiently slow salary growth, reintroduced a tax that peaked at 25% of the 
total payroll of clubs exceeding a limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Union head Bob Goodenow asked Bettman to withdraw the tax because "it was 
designed to operate as a cap." Bettman refused. On Monday, Bettman rallied the 
governors around the issue and they unanimously rejected the last union 
proposal because it did not include a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's unanimity in that (meeting) room, even on the tax issue," 
said Ed Snider, owner of the Philadelphia Flyers. "Especially when everyone saw 
the numbers on the tax issue. We must make a deal that works and if we can't, 
there's no sense in playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers, also remains determined to 
incorporate a tax into a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tax is absolutely in the cards," he said. "If it isn't, we won't be playing 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Clarke, general manager of the Flyers, said he fears for the future of the 
NHL if the season is wiped out -- but he would be more perturbed if it 
continued under past economic pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "To not have a season is going to hurt us all, not just the owners, but the 
players too," he said. "But the owners are getting hurt so bad, they have to 
risk this. We can't continue on the path we were (on). 
</P>
<P>
 "If they won't accept a tax, you hope there's some way (to make a trade-off in 
another area). If the tax is the reason we're not going to play this year, 
they've got to give us some reason we can come back and play. But there's 
nothing there now that I can see." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and Goodenow have not arranged a meeting, but a union spokesman said 
he expects negotiations to resume soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commissioner has said he wants to take a problem-solving approach toward 
the stumbling blocks we have encountered," Goodenow said in a statement. "I 
agree that such an approach would be helpful for the purpose of reaching an 
agreement before the entire season is canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 The room for compromise appears to be as limited as the time left for saving 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said the NHL has made all its major concessions, particularly in 
granting unrestricted free agency to veteran players. The union has said that 
in accepting a rookie salary cap, two-way contracts for entry-level players and 
capping signing bonuses, it has already yielded more than it intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty close to where we have to be if we're going to make a sensible 
deal to make an agreement that will address our problems," Bettman said. "If we 
needed to make a little bit of movement here or there to try and close it out, 
we would reach to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on where the negotiations seem to be going, I have a hard time 
envisioning how you make a deal without a tax or some other meaningful 
restraint on the increase in player salaries to give you what we have called a 
drag." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's meeting produced an air of gloom among club representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pessimistic right now," Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said. "It's a 
combination of too little time and being too far apart. Even if you get the 
major issues, what about all the gray areas? We are getting real short." 
</P>
<P>
 Said King co-owner Joe Cohen: "I think we have to work hard and get a 
settlement. I don't know if it's possible. We need a business that works for 
everybody, for the players and for the owners both." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said he is seeking such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first desire would have been to create a partnership. Somehow, salary cap 
became a dirty word and I don't understand it," he said. "The two sports that 
are playing and playing pretty well (the NFL and NBA), the sports with the 
highest salary on average, they have salary caps. They're really partnerships. 
It's a determination of how you're going to divide up money on a fair and 
equitable basis. And if you can do that and build together, the results can be 
phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had we problem-solved in partnership last summer we would have been off to a 
spectacular season and I think both sides would have reaped the benefits of 
that fabulously. As it stands now, we're dealing with a potentially difficult 
-- if not disastrous -- situation. But we've got a league that has got 
fundamental problems. A healthy league does not shut itself down for 75 days 
unless it has profound problems it's trying to address."

BASEBALL LABOR TALKS; EXTENSION ONLY RESULT OF EMOTIONAL MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final hours of the attempt to reach a negotiated settlement in baseball's 
four-month-old bargaining dispute turned out to be long and contentious ones 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In what a management official said was an often venomous meeting here that 
ended at 1:15 Tuesday morning, the owners ultimately gave the players union an 
extension until mid-morning to accept or reject their Sunday night tax proposal 
that the union continued to characterize as a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication, however, that the owners would extend their 
implementation deadline. They still are scheduled to meet in Chicago on 
Thursday to declare a bargaining impasse and unilaterally impose the salary cap 
proposal made on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has yet to officially reject the latest management proposal, but a 
union lawyer compared it to a Rube Goldberg contraption and said it contains 
the same spending deterrents that the owners' high-rate tax plan of Nov. 17 did 
and the same deterrents as the salary cap proposal the owners have kept on the 
table while juggling the tax plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't read anything into the fact that we're going late tonight," Dodger 
pitcher Orel Hershiser said. "If the mediator wants to have a meeting and the 
owners are willing, we'll be there, but we're still talking about issues that 
have been there since June." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking, Hershiser added, without really bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to get to the heart of the issue," Kansas City Royal 
pitcher David Cone said. "We're trying to say to the owners, 'Let's cut through 
all the technicalities and side issues so that we can get to your best offer.' 
We're trying to say, 'What's the one primary reason you want to implement?' and 
maybe we can find a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to be a little late in the procedure for all of that, and only the 
tenacious effort of special mediator William J. Usery to keep the sides at the 
table and the owners out of Chicago probably prevented the talks from 
dissolving during Monday's emotional pre-dinner phase. It was then, one union 
official said, that the players "railed against the owners phony deadlines" and 
virtually pleaded with them not to wipe out 25 years of negotiations by 
implementing their "regressive salary cap proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 "At least no one got hurt in there," Atlanta Brave pitcher Tom Glavine said of 
the intense atmosphere as the sides broke for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Said union leader Donald Fehr at the end of the long night: "There was a lot 
of discussion. I'm not sure it went anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 His associate counsel, Eugene Orza, said that after crunching numbers 
overnight and throughout the day that their initial impression of the owners 
latest proposal as another cap in disguise hadn't changed. He also said it was 
fundamentally different from the players' plan in the context of where the 
money comes from and where it goes. The owners' plan would virtually match the 
players' flat payroll tax of 5%, but a secondary rate escalates rapidly after 
payrolls pass a $34.8 million threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the compensation level down to 50% of revenue, but this 
isn't a cap," Colorado Rockies' owner Jerry McMorris said. "When you hit a cap 
you're done. That doesn't happen with this plan. It will put a 25% to 35% less 
drag on salaries than our previous proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but the certainty that these talks will not go beyond today seemed to 
be 100%.

KNOX WON'T QUIT RAMS; JOHNSON REPORT DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Monday that quitting "is not in my vocabulary" but Ram 
President John Shaw said the coach's future will be discussed with owner 
Georgia Frontiere after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Dallas Morning News reported Monday that the Rams already have 
had conversations with former Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson and his 
attorney about Johnson coaching the team, Shaw said that was not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had a number of conversations with Jimmy Johnson but I have had no 
conversation with him about employment," Shaw said. "And I have not discussed 
any such thing with his attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, who is paid more than $700,000 a year, has a year left on a four-year 
contract. A 15-31 record, dwindling fan interest and the prospect of a fresh 
start elsewhere have raised speculation Knox will be fired at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate talking about (Knox) with ownership at the end of the season," 
Shaw said. "There are a number of factors involved: Whether we move or don't 
move, for example. But there have been no discussions at this time, and there 
won't be until the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Monday, if the team moves, he intends to go with it, and under no 
circumstances will he resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this a long time, and no, that would not be something I would 
think about," he said. "I have never walked away from anything in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say I was going to come in here and turn this around in three years. 
I expected to have a good year this year, based on the people we had gotten 
signed, but some things have happened and we haven't gotten it done. I signed a 
four-year contract and I still have a year to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnson rumors began early this season, but Johnson was quoted recently as 
saying that his attorney has had talks with the Rams about his return to 
coaching. Knox, who particularly enjoys NFL gossip and who regularly stays in 
touch with league officials, said he was unaware of the Jimmy 
Johnson-to-the-Rams talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard that," Knox said. "I wouldn't bother to check it out, and I 
haven't heard it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he has not spoken to management about his future. "Why should I?" he 
said. "I don't speak to management about those kind of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox inherited a team that finished 3-13, and guided it to a 6-10 mark in 
1992, 5-11 in 1993 and 4-10 so far this season.

INDICATION IS THAT RAMS WILL LEAVE; PRO FOOTBALL: BOOSTERS MEET FRONTIERE, SHAW 
AND COME AWAY FEELING DECISION TO MOVE TO ST. LOUIS ALREADY HAS BEEN MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A two-hour meeting with Ram owner Georgia Frontiere and President John Shaw 
has left the president of the team's booster club pessimistic about Orange 
County's chances of keeping the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the sense they're fairly committed to going to St. Louis," said Frank 
Bryant, who joined booster club vice president Linda Moomau for the meeting at 
Frontiere's home in Bel-Air last Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't say that, but during the conversation, it sounded more like a 
conclusion than a possibility. They were talking about how things 'will' be 
rather than how they 'might' be. That leads me to believe someone is already 
thinking they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting marked the first time Frontiere has discussed the team's possible 
relocation with a group trying to prevent the move. Repeated attempts by Save 
the Rams, of which Bryant is a member, for a meeting with the owner have been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was strictly from a fan's viewpoint -- we weren't representing Save the 
Rams," Bryant said. "She wanted to meet with us primarily because she feels 
that even though she might make a decision to move, she owes the fans something 
after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant said he stressed to Frontiere that "it's only a small minority" of fans 
who say disparaging things about the owner, and that there are a number of 
sincere fans who don't want the team to leave, regardless of what she reads in 
the newspaper. "But that doesn't reduce the hurt of what some fans say," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boosters asked Frontiere what they could do to persuade her to stay. "She 
said it's a business decision, that the dollar amounts are so large (in St. 
Louis) that it's difficult to not give that serious consideration," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis is offering a new, publicly financed, 70,000-seat domed stadium and 
a lucrative lease that could net the Rams profits of about $25 million a year. 
The Rams, suffering from sagging attendance, say they are projecting a 
$6-million loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Also discussed was the impact of Orange County's financial crisis. "It's going 
to make it a little easier when they make their (relocation) presentation to 
the NFL," Bryant said.  
</P>
<P>
 The league probably will vote on the move at its March meetings.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: COACHES SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH, NOT RUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school football coach is often the most visible staff member on campus 
and in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the vast popularity of the sport, the position requires a great 
deal of responsibility and maturity. The team is often a rallying point for the 
student body. Games draw thousands of fans, and media coverage can be 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, the manner in which a coach conducts himself on and off the 
field is vital. After all, he is a person in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, coaches sometimes forget the importance of their role. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case last Friday, moments after Bloomington had completed a 
perfect season by defeating La Mirada in the Southern Section Division VIII 
championship. La Mirada Coach John Mele, when asked about Bloomington's 
high-powered offense, shrugged and walked away from reporters gathered on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett would not talk after his team's lopsided loss to 
Sylmar in the City Section Division 4-A title game Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no comment to any of you," he told reporters. "You can call me at 
school Monday if you want to talk about the game. I've got nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett was upset over his team's 38-6 loss. He was also agitated because 
Sylmar had kicked a field goal with two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the Crenshaw student body during the postgame awards ceremony, 
Garrett blasted Sylmar for "rubbing it in." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration is understandable. Coaches put in long hours and receive 
little monetary compensation. They have to help raise money for equipment, 
monitor grades of their players and offer personal advice when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands, however, do not excuse rudeness. What kind of message does a 
coach send to his team when he turns his back on reporters or criticizes the 
opposition in front of the entire school? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always concerned about our coaches being good sports and representing 
their schools well," said Barbara Fiege, City Section commissioner. "Walking 
away from the press is not good for kids or the section."

 Santa Ana Mater Dei's 28-21 victory over La Puente Bishop Amat in the Southern 
Section Division I championship game last Saturday night improved its record to 
14-0 and gave it the No. 1 ranking in The Times' final poll of Southland teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, eliminated by Mater Dei in the semifinals, finished No. 2, and 
previously undefeated and top-ranked Bishop Amat dropped to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The state rankings, compiled by Cal-Hi Sports, will be released today, and 
Concord De La Salle is expected to finish No. 1. It replaces Bishop Amat, which 
held the top spot all season. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Salle finished the season 13-0, extending its winning streak to 39 
games. The Spartans, who compete in the North Coast Section, have won 134 of 
their last 138 games under Coach Bob Ladouceur. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Eidson, a De La Salle assistant coach, said several Southland schools, 
including Los Alamitos and Sante Fe Springs St. Paul, have contacted the school 
about a nonleague game next season. "Our main concern here is getting too 
excited about a game early in the season and then being flat for league play," 
Eidson said. "I think our ultimate goal would be to get a game against a 
Southern California team at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year, Channel 13 televised the Southern Section 
Division I championship game and Mater Dei's victory over Bishop Amat got an 
impressive 6.0 rating and a 10 share. The three-hour telecast registered its 
highest rating during the final 45 minutes with a 6.7 and a 12. Sports 
programming on Channel 9 Saturday night did not fare as well. The Laker-Clipper 
game got a 5.1 rating and a 9 share, and the Michigan-Duke delayed basketball 
game finished with a 2.0 and a 4. Each rating point represents about 50,000 
homes in the greater Los Angeles area. Last year, Channel 13 averaged a 4.4 
rating and an 8 share for the Mater Dei-Rialto Eisenhower title game. The 
station is in the second year of a three-year contract with the Southern 
Section to televise the Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Southland's top running backs fell short in their goal to break 
the single-season touchdown scoring record of 46 set by David Dotson of Moreno 
Valley Valley View in 1991. Bloomington's Greg Oliver scored four touchdowns 
against La Mirada, giving him 45. Steve Wofford of Bakersfield finished with 43 
and Ted Iacenda of Newhall Hart with 42. Oliver did break Dotson's 
single-season scoring record of 282 points set in 1991. Oliver's 45 touchdowns 
and 41 two-point conversions gave him 352 points. Wofford also set the record 
for most touchdowns in a career with 107, breaking the mark of 94 set by 
Russell White of Encino Crespi from 1986-88.

RAIDERS' POSSIBILITIES COMPLICATED BUT SIMPLE: WIN AND THEY'RE IN

 All the Raiders know for sure at this point is that they won't have home-field 
advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. They can't catch the Pittsburgh Steelers 
(11-3). 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, all things are possible for the 8-6 Raiders, all things good 
and bad, everything from a division title to sitting out the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 If they win their remaining two games, the Raiders are guaranteed a playoff 
spot and could even win the AFC West if the San Diego Chargers lose their final 
two games, on the road against the New York Jets and at home against the 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders and San Diego both finish 10-6, the Chargers will win the 
division because the two split their head-to-head competition and San Diego 
would have the better division record at 6-2. The Raiders would be 5-3. STEVE

 The Raiders are the most injury-free of the playoff contenders in the AFC West 
Division. The only players with physical problems are safety Eddie Anderson, 
who has a slight groin pull, and cornerback Lionel Washington, who has a calf 
bruise.Anderson is expected to play Sunday against the Seahawks in Seattle. 
Washington is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos was a rarity for quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler, who had a chance to go home rather than go in for medical treatment. 
Three of the previous four weeks, he had been injured, suffering jammed toes 
against the Rams, a concussion against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and a punctured 
hand against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he miss the trainer's room Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a decision I was not going to go in there, no matter what," Hostetler 
said with a big grin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game was the Raiders' 550th, counting regular season and playoffs. It 
was the first in which a Raider kicked five field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In setting the club record Sunday, Jeff Jaeger broke the mark of four first 
set by Mike Mercer in 1965 against the Houston Oilers, and then equaled five 
times by George Blanda. Blanda kicked four field goals in regular-season games 
against Houston in 1967, Denver in 1968 and the Miami Dolphins in 1973. Blanda 
also kicked four field goals against Houston in 1967 and against Pittsburgh in 
1973 in playoff games. STEVE SPRINGER

 Although quarterback Chris Chandler failed to inspire the troops, Coach Chuck 
Knox said he will start again Sunday against the Bears in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason to change," Knox said."Chandler had the misfortune of 
having seven balls that could have been caught. He made two big throws for 
touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler completed 18 of 34 passes for 199 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not give Tommy Maddox a look? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to play these last two games to win, with the best people that we 
have," Knox said.

<P>
 Knox was asked which Rams merited Pro Bowl balloting attention this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to think about that a little bit before I answer," he said. "If I 
answer that right now, I might leave off a guy or two."

 At day's end, Knox was still thinking.

INJURY; CUNNINGHAM LOSES EAGLE JOB TO BRISTER

 If the Buffalo Bills are going to make the playoffs, they'll have to do it 
without quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, 34, said Monday he is finished for the regular season, having sprained 
his left knee during Buffalo's 21-17 loss to Minnesota on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An MRI showed a stretched anterior cruciate ligament, but team doctors said 
they want to check again in three days to make sure there wasn't also a minor 
tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm definitely out for the next two games," Kelly said. "The way it 
feels right now, it doesn't look good. . . . I've had knee injuries before, and 
this one's a little bit sorer than I've ever had before." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marv Levy said he would wait for the doctors' report before making any 
decisions about Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. If Kelly is 
unable to play, the Bills (7-7) will be led by Frank Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kelly injured his knee at the end of the 1992 season, Reich started two 
playoff games and won them both, bringing Buffalo back from a 32-point 
second-half deficit to beat the Houston Oilers in the AFC wild-card game -- the 
biggest comeback in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the Philadelphia Eagles lost their fifth consecutive game, Coach 
Rich Kotite benched quarterback Randall Cunningham in favor of Bubby Brister, 
who gets the start in Sunday's crucial game against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that from a standpoint of offense, we need more consistency," 
said Kotite, whose Eagles have averaged 11 points a game during a losing streak 
that has seen them drop from 7-2 to 7-7. 
</P>

<P>
 Eagle owner Jeffrey Lurie would not say whether he will try to hire former 
Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Morning News, citing an unidentified source, reported that Johnson 
is expected to announce Sunday whether he will return to coaching next season 
with the Eagles or remain a broadcaster.

 Patrick Haggerty, an NFL referee whose career spanned 28 years and three Super 
Bowls, has died of complications from prostate and bone cancer. He was 67.

 Seattle Seahawk safety Eugene Robinson and offensive tackle Ray Roberts will 
be sidelined for the season after suffering a torn Achilles' tendon and a 
broken leg, respectively, in a 16-14 victory Sunday in Houston. . . . 
Pittsburgh Steeler running back Bam Morris has a broken little finger on his 
left hand to go with the reaggravated left ankle sprain that could sideline him 
for Sunday's pivotal game against the Cleveland Browns. . . . San Diego Charger 
linebacker Junior Seau underwent MRI exams on his neck, left shoulder and left 
knee. The Chargers will decide by Wednesday whether to give the struggling 
linebacker some time off. . . . Washington Redskin offensive tackle Jim Lachey 
was hospitalized because of a six-to-seven-inch-long and one-inch-deep gash on 
the inside of Lachey's left calf suffered Sunday against Arizona and is 
probably done for the season. . . . Indianapolis Colt Coach Ted Marchibroda, 
who replaced Jim Harbaugh with Don Majkowski six games ago, said another 
shake-up at quarterback is imminent. Majkowski, 3-3 as the starter, has not 
given the Colts the improvement they had hoped for when he replaced Harbaugh, 
Marchibroda said. . . .

 Cincinnati Bengal fullback Derrick Fenner was arraigned in Hamilton County 
Municipal Court on charges of resisting arrest, inciting to violence and 
disorderly conduct while intoxicated after he allegedly threatened a police 
officer and incited a crowd in a tavern. A judge set bond at $16,000. . . . New 
Orleans Saint offensive lineman Richard Cooper has a dislocated right elbow and 
will be sidelined two to three weeks. . . . Wide receiver Tom Waddle is 
expected to return this week for the Chicago Bears. He has been out after knee 
surgery. . . . Denver Bronco Coach Wade Phillips said quarterback John Elway, 
who did not play Sunday against the Raiders, is listed as day-to-day for 
Sunday's game in San Francisco. When asked if he has considered holding Elway 
out the rest of the season, Phillips said, "You couldn't hold him out. He 
wouldn't let you."

 Former Angel and Kansas City Royal first baseman Willie Mays Aikens on Monday 
was sentenced to 20 years and eight months in prison without parole. U.S. 
District Judge Dean Whipple also ordered him to pay an $18,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikens, 40, was convicted Aug. 16 of four counts of crack cocaine distribution 
and one count of use of a firearm during drug trafficking.He later pleaded 
guilty to bribery for offering $100 to a drug-testing official to submit a 
false urine specimen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the drug case, Aikens was convicted of selling 63 grams of crack to an 
undercover police officer in January and February of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikens' attorney contended his client was entrapped by the undercover officer. 
But prosecutors argued Aikens' home was full of the equipment necessary to cook 
crack and noted the officer was able to buy crack on four different occasions.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: FOR SOME, HOLIDAYS ARE A SEASON OF LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

 When Denise Crofton's only child passed away 3 1/2 years ago, she felt as if 
she died with her 18-year-old daughter, Alexa. Since that tragic day in May, 
1991, Crofton has found all holidays, except her daughter's birthday, 
impossible to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas was always a wonderful time for us, but without Alexa, my husband 
and I just can't handle the festivities. It's too painful," says Crofton, 46, 
who moved from Orange County to San Diego after her daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we know Alexa would want us to celebrate, we just can't. We don't 
decorate, send out Christmas cards or go into the stores during the holidays," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the holiday season is supposed to be a time of joy, comfort and 
fellowship with loved ones, it can be an emotionally difficult time for 
individuals who have lost a loved one, says Costa Mesa marriage, family, child 
counselor Elizabeth Slocum. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are acutely aware of the fact that they no longer buy a present for 
the deceased person and that there is an empty chair at the dinner table," she 
says, adding that holidays trigger feelings of grief and loss. 
</P>
<P>
 How deeply the loss is felt during the holiday season depends on a number of 
things, including who the loved one was, how he or she died and how far along a 
person is in the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bereavement process is often more difficult for the person who lost a 
loved one suddenly, and if the deceased is his or her child. That can take a 
lifetime to get over," says Slocum. "Every Christmas, parents can't help but 
think of what could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Crofton says that it's too painful to think about what life could have 
been like for her pretty, athletic, outgoing daughter. "When we see babies, it 
kills us to know that we'll never be grandparents and our daughter will never 
be married," she says. "It's very difficult to think about, so we try not to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Croftons find the holiday season as painful today as it was the first 
November and December they spent without her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first Thanksgiving we went to a coffee shop at 4 in the afternoon for 
turkey, dressed in terrible, dirty sweats. That first Christmas we drove 
through the Pacific Northwest and spent Christmas morning in a hotel room 
holding onto each other and crying," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent holidays haven't been any easier for the Croftons. "We thought the 
pain would soften, but it hasn't," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Crofton's daughter, Alexa, was found to have incurable adrenal cancer in late 
January, 1991, and died less than four months later at St. Joseph Hospital in 
Orange. Although she had been suffering from a variety of symptoms since her 
senior year in high school, doctors didn't diagnose her condition until she 
became seriously ill and returned home during her first year at college in 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time doctors removed the tumor in her left adrenal gland, the cancer 
had spread throughout her body. Despite doubts, she did survive surgery and 
spent the next few weeks in and out of the hospital until she told her mother 
she loved her and died in her father's arms May 27, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their daughter's death, the Croftons have received many invitations to 
friends' houses for the holidays, but they always decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too difficult for us to celebrate the holidays," says John Crofton, 54, 
who retired in 1985 from an executive position with a fast-food restaurant 
chain to spend more time with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The void is tremendous," he says. "We had it so good and now we can't have 
it, so why bother watching another family celebrate? I suppose there's a little 
bit of jealousy involved." 
</P>
<P>
 John Crofton looks back fondly on their last Christmas together, which was a 
little more than a month before Alexa's cancer was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally open presents in the morning with the entire extended family, but 
that particular Christmas we decided to open them on Christmas Eve, just the 
three of us. Alexa really enjoyed that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they won't celebrate, remembering their daughter during the holiday 
season is important to the Croftons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about Alexa and the good times we shared," says John Crofton. 
"Whenever something triggers a memory, we'll share it with each other and other 
people. We are very open to hearing from her friends as well." 
</P>
<P>
 People who have lost someone like to talk about the person and like others to 
mention him or her, says Denise Crofton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it when people say her name," she says. "The more people mention Alexa 
and talk about her, the more therapeutic it is for me. The absolute worst would 
be if she was forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty friends visited Alexa in the hospital the day before she died and there 
were 750 to 800 people at her funeral. Even though she'd only attended college 
in Indiana for one semester, 100 people showed up at her memorial service 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss Alexa tons," says Erin Marlin, 21, who was close friends with Alexa 
for four years before she died. "She was a wonderful person who was beautiful 
inside and out. She didn't dislike anyone or talk bad about people. She was 
always happy and laughing and made me feel good, even when I was in a bad 
mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin was a year younger than Alexa and met her through friends at Foothill 
High School in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clicked and became the best of friends really fast," says Marlin. "We'd 
spend the summers and holiday breaks together and stay up until all hours of 
the night talking. I trusted her completely." 
</P>
<P>
 When Alexa became sick so quickly, Marlin found the experience very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so frightened for her when she was sick," she says. "When she passed 
away, it felt like someone had torn the insides out of me. All I wanted to do 
was lay in bed and cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her death, Marlin has found the holiday season difficult to celebrate. 
"In my house, we have a Hanukkah dinner and invite our friends, but it's 
difficult, because my best friend isn't able to be there with me," says Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marlin usually doesn't pray aloud in temple, she always says a 
mourner's kaddish for Alexa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say the prayer with her in mind every time, and then I read a poem in the 
prayer book about life and death," says Marlin. "That calms me and makes me 
remember all the good times we shared."

REALITY 101; COLLEGE SENIORS WHO STUDY THE JOB MARKET KNOW IT'S UGLY OUT THERE. 
HOW CAN ANYONE GET AHEAD? THREE STUDENTS SHARE HOPES AND STRATEGIES.

 The coming spring could be uncharacteristically chilly -- if you're a new 
college graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment prospects are not encouraging. Modest improvements in the job 
market during the last two years won't nearly offset a decline of more than 30% 
between 1988 and 1993, says Patrick Scheetz, director of the Collegiate 
Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the efforts of college seniors seem "very laid back," says 
Scheetz, who talks to students in his other capacity as assistant director of 
placement services at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors seem to think that they need to earn grades now and look for work 
later, or that, "The dear Lord will take care of me when graduation rolls 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Scheetz warns that seniors should be pursuing jobs now through networking, 
resumes, cover letters and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does it take to get that first post-graduation paycheck? Starting 
today, The Times will follow three Southern California students through their 
job searches to find out. We'll catch up with them in a couple of months and 
conclude when they graduate in the spring.

 Name: Lance Ralls 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 22 
</P>
<P>
 School: UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Major: Mechanical Engineering 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the large Placement and Career Planning Center at UCLA, Lance Ralls is 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be here all day tomorrow," he tells a receptionist. "I've got three 
interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralls, who grew up in Chowchilla and is the son of a tire shop manager and a 
city clerk, says he is optimistic about getting a job: "It seems I could get at 
least a few offers in different fields." 
</P>
<P>
 He started his search early. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, he talked to seniors about their plans, attended career days and 
learned how to use the placement center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They installed a computer that does everything," he says. "If someone doesn't 
understand the procedure, it could cost them an interview." 
</P>
<P>
 The summer after his junior year, Ralls landed an engineering internship with 
a Pasadena firm. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, he arranged for campus placement counselors to critique his resume 
and film him in a mock job interview. The first four weeks of the quarter, he 
spent more time at the placement center than on any class. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to research the companies," he says. "They all have pamphlets and 
annual reports. The interviewer asks what do you know about us or like about 
us? You should ask questions. They want to see if you've spent time on them." 
</P>
<P>
 His 3.6 grade-point average in his major (3.3 overall) helped get Ralls about 
15 interviews, which he attends in a new pin-striped dark suit and white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go through interviews, you see that it's engineers and econ majors 
with lots of math and accounting (that) a lot of the jobs are targeted for," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends who are history, political science or sociology majors, unless 
they've had some accounting, are going to grad school or law school." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews have also taught him about the quirkiness of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing is that some time you could have an off day or you are 
not compatible with the interviewer. That can decide your future with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some where it clicked and I had a great time. Another time I didn't 
click and you could tell it was over. You know your fate in about 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Because some interviews clicked, Ralls recently bought another suit because 
companies have invited him back for 10 second or third meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he's invited back on two-thirds of the first interviews 
suggests that he has what companies are looking for," says Bill Locklear, 
acting director of the placement center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to find a job that has a lot of diversity," Ralls says. "And a job 
where I can lead and still be a team player. And I'm looking for work with a 
client -- people who are having a problem I can help solve." 
</P>
<P>
 He's applying for positions including engineering management, technical sales 
and training as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just to make sure I'm not flipping burgers next fall," he says, "even 
though I could probably figure the aerodynamics of the burgers as they flip." 
</P>

 Name: Matthew Glasser 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 21 
</P>
<P>
 School: Occidental College 
</P>
<P>
 Major: Public Policy 
</P>
<P>
 News reports told Matthew Glasser that the economy would not welcome new 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 His concerns about his future are magnified by Democratic losses in the Nov. 8 
election. Glasser is seeking a job as a political or community organizer with 
"the progressive left." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are a lot of people I might have worked for no longer in office, but 
a lot of their staffs are looking for work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disillusioning to recognize that it's going to be an uphill battle. 
We've been studying hard and honing our skills. Getting a job should be the 
easy part." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his 3.65 grade-point average, work experience and contacts make 
the slender, soft-spoken former Calabasas High student optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm single and willing to travel," says Glasser, whose father is a 
psychiatrist and whose mother is a dietitian. "I think I have not only the 
skills, but the confidence to know I can do the job. The opportunities are 
there. I just need to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasser helped with strategy and media relations for Proposition 186, the 
unsuccessful health-care measure in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked precincts and phoned voters to fight the National Rifle Assn.'s 
attempt to recall state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 He also worked with a coalition to defeat a state Assembly bill that limited 
local rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 And he studied one semester in Washington, D.C., where he worked for the U.S. 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel prepared to go out to work because I've already worked," Glasser says. 
"It's tough, but especially in the field I'm in, it's essential. It's one thing 
to study how things should be and another to experience how they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field isn't that organized," he says. "People rarely come out looking for 
help. You have to network with contacts and see what's available. People have 
said they were very happy with my performance, and we'd like to have you if the 
money is around. I'll have to see if those opportunities materialize." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasser has been trying to enhance his opportunities by checking Occidental's 
Career Development Center for names of alumni in his field and training on how 
to interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it's too early to interview now. "Often, political and community 
groups need to hire right away and get someone who can begin soon, and I 
wouldn't be available until graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll send out resumes and make contacts after Christmas. He'd prefer a 
permanent position with a campaign consulting firm or a progressive foundation 
to a temporary one with a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 If no opportunity develops, he'll start an organization to "disseminate 
information about jobs on the progressive left." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd try to finance the project through donations from foundations or the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to find information by networking," he says. "This will go a step 
further and help place people in internships and jobs."

 Name: Adria Blakely 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 22 
</P>
<P>
 School: Cal State Dominguez Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Major: Public Administration 
</P>
<P>
 Adria Blakely's search for a job in health education has been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Locke High School in South Los Angeles, Blakely has taken steps 
to prepare herself for a career teaching people in hospitals or schools how to 
stay healthy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to many people about my interests just to get a feel for the 
profession," says Blakely, whose mother is a clerk at the Watts Health 
Foundation and a former dental hygienist; her father is a plumber in 
Sacramento. Some time ago, she had seen a job announcement for a health 
educator. "The duties -- speaking with patients about nutrition or sexually 
transmitted diseases or doing workshops -- made me realize here was something I 
would be interested in doing." 
</P>
<P>
 She will graduate from Cal State Dominguez Hills in May with a degree in 
public administration. That will provide management skills, while a 
concentration in health sciences prepares her for her chosen specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 She's employed part-time in the school's health center, where she's learned to 
work on computers, and as a teen-ager she worked as a summer receptionist at 
the King/Drew Medical Center; it was that experience that started her thinking 
about the health professions. 
</P>
<P>
 And she serves on the board of directors of the school's student union, 
gaining experience in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blakely, who has a 2.49 grade-point average, lacks experience with 
patients, which she says is important if she applies for jobs without a degree 
in a health field. 
</P>
<P>
 To become employable, she may have to get experience as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going for a master's degree in public health and I'm going to try to work 
at the same time," she says. "I know something is going to come up where I 
won't need an additional degree, but maybe not in the area I want. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is that in order to get the experience, I'll have to 
volunteer and the job won't be paid," Blakely says. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she has applied for one position in health education and two clerical 
jobs in case nothing is available in her field. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance her chances, she's had her supervisor at the student health center 
critique her resume and will go through a mock job interview at the Student 
Development Office. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also bought outfits appropriate for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very positive," she says. "I'm very organized. I'm pretty good at 
diagnosing problems and finding ways to get around them or fix them and I'm an 
excellent planner." 
</P>
<P>
 If she doesn't get a scholarship for graduate school, she'll need a job by 
next fall to pay for it. "That's when things will become critical," she says.

BODY WATCH; MAGIC MUSHROOM OR MENACE; THE KOMBUCHA 'TEA' CULT IS GROWING EVER 
STRONGER. BUT NO ONE CAN PROVE THE DRINK ALLEVIATES EVERYTHING FROM ASTHMA TO 
AIDS. AND SOME SAY IT MIGHT EVEN BE HARMFUL.

 "What kombucha does is . . . is it sets up a vibrational tone," Norman Baker 
is saying. "It's a living thing! Give it love! Sing to it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who in stature and intensity calls to mind Richard Simmons, places his 
hand over his heart and stares earnestly into his visitor's eyes. "In fact, we 
believe the kombucha has an intelligence well above the level of a dolphin. It 
knows where to go in your body." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, kombucha. Hindu love god? Recently exhumed Mayan fertility idol? No, Baker 
is talking about a mushroomish mass of plant matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California and points beyond, kombucha is spreading like 
kudzu. But the pie-sized, brown mass with a tough but gelatinous consistency is 
not for eating. Rather, it is floated atop a solution of black or green tea and 
sugar, and fermented for seven to 10 days -- after which it renders a tangy, 
cidery beverage with a whiff of vinegar and a hint of carbonation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dosage: four ounces, three times a day before meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kombucha "tea," as it's called, is causing quite a stir. The list of ailments 
it is purported to cure, according to its fans, is staggering: asthma, eczema, 
low energy, bad digestion. It clears up your skin, gets rid of wrinkles, and 
even turns hair (or at least some of it) from gray back to its original color. 
There are even claims that it rebuilds AIDS-ravaged immune systems and 
mitigates symptoms of multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics, however, say that kombucha may be benign at best and toxic at worst, 
and fear a cultlike hysteria may arise before it is carefully analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there's a rush on kombucha accouterments. Pyrex bowls are selling 
as fast as the shipments come in. And health food stores such as Wild Oats in 
Pasadena are selling dozens of bottles of a commercially produced kombucha 
beverage for $5 a pint. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult, however, to know just how much of the information circulating 
about kombucha -- which reportedly originated in Manchuria -- is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Kombucha, Health Beverage and Natural Remedy From the Far East," 
by Gunther W. Frank (Wilhelm Ennsthaler, 1991), the Soviets began conducting 
experiments with it under Stalin when it was discovered that people in the Ural 
Mountains who were inveterate "tea kvass" drinkers had dramatically lower 
cancer rates than other similarly industrialized areas. Still, the article 
contained in the book was penned, according to a note by Frank, by a Russian 
doctor who preferred to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tea has been available in Europe for years," says German-born Aurelia 
Haslboeck, a healer and aroma therapist who says the tea works "like magic." 
The Los Angeles woman says she is frequently complimented on the luminosity of 
her skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kombucha tea has also been widely embraced by people who are HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say from between 15% to 20% of our AIDS patients have experimented with 
it," says Dr. Gary Cohan of the Pacific Oaks Medical Group, which specializes 
in AIDS and HIV treatment and research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Baker and his partner, novelist Betsy Prior, are believers. They are 
also the owners of Laurel Farms, a kombucha distribution outlet based in Culver 
City. Fifty bucks gets you a starter mushroom and instructions, although the 
two say that's just to subsidize free kombucha for those who are too sick or 
broke to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Laurel Farms is a registered trademark, and the talk soon turns to 
joint ventures with Coca-Cola and Snapple. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, Baker and Prior are a gale force of kombucha boosterism that borders 
on the messianic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their office answering machine takes more than a hundred messages a day from 
people pleading for kombucha, people relating tales of miraculous remissions. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are quick to note: "We're not saying it's a cure." Saying it is a 
cure would immediately put kombucha within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration, which is keeping a watchful eye on kombucha 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosio Vior, the FDA's Los Angeles branch spokeswoman, says kombucha raises 
several red flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the warning signs we look for that something is a scam is when people 
say that a product cures a whole host of illnesses," she says. "Another is when 
they refer to it as ancient, something used for years. You have to ask, if this 
stuff is so wonderful, why don't the medical professionals know about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jeffrey Gates, an associate researcher in Cornell University's nutrition 
department, has been monitoring kombucha use for almost a year. A member of the 
China Group, a research group immersed in studying the diet of Chinese 
peasants, Gates recently sent samples of kombucha to a biotech lab to be 
analyzed for "anti-carcinogenic activity." 
</P>
<P>
 While awaiting results, Gates says he is slowly forming some preliminary 
conclusions about the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility that kombucha actually does work, but the question 
remains: What is the margin of error allowed, how much is too much, and what 
will happen if it's contaminated? What are the consequences? Death? Organ 
damage? Simple nausea?" 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Internet, Gates has collected reams of anecdotal evidence about 
kombucha. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of stories are positive, but there have been reports of 
nausea and vomiting, and in one case a woman attributed a breast lump to the 
tea," he says. There also have been two unsubstantiated reports of death caused 
by kombucha, and Gates says he can't rule out the possibility -- however dim -- 
that kombucha could be toxic to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Cohan, the Pacific Oaks physician who specializes in AIDS treatment: 
"Some of my patients have experimented with it and have fun with it, and I 
don't think there's any great harm in it. But if it's so great, where's the 
data? There's a cult mentality at work here."

BODY WATCH; OLD AGE ELIXIR; MORE THEN EVER, DOCTORS -- BOLSTERED BY NEW STUDIES 
-- SAY HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY IS THE BEST WAY FOR POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN TO 
PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS AND HEART DISEASE. SO WHY AREN'T WOMEN BUYING IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dr. Michael Kleerekoper thinks hormone replace therapy is terrific for 
post-menopausal women -- a view widely shared by his colleagues in orthopedics, 
gynecology, cardiology and internal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not, he notes wryly, a position widely shared by U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
 The good doctor was reminded of that last spring when he and several other 
experts faced 1,000 well-informed Los Angeles women for a $75-a-plate luncheon 
at the Beverly Hilton called "Women and Doctors." Repeatedly, the physicians 
touted the value of taking hormone replacement therapy -- estrogen or a 
combination of estrogen and progestin -- beginning at menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a questioner wanted to know if taking calcium supplements was a good way 
to prevent osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not nearly as good as estrogen," said Kleerekoper, bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
 A groan rose from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is estrogen, estrogen, estrogen!" one woman complained loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbowed, Kleerekoper, a Wayne State University doctor, leaned closer to his 
microphone and boomed his bottom line: "There is nothing, globally, that takes 
care of the problems (associated with menopause) like estrogen does." 
</P>
<P>
 Is hormone replacement therapy the great elixir of old age for women? More 
than ever, doctors -- backed by a groundswell of new evidence -- say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prestigious medical groups, including the American College of 
Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have 
released position papers saying post-menopausal women should seriously consider 
preventive hormone therapy for its benefits in reducing osteoporosis and heart 
disease -- the two major scourges of old age in women. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of evidence has tipped so far that a group of oncologists writing 
in the Aug. 17 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. called for 
studies on hormone therapy in breast cancer survivors -- long considered 
prohibitive because of a possible association between estrogen and breast 
cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a steely display of consumer independence and -- possibly -- distrust 
in medicine, many American women are still saying no to hormone therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no free lunch," UCLA breast cancer surgeon Dr. Susan Love told the 
Women and Doctors group. "You're not going to be able to take something and not 
pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enormous amount of resistance," says Janine O'Leary Cobb, the 
director of a Champlain, N.Y.-based consumer group for post-menopausal women 
called A Friend Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Various surveys estimate that 15%to 25%of the nation's 40 million menopausal 
or post-menopausal women are on hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last two years," Cobb says, "physicians around the country have come 
to recognize that many women have dug in their heels about this. Doctors are 
wondering what they can do differently to get women to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, hormone therapy is not a benign treatment. Users commonly 
experience such annoying side effects as irregular menstrual bleeding, breast 
tenderness, bloating and headaches, although doctors say dose adjustments can 
often alleviate these problems. Hormone therapy is not safe for women with 
certain conditions, such as liver and gallbladder disease. Finally, there is 
still a question of whether hormones promote breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 This rare instance in which consumers have, en masse, spurned scientifically 
based medical advice perplexes health officials who are increasingly sensitive 
to the dual goals of promoting women's health objectives and encouraging 
cost-saving preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider that American women live considerably longer than they used 
to . . . more than one-third of their lives post-menopausally, that heart 
disease is the leading cause of death, and that one in five or six of them will 
fracture a hip from osteoporosis and 25% of them will never walk again, that is 
really important stuff," says Dr. Diana Dell, a Duke University professor and 
president of the American Medical Women's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are thought to be naturally protected from heart disease by hormones 
produced by the ovaries until menopause. After menopause, however, heart 
disease skyrockets, surpassing even that of men. Heart disease is the leading 
cause of death in older women with a half a million U.S. deaths a year -- more 
than twice as many as all cancer deaths combined. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a major study -- Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) 
-- researchers last month announced that hormones clearly improve a number of 
key risk factors for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Osteoporosis prevention has been another big winner with studies showing that 
hormones can lower the risk of hip fracture -- the most disastrous consequence 
of osteoporosis -- by 60%. So overwhelming is hormone therapy for osteoporosis 
prevention that the Food and Drug Administration now allows manufacturers to 
market it for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Estrogen therapy is almost like women immunizing themselves for two of the 
most prevalent diseases that can affect menopausal women: heart disease and 
osteoporosis," says Dr. Morris Notelovitz, president of the National Menopause 
Foundation in Gainesville, Fla. "When we look back in time to come, the 
intelligent use of hormone therapy will be one of the greatest boons ever to 
women's health." 
</P>
<P>
 According to other research, hormones also look promising for preventing 
Alzheimer's disease and cataracts, and improving mood, skin tone, hair texture 
and sexual functioning. And, according to an English study, women on hormones 
sleep deeper and think better when awake. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The therapy) can have a tremendous effect on the quality and quantity of a 
woman's life," Notelovitz says. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the benefits so clearly outweigh the risks, why aren't more women taking 
hormones? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The negative column bears one of the primary reasons women hesitate to sign up 
for hormone therapy: It may increase the risk of breast cancer. While a few 
long observational studies found that estrogen users had a 20% to 30% higher 
risk of breast cancers, similar studies found no risk; the issue is far from 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The association between hormone therapy and uterine cancer is much better 
understood. The PEPI study and others have demonstrated that estrogen therapy 
causes tissue growth in the uterus that can lead to cancer. But when estrogen 
is combined with the hormone progestin -- the most popular regimen used today 
-- the increased risk of uterine cancer is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when women hear estrogen, they often think cancer, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk of breast cancer is minute compared to the benefits they get from 
prevention of heart disease and osteoporosis. But the bottom line is the word 
cancer ," Notelovitz says. "And that is unfortunate. Estrogen does not cause 
breast cancer. It may promote breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take time to undo the myths and misconceptions of the past, says 
Dr. Lila Nachtigall, a New York University professor and author of a consumer 
book on menopause. She blames some of her colleagues for dissuading patients 
from taking hormones in the '70s and '80s -- even though many of those same 
doctors today are writing prescriptions by the fistfuls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardiologists and internists have done the biggest turnaround. Ten years ago, 
I would put a woman on estrogen and the internist would take her off. They 
wouldn't even call, they would just take her off. Now, they call me and say 
'She just had a heart attack. She needs estrogen,' " Nachtigall says. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have tended to emphasize the traditional use of hormone therapy -- as 
a short-term drug to alleviate hot flashes, vaginal dryness and night sweats. 
As such, too few women understand that hormones are a much weightier tool when 
used for long-term prevention of disease, Dell says. In a recent survey of 
1,000 women by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the makers of the hormone product 
Premarin, only 5% of women identified heart disease and osteoporosis as 
long-term post-menopausal risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have too often improperly characterized hormone therapy in a way that 
infantilizes women; that once their hot flashes go away, they won't need 
hormones," she says. "If women got clear-cut messages instead, many will begin 
and continue therapy. But a lot of this has to do with the amount of time a 
doctor spends with a patient in discussing whether or not to take hormones." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb, of the consumer group A Friend Indeed, agrees that doctors take too 
little time to educate women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of time and care to prescribe hormones. What doctors should do 
is delegate this task; turn it over to nurse-practitioners who can take more 
time," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She also blames doctors for not helping women adjust to hormones in a more 
sensitive manner. In the 1991 meeting of the North American Menopause Society 
in Montreal, Cobb hung a poster in an exhibition hall displaying letters from 
women complaining of how their doctors handled their hormone therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of doctors hanging around my board," she says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace is packed with numerous hormone formulations including pills, 
skin patches and vaginal creams; products to prevent osteoporosis and others 
for various menopausal symptoms. Finding the right product for an individual 
woman can involve time and experimentation. But, Cobb says, two-thirds of women 
who start hormone therapy quit within a year because of bothersome side effects 
-- far too short a time to gain any disease-prevention benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us are very good at prevention," Dell says. "All of us 
live for today and don't live for what will happen in the future. You only have 
to look at the number of American women who smoke to see how true that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Dell says she often sees patients who believe that since menopause 
is nature's way, she must live with nature's consequences rather than take 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that same patient will think nothing of taking anti-hypertensive drugs to 
prevent stroke," Dell notes. "I don't see the difference. Hormones are a 
medicine used for prevention purposes just like other medicines are." 
</P>
<P>
 Notelovitz says he likes to remind his patients that they do have a choice if 
they want to try to live out their final third of life in vigorous health but 
don't want to take hormones. Osteoporosis can often be prevented in mid-life 
with hefty calcium supplements and regular weight-bearing exercise. Heart 
disease can be prevented with a regimen consisting of a low-fat diet, no 
smoking, exercise, stress reduction, antioxidant supplements and low-dose 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to give women an option: Do you want to take hormone therapy or do 
you feel more comfortable with diet, exercise, antioxidants and aspirin? The 
problem with the later is compliance. Once you stop, you lose the protective 
effect," he says. 
</P>

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; A WONDERFUL GLOW; SUPPORTERS OF THE 
PERFORMING ARTS CENTER BASK IN WARMTH OF CANDLELIGHT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not only was there no mention of bankruptcy on stage at Sunday's Candlelight 
Concert, the mood was so jolly you'd have thought Orange County had just 
declared a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful room, a wonderful feeling," said Tom Nielsen, chairman of 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, during his remarks at the Hyatt 
Regency Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, praising the 600-strong, can-do crowd, he said: "There have been 21 
years of Candlelight Concerts and only eight years of the Performing Arts 
Center. A lot of people had a dream many years ago of what was possible. That 
is what we are celebrating tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat mood was heightened by the lush ballroom decor at the 
English-themed affair. Towering evergreens strung with gold twinkle-lights 
lined the walls, and tables were topped with fruit-and-flower laden topiaries. 
Table favors were English crackers, gaily wrapped cylinders that crackled when 
guests pulled a string. Buried inside were plastic toys and paper party hats. 
(Gala hostesses take note: Elegant gold bamboo-motif chairs had this event 
looking like a page right out of "Tiffany Parties.") 
</P>
<P>
 The only solemn moment at the $250-per-person, black-tie benefit sponsored by 
the center's board of directors came when Nielsen called for a "few moments of 
silence" in honor of the late Hal Segerstrom, the arts supporter who died 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A respectful hush fell over the room as guests bowed their heads in 
remembrance of Segerstrom, whose widow, Jeanette, was unable to attend the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dinner, concert underwriters and committee members gathered in the 
hotel's Ciao Mein restaurant for champagne and appetizers. (Donors of $10,000 
were presented with crystal bowls from Georg Jensen. Donors of $5,000 to the 
concert were given crystal candlesticks donated by Tiffany & Co.) 
</P>
<P>
 On hand to congratulate gala chairwoman Catherine Thyen, who wore a 
forest-green ball gown "so I'd blend in with the Christmas trees," she said, 
were Henry and Renee Segerstrom (glamorous in a gold lame gown), Judie and 
George Argyros, Maralou and Jerry Harrington, Mark Johnson and Ted and Mary 
Jean Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major center donors hobnobbing at the affair, which raked in $135,00 for 
the center's programming and operating expenses, included Arden Flamson, 
Michelle Rohe, George and Arlene Cheng, Carol and Kent Wilken, Joan and Don 
Beall, and Thomas Kendrick and Judy O'Dea Morr. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a sit-down repast of the Queen's Salmon Souffle with asparagus and 
caviar sauce, Cumberland wild field green salad and Windsor veal tenderloin, 
guests heard performances by the Pacific Symphony and the Pacific Chorale's 
adult and children's choruses with guest appearances by mezzo-soprano Heidi 
Herzog and boy soprano Colin Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tidbit: When the chorale sang "The Twelve Days of Christmas," the lyrics 
included "And a wedding date for Carl St.Clair" -- a reference to the 
42-year-old Pacific Symphony conductor, who recently announced his plan to 
marry Susan Cunningham, 29. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Interfaith Shelter tea: A record-crowd of more than 200 attended the annual 
Orange County Interfaith Shelter tea and luncheon last week at the Irvine Cove 
home of Ellie Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests in holiday finery oohed and ahhed over the ocean view at Gordon's 5,000 
square-foot Mediterranean digs, situated on a hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
 A past president of FOCIS (Friends of the Orange County Interfaith Shelter), a 
support group committed to raising a minimum of $60,000 a year for the Costa 
Mesa shelter, Gordon can't imagine living a life that doesn't include 
volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the Jewish heritage is to give tzedakah to people who are less 
fortunate," she said. "My first remembrance of giving was a little blue box my 
mother and father kept in the kitchen. We would put change in it for charity. 
It wasn't that there was a lot to give . . . but we learned to give it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, living in palatial surroundings with plenty of food and clothing, Gordon 
is grateful for her blessed life. And, because of her work with the shelter -- 
where 3,000 homeless families are assisted yearly -- she knows it could change 
in a heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know when a turn of events could put you in the same position," she 
said. "When you listen to the stories of people in the shelter, you learn they 
are there because of terrible circumstances -- the loss of a job or a terrible 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very fortunate to be in this position. And it's our responsibility to 
give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests at the tea were FOCIS president Lois Jacobs, shelter board 
president Diana Hensley and board member Judy Cooper.

COPING WITH DEPRESSION, LOSS DURING THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Losing a loved one is difficult at any time of the year, but the holidays 
often exacerbate the loss, says Patricia Drake-Emerson, hospice program manager 
for St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense of depression and loss seems even greater during this time of year 
when everyone else is celebrating," she says. "A person may look out on the 
world that seems so gay and think, I've lost someone dear; I'm miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have lost a loved one, here are some tips for dealing with the 
holidays: 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue family traditions. They provide continuity in your life at a time 
when you definitely need it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do something to memorialize the individual. This will put meaning into the 
loss and keep the person in your thoughts. Make a trip to the cemetery, have a 
special religious service in his or her honor, donate something to a worthy 
cause, launch a balloon with the person's name, show pictures of the loved one 
at a family gathering, or write a letter to him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't isolate yourself. You'll become even more depressed. Reach out to 
others and allow your friends to help. If you're invited to a party, make a 
deal with yourself to go for just 15 minutes and then leave if you aren't 
enjoying yourself. You may find that you have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reach out. There are bereavement groups in Orange County that offer 
individuals who have lost someone a chance to share with others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about your loss. It's important not to push down your feelings, but to 
feel and express them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give it time. Everyone grieves in his or her own way, on his or her own 
timetable. The process may take years or even a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't forget surviving children. If you have lost a child and have other 
children, although it's difficult, it's important to remember them and to 
realize that they are also grieving. It may be a good idea for them to visit a 
children's bereavement group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pamper yourself. This might be the time to take a trip and get away from it 
all. Take time for yourself. Get a massage, go out to dinner, see a play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you know someone who has lost a loved one, keep the following in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Respect the feelings of the other person. If you've invited the person over 
for a party, your friend will come if he or she is ready. If a party is too 
much for him or her, suggest going for a walk or out for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about the lost loved one. People who have lost someone, cherish stories 
about the person that they might not have heard before. Don't be afraid to 
bring up the person's name. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reach out. Just saying, "call if you need anything," is pretty useless, 
because most people who are grieving won't call. Call them instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donate a gift in honor of the deceased person and then notify their loved 
ones. This shows that you are still thinking about the person and honor his or 
her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask what a person is doing for the holidays. Don't assume he or she wants to 
be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create excuses to drop by. If you bring food over, use your best dishes so 
you'll have to return soon for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give it time. Realize that everyone has his or her own process to go through 
and there is no set time for grieving. Just because you want the best for your 
friend and would like him or her to be over it, that won't necessarily happen. 
He or she may never be the same, and this is something you'll have to accept.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; STABILITY SPREADING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA; PEACEFUL ELECTIONS IN 
NAMIBIA AND MOZAMBIQUE ARE LATEST EVIDENCE THAT DEMOCRACY IS CATCHING ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An utterly peaceful two-day election in Namibia last week capped a year of 
astonishing democratic and economic gains in southern Africa, a long-blighted 
region that now offers dramatic hope for a crippled continent. 
</P>
<P>
 In Namibia's first post-independence election, the incumbent president, Sam 
Nujoma, and his ruling party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, or 
SWAPO, swept nearly 72% of the vote in the former South African colony, a 
sparsely populated nation twice the size of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fighters," announced Nujoma, a former guerrilla leader. But the new 
enemies "are poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullets, not ballots, are usually associated with a continent dominated by 
numbing news of famine, brutal ethnic wars, disabling corruption, the anarchy 
of Zaire and Somalia, and the genocidal horrors of Rwanda. The continental 
economic slide has been so severe that most Africans are poorer today than they 
were in the mid-1970s, according to the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the successful election in Namibia added to evidence that political 
reconciliation and multi-party democracy are inexorably spreading over the vast 
southern third of Africa after decades of bitter racial strife and a series of 
devastating wars fueled by Cold War rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 One after another, nine of the 10 nations in southern Africa have held 
elections since 1991, including three for the first time this year. Only the 
tiny mountain kingdom of Swaziland has resisted the rush of democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, poverty is still the rule, and some governments barely tolerate 
their opposition. But hope is growing that southern Africa, a region of more 
than 100 million people, can become a model of stability and an economic 
powerhouse that may help reverse the grim trends farther north on the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The process already has started. A trading bloc is under consideration to 
boost regional economies. And the elected leaders of South Africa, Zimbabwe and 
Botswana have met repeatedly to orchestrate diplomatic pressure that restored a 
democratic government in tiny Lesotho, kept elections on track in Mozambique 
and has sought a lasting peace in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eugene Nyati, director of the Center for African Studies in Johannesburg, 
cautions that "it's too early to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 "The democratic elections you've seen are a rejection of one-party 
dictatorships, but most fall far short of embracing the multi-party democratic 
culture as known in the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most African democracies remain too dependent on foreign aid, Nyati pointed 
out, and are hobbled by economic disparities and ethnic divisions. They could 
collapse "like a house of cards," he warned. "Until they can translate the new 
democracy into economic well-being, the democracies will be short-lived. The 
process remains very vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Angola remains the region's biggest worry. After two previous peace accords 
and one election ended in failure, a truce and peace agreement signed Nov. 20 
to end Angola's 19-year civil war has yet to silence the guns in the region's 
last remaining and most intractable conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But United Nations officials, who are monitoring the cease-fire, insist that 
sporadic battles between the elected government of President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos and the rebel UNITA army led by Jonas Savimbi have not scuttled the 
ambitious plans to create a unified military and a government based on 
power-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Savimbi, who has not appeared in public in months, didn't show up to sign the 
treaty in the Zambian capital of Lusaka. 
</P>
<P>
 But aides have signaled that the enigmatic rebel leader has endorsed the 
agreement, and a UNITA delegation last week joined the first meeting of the 
joint military and political commission that will oversee implementation of the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, once doubtful U.N. officials and diplomats are increasingly 
optimistic that peace, and perhaps one day even prosperity, may finally be 
possible in a country potentially rich with diamonds and oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has already broken out in Mozambique, another bloody spot on the map. 
Two years after a U.N.-brokered cease-fire ended one of Africa's longest and 
most savage wars, the world's poorest country (annual per capita income is only 
$60) successfully held its first free elections in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the incumbent ruler, Joaquim Chissano, was elected president. 
More important, his chief rival, former rebel chief Afonso Dhlakama, has kept 
his pledge to honor the results rather than resume a 17-year war marked by 
conscription of children, widespread atrocities and scorched-earth tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This specter of war has been removed," Chissano said Friday in his 
inauguration speech in Maputo. "Peace has come to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now, Mozambique remains a ward of the United Nations and major 
Western donors. The outside world has spent $1 billion monitoring the 
cease-fire, demobilizing combatants, repatriating refugees and registering 
voters. Chaos could resume when the United Nations' 7,000 peacekeepers withdraw 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa's most extraordinary transition, of course, came with the stirring 
election in April of Nelson Mandela as president of a democratic South Africa 
after 3 1/2 centuries of institutionalized racial oppression, first under 
colonialism and then under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's triumphant inauguration was soon followed by the ouster of Africa's 
longest-serving despot, Malawi's frail and apparently senile H. Kamuzu Banda, 
in that nation's first-ever democratic election. 
</P>
<P>
 During his three decades of ruthless if eccentric rule, Banda proclaimed 
himself Life President and outlawed all political opposition, as well as long 
hair on men, bell-bottomed pants and miniskirts. He jailed potential rivals and 
warned others that they would be "food for the crocodiles." 
</P>
<P>
 A new constitution has since abolished scores of repressive laws. The new 
president, former businessman Bakili Muluzi, has vowed to alleviate poverty and 
boost social services. "We will not work on retribution," he said at his first 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Botswana, the region's oldest and most stable democracy. The 
diamond-rich nation held its sixth general election without fanfare Oct. 15. 
Angered at corruption scandals and rising unemployment, voters trimmed the 
majority of the long-ruling Botswana Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the world's poorest nations when it won independence from Britain in 
1966, Botswana has since blossomed into one of Africa's richest. Primary and 
high school enrollment has grown exponentially, tarred roads crisscross the 
country, and health standards are vastly improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Zimbabwe, led by President Robert Mugabe since a guerrilla war 
ended the white regime of Rhodesia in 1980, is due to hold elections next year. 
Racial tensions have risen recently, fueled by accusations that whites, who are 
outnumbered 100 to 1, still dominate the economy and own most of the arable 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Zambia's leader since independence in 1964, Kenneth Kaunda, stepped down in 
1991 after he was finally forced to hold an election. He hopes for a comeback 
in new polls next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the new South Africa, the region's richest and most 
developed nation, remains the paradigm and the leader for the fledgling 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially and politically polarized, it used a power-sharing arrangement to 
usher in democracy. That drew nearly every political party into the April 
election and ultimately gave each of them a role in the new government of 
national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mandela, often to the dismay of his most ardent supporters, has reached 
out to reassure nervous whites at home and investors abroad. He has neither cut 
the civil service, confiscated land nor nationalized industries. He has won 
strong backing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mandela's government now plans to privatize such state-owned companies 
as Eskom, which generates half the electricity produced in sub-Saharan Africa, 
to help finance its ambitious five-year reconstruction and development 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Mandela recognizes the limits of democracy. Touring the squalid 
squatters camp of Orange Farm outside Johannesburg on Thursday, the president 
conceded that he had yet to deliver the jobs, houses, electricity and other 
tangible benefits he often promised during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have brought none of these things," he told the crowd, adding: "The wheels 
of government grind very slowly, and people should not expect miracles. We are 
ordinary human beings with many limitations."

THE MEDIA; CO-OP'S VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOOT THE WORLD ON A SHOESTRING; WITHOUT 
RESOURCES OF MAJOR TV NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, GETTING FOOTAGE FROM HOT SPOTS LIKE 
BOSNIA IS RISKY BUSINESS FOR FRONTLINE'S FREE-LANCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Vaughan Smith was working as a free-lance television cameraman 
in Sarajevo when a stray bullet whipped through the billowing sleeve of his 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith shrugged off the episode as one of the perils of his business, 
recalling: "The shot came through the window of my Bosnian fiance's family home 
in Sarajevo. We all hit the deck. And the family was embarrassed that it 
happened in their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's business is a new company of free-lance TV cameramen and camerawomen 
who pursue front-line footage they sell to television networks worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise is appropriately named Frontline News Television and is a 
cooperative of combat-tested TV photographers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have about 20 cameramen in our group," said Smith, taking a break from the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina story to return to London and his company's basement office 
near Victoria Station. 
</P>
<P>
 He is co-director of the cooperative and owns 51% of its stock, taking no 
salary but sharing in the commissions earned by Frontline's camera operators in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontline News is "a very lean organization," Smith said, pointing out that 
"we have to do things on the cheap since each cameraman -- or camerawoman, we 
have three -- pays his or her own expenses. . . . They are not staying in 
five-star hotels." They also pay for their own insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are independent souls," Smith continued. "They pursue the stories 
they want to -- in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda, Central Asia, 
wherever. But we try to keep the focus on stories that we can sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on the cheap -- small, home video, HI-8 cameras instead of the 
expensive Betacams." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than staying in hotels in Sarajevo, for instance, Frontline personnel 
might stay at a private home for bed and breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontline's TV journalists cannot afford the high cost of armored cars in 
places like the former Yugoslav federation, as American or British network 
teams can, and therefore often work at greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
 A correspondent for one of the American networks commented: "We sometimes buy 
from them because it's cheaper and everyone is cost-conscious these days. Also 
they are good for getting back-stop news footage in difficult places." 
</P>
<P>
 The company had its genesis in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, 
during which Smith obtained through subterfuge some of the only combat film of 
the American forces advancing into Iraq with tank guns blazing. 
</P>
<P>
 A former captain in the elite British Grenadier Guards regiment, Smith, now 
31, left the army and eventually wound up in Pakistan selling micro-light 
aircraft. There, he linked up with free-lance television camera crews moving in 
and out of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 He volunteered first as a sound technician, later as a photographer and caught 
on with a group accompanying John Simpson, foreign affairs editor and roving 
correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith later covered the Gulf War. Using his ex-army credentials and donning a 
British officer's uniform, he managed to bum rides with a forward American unit 
and rode into battle with it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I avoided censorship by getting back to Dhahran (Saudi Arabia) and then to 
Bahrain, then flying back to Europe with my stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The BBC's Simpson recalls that Smith "obtained the best and most spectacular 
television pictures of the ground fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 With the profit from his exclusive film, which was used by networks around the 
world, Smith set up Frontline News TV, among whose founding members were highly 
regarded free-lance cameramen Nick della Casa and Tim Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, while skilled in the field, was still an amateur in marketing the 
film, and he cycled around London delivering the cooperative's footage to TV 
offices for possible use. The first year for Frontline News was difficult, with 
only about $75,000 worth of business, which did not turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of 1991, Anna Roberts, a journalist and TV producer, joined the 
group to sell the footage and developed a list of about 70 customers, mainly TV 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other women, Susannah Nicol, now co-director with Smith, and Jane Birch, 
joined the group to run the office and organize sales and contracts, boosting 
business this year to about $650,000 -- and well in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperative's office markets the product of the field TV photographers and 
takes between 20% and 25% commission on sales, which constitutes its profit. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all combat journalists, the work remains dangerous: Founding member 
Della Casa was slain by a Turkish guide in the Kurdish mountains of Iraq in the 
rebellion that followed the Gulf War. Rory Peck, another Frontline cameraman 
known for his Gulf War shots of an air-raid shelter in Baghdad hit by an 
American missile, left the cooperative to work on his own in Moscow -- and was 
killed during the firefight when Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin withstood 
the challenge of the Russian Parliament in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has temporarily based himself in the port city of Split on the 
Dalmatian coast of Croatia, wants to offer customers a variety of material from 
his field photographers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are always on the lookout for big, breaking news stories, when we tend to 
offer our pictures to networks right on the spot -- particularly if they have 
satellite facilities, as in Sarajevo," Smith said. But he added that the 
Frontline journalists also package features. "We want to produce the kind of 
features that hit home, that appeal to editors and audiences. A really good 
piece can be sold in many different countries' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, we put together the piece on the corruption among United 
Nations forces in Bosnia: Ukrainians selling fuel, the French involved with 
prostitution. That was a fine exclusive that others picked up on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're good at wars, but we're moving into other areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also put a man aboard the trans-Siberian express to film Chinese 
passengers selling their goods to Russians along the way -- fake name-brand 
running shoes, things like that. It made a very watchable feature. . . . For an 
American network, with their large crews, to do such a trip would have cost too 
much for them to take a chance on a story." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Frontline News sells film on the spot at a rate of $1,000 a minute. "If 
we get a couple of minutes, we might make expenses," Smith said. "But if they 
really want something, it will run longer, and we will do much better." 
</P>
<P>
 With the feature stories that take more time, the television package is put 
together by editors in London. The cooperative, with its 20 journalists, 
operates largely like an individual free-lancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we'd like to get contracts and commissions with networks that would 
guarantee us fees if we produce. . . . And we'll go absolutely anywhere we 
think we can get something to sell."

PROFILE; AN UPHILL FIGHT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN EL SALVADOR; YOUNG CHIEF IS 
BUILDING CIVILIAN POLICE FORCE WITH SCANT RESOURCES. SOME FROM BOTH RIGHT AND 
LEFT HAVE TRIED TO THWART EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodrigo Avila, the head of El Salvador's new civilian police department, 
arrives for a meeting alone and driving his own car. No bodyguards, no 
assistants. This might not seem unusual except that Avila has survived three 
assassination attempts in his first six months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a matter of fate," the young commander says, shrugging off the 
peril. "It is more dangerous today in El Salvador to be a run-of-the-mill 
Salvadoran than to be the police chief." 
</P>
<P>
 An engineer by training, a businessman by profession and a skilled 
sharpshooter by avocation, Avila heads the institution that is perhaps most 
crucial to maintaining peace in a country emerging from 12 years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Civilian Police -- a nonpolitical, professional law enforcement 
agency -- was created as part of U.N.-brokered accords that ended the war in 
1992. It is intended to replace the loyal police forces that right-wing 
Salvadoran regimes had used for years to suppress political opposition and that 
were blamed for widespread atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 But building a police department in a still-polarized country such as El 
Salvador, where hidden agendas can overwhelm available resources, is no easy 
task, and no one knows that better than the 30-year-old Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard to create a police force, one that is born out of politics, 
making the maximum effort that it not be politicized," Avila said in an 
interview at his new headquarters, a refurbished auto-repair shop warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this would be easy, but I never realized it would be so 
difficult. . . . Forming a police force, a project that can take years, 
decades, centuries, we had to do in one year and eight months. And in a very 
improvised way. We had to create a police force from zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are nearly 6,000 men and women wearing the new civilian police 
uniform and deployed throughout the country. Under the accords, the force 
includes former enemies -- onetime leftist guerrillas and erstwhile members of 
state security agencies that battled throughout El Salvador's bloody civil war 
of the 1980s -- as well as ordinary Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
 As an institution, the police force is still very weak. El Salvador is 
suffering its worst crime wave ever, according to Avila, and the police are not 
yet capable of conducting serious investigations.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the crime -- murders, carjackings, home robberies -- are blamed on 
organized crime syndicates with strong connections to the military. Fewer than 
3% of police officers are assigned to investigations, and even those have yet 
to receive training or equipment, according to U.N. officials monitoring the 
peace accords that ended the open fighting in 1992. More than 80% of the people 
in El Salvador's jails and prisons have yet to be tried for their alleged 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the project of forming a professional police force has met 
with considerable resistance, especially from intransigent elements in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous administration of President Alfredo Cristiani, which was in 
office until June, tried to secretly transfer units of the old, discredited 
police force intact into the new police agency in violation of the peace 
accords. The government also allowed some officers to sidestep required human 
rights training and avoid a screening process intended to weed out the most 
abusive agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila, who likes to compare himself to Don Quixote tilting at windmills, says 
he has had to struggle against the ulterior motives of all sides involved in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been fighting against a lot of resistance. People in the government 
who didn't really care about the police force. For them it was just one more 
part of the peace accords that had to be fulfilled. People in the army who 
wanted to put the brakes on the project. People from the guerrillas who thought 
they could take power through the police force.  
</P>
<P>
 "These people did not recognize the importance of creating a professional 
police force." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila speaks frankly about rampant corruption in the government, the 
judiciary, even the military. This is daring talk from anybody, but especially 
unusual coming from someone with Avila's background. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a military doctor who achieved the rank of colonel, Avila considers 
himself to be a product of the ideological right. He helped train army snipers 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, the war is over, and El Salvador has to change. It can no longer 
be divided simplistically into the rich and poor, left and right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a person on the right. But I don't discriminate. I work with people from 
the left. In the (National Civilian Police) no one has an ideology. This is a 
professional job at the service of the community. There are people who call me 
a Communist because I work with the (former guerrillas). It is absurd. I am 
more right-wing than the ones who accuse me, because they are only thinking of 
their personal interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila's office is spartan, with a desk, a large plant and a picture of his 
young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He casually grasps a Grip-Master hand exerciser as he speaks, and eagerly 
shows a visitor a couple of his department's newest acquisitions: a hard-rubber 
tactical baton and a can of pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 He was educated in El Salvador and at the University of North Carolina, where 
he earned an engineering degree, and worked for Exxon before being named to 
head the operations division of the new police force last year. He was 
appointed chief in June. 
</P>
<P>
 With no police experience except for a stint as a campus security cop at North 
Carolina, Avila relies heavily on gumption and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 He is likely to show up in shirt sleeves for a meeting with judges in a 
country where officialdom normally clings to formalities. And he will work the 
streets, showing up at a demonstration to negotiate with disgruntled bus 
drivers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, human rights and U.N. officials say, Avila is likely to get his 
wings clipped if his efforts to build up the powers of the police challenge the 
political equation too directly. 
</P>
<P>
 President Armando Calderon Sol recently ordered the army into the streets of 
San Miguel, El Salvador's second-largest city, to end a transport strike, 
declaring that Avila's Civilian Police agency was not capable of handling it. 
</P>
<P>
 And already, some of the evils that plagued the old police, such as 
bribe-taking and other corrupt practices, are beginning to creep into the new 
agency, knowledgeable observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most I can hope to do is lay the foundation, set out some rules, so that 
no one, not even a new police chief, can simply do whatever he wants but must 
follow a new, institutional policy," Avila says. "That will be the legacy." 
</P>

AREA SCORES RISE ON TESTS TO EARN COLLEGE CREDIT; EDUCATION: STUDENTS AS A 
WHOLE BOOST PERFORMANCE ON ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMS, THOUGH SEVERAL DISTRICTS 
SEE SLIGHT DECLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Willing to tackle rigorous exams for college credit, more Ojai and Oxnard high 
school students are taking Advanced Placement tests -- and passing them, a 
state report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County students as a whole boosted their performance on the exams last 
year and outperformed their peers across the state, according to a California 
Department of Education report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of exams passed for every 100 high school juniors and seniors in the 
county rose from 12.9 to 13.8 in 1994, a score well above the state average of 
10.8. 
</P>
<P>
 But several school districts -- including Simi Valley Unified, Ventura Unified 
and Moorpark Unified -- showed slight declines in exam scores this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer students in Simi Valley and Moorpark took the tests in 1994, in some 
cases because of expense, officials said. Each Advanced Placement exam costs 
$72. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of the test has gone up significantly over the past years," said 
Becky Wetzel, programs and assessment director for Simi Valley Unified. "It 
used to be only $40." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura had roughly the same number of students taking the Advanced 
Placement exams last year, the teen-agers who signed up for the exams took 
fewer of them, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena High School counselor Jean Wise said the district's decline was at least 
partly due to Buena's decision not to offer either Advanced Placement computer 
science or chemistry last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Placement tests are offered in 16 subjects, including European 
history, calculus and physics. To be eligible for college credit, students must 
score at least 3 out of a possible 5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the county's roughly 15,000 high school juniors and seniors, 1,885 took at 
least one of the grueling three-hour exams last spring -- a 5% increase 
compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With college fees soaring, many students are opting for Advanced Placement 
credit to get pricey college courses out of the way early, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage students to take these exams," Oak Park High School Principal 
Jeff Chancer said. "College is real expensive now. It could be a big savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in tiny Oak Park Unified, the county's smallest school district, 
handily outperformed their peers this year, earning test scores five times 
higher than the state average and four times higher than the county average. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a school, we had a total of 188 tests taken," Chancer said. "Of those, 84% 
of the exams taken received a score of 3 or higher." 
</P>

 Seventy Oak Park students took the exams -- which totaled 40 more tests than 
last year, when 66 students took Advanced Placement tests. In a district where 
90% of the students go to college, Chancer said, those statistics are exciting, 
but not surprising. "There's a real strong commitment here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District, which has more high school students 
than any other county district, boosted its performance on the tests even 
though it continues to fall below the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students in the district taking the exams grew from 478 in 1993 
to 610 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 And school officials said they are particularly pleased students are choosing 
some of the more difficult tests, opting for chemistry and calculus more often 
than English literature and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraged," Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said. "There's a lot of good 
teaching going on in these most rigorous courses." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard high school district typically trails Ventura Unified School 
District in test scores, but not on this year's Advanced Placement exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ventura Unified high schools showed slight declines in student 
performance on the exams. But that didn't change the wide gap that has existed 
between the two schools. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Ventura High, the passing rate per 100 juniors and seniors was 5.9, about 
half the 11.6 rate of its cross-town rival Buena High. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity mainly boils down to the number of students taking the exams. 
Only 60 Ventura High juniors and seniors sat for the tests in 1994, compared to 
104 at Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High offers only half as many Advanced Placement courses as Buena. But 
Ventura High School officials said they can only give the grueling, 
college-preparatory courses where there is interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't offer a course that only 12 kids have signed up for," Ventura High 
Assistant Principal Larry Emrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Buena High, the passing rate dipped slightly from 13.5 to 11.6, a 
difference school officials attributed to a temporary reduction last year in 
the variety of Advanced Placement courses offered. Making the Grade 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Placement tests are offered in 16 subjects, including European 
history, calculus and physics. To become eligible for college credit, students 
must score at least 3 out of a possible 5 points on the test. The percentage of 
examinations taken by high school juniors and seniors that qualified them for 
college credit has more than tripled in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 10 years ago, the statewide percentage was 3.4%, meaning that 
fewer than four students per 100 earned college credit.

HOME BUILDING JUMPS 44%, BUT ANALYSTS CAUTIOUS; CONSTRUCTION: WHILE THE 
MINI-BOOM IS A POSITIVE SIGN, INDUSTRY LEADERS SAY IT'S TOO SOON TO CALL THE 
INCREASE A SIGN OF RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County home construction has risen 44% this year compared to the 
previous three years, but building industry officials cautioned Monday that the 
rebound offers no assurance of a full economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first 10 months of this year, builders constructed 1,378 new 
single-family homes countywide. By contrast, developers built an average of 
about 955 homes over the same period from 1991 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Building analysts attributed the increase to several factors, including the 
threat of rising interest rates and the need to accommodate an exodus from Los 
Angeles County because of crime and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry leaders said it is too early to consider the increase a sure sign of 
economic recovery in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best year we've had since 1990, but the numbers are still terribly 
reduced," said E. Warren Bossard, a housing consultant for Chicago Title Co. "I 
think it would be overly optimistic to say that economic recovery is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Bartolotto, the analyst who compiled the data for Construction Industry 
Research Board, cautioned that this year's rise should not be considered a 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be a one-time thing -- an adjustment of the market," Bartolotto said. 
"Still, it's a good indication that there is a fresh confidence in the economy 
on the part of developers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartolotto and Bossard agreed that the mini-boom can only help improve Ventura 
County's economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there will be a ripple effect from this new activity," Bossard 
said. "Development affects all the trades -- from building supplies to the 
people who build furnaces to those who make refrigerators." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the increase in home construction opens the door for people to 
trade up, moving now to sell their current home in favor of a new one. That can 
lead to a flurry of activity in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications this year are that county residents have already begun to re-enter 
the market in search of a second home, said Dee Zinke, executive director of 
the Building Industry Assn.'s Ventura County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is people who have been sitting on the fence deciding to 
make their move now," Zinke said. "That is having a positive impact all the way 
down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The spark for this renewed interest comes in part from fear that interest 
rates will continue to rise. Also, interest in east Ventura County can be 
traced to Los Angeles residents who are heading across the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly anecdotal evidence that people who were rattled by the 
(Northridge) earthquake are moving away from the epicenter, and that means out 
into Ventura County," Bartolotto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think the quality-of-life issues are also helping fuel development in 
areas like Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, federal law enforcement officials ranked Ventura County first 
in safety among counties in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that, more and more, Ventura County is appearing to be an 
attractive alternative to the buyer moving out of L. A.," said Kim Bryson, a 
Ventura County Economic Development Agency board member. "Hopefully that will 
lead to a gradual improvement of our economy." Ventura County Home Construction

UP IN ARMS; VETS BATTLE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT OVER CHANGES AT VA MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Northridge earthquake gravely damaged it, the stately Sepulveda 
Veterans Administration Medical Center had an unusual reputation among many 
local veterans: They liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many VA facilities are not held in much esteem by veterans. Yet Sepulveda -- 
with its serene, park-like grounds, committed staff and respected 
rehabilitation programs -- was viewed as a caring refuge for those bearing the 
physical and mental scars of service in America's wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a safe place for me," said Dan Tinder, 45, a Vietnam veteran from 
Reseda who suffers post-traumatic stress disorder. "When things got really bad, 
I had my psychiatric unit to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the quake wreaked tens of millions of dollars in damage on the 
39-year-old, red-brick federal medical complex, VA officials have made sweeping 
changes that have left Tinder and other veterans fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor wrecked Sepulveda's 431-bed hospital and knocked out heat and 
water supplies in the rest of the 51-building medical complex. More than 300 
patients, many of them elderly and infirm, were hurriedly evacuated to several 
other VA facilities in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, citing the high costs of rebuilding Sepulveda's hospital, U.S. 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown announced it would be torn down and 
replaced with a $65-million ambulatory care center offering no long-term beds 
but a range of outpatient services. The new structure is scheduled to open in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sepulveda's inpatient substance-abuse and psychiatric programs have 
been transferred to the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center in Brentwood, 15 
miles distant, over the congestion-prone San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes at Sepulveda coincide with a drive by the VA -- the nation's 
largest health care system -- to convert from high-cost, hospital-based 
treatment to outpatient care. VA officials contend that switch will allow more 
veterans to get treatment at lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But many San Fernando Valley-area veterans are angry at the Sepulveda changes. 
They say the elimination of its emergency room could jeopardize veterans' 
lives. And they complain that West Los Angeles offers lower-quality care, is 
hard to get to and treats them as ciphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the vets said the hardest battle we'll ever fight is against our own 
government," said Ryan Smith, a 24-year-old Marine veteran from Toluca Lake, 
who participated in a street-corner protest by veterans outside Sepulveda last 
week. "That is so true." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, Sepulveda has dramatically downsized its staff, 
dropping to 1,123 employees from a pre-quake level of 1,855. About 360 
employees were permanently reassigned to West Los Angeles; nearly 400 others 
retired, took buyouts or transferred to other VA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With its operating rooms shattered and its brick walls cracked, Sepulveda's 
still-standing hospital, Building 3, remains the most visible symbol of the 
quake's destructiveness. But damage is apparent throughout the sprawling 
medical center, clustered atop a low hill and flanked by long, rolling lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda's Olympic-sized pool -- once used for physical rehabilitation -- 
remains closed to veterans. Half of its gymnasium is occupied by displaced 
medical records, reducing volleyball and basketball games to half-court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although VA Secretary Brown said Sepulveda's 120-bed nursing home would reopen 
by mid-May, elderly residents were not moved back in until just after 
Thanksgiving, their return delayed in part by unreliable utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials insist the planned ambulatory care center will be a 
state-of-the-art facility, providing cardiology, neurology, rehabilitative care 
and other services, as well as minor surgery. Patients requiring major surgery 
will be sent to West Los Angeles or other VA hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sepulveda treated about 20,000 veterans in its inpatient and outpatient 
programs in the fiscal year before the quake, the ambulatory care center will 
provide outpatient care to 22,500 veterans in its first full year in operation, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda must remove low-level radioactive isotopes from the hospital before 
it can be demolished, a process that will be supervised by the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. Meantime, groundbreaking for the outpatient center is 
expected to take place in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Sepulveda's inpatient programs in mental health and drug 
and alcohol abuse were transferred to West Los Angeles. However, Sepulveda 
continues to provide outpatient care in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda Director Perry C. Norman said the transfers produced few hitches. 
With an outpatient configuration, she said, Sepulveda will be able to care for 
more veterans. She cited studies indicating that 60% of all VA inpatient 
surgeries could have been handled on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the closure of Sepulveda's hospital, psychiatric wards with more than 100 
beds and the inpatient chemical-dependence unit has sparked disappointment and 
bitterness among many local veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with chronic drug and alcohol problems said Sepulveda's treatment 
programs served as a sanctuary for them, allowing them to check in for brief 
hospitalization during periods of stress, and later check out and resume their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is so different. The staff cares so much," said Doug Gowdy, a 
29-year-old Coast Guard veteran who has been treated for alcoholism and drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, veterans said, they face staff indifference, waiting lists and 
broken appointments at West Los Angeles, the biggest of the 171 hospitals 
operated by the VA nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lacock, who served as a Marine corporal in Vietnam and now lives in 
Northridge, said West Los Angeles doctors canceled three appointments with him 
before he was able to get surgery on a finger that healed crookedly after an 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all honesty, it didn't get worse," he said. "But it's aggravating as far 
as wasted time. Man, I wasted days upon days." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie E. Gogerty, a recovering alcoholic from Van Nuys who served as an Army 
private in Saigon, said inpatient substance-abuse programs at Sepulveda were 
more in-depth, structured and effective than those at West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles VA officials said a small number of appointments have been 
flubbed with Sepulveda veterans. They acknowledged that there is a two-week 
waiting list to get into the alcohol treatment program, but no wait for 
inpatient psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a small family there; we are a larger family here," said West Los 
Angeles spokeswoman Harriett Bordenave. But, she added, "No one is denied care 
that they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans also complain about the closure of Sepulveda's emergency room, saying 
its absence could jeopardize lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda now maintains an "urgent care center" -- essentially a first-aid 
station -- that is staffed during the day but not at night. For veterans in 
medical crisis, Sepulveda staffers dial 911 and send them to nearby private 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 80 veterans have been dispatched to outside hospitals since the 
quake, with no medical complications, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley veterans said the biggest obstacle for many of them is simply getting 
to the West Los Angeles hospital, a 30-mile round trip from Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these guys are semi-homeless; they're just out of recovery," said 
Don Williams of North Hills, a recovering alcoholic who served three combat 
tours in Vietnam as an Army sergeant. "They have to take the bus, and that can 
take three or four hours to get over there. A lot of them don't have cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Bordenave said West Los Angeles operates a shuttle service between the two 
medical centers that carries 15 patients per week. She added that the Disabled 
American Veterans runs a van service as well. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials argue -- and leaders of some veterans groups agree -- that as the 
veteran population ages and treatment technology advances, it makes sense for 
the VA to place more emphasis on outpatient care, and less on inpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the VA is trying to take something away, they're trying to give them 
something back," said Terry Tracy, the Los Angeles-based state service officer 
for the American Legion, who also praised the VA for not shutting down 
Sepulveda altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Some veterans' advocates concede that complaints about Sepulveda's conversion 
to outpatient care "aren't earth-shattering," as one put it. But they argue 
that health care for veterans should not be disrupted at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who gave us a country," said Lawrence C. Caird, Sepulveda's 
administrative officer for psychiatry. "They gave us a free press. They gave us 
our suburbs. They gave us all the things we take for granted every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable to me to make a decision to make access to medical care 
less convenient to them. I can't imagine why you would do that to veterans. 
They are so special."

A $25,000 CASE OF BAD TIMING; INVESTMENTS: ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
HAVE HIT A VALLEY MAN NAMED TREASURE IN THE WALLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four days before the announcement of the biggest local government financial 
collapse in the nation's history, Clifton Treasure decided that investing 
$25,000 in Irvine school district bonds would be a pretty wise move. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the broker said, 'Irvine,' I said, 'Man, that's solid. It's a good 
deal' . . . richest county in the state," said Treasure, recalling his phone 
conversation with the salesman from the Westlake Village office of Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, the 59-year-old Studio City resident was on the phone with 
that bond salesman again, this time trying to undo the deal. Sorry, said the 
broker, no deal. 
</P>
<P>
 So begins the short but sad saga of one of Orange County's last municipal 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasure said the broker told him the best he could do was to try to sell the 
bonds for about 50 cents on the dollar -- losing half of Treasure's treasure in 
just four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential's advice: Hold on to the bonds and hope their value recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 To double-check, Treasure called another broker he knew, who told him the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a supervisor from the Prudential Securities Westlake office called to 
calm Treasure down, urging him to ride out the financial storm and see how he 
fared, Treasure said. He also reminded him to send in his check for the bonds 
-- which he still hadn't paid for, Treasure said. He had committed to the deal 
and would face legal action if he reneged, Treasure said the broker told him. 
</P>
<P>
 So -- against the advice of his attorney -- he paid up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that phone call, Treasure said he contacted the Orange County district 
attorney's office. "They seemed happy to hear from me," he said. Then he called 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, then the arbitration office of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, hoping somebody would tell him his 
problem could be solved. It couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time that Treasure, a man of modest means who manages a 
mobile home park in Monrovia, has dabbled in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second. 
</P>
<P>
 His first purchase was made years ago through First Interstate Bank, and it 
wasn't until he received a phone call from Prudential about six months ago 
urging him to expand his bond portfolio that he considered making another buy, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he purchased the school bonds, he tried to reduce his exposure to 
the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I'd like to get $10,000 in bonds and he said I couldn't. I had to 
buy $25,000. I was just trying to be a nice guy, you know. If anyone ever calls 
me on the phone again. . . . But it's a big company, the fourth-largest in the 
nation, you know. At least that's what he told me." 
</P>
<P>
 He could not make a smaller investment because of the way the bonds are 
denominated, Treasure said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake office of Prudential Securities declined to comment. Charlie 
Perkins, a spokesman for Prudential's New York headquarters, said his firm is 
obligated to warn customers about risky investments, but there was no way its 
brokers could have foreseen Orange County's impending financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Taylor, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking 
Board in Washington, said that Treasure may be able to recoup some of his money 
if his purchases are among older bonds protected by debt-service requirements 
that channel interest and principal payments into separate funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasure's bonds were first issued in January, 1977, maturing in January, 
1996, according to officials in the Orange County auditors office. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how Treasure's investment will be affected in the long run by 
the debacle, but "right now these bonds are on hold," said Gary Leach, who runs 
the claims and disbursement department of the Orange County auditor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasure said he has decided to take the broker's advice and hold on to the 
bonds in the hope that they will regain at least some of their value. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasure said that if he loses his entire investment it won't leave him broke, 
but he still feels pretty awful about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to put a down payment on some land for a house in Topanga Canyon. 
. . . It's not like I have kids who are going to go without shoes on their 
feet, but I feel like a man in a boat who just tossed $25,000 overboard," he 
said Monday. 
</P>

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MORE ATMS TO BE INSTALLED AT POLICE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying it will promote community-based policing, law enforcement officials and 
city leaders Monday announced plans to install banking machines in police 
stations throughout the city in an effort to provide residents with a safe 
haven to take care of their banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invite our citizens to come to these ATMs and use them," said Los Angeles 
Deputy Police Chief Martin Pomeroy during a news conference at the LAPD's 
Devonshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 In a citywide expansion, 13 automated teller machines will be added to LAPD 
stations. Currently nine LAPD facilities have ATMs, five of which were 
installed under a pilot program approved last year by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, ATMs are already positioned inside the Devonshire 
and Van Nuys police stations with three more scheduled to be installed next 
year at the West Valley, North Hollywood and Foothill divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will offer people a positive reason to stop by police stations," 
said Kimberly Phillips, chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Police 
Credit Union, which was chosen by the council to oversee the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, additional banking machines were placed at five police 
stations after a series of crimes against ATM users, which climaxed in the 
slaying of a pregnant woman at a Sherman Oaks ATM last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to provide residents with a safe place to use an ATM, 
particularly at night. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing officers and residents with quick cash, the machines 
have even been popular among suspects who have accessed money to make bail, 
quipped one LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the credit union loses about 15 cents on each transaction at any of 
the nine ATMs available, but at the same time it accomplishes its main goal of 
serving its members and the public, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that the machines must generate an average of 100 
transactions a day to justify their cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy was joined at the news conference by City Councilman Hal Bernson and 
Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Michael Luros. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Luros who approached Bernson about installing ATMs in police 
facilities. Luros said he hopes the machines will help restore the public's 
confidence in the police, shaken following the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to demonstrate to the public that the vast majority of police are 
mature officers who are dedicated to serving the public," Luros said. "I felt 
this was a way to reintroduce the public to police under neutral 
circumstances." JULIE TAMAKI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; OWNERS ACCEPT CITY'S OFFER ON PARKING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year struggle to establish a public parking lot in Studio City has taken 
a large leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of a 1.25-acre lot at 12229 Ventura Blvd. have accepted the city's 
offer to buy their property for $1.9 million. The sale will clear the way, city 
officials hope, for a November opening of the lot, which would contain 80 to 90 
metered spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot is behind a Household Bank and contains an actors' studio, which will 
have to be demolished.  
</P>
<P>
 Karen Patterson, a manager in the Los Angeles Transportation Department, said 
that before the deal can be concluded, the city must make sure that the 
tenant's lease will expire in a workable amount of time, because the city 
cannot afford to relocate the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Spearheading the community's long-lived quest for parking were Art Ginsburg, 
owner of Art's Deli; Ben Rinaldo, a member of the Studio City Residents Assn.; 
Tony Lucente, president of the residents group, and Sondra Frohlich, executive 
director of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "At long last we've seen the results of a very long struggle for some parking 
relief in Studio City," Lucente said. "And while this isn't the final step, 
it's a big one in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of parking has been a critical problem in the community since the early 
1960s, according to Ginsburg, who has run his restaurant for 37 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fantastic," Ginsburg said. "I think this will be a good thing 
for both the residents and the merchants. I'm glad the city is finally doing 
something to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Money to buy the land came from a discretionary parking fund of the Fifth 
Council District, Zev Yaroslavsky's district before he became a county 
supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky worked to protect the fund, which came from local parking meters, 
from being raided by the City Council for uses outside the community. Although 
the City Council has approved funding to buy the land, funding for the 
construction costs -- estimated by Patterson at $500,000 to $750,000 -- still 
needs council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patterson, the parking meters would be two- or four-hour meters 
and charge 25 cents per hour. That means that, while shoppers would find it 
easier to find parking, businesses would still face the problem of providing 
parking for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The next task for his residents group, Lucente said, is to lobby the city to 
build a multilevel parking garage on the site. If such a structure is built, 
Patterson said, longer-term parking for business employees might be possible.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; COUNCIL TO WEIGH INTERIM APPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of a drive by community activists to persuade the Los Angeles City 
Council to appoint an interim Fifth District member for the next six months 
could be decided by the council today. 
</P>
<P>
 On the council's agenda is a proposal to call a special election to fill the 
seat vacated by Zev Yaroslavsky earlier this month. Under the city's bylaws, if 
the council wishes to appoint an interim member, it must do so before it orders 
a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although vacancies have arisen in the past, the council has not appointed an 
interim member in the last 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council district office is currently being run by a caretaker, Avak 
Keotahian, a former city legislative analyst who has no vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders say, however, that severe earthquake damage to Sherman Oaks 
has made it critical for the area to have a voting representative. The interim 
council member would oversee the community's rebuilding and the establishment 
of an emergency recovery area there. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5th District also includes Bel-Air, Century City, Fairfax, Westwood and 
portions of Studio City, Van Nuys and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For the council to appoint an interim representative, it would have to put off 
the special election vote and a council member would have to request that an 
item calling for the appointment be placed on the agenda, according to Michael 
Carey, executive officer in the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would then have two deadlines. It can delay calling the special 
election for only so long -- until Feb. 15, to be exact -- if the council wants 
to consolidate the special election with the general elections in April, 1995, 
said Kristin Heffron, head of the city's Elections Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Heffron said that if the council wishes to appoint a short-term council member 
-- someone who would run the office until June 30, 1995 -- it must do so by no 
later than Jan. 11. Otherwise, the appointee would be a long-term replacement, 
staying in office for the remainder of Yaroslavsky's term, which ends on June 
30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also must abide by a city requirement that an appointee live, and 
be registered to vote, in the district for 30 days prior to selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men have been mentioned as candidates for the interim post, former 
Yaroslavsky aide Michael Jimenez and Robert Geoghegan -- who served as chief 
deputy to former Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman.  
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez registered to vote in Bel-Air on Dec. 5, but Geoghegan was not 
registered to vote in the district, according to a spokeswoman for the Los 
Angeles County Registrar of Voters. However, another spokeswoman said that if 
Geoghegan had re-registered in the past few days, the changes may have not 
shown up in the system.  
</P>
<P>
 Geoghegan said Monday that he had sent in a change-of-address form to the 
registrar on Friday, the same day he moved to Cheviot Hills. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TIGER FAMILY SETTLED AT WILDLIFE REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mama tiger, papa tiger and the two cubs rescued from an Irish farm seemed 
Monday to be adjusting well to their new home at the Wildlife Waystation animal 
refuge, director Martine Colette said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old female, who had been separated from the 6-week-old cubs for the 
weekend while flying to Los Angeles from Europe, readily accepted them back 
late Sunday night, Colette said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tigers arrived at the sanctuary in the mountains above Lake View Terrace 
on Sunday afternoon, and a veterinarian had been concerned that the mother 
might attack the cubs rather than resume nursing. But, Colette said, there was 
"lots of baby nursing going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The family of Siberian tigers had been living in what were described as the 
"most appalling conditions" on a farm in Ireland. The Irish branch of the 
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, acting on a tip, confiscated the 
animals and arranged for them to be taken to the Wildlife Waystation, home to 
1,500 animals, including dozens of big cats. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer who had been keeping the tigers faces criminal charges of cruelty 
to animals, according to Irish press reports. ALAN ABRAHAMSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; GRAY SQUAD TO HELP SENIORS BEAT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flipping through the pages of a law enforcement magazine had Los Angeles 
Police Capt. Val Paniccia seeing gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Not content to sit by and allow criminals to have an easy go at preying on the 
elderly in the West Valley Division, Paniccia gleaned an idea from the magazine 
and launched the "Gray Squad," a new task force that will stress crime 
prevention among senior citizens and address a host of other needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cowards of our criminal society pick on easy victims, and I'm afraid 
senior citizens are some of those people," said Paniccia, who heads the LAPD's 
West Valley Division in Reseda. "They're more susceptible to being overpowered, 
and they're singled out by cowards for purse snatches and other crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 So Paniccia joined forces with Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick to 
start the squad, which is made up of police officers, public service officials 
and health-care providers, as well as trained senior volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's goal is to educate the elderly on how to become "crime 
resistant" while providing them with access to a host of services to draw upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often, what seniors turn to the LAPD about is not always a police 
issue," Chick said. "They just don't know where else to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Iain Hamilton, who heads the squad at the West Valley Division, said 
so far five senior volunteers have received training to help staff a referral 
service that will provide the elderly with information on a laundry list of 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, elderly residents can receive information from the service on how 
to arrange rides to a senior citizens center so that they won't have to spend 
the day home alone or how to get help from fire officials on getting smoke 
detectors installed inside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the elderly that are maybe too timid to ask for help will begin 
turning to us so that we can give them the assistance they need," Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Bloom, a 71-year-old Gray Squad volunteer, said her job also involves 
referring seniors who have fallen victim to crimes, such as a carjacking, 
burglary or physical abuse, to the proper police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 A liaison from Chick's office is expected to begin visiting senior apartment 
complexes, recreation centers and other organizations for the elderly to get 
the word out about the new squad, which Paniccia expects to be fully 
operational by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Paniccia said he hopes the squad will be located in a police 
substation that is expected to open in downtown Reseda next year. JULIE TAMAKI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; CYCLIST BRINGS SAFETY PROGRAM TO L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last 12 years, Tana Ball's life has revolved around bicycles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth woman was a coach for the United States Cycling Federation, 
U.S. junior national amateur teams and a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department women's team. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows the benefits of bicycling from her vantage point as coach, and in 
the mid-1980s she began to think of introducing the sport of bicycle racing to 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a dream of mine since I worked at the Olympic Training Center," 
Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also knows the importance of helmets and bicycle safety. As a bicycle 
racer in 1987, she was competing at the velodrome built for the 1984 Olympics 
when she crashed at over 30 m.p.h. She was unconscious for several hours but 
her helmet saved her from serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she authored a proposal for a bicycle safety education program that 
will become part of the physical education curriculum in middle and high 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Ball's bicycle safety proposal was approved the day before she 
received her last physical therapy session to treat injuries from a bicycle 
accident last summer. More than 80% of the funding for the $617,000 two-year 
program will be provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said 
Ball, who will be the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Program components will include building self-esteem, increasing the 
acceptance of helmets and encouraging students to seek alternative methods of 
transportation. One long-term goal is to change the normal patterns of 
commuting by car that develop when students graduate and become employed, Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball said the program, called Bicycle Commuting and Safety Video Education, 
will provide lesson plans and an instructional video for all physical education 
instructors in the district, and should reach an estimated 400,000 students.  
</P>
<P>
 Ball said the program can be used by all teachers even if they have no 
experience with cycling. Students will receive bike handling and safety 
information that will help them be more defensive bicyclists when they ride on 
public roads, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Ball's first instructional film project. In 1987, she was an 
adviser for the film "Be Safe on Your Bike," produced for the Los Angeles 
Police Department. That film was made in cooperation with the USC film 
department. USC will also assist with the current project, which Ball said will 
reduce the video's production costs. RAY PATTERSON

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY COUNCIL ROLLS BACK CABLE TV RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cable television subscribers in Burbank will get a slight reprieve when they 
receive their monthly bills from now on, thanks to a rate rollback enacted by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly charge for Sammons Communications' basic Lifeline service, which 
includes over-the-air broadcast channels and public access stations, will be 
reduced 27 cents to $10.29, while the cost for renting cable converter boxes 
will be cut by up to 90 cents per month, depending on the type rented, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Stassi, director of the city's Public Service Department, said the rate 
rollbacks will be retroactive to July 15 and subscribers will receive refunds 
for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate changes are part of Burbank's efforts to take advantage of the 
limited regulatory powers granted to cities over their cable TV franchisees 
under the 1992 federal Cable Television Act. The city has been certified by the 
Federal Communications Commission to regulate rates, Stassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons, which provides cable service to Glendale and Burbank and has about 
70,000 subscribers in the two cities, is currently in negotiations with both 
cities for renewal of its franchise agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons subscribers in Glendale will not be affected by the Burbank rate 
rollback. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose service has been criticized by subscribers in surveys, is 
expected to agree to build a new fiber-optic system that will increase its 
channel capacity as a condition of its new franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the monthly Lifeline fee and the equipment charges, Burbank 
also rolled back the hourly rate for service calls from $71.25 to $39.02 -- a 
drop of 45%. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PLANNERS TO WEIGH FATE OF 75-FOOT SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas Planning Commission on Thursday will consider a restaurant 
owner's request to be allowed to keep his freeway sign for 15 years, instead of 
taking it down within 90 days, as the commission has ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Soller, owner of Red Robin Restaurant on Calabasas Road, argues that 
under the state's business and professions code, he has 15 years to remove the 
75-foot-tall sign installed about 22 years ago.The meeting will be at City Hall 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials maintain that the restaurant sign, and a 100-foot Mobil service 
station sign next door, have been in violation of a Los Angeles County 
ordinance adopted in 1977, which sets a 42-foot height limit on such signs. The 
city has invited both business owners to apply to the city for permission to 
use 42-foot signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobil station owner, John Barkhordar has indicated that he will appeal the 
Planning Commission's decision to the City Council, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkhordar and Soller say they need the signs to attract business from the 
freeway and that business would drop off if the signs came down. Barkhordar 
said he put up a temporary, 42-foot sign to see if it would be visible from the 
freeway, but it was not.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the sign ordinance is designed to protect the scenic beauty 
of the city, not to harass business owners. The issue has ignited a controversy 
in Agoura Hills, where freeway signs were outlawed in 1985.  
</P>
<P>
 The businesses were supposed to have removed their signs by March, 1992, but 
many have refused and 12 have sued the city. A hearing has been set for Feb. 15 
in Van Nuys Superior Court. FRANK MANNING

 One of two Agoura High School students who sheriff's deputies say set fire to 
another student has been expelled, according to the school district's top 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made last week at a special meeting by the Las Virgenes 
Unified School District Board of Education, said Supt. Albert Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of behavior that we had is totally unacceptable and unlawful and 
will not be tolerated," Marley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board postponed disciplinary action for 30 days for the other youth, at 
the youth's request, Marley said. The student had the legal right to request 
the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths, ages 16 and 17, set Benjamin Goldhammer on fire Nov. 16 as he 
stood in a lunch line in the school's cafeteria, according to Lt. Jim Glazar of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The youths were standing behind 
the victim when one of them held out a cigarette lighter and ignited his shirt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said at the time that they had heard there was a history of 
animosity between Benjamin and one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The students called the action a "prank that got out of control," Marley said, 
but "the board simply felt that under California law this is certainly 
justification for expulsion. Sometimes motive or intent is irrelevant; another 
person was badly injured." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old youth, who suffered second-degree burns to his back and 
buttocks, was still recovering at home, Marley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "His dressings are still required to be changed a few times a day," Marley 
said. "It was obviously a severe burn." The school district has provided a home 
tutor for the student, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsion will last at least until the end of the school year, Marley 
said. The expelled student, a junior at the high school, has the right to 
petition for readmittance next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ryder, deputy in charge of the Sylmar district attorney's office, said 
that the case is being reviewed and that charges may be filed against the 
youths. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; REDEDICATION SET FOR EXPANDED COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 City and county officials will hold rededication ceremonies next week for 
Burbank's newly renovated courthouse, which has been expanded so that the court 
can begin trying felonies and other Superior Court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 About 32,000 square feet have been added to the 40-year-old courthouse at 300 
E. Olive Ave., including a new Superior Court courtroom, a new municipal 
courtroom, court clerk's offices, a jury facility and a detention area. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion -- funded by Los Angeles County -- and an adjacent five-story 
parking structure, which opened last summer and was paid for by the city of 
Burbank, add up to $10 million in improvements to the courthouse this year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion, which has been in the works for about eight years, turns the 
building into a fully modern facility and alleviates its longstanding parking 
crunch.  
</P>
<P>
 The refurbished courthouse will meet Americans With Disabilities Act 
requirements and will also include new offices for the district attorney and 
public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 The rededication ceremony, scheduled for noon Monday at the courthouse, will 
include appearances by County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, Burbank Mayor Bill 
Wiggans and Municipal Judges Marion Gubler, David Schacter and Thomas Murphy.

QUAKE GROUP CRITICAL OF QUACKENBUSH; POLITICS: INSURANCE COMMISSIONER-ELECT 
DRAWS FIRE FOR TIES TO INDUSTRY, IS PRESSED TO PROBE TREATMENT OF 
POLICYHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Northridge-based group, formed to help homeowners settle earthquake 
insurance claims, criticized newly elected state Insurance Commissioner Charles 
Quackenbush on Monday for relying on a transition team composed almost entirely 
of insurance-industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- called Community Assisting Recovery (CARe) -- also asked that 
Commissioner-elect Quackenbush investigate the treatment of earthquake 
policy-holders by insurance firms following the Jan. 17 disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want Mr. Quackenbush to live up to his promises. . . . We want to make 
sure he does not ignore the consumer to the benefit of the industry," George 
Kehrer, executive director of CARe, said at a news conference in one of the 
hardest-hit areas, south of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real issue out there is the adjusters who are not addressing the asbestos 
problems, who are not addressing foundation problems, who are ignoring slab 
problems," Kehrer said. "When adjusters know that slabs get cracked by 
earthquakes and then don't tell a homeowner to lift up the carpet to see what 
kind of cracks they have in the slab, that to me is an insurance fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His spokesman, Greg Butler, denied that the new commissioner is consulting 
exclusively with industry officials, adding that if homeowners are having 
problems with insurance settlements they should complain to Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi, who is in office until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even taken office yet," Butler said in a telephone interview from 
Sacramento. "But we have been very clear that where there is a problem with an 
insurance company . . . we will make sure that problem is corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Kehrer at the news conference was Ina De Long, president of United 
Policyholders Inc., an Oakland-based nonprofit insurance consumer group, and 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes Sherman Oaks and 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he plans to introduce legislation to help address some of the 
problems homeowners are having with insurance companies and banks regarding 
their quake-damaged properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can expect the Senate to hold tough hearings and take a tough response," 
he said. "We should put Mr. Quackenbush and the industry on notice that they 
can win an election, but they still have a problem to solve." 
</P>
<P>
 CARe will hold a free workshop today from 3 to 9 p.m. at the FEMA center in 
Chatsworth, 20525 Nordhoff St. Attorneys will be available to review homeowner 
policies and give advice.

MCKEON, MOORHEAD TO LEAD HOUSE PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both of the San Fernando Valley area's Republican congressmen have emerged 
from leadership meetings this week as chairmen of House subcommittees, 
substantially increasing their clout on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon of Santa Clarita has been selected chairman of the 
subcommittee on postsecondary education, training and lifelong learning, while 
Glendale Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead was named chairman of the subcommittee on 
intellectual property and judicial administration, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's panel, which is under the jurisdiction of the Economic and 
Educational Opportunities Committee, will allow him to help prepare California 
workers for mid-career changes, his aides said. The selection was seen as a 
major vote of confidence in McKeon, who is beginning his second term in the 
House, by GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, will handle 
copyright and trade issues that are essential to the region's entertainment and 
high-tech industries. Earlier, Moorhead had been bypassed for two chairmanships 
of full committees, a blow to the 11-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceding power are Reps. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), Howard Berman 
(D-Mission Hills) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who will all give up their 
subcommittee chairmanships when the 104th Congress convenes next month.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; SURVIVOR REMEMBERS THE LESSONS OF INTERNMENT CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reporter's search for one of more than 100,000 U.S. citizens of Japanese 
ancestry relocated to camps during World War II led to the San Fernando Valley 
Japanese American Community Center and Ed Koyama, a 73-year-old retired 
pharmacist from North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you go to camp?" the center's receptionist called out to senior citizens, 
in a surprisingly matter-of-fact way, as she led the way through the kitchen 
and dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Koyama volunteered to share his experiences in the camps and his feelings 
about a new exhibit about them at the Japanese American National Museum, as 
well as the current political sentiment toward immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Koyama said he harbors no resentment about being relocated from his home in 
Los Angeles to Arkansas in his late teens but feels strongly that people should 
know what happened. He donated more than half of the $20,000 in reparations he 
received to the museum to memorialize his relatives and support his community. 
</P>
<P>
 A Nisei is a second-generation Japanese American; Sansei, third generation, 
and Nihonjin, a Japanese person. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you remember what happened when it was announced that people were 
going to be interned? Can you tell me what that was like?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It was all over the radio at that time, and it was kind of strange. We 
knew it was coming: The posters were up, the police and the Italian evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us were going to the camp at Santa Anita, but we had relatives in 
Fresno and in the San Joaquin Valley. So the thing was, my dad's brother and my 
mother's sister married so they were very close. When we found out that my 
dad's brother was interned because he was a professional photographer -- of 
course, he was taking pictures of dams and all of this stuff -- and somehow the 
FBI found out all that stuff. So all of a sudden they just picked him up, like 
many strategic individuals were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four girls in that family and no father, and we had two boys and 
two girls in our family, so we thought we'd better go up there and stick 
together. We never knew what was going to happen in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought that if we ran to the San Joaquin Valley, we would get away from 
the evacuation because we weren't actually in L.A. But that wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't know what was going to happen, but we were finally put into the 
Fresno fairgrounds, which became the temporary center for people within the 
Fresno area. 
</P>
<P>
 And then they sent us to Arkansas. We were sent to Rohrer Camp. Anyway, it was 
quite a ride in these old rickety-rackety trains that were pulled out of the 
woodwork. They were old sleeper cars, and they were really dusty and dirty, but 
we were younger, so we didn't realize too much of it. It was a long ride, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 So then we got settled there. Of course, we never knew what the future was. We 
didn't know how long we were going to be stuck there. I had a little medical 
background, so I worked in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Before you were sent to the camp, how were people reacting to people like 
you who looked like they were of Japanese ancestry?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's really hard to say. There was some killing going on, you know, with 
some of these crazy nuts going to these farms. So there was some tension. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a cleaning shop on 7th and Alvarado, and when it was announced, you 
know, as we walked down our street, people would be spitting on us. Of course, 
we were kind of young and not experienced at this kind of thing. We were rather 
humiliated. I didn't think it was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, we had a cleaning shop and they gave us a certain amount of time to 
get rid of it. Well, we really didn't have too much time, so most all people 
just gave it away for practically nothing just to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a home and then we had a two-unit in the rear where we put all our 
furnishings. We galvanized all our windows with metal, and within six months or 
so, we had a real estate company taking care of the place. We didn't know how 
much we could depend on them. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden we found out the place was ransacked. It was so ransacked 
there wasn't a rag on the floor. We had just bought that furniture six months 
ago, you know, all of it. But what are you going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say how I really feel about it. I think, in one way, thinking 
very shallowly, I thought we were safer in camp than being outside during those 
rough times, because of how crazy people were outside. There could have been a 
lot more harassment and killing. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's only in the U.S. where they are going to set up these camps and 
clothe you and feed you. They had all these different auditoriums and schools 
set up, and Boy Scouts and everything. I think it would have been a lot 
different in Germany or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of Niseis are very bitter about this whole thing. I think the U.S. did 
what they could do, despite the fact that it was wrong to put people in camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, just think, after the war they really opened up avenues for Nihonjin and 
Niseis and Sanseis, and we really bounced back. You can tell how well the 
Niseis have done and you just don't know how well we would have done if we 
stayed in the city while the war was on. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in one sense, it was good. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then how was it bad?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's bad that we were American citizens, you know, and they did this. But I 
think it was inevitable. At least, I'm thankful for what the government did. In 
Europe, we would have really been put in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
 I really don't have much bitterness to the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about things that are going on now, like Proposition 187.  
</P>
<P>
 A: From what I hear, the thing about 187, most people think it's strictly a 
Spanish problem. Because all we see is these Spanish people coming in, the 
Mexicans coming through creating all these social problems. And then we have to 
take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon they have kids here, and they become American citizens. But I 
understand the problem is with Japanese, too. And there are other races that 
are involved in this. People are coming in illegally all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fault of the U.S. government. They should stop illegal immigration. 
You can't condemn people and not give medical aid to babies and try to ship 
them back out. It's too late for that. 
</P>
<P>
 From now, they should really do something very seriously. I think Mexico 
should do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is just too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little despairing about Japanese families as a whole. You don't hear 
them raising too much noise about their heritage. You know why? Because they 
worked hard, made money and sent their kids through college. They are 
well-fixed. They don't make any waves. Nihonjins aren't making waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks are. The Spanish are. Some Japanese are, you know, the die-hard 
Japanese. I think that's good. Like the Japanese American Citizens League. Even 
JACL has the right ideas but they don't go all out trying to help blacks and 
Mexicans. But I think one thing. Nihonjins feel that we got money, we got 
education, so we shouldn't have to help them in any way, and I think the 
Japanese better wise up. Japanese also have to get together and start learning 
about their heritage and see how important it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you want people to know about your experience in the relocation 
camps?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it was a good experience. I really realize the value of parents 
now. I try to tell my daughter, too. Whether she's getting it or not, I don't 
know, but you have to try. If you hear it once, they are going to remember. If 
I die, she's going to repeat my story. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to you is like talking to my daughter. I think it's hard for you to 
visualize. No matter how much I tell you, and I'm trying to tell you the truth, 
it's hard to visualize.

L.A. MAY BE ON HUD PROGRAM 'SHORT LIST'; REDEVELOPMENT: DECISION ON 
'EMPOWERMENT ZONES' IS DUE NEXT WEEK. OFFICIALS SAY REQUEST FOR MORE 
INFORMATION IS A GOOD SIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One week before the federal government selects six "empowerment zone" 
finalists from a nationwide list, Los Angeles officials said they are 
optimistic that a local application will be selected, providing blighted 
communities $100 million in special aid and tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Local development officials said Monday that Los Angeles' application has made 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development's "short list" and has a good 
chance of being selected as one of the finalists chosen from a field of 78 
applicants. The decision will be announced Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very optimistic about next week," said Corole Carrillo, the county's 
director of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones are the engine of President Clinton's urban revitalization 
program, a designation that provides blighted neighborhoods tax breaks for 
business within the zone and grants for job training, child care and other 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint application submitted by Los Angeles county and city officials in June 
proposes a 20-square-mile empowerment zone that includes economically 
disadvantaged neighborhoods from Pacoima to South-Central to Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each zone considered by HUD is limited to 20,000 residents and must meet 
specific requirements for unemployment and poverty rates. Only 4.4% of the 
city's jurisdiction can be included in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 From 25% to 40% of the 13,400 residents in the Pacoima section of the zone are 
considered impoverished. The area includes the Hansen Dam recreation area and 
the San Fernando Gardens, a low-income housing project that shelters more than 
2,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the application is such a high priority that Los Angeles officials 
have been speculating about HUD's upcoming decision based on preliminary 
signals from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, HUD officials asked Los Angeles officials and other applicants to 
provide additional details on how they expect to spend federal grants to 
provide social services within the empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some officials have speculated that the request indicates that the 
Los Angeles application lacked enough information, HUD officials said the 
request is good news, meaning the applicant is being seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Applications that are being more seriously considered by HUD Secretary Henry 
Cisneros were contacted last week by the review panel to provide some 
clarification," said Mark Fabiani, a former Los Angeles deputy mayor who is now 
a deputy assistant HUD secretary sitting on the panel that will select the six 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials took the HUD request as a signal that Los Angeles has a good 
chance of winning a highly coveted empowerment zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our understanding is that we are among the finalists," said Marilyn Lurie, a 
director in the city's Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional information requested by HUD, which one county official 
described as "pretty minor points," was due Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo agreed that the request for additional information is a positive 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that HUD asked us to provide some clarification," he said. "We 
saw that as only good news." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he doesn't know how many applicants are on the "short list" but 
was told by HUD that the list of 78 applicants has been substantially narrowed 
to a "smaller population of applicants." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Mike Hernandez, whose South Los Angeles district 
includes major portions of the proposed zone, was cautiously optimistic about 
the Los Angeles application. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've heard is we're getting it but I'm not saying that until it 
happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez added that the application was once in jeopardy because state 
officials threatened to charge a 5% administration fee to process the federal 
empowerment zone funding for the city and county of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez said the application became more competitive since Gov. Pete 
Wilson's administration agreed last week to drop the fee request. Pacoima 
Empowerment Zone 
</P>
<P>
 An application for a proposed federal empowerment zone has made the Department 
of Housing & Urban Development's "short list," indicating it has a good chance 
of being chosen. It would include a 2.4-square-mile area of Pacoima plagued by 
poverty and high unemployment rates. The zone, the centerpiece of President 
Clinton's urban revitalization efforts, is expected to provide tax breaks, 
grants and social services programs.

FEE BACKED FOR COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest development in a long controversy, a Los Angeles city panel 
recommended Monday charging residents $200 to have animal regulation officers 
trap and kill coyotes that venture into residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by the City Council's Public Safety Committee is part of a 
new coyote-trapping policy that was created following clashes between 
animal-rights activists and residents who were frustrated with growing reports 
of coyote attacks on pets, particularly in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-rights activists urged city officials to ban trapping, saying the city 
should instead educate people on ways to coexist with area wildlife. But some 
residents asked for more trapping to help eliminate coyote problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to accommodate both sides, the city's Animal Regulations 
Commission adopted a policy in June to charge residents a fee to have animal 
regulation officials set traps, but only after property owners meet certain 
conditions, such as putting up fences to deter coyote attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lila Brooks, director of California Wildlife Defenders and a longtime opponent 
of coyote trapping, urged the panel to increase the fee to at least $600 to 
discourage residents from requesting traps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm suggesting that coyote trapping is unnecessary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal regulation officials also asked the Public Safety Committee on Monday 
to allow them to fill six vacant positions to help implement the new coyote 
policy. Due to staff shortages, animal regulation officials say they have been 
unable to launch the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee declined to vote on the staff decision and sent the matter to 
committees on personnel and financing. HUGO MARTIN

MOTOWN MUSIC WRITER HELD IN VALLEY SLAYING AFTER SEARCH; CRIME: A CHICAGO

 Across the nation, people were looking for Jack Goga. 
</P>
<P>
 From Woodland Hills, where police say he killed his host, to Simi Valley, 
where he is suspected of assaulting his ex-wife's old boyfriend, to his 
Michigan hometown where he was finally arrested Saturday night, the hunt was 
on.  
</P>
<P>
 Goga's half-sister wanted to know why she hadn't heard from him in months. The 
family of Digna Adames, a 25-year-old Chicago singer whom Goga had taken to Los 
Angeles, wanted to know why she had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles police wanted to know what happened in the house on Del Valle 
Avenue in Woodland Hills, where Charles (Chick) Evans was found shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga, a 50-year-old Motown songwriter and former record producer, had been 
staying at the house with Evans. When Evans' bullet-riddled body was discovered 
there by a friend last week, Goga had vanished along with Evans' car. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga left behind notes containing the names of people he was planning to kill, 
Los Angeles police say -- including the man who found Evans' body; Goga's 
ex-wife, Kate Wolfe; her father and Adames. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the people who had been looking for Adames fear the worst. "It doesn't 
look too good for my sister," said Rosa Medina, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Huntington Woods, a town north of Detroit where Goga grew up, found 
him Saturday night after his half-sister, Mary Danescu, 67, reported a prowler 
in her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers followed footprints in the snow from Danescu's home and eventually 
caught a shivering Goga a few blocks away, carrying a loaded revolver, said Lt. 
John Morrison of the Huntington Woods Police Department. Los Angeles and Simi 
Valley police were planning to fly to Michigan to interview Goga today. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga grew up in the house where Danescu now lives, but he went to California 
to make it in the music business more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked as a record producer, according to an ASCAP biography, and wrote a 
few songs, including some for Marvin Gaye and the Four Tops. Then, in the 
1980s, Goga left his first wife for Wolfe, a Simi Valley woman, Danescu said. 
</P>
<P>
 They married six years ago, Danescu said, but the marriage broke up about two 
years ago and that shattered Goga. 
</P>
<P>
 He began staying with friends in California, moving from one place to another. 
Danescu said she heard he once lived in his car for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Chicago about a year ago, Danescu said, and met Adames, a 
cosmetician and mother of a 7-year-old boy.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Medina, Adames was in a singing group of three women, to whom 
Goga promised a contract with Warner Bros. The group recorded a song, but when 
Goga tried to persuade them to go with him to Los Angeles to present the music, 
only Adames agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was a little nervous about going, but she wanted to take a chance," 
Medina said. "She is a single mother, and she wanted to do right by (her son). 
She wanted to put him in private school." 
</P>
<P>
 Goga also ingratiated himself with Adames' family, staying in their house for 
about a month before leaving, Medina said, promising the financially strapped 
household he would supply it with a microwave and put Adames' 19-year-old 
brother through the Chicago Institute of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 In late May, Adames and Goga drove to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Goga had become infatuated with Adames, although she had a fiance in Chicago, 
LAPD Detective Larry Dolley said. Goga carried a picture of Adames' old singing 
group and would point her out as his girlfriend, Dolley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Adames had always tried to keep her relationship with Goga on a professional 
level, Medina said. She would call home from California virtually every day, 
and she sent several packages to her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The last call came on Father's Day, June 19. She had arranged to return to 
Chicago the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had said he was going to hook her up with the right people," Dolley said. 
He speculated that she might have changed her mind and that he then killed her. 
 
</P>
<P>
 When she didn't come home, Adames' family reported her missing. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 21, Dolley said, Goga attacked Wolfe's old boyfriend at his Simi 
Valley residence and wrestled with him over a gun, then fled. Simi Valley 
police obtained a warrant for his arrest, but couldn't find him. His only 
address, police said, was a post office box. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after, he moved in with Evans, a retired movie technician with a 
fondness for cars. Neighbors said the friendly Evans and cold Goga were an odd 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Police speculate that Goga shot Evans about three weeks ago, probably because 
Evans wanted Goga to leave. Goga, Dolley said, then seems to have stayed in the 
house with Evans' body for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
 When a friend telephoned asking for Evans, Goga would say Evans was sick or 
out of the house, Dolley said. But the friend, a 45-year-old Van Nuys man, 
became suspicious, went to the house and discovered the body, Dolley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Goga was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began to hunt. They staked out the house, circulated descriptions of 
Evans' yellow 1972 Volvo station wagon and called Huntington Woods police to 
warn that Goga might be returning. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later he was arrested in Michigan and taken to a hospital with a 
diabetic condition and dislocated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said they didn't know if Goga truly intended to carry out 
the death threats in the notes he left behind.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a weapon with him when he was arrested, so anything's possible," 
Dolley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary Danescu says she's not certain now if she wants to see her half-brother. 
"I'm so depressed by the way his life has turned out," she said. "He had such 
talent. He wrote such beautiful music."

MIRA LOMA JAIL SEEN AS SCHOOL SITE; EDUCATION: EXPELLED STUDENTS COULD CONTINUE 
THEIR STUDIES IN THE FORMER DETENTION FACILITY, ACCORDING TO A PROPOSAL TO 
COUNTY SUPERVISORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local school officials want to see troublesome students spend time in jail, 
and what's more, they want the youths to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind a request to be presented today to the County Board of 
Supervisors that the abandoned Mira Loma jail in Lancaster be made available as 
classroom space for students expelled from the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, classes would be held in the visitors' center or another 
large room at the facility. Officials hope the austere surroundings might have 
a beneficial effect on the youths, who could volunteer to attend after being 
ejected from their regular campuses for weapons possession or other serious 
offenses, said district Trustee Bill Olenick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a jail cell, but it certainly has the visual impact of a guard tower 
and barbed wire surrounding the facility," Olenick said. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of deputies working out of Mira Loma to relieve crowding at the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station would serve as an additional deterrent to 
untoward behavior, Olenick said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many teachers oppose the idea, saying that it undermines the district's 
"zero tolerance" program that automatically expels students for serious 
offenses, said Dave Kennedy, president of the Antelope Valley Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a last-ditch schooling alternative "weakens the message we should be 
sending to our students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 students were expelled from the district last year. Olenick said 
some deserve another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the students that need education the most," he said. "My district, 
frankly, is uncomfortable with turning them on the community full-time." 
</P>
<P>
 But having expelled students on the streets is "a law enforcement problem," 
Kennedy said. "Our problem is trying to make the campuses that our students 
attend as safe as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he is also concerned that the district wants to open the school 
so it will not lose the per-student revenue the state gives school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick rejected the allegation, calling the school a "break-even" venture 
only if Mira Loma can be used free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "So long as a student is fixable, we have a responsibility to try and help 
them get through school and improve their lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Michael Antonovich will sponsor today's proposal, which 
requests that the school district be allowed to use the facility free of 
charge, subject to cancellation if it is needed for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail, with room for 1,900 inmates, was closed last year because of county 
budget cuts. Olenick said the school could open within 30 days if the county 
approves it. 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be a "step below" three existing continuation schools in the 
district, which work with about 750 problem students, because it would deal 
with more serious offenders, Olenick said. He said the facility would probably 
not offer diplomas, but students who perform well might be allowed to re-enter 
district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick said he believes some students would voluntarily enroll at the school, 
even though it would be much more disciplined than a normal classroom, because 
it would be preferable to a life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some kids who are good kids 99% of the time and did something 
stupid," he said.

SULPHUR SPRINGS DISTRICT APPOINTS BOARD MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer salesman has been appointed to replace a Sulphur Springs Union 
School District board member who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Sturgeon, a 14-year resident of the area, was selected from nine 
candidates who applied for the opening left by the resignation of Gary 
DeRevere.The Board of Trustees announced his appointment late Friday after 
interviewing candidates for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 DeRevere was elected to the board last year, despite withdrawing from the race 
one month before the election. He accepted the position after three weeks of 
deliberating, but resigned Nov. 14, saying his job as an electrical contractor 
kept him from giving enough attention to his position on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturgeon owns a business in the Valencia Industrial Center that distributes 
software and other computer supplies, district Supt. Robert Nolet said. The new 
board member has two children at Sulphur Springs Elementary School and has been 
involved in numerous school activities, including serving as president of an 
advisory council to the principal of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be formally seated at the board's meeting Wednesday. His appointment 
will become permanent unless a petition calling for an election is filed with 
the Los Angeles County superintendent of schools within 30 days, Nolet said.

O.C. AND STATE IN TENTATIVE ACCORD ON SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and local education officials have come to a tentative agreement with 
Orange County to keep all school funds in an account separate from the ailing 
county treasury, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at the state Department of Education said they will not send 
$47 million due Orange County districts at month's end unless they get a 
guarantee from the Board of Supervisors or a court that the money will be used 
only for education. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's bankruptcy attorney, Bruce Bennett, said Monday that he would 
probably approve such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept that new money provided by the state should be segregated and 
applied solely for its intended purposes is sensible and is acceptable to the 
county," Bennett said. "That pattern will hold where it continues to make 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart, an attorney for the Orange County Department of Education, 
said he had faxed a draft of the plan to county officials late Monday and 
expected approval as early as this morning. He said the plan would include 
segregation of all incoming school funds and a conservative investment policy 
for that money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can reach this agreement, that'll get us out of the woods in the short 
term and we can continue to operate," Wenkart said. "Then we can deal with the 
long term." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling last week's bankruptcy filing "surely one of the gravest crises yet to 
confront public education," County Supt. of Schools John F. Dean said he is 
"hopeful that special protections can be put in place . . . to ensure that 
monies collected for public education are available only for those purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 But until the plan is secure, officials in local districts remain concerned 
about everything from meeting their payroll to paying their electric bills. 
Teachers are paid monthly. Other district employees are normally paid 
semimonthly, but were scheduled to receive paychecks both this Friday and last 
because of the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-daily memo from Dean to local superintendents Monday said he 
"anticipates" approval of this Friday's payroll to 28,000 school employees and 
that he has "not yet heard" about January paychecks for the county's 20,000 
schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to unduly panic people, but we feel an obligation to be 
honest with them and say, 'We don't know,' " Capistrano Unified School District 
spokeswoman Jackie Price said. "We can't guarantee that there will or will not 
be a Jan. 3 pay. It's out of our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Other school administrators said they are still keeping capital improvements 
on indefinite hold, have frozen all hiring and stopped all but essential 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not making any large purchases for paper, pencils and crayons," said 
Jack Sarnicky of the Anaheim City School District. "Things that are normally 
stocked at a level to last a couple of months, we are just using what's on hand 
. . . letting those stocks come down until we hear whether we can pay vendors." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the county's 31 school districts have scheduled a special meeting 
this morning at 7:30 for further updates on the ongoing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Secretary of Child Development and Education Maureen DiMarco 
expressed confidence that the schools would continue to run smoothly, while 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said the Legislature should consider emergency 
loans to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people expecting 30-some school districts to go belly up. 
That's a rash, unwarranted assumption at this point," said DiMarco, who is from 
Cypress. "I think everyone is legitimately concerned, but I certainly urge 
people to not panic at this point. We don't have information that warrants 
panic at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, meanwhile, said schools should be considered separately from cities and 
other government agencies as state officials consider bailing out Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to let school districts shut down," said Brown, who is 
considering convening a special session of the Legislature in response to 
Orange County's crisis. "You have to step up to the plate, because (schools) 
are running out of money now." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, county officials said, the schools may be the first to receive solid 
assurances about their future, with plans in the works to set up a fund 
separate from the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday afternoon, acting state Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson sent a letter to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley demanding 
that the supervisors agree by Friday to segregate all local tax revenue, state 
and federal money earmarked for public schools from the county treasury. Dawson 
also asked in the letter that the supervisors use the segregated funds to 
"ensure the orderly conduct of public education . . . making the payment of 
school district payrolls a top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 "Education is different than any other public service, it is required by the 
Constitution," said Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Education. "The state is under an obligation to continue the education of 
children, where they don't have an obligation to continue sewer service." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Riley, Dawson said that unless the supervisors agree by 
Friday to protect school money from the bankruptcy action, he will circumvent 
the county and find a way to deliver money directly to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, we're not going to send it, not unless we get some guarantees 
that these funds are going to be used for running the schools in Orange 
County," Patrick Keegan, director of the state's school business services 
division, said of the $47 million due local schools at month's end. "If we 
can't get those guarantees, then we're going to have to rethink and see where 
we can put the money so the school districts can access it." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at school districts throughout the county have said repeatedly 
in the week since the bankruptcy filing that if incoming funds are immediately 
separated from the rest of the county pool, schools will be able to function 
normally for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, several administrators said, will be to gain access to money 
deposited with the county before the bankruptcy filing -- more than $1 billion 
that belongs to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want that money returned home," Laguna Beach Unified Supt. Paul M. 
Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hand-to-mouth existence," added Jerry Buchanan, Huntington Beach City 
School District assistant superintendent for business. "It's no fun not having 
the reserve in the bank to cover you." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other administrators echoed Buchanan's frustration at the dearth of 
information and lack of written guarantees protecting payroll and other 
expenses coming from the county. Several have retained private bankruptcy 
attorneys, although they remain unsure what legal action, if any, they will 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that lines of communication will open up quickly. School districts 
are usually silent players, but we do have political muscle," said Cypress 
Supt. William D. Eller. "There are a lot of parents and grandparents of 
schoolchildren out there who are concerned about what's going to happen to the 
schools."

 FORGET SOMETHING? You think the county has money troubles . . . with a new tax 
season coming up, state officials say about 50,000 here have yet to file a 1993 
state tax form. The state Franchise Tax Board is sending letters reminding all 
of them it's one of those things you have to do. . . . If you're delinquent, 
you've got 30 days to file or explain why not. Otherwise, you pay minimum 
penalties of $114. Says spokesman Jim Shepherd: "Many filed federal returns,

NON-EMERGENCY SPENDING CURTAILED BY ORANGE COUNTY; FINANCES: SUPERVISORS VOTE 
TO SUSPEND FUNDING FOR MOST SERVICES NOT INVOLVING HEALTH, WELFARE OR SAFETY.

 Orange County curtailed all but emergency spending Monday as its investors 
grappled with an expanding financial crisis that forced postponement of a major 
freeway widening, a near-shutdown of the county's largest water district and a 
halt to property tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 One week after the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in history, some 
investors in the county's collapsed securities pool -- which includes cities, 
school districts and other public entities -- said their inability to tap into 
a now-frozen $7.8-billion investment fund was wreaking havoc with their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 4 1/2-hour closed-door session, the County Board of Supervisors voted 
to curtail any spending that was not related to the "health, welfare or safety 
of county residents." 
</P>
<P>
 While emergency services ranging from fire and police protection to health 
care and welfare would be maintained, nearly all other expenditures are being 
canceled or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is obviously unprecedented," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. "This 
reflects the seriousness of the situation but it's not closing up shop, it is 
setting priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Top county officials continued to work with bankers to seek new sources of 
money and hired accounting giant Arthur Andersen & Co. as a special consultant 
to the county treasurer's office. Thomas E. Daxon, the former state auditor of 
Oklahoma, will lead the Arthur Andersen team. Acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe 
will continue in his job and work with the consultants in trying to sort out 
the county's loss of up to $2 billion so far in its investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because of the financial crisis, the county halted hearings on property tax 
appeals because it cannot issue refunds. Officials characterized the action as 
a "timeout" that would stop the clock on the two-year deadline that now applies 
to such appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 * State and local education officials came to a tentative agreement with the 
county to keep all school funds in an account separate from the ailing county 
treasury. But administrators in individual districts said they remained worried 
about making payroll and paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Water District asked a federal judge for permission to 
remove $34 million from the fund. Without the money, officials said, the water 
district would be forced to default on its debt payments and might have to 
cease operations. The Board of Supervisors tentatively agreed to advance $5.8 
million to the district, which manages the county's ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sources at the U.S. attorney's office said they had begun an investigation 
into the Orange County investment fund that would focus on whether former 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron had used the mails or wires to defraud 
investors. "This thing is so big and so shocking that we have to look into it," 
said one investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) announced the formation of a special 
committee that will begin meeting next week to examine the causes of Orange 
County's investment crisis and ways to help. Although Gov. Pete Wilson and 
others have rejected the idea of a bailout, Lockyer continued to hold out hope 
that a loan might be feasible if no other avenue is available to keep essential 
services in the county running. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Democratic leader Willie Brown of San Francisco, still enmeshed in a 
fight for the speakership, said he and other Democrats "would be prepared to 
bring the people back here in a hot minute" to deal with Orange County 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) introduced legislation designed to 
close the investment loopholes. The bill would apply the strict requirements 
currently used by the Local Agency Investment fund run by the California 
treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would limit derivative investments, reverse repurchases and other 
investment tools blamed for the downfall of the Orange County investment fund. 
"There should be no gambling at all with taxpayers' dollars," Pringle said. 
"Unfortunately, the way the system is, that can happen. It's got to change." 
Big Agencies, Big Hits 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, it was some of the county's biggest agencies -- from the one that 
supplies much of its fresh drinking water to the one that builds it roads -- 
that were taking the biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority postponed the Interstate 5 freeway 
widening project through Anaheim. But the agency said most of its other major 
operations, including bus and rail service, will continue without interruption 
because of newly arrived property taxes and an expected advance on federal 
transit funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation authority with $1 billion in deposits, the largest investor 
in the county's beleaguered pool -- unveiled a spending blueprint it says will 
get the agency through the next 100 days of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency chief Stan Oftelie said that construction on five major freeway 
projects will move forward. But others under design -- including the widening 
of the northbound Santa Ana Freeway through Anaheim -- will be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the County Board of Supervisors said it would release $5.8 million 
to the Orange County Water District, according to General Manager William R. 
Mills Jr. However, the money will not be disbursed until after the release is 
reviewed at a meeting today of 11 primary contributors to the troubled bond 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district is "in a rather unique situation . . . (because) the 
district used the county (fund) like a checking account," according to a news 
release it issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency petitioned U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan for "immediate 
access" to more than $34 million of the $118 million it has invested in the 
county pool. The district had just $100,000 in cash on hand to pay operating 
bills Friday, according to court documents. District Finance Director Andrew V. 
Czorny said in the court filings that the severe cash crunch could force 
service cutbacks and push the agency into default. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district, which serves nearly 2 million people, says it needs $5 
million to deal with debts due at the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 District board members have ordered employees to review all "non-critical" 
funding requests to ensure that the agency can meet payroll and other 
day-to-day expenses. "We plan to reduce expenditures until we can determine the 
full implications of the (bankruptcy) filing," Mills said. Blow to Schools 
</P>
<P>
 Schools were expected to feel the biggest hit from the investment debacle, 
because so much of their money is tied up in the Orange County portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they expected to announce an agreement as early as this 
morning in which all incoming funds -- including local property taxes, state 
and federal grants -- would be segregated in a special fund accessible only to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund would be invested conservatively and allow the county's 31 school 
districts to continue meeting payroll and operating expenses for months 
regardless of what happens with the now-frozen county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said he probably would 
support such an agreement, calling it "sensible" to keep the money separate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento Monday, Brown said he would support special bailout loans 
specifically for schools, while acting state Supt. of Public Instruction 
William D. Dawson wrote a letter to Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley demanding that the board approve a plan segregating school 
funds by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Private health and social service providers scrambled Monday to determine 
whether funds crucial to their operation would be frozen as a result of Orange 
County's growing financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion reigned in many nonprofit agencies. Administrators worried not just 
about delays in county funding, but about whether state and federal money 
funneled through the county would be held up as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A county spokesman said officials were still "looking at" which county 
contractors and vendors would receive priority. But the spokesman, Jim Bourne, 
had reassuring news for agencies expecting state and federal money, saying its 
distribution would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday evening, county Budget Director Fred Branca said the process of 
weeding out all nonessential invoices already had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development of a critical list has started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Branca said department heads will get the first crack at deciding whether each 
contract is essential to either health, welfare or public safety, although he 
admitted the criteria to judge this still is being worked out. The bills 
approved by department heads will be sent to the County Administrative Office, 
which will decide which invoices to pay. For example, Branca said, bills for 
medicine for county clinics or jail inmates will be paid, as will bills for 
essential Sheriff's Department services. 
</P>
<P>
 Branca said it was still too early to tell if there will be a ceiling on the 
amount of money to pay these bills or at what point nonessential vendors would 
be paid. Daxon and his financial consulting team will help Branca and other 
county officials decide how to manage the county's money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get to the bottom of this and find out what the problem is," 
Daxon said. "We've got to sit down and start asking questions. It'll be a while 
before we have any answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon said Orange County's crisis is of an unrivaled magnitude, but he said he 
and his firm are "certainly not strangers to adversity." He said the state of 
Oklahoma was on the verge of losing federal funding when he took over as state 
auditor and that he worked on a team that straightened out the troubled 
Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Board of Supervisors will hold its first regular meeting since the 
county declared bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a Laguna Beach woman said she will file 
a lawsuit this morning asking a judge to force the supervisors to stop 
discussing the financial crisis in secret. Wall Street Sales 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, $100 million more of county-owned bonds were sold Monday by 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., which held the bonds as 
collateral for loans to the county fund.  
</P>
<P>
 DLJ Securities' bond sale followed $11.4 billion in collateral bond 
liquidations by other major brokerages last week as the county defaulted on 
loan payments and the brokerages seized the collateral and sold it. The loans 
had been used to balloon the fund's massive -- and, as it turned out, ill 
considered -- bet on falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the bond liquidations, the county has sued one of the 
brokerages -- Nomura Securities -- and has promised to sue the rest demanding 
that the bonds be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's sale of its collateral has reduced the county fund from $18.5 
billion in bonds to perhaps as little as $5 billion, analysts say, not 
including a $2-billion loan still outstanding from Merrill Lynch, the sole 
remaining brokerage extending credit to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Merrill Lynch sent Daniel Napoli, its senior vice president, to 
Orange County to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Monday, county officials continued to seek help from banks they 
hope will extend the county a line of credit that could allow bills to be paid 
while the investment fund remains frozen in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles branch of the Industrial Bank of Japan last week, for example, 
came to the aid of the transportation authority, extending a $78-million loan 
under its line of credit agreement so the agency could repay certain debts to 
bondholders that were due last Wednesday.

RUSSIANS MEET INDIGNATION IN REBEL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian troops moving into the heavily armed secessionist republic of Chechnya 
halted their advance here 20 miles northeast of the Chechen capital Monday and 
met an unexpected form of resistance -- a crowd of men wielding only their 
indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our land. Get out!" shouted a gold-toothed Chechen in a tall fur hat, 
standing eyeball to eyeball with Col. Ivan Gromov, a commander of an armored 
column of the Russian Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you move your crowd back off this bridge," Gromov ordered in a booming 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Move your soldiers back," retorted the man with the gold teeth, as about 150 
Chechens around him stood their ground. "Listen," he added. "Did we ever invade 
Russia with arms? No. We're defending our homeland and we have nowhere to 
retreat." 
</P>
<P>
 The shouting match above a drainage canal bordering this farming village 
reflected the tense, mostly bloodless standoff that has prevailed since Russian 
forces began their tentative and risky occupation of Chechnya on Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin justified the military offensive as a forced measure to defend 
Russia's integrity and create the conditions for a negotiated peace. Chechnya, 
a mountainous republic with a largely Muslim population of just more than 1 
million, declared its independence in 1991 soon after President Dzhokar M. 
Dudayev, a charismatic former bomber pilot, came to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Its continued defiance prompted Boris N. Yeltsin into one of the riskiest 
moves of his presidency, a major military campaign that many warn could pull in 
other small nations of the Caucasus Mountains' ethnic patchwork and bog down 
into another Afghanistan-type war. 
</P>
<P>
 The first clashes that Russian troops faced on their rapid advance toward the 
Chechen capital of Grozny underlined the danger of a broader Caucasus war. In 
neighboring Ingushetia, pro-Chechen villagers attacked a Russian column on its 
way toward Grozny and, according to Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev, burned 
30 vehicles. Another Russian column advancing through nearby Dagestan was 
blocked by residents, and nearly three dozen soldiers were reportedly taken 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chechnya proper, 18 miles northwest of Grozny, Chechen artillery forced a 
Russian tank column to turn back by attacking it with truck-launched Grad 
missiles. The attack brought a fruitless retaliatory raid by Russian jet 
fighters and helicopters. Their bombs ruptured and set fire to a gas refinery 
pipeline, but the fire was quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Usman Saltayev, commander of the Chechen artillery unit, said he saw 
three plumes of smoke rising from the line of about 40 Russian tanks before it 
turned back. Russian media said soldiers had died, but it was not clear how 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moscow-Grozny peace talks got under way in the Caucasus city of 
Vladikavkaz, although reports from the negotiations were contradictory. Some 
said a preliminary agreement could be struck within hours; others said it would 
take weeks at best. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, the political fallout for Yeltsin continued to mount. Public 
displeasure with the military moves sparked several anti-war protest meetings 
and criticism of the Chechen offensive by almost all top politicians. The only 
enthusiastic support came from ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma -- the lower house of Parliament -- resolved to meet today to make 
its own decisions on the Chechnya crisis. Yeltsin, who remained out of sight 
following a minor operation on his nose, appealed to lawmakers not to choose 
this moment to inflame tension with the Kremlin, but to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Orthodox Russians are being dragged into a war with the Muslim world," 
warned Communist leader Gennady A. Zyuganov. "Only early elections in Russia 
can prevent the bloodshed in Chechnya." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Chechnya, the two sides appeared to be trying to avoid a head-on 
confrontation, at least while negotiations continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for Russian pledges to refrain from attacking Grozny while peace 
talks are still under way, the Chechens did not raise an armed challenge to 
Col. Gromov's tank column as it moved about 70 miles from Mozdok in Russia and 
stopped here, northeast of Grozny, on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck-launched missile attack was the only confirmed combat on a cold, 
clear day otherwise dominated by doomsday rhetoric from Dudayev's defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff on the bridge ended with a slight retreat by the unarmed Chechen 
crowd. But the grumbling in both camps continued, bespeaking the intractable 
nature of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever tasted homemade Russian vodka?" asked Gromov, a veteran of 
other ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union. "Well, the situation in 
Chechnya is brewing into a far stronger drink. We are unprepared for what will 
happen here if the cork comes out of the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Along one side of the road, stretched for two miles in a field, were as many 
as 1,000 troops under Gromov's command, many lounging beside tanks and armored 
personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the road, the stone-house village of 13,000 people waited 
nervously for Gromov to get his next orders. Nobody seemed to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers said they spent a fright-filled night Sunday as the tank column 
advanced toward them and then stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Musa Gaichayev led a group of village elders Monday to meet Gromov and 
ask respectfully what his troops were doing there. "My mission is simple," the 
colonel told them. "It is to make people surrender all illegal weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a tall order in Chechnya, where hunting rifles and automatic weapons 
are practically part of the dress code -- especially since the hasty 1991 
pullout of the Soviet army left the region awash in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing bloody resistance if the Russians entered their village, the Chechen 
elders agreed to disarm any provocateurs on their side if the Russians would 
keep on the other side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Gromov agreed but later complained that nobody had surrendered any weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "These village elders are like the queen of England," he said. "They govern, 
but they do not rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers who came out to berate the Russians heatedly denied that they were 
armed -- although one man proudly showed off a hunting rifle. The villagers' 
assertions drew winks and nods from the elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will disarm when the Russians themselves disarm and go home," declared 
Katash Khashumov, 62, a village leader clad in a gray lambskin hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd consisted of elders, middle-aged men and a 12-year-old boy. 
Villagers of fighting age, they said, had withdrawn to Grozny to defend the 
city against what they consider Gromov's real mission -- to overthrow Dudayev. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Grozny city limits, Chechen warriors in camouflage staffed a 
concrete-block checkpoint illuminated by a flaming tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Ilyasov, 34, was commanding the checkpoint with a Kalashnikov rifle and a 
vest loaded with five hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must know better than to move on Grozny," he said. "Every Chechen there 
is an atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Grozny, a city of 400,000 people, was outwardly calm but evidently crippled by 
three years of political and economic conflict with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage and broken glass littered the ice-rutted streets. The entire city, 
including Dudayev's 10-story presidential palace, was without heat because of 
mine attacks three months ago on municipal heating plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chechens said that, whatever they thought of their president before, they 
support him in this battle against Russia. And their confidence was striking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't take Grozny," said Yakub Sultygov, the minister of cattle. "If 
they do, all they will capture is a pile of ashes." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; A DAY OF RECKONING IN ETHIOPIA; THE MEN OF 'THE RED TERROR' WILL GO 
ON TRIAL FOR AN ERA OF MURDER AND TORTURE THAT THEY RECORDED IN CHILLING 
DETAIL. THEY ALSO FACE CHARGES THAT THEY USED FAMINE AS A WEAPON AGAINST THEIR 
OWN PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They killed, tortured, despoiled and terrorized an ancient country -- and 
wrote it all down. In ghastly detail. They affixed their signatures and stamped 
the official seal to their 17 years of tyranny and filed it away. Then they 
lost a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, their deeds are counted on 309,215 pages, which become court evidence as 
the new government of Ethiopia today commences prosecution of 3,400 officials 
of yesterday's Communist regime on charges of "crimes against humanity" and a 
roll call of other malefactions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the American Bar Assn. and governments on three continents, 
Ethiopia believes it is undertaking the largest, most richly documented trial 
of systematic government genocide since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of victims could exceed 100,000. The number of ready witnesses 
could reach 10,000. The charges against the first string of defendants consume 
296 leather-bound pages and require a full day to read aloud. About 1,300 men 
are in custody; 1,100 are on bail. The remainder have fled and are being 
sought. The process could last years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unique among the accusations is that the government of exiled President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam withheld and manipulated food aid in one of Ethiopia's 
periodic droughts, employing the cruelty of famine as a weapon to suppress 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The trials are probably the ending chapter of the last hard-line government to 
rise under sponsorship of the former Soviet Union. All across the exhausted, 
impoverished and struggling nation, Ethiopians are transfixed and wishing for 
catharsis. They hope, too, that in this improbable place, the world will find a 
precedent for trials of human rights atrocities in Rwanda and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this day would come true," said Tsadle Wodajo, 58, a mother 
who lost a 20-year-old son to the former rulers they call the Dergue, or "the 
shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 In her mud-and-straw home in a village in central Ethiopia, she recalled a 
police lieutenant warning her not to cry or mourn her boy's 1978 execution, 
because that itself would be a counterrevolutionary crime and she would be 
imprisoned. So she held a wake quietly in the dark of night and fed the 
leftover ceremonial bread to her dogs to hide the evidence of her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Terefe Atomsa, 73, also lost a son. In his cracked, yellowed block house 
outside Addis Ababa, among flowering jacarandas and fragrant eucalyptus, he 
recalls seeing a pile of corpses left on a bridge for all the living to 
witness. It was the government's way of warning political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Terefe said he was afraid to claim the body of his 19-year-old son, recalling, 
"They would have made me pay for the bullets used to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in the heart of the city, at the prison named Alem Bekayne -- "the 
end of the line" -- the gates were opened last week for two American reporters 
to enter a two-story octagon blockhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, 420 defendants, including top officials of the accused Mengistu 
government, lounge in the warm sun, play Ping-Pong, study auto mechanics and 
wait for their turn in the dock and their chance to answer for an epoch that 
Ethiopians call "The Red Terror." 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms offer courtyard balconies, a shaded square, running water and plenty 
of books, games and clean clothing. Many Ethiopians might find it strange to 
know that the prisoners live better than millions of ordinary citizens in this, 
the second-poorest nation in Africa, a country where 40% of its 55 million 
people have no work and where every street corner teems with beggars. 
</P>
<P>
 The first defendants to go on trial and those facing the most serious genocide 
charges are 66 men -- 45 in custody, the others, including the exiled Mengistu, 
being prosecuted in absentia. All face death by hanging, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in custody is former Prime Minister Fikire Selassie -- seen last 
week sunning himself on a prison balcony, wearing sharply pressed slacks and a 
clean sweater. His face was impassive and his steel-gray hair carefully 
trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself, I hope no good comes to them," says prison administrator Theodore 
Makonen. "They have destroyed a country. They destroyed the lives of millions 
of people. And they do not feel sadness. They feel as if they were right." 
</P>
<P>
 How detailed is the evidence against the accused? "We have minutes of meetings 
in which it is stated, 'We hereby agree that revolutionary measures be taken 
against A, B and C.' In this context you should know, revolutionary measure was 
a synonym for execution," said Abraham Tsegaye, of the Ethiopia Special 
Prosecutor's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "These documents," he added, "specify where the executions should occur, 
whether in a marketplace before the public or in prison or at the victim's 
home. . . . And we have documents in which it is reported back things like, 'I 
hereby confirm that your order for the execution of A, B and C was carried out 
in the presence of comrade so-and-so and comrade so-and-so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also assert that the meticulous bureaucrats of the Mengistu 
government left behind taped recordings of torture sessions. There are known to 
be repositories of skeletons. Reports circulate widely that prosecutors have 
gory photographs and even videotapes of tortures and executions. "This was a 
campaign of annihilation against all political groups and individuals suspected 
of being counterrevolutionaries," Tsegaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 These trials and these prisoners are the legacy of a brutal civil war rooted 
in the Cold War politics of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 After 50 years under Emperor Haile Selassie, a dissipated Ethiopia fell to a 
military coup in 1974. The proud country is one of the oldest independent 
nations in the world, and its new rulers were befriended by the West. For a 
moment, Ethiopia thought it saw a spark of economic revival. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new rulers, searching for a way to control their people, soon moved 
into the Soviet orbit with its ideology of class struggle. They fashioned 
perhaps the most rigidly Marxist society in Africa. According to the special 
prosecutor, the government systematically executed hundreds of students on a 
single day to forestall a street demonstration. And 600,000 Ethiopians were 
forcibly relocated. Billions of dollars in aid were spent enlarging the army 
from 50,000 troops to 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends spied on friends, neighbors feared neighbors. Everyone was apt to be 
an informer. Deeply rooted Coptic Christianity was suppressed. Tens of 
thousands fled the country -- the hope of a whole generation disappeared from 
the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 And the outside world paid hardly any attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But ethnic dissent in several rural regions could not be crushed, despite the 
iron boot of terror, and the situation disintegrated into civil war in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A united opposition army took Addis Ababa and the country in 1991, and 
Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe. A new government, part socialist and part 
free-market, emerged under interim President Meles Zenawi. It sought to piece 
back together a country where regional and ethnic passions had been fanned to a 
fever pitch and where the very institution of government lacked credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 This new administration itself has an imperfect human rights record but has 
won renewed respect and contacts with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 A luxury hotel is under construction in Addis Ababa. It is spring here, and 
the year is 1987 by the Ethiopian calendar. The sky is pure blue, the breezes 
gentle. Just this week, an elected Assembly finished work on a new constitution 
that promises democratic elections within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, where there is heartbreaking poverty and there are an 
estimated 20,000 or more wandering children, beggars ask for the smallest of 
coins but will settle for a smile and the respect shown by a short 
conversation. The better restaurants serve lobster and Italian wine. A 
restaurant called Burger Queen has a fresh coat of white paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The genocide trials, says Addis Ababa Police Commissioner Hassen Shiffa, "are 
the first happiness the people have had. . . . Maybe they can re-create some 
confidence in government. The lesson is this: Rulers may be arrogant and kill, 
but one day they will have to come to court and answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The epic storehouse of evidence and the legal case were compiled with help 
from several nations. Argentina provided forensics investigators at mass grave 
sites. The Americans and Swedes provided computer equipment and assistance for 
cross-referencing of documents. The British and Dutch provided money. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tribunal is wholly Ethiopian. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer than 1,000 lawyers in Addis Ababa, a city of uncounted 
millions of people; defense attorneys say they are swamped. Abebe Worke thumbed 
through the book of charges and began reading random pages: "Genocide, 
homicide, homicide, first-degree homicide, homicide . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the eve of trial, Abebe said he was unsure how many men the government 
would ask him to represent. It is unpopular work. His friends argue that the 
Dergue was so awful it deserves no defense, and he noted, "You can imagine what 
the aggrieved people feel here." 
</P>
<P>
 In some quarters of Addis Ababa, the trials are quietly criticized as just 
another coldblooded attempt by one clique of African rulers to eliminate its 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, among the charges against the Mengistu Dergue is that it executed its 
predecessor government, including the top 60 officers of Emperor Haile 
Selassie's administration. And while most accounts say the emperor himself died 
of old age while under house arrest, today's defendants now are accused of his 
killing too.

 In a comfortable downtown Addis Ababa home, behind gates and a rutted road, 
Elizabet Mengesha sits in the dim light cast by bare bulbs and weeps for her 
husband, Debeta Dinsa, one of several men to serve as vice president under the 
former regime. Twice each day, she takes him food at the prison courtyard. She 
protests his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a young woman then, but I did hear that people were dying in the 
streets. Yet I know my husband was a loving and caring human being," she said. 
"I've been waiting so long for these trials. . . . If the government can 
convince the people that these men are criminals, then they have to go to jail. 
But true justice is the judgment of the people."

 Ethiopians now are taking to the streets to condemn the Dergue. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 victims marched here last weekend, hundreds carrying yellowing 
photographs of lost children, husbands, wives, fathers and mothers. It was as 
if the living and dead were marching together. Others in the crowd bore the 
scars of bullets, ropes, whips and scalding irons -- and deeper wounds still to 
their dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Melaku Tefera, 33, hobbled along using a crutch. His leg and sex organs were 
mutilated in prison. His father was executed. "These cruel people, these 
Dergue," he said, "they shouldn't be killed. They should be put in a museum 
behind bars. People from all over the world should have to come see them and 
know what they did."

CHIEF, REPORT ON FIRE VIDEO CONTRADICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Los Angeles City Fire Chief Donald O. Manning's recent public 
statements that a video of female recruits making mistakes was an innocent 
compilation of bloopers, his own internal investigation concluded last month 
that the tape's purpose ultimately became protecting the department from sexual 
harassment complaints and lawsuits by trainees who allegedly were performing 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews and testimony before the Fire Commission, Manning also insisted 
that Capt. Steve Owens was solely responsible for producing and editing the 
tape. But, according to the internal investigation report obtained by The 
Times, Owens was ordered to make the video by his boss, Capt. Donald M. Carter, 
who supervised the training academy when the footage was shot last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capt. Carter stated he wanted the footage of the identified recruits 
performing poorly in order to protect the training staff, and ultimately the 
department, from the threat of future litigation," said the seven-page 
investigative report, completed Nov. 23. "He directed Capt. Owens to extract 
excerpts of videotape of recruits identified as borderline performers or facing 
potential termination." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation further revealed that copies of the video, which was 
originally intended to be humorous, were distributed by Carter to his training 
staff, who were instructed to save them at home for documentation against 
potential lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials suggested that Manning may not have been aware of all the 
events surrounding the tape's production when he made earlier statements 
describing the investigation's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials who had read the report said Monday that the contradictions 
between Manning's public statements and the probe's findings raise serious 
questions about whether the chief has been candid in his explanations of the 
affair, which has generated nationwide publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This speaks to the very credibility of the department leadership," said 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has introduced a motion for an independent 
city inquiry to determine how many firefighters were involved in producing the 
tape, how widely it was distributed and whether disciplinary action is 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Fire Commission said they, too, were disturbed by 
discrepancies between Manning's testimony before their panel and the findings 
of the investigation conducted by the department's administrative justice unit, 
headed by Battalion Chief Timothy V. Manning, the chief's son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly does raise concerns," said Fire Commission President Elizabeth 
Lowe, "and I'm going to ask about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Leslie Song Winner described herself as "mystified." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why the department only presented half the story to the 
commission," she said. "It makes me wonder whether this investigation is the 
complete story." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Larry Gonzalez said the probe's findings even raise legal 
questions because the primary reason for the videotape's creation was 
apparently to target trainees' poor performances. "I'm appalled as to how the 
department has handled this situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The events leading up to the tape are scheduled to be discussed again at 
today's Fire Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, a department spokesman, said 
Manning may not have read the investigation report when he spoke to the 
commission about the probe last week and in subsequent interviews with 
reporters, including on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best of my recollection in talking to the chief is that he did not read 
the report," Cathey said, adding that Manning "may have only been briefed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathey also said he does not believe that the statements made by the chief and 
Owens are inconsistent with the investigation's findings that the original 
intent of the tape was to be a humorous compilation of bloopers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Owen's testimony that he was solely responsible for the tape, Cathey 
said the captain was nervous at the time and was not given the opportunity to 
tell his entire version because he was constantly interrupted by fire 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens and Carter were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure of the video has heightened mounting concerns over whether the 
Fire Department -- long recognized as one of the nation's finest -- has 
discriminated against minorities and women. Last month, the city's Personnel 
Department released a blistering audit stating that white males dominate the 
department's top posts and that women and minorities have been harassed and 
given unfair evaluations by supervisors, all in an effort to run them off the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of the video was noted in the audit, which was released in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the controversy over the tape first erupted, Manning has worked hard to 
defuse the situation in discussions with reporters and his bosses on the 
mayorally appointed Fire Commission, characterizing the video as harmless and 
made with no ulterior motive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dec. 6 Fire Commission hearing, Manning said his view was shaped by the 
investigation he had ordered. He testified that the probe uncovered no 
wrongdoing and that only one captain was involved in the project -- Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens told the commissioners that he used his own camera and tapes to make a 
"bloopers-type" production and that he decided to abandon it when he realized 
that the footage could be misinterpreted as demeaning toward recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision myself to make all of these tapes," he insisted after the 
commission had viewed a 20-minute segment of the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen's admission that day surprised many of those who know him, including 
current members of the department and recruits who did not pass their academy 
training. "He doesn't have a mean bone in his body," said Kay Harter, who is 
featured in the video and quit the academy two weeks before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the ranks there is so much cynicism about the lack of advancement for 
minorities and women that some African American firefighters have privately 
been suggesting that Owens was singled out for blame because he is black -- an 
allegation department officials vehemently deny. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Manning's and Owens' testimony, the Fire Department emphasized 
again in a news release that "the videographer of that tape did not intend for 
it to depict any recruit unfavorably and he had unilaterally discontinued his 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Manning insisted in remarks to reporters after a City Council 
committee hearing that the investigation concluded that Owens acted on his own. 
"Certainly," the chief said, "there was no direction for (Owens) to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But that account does not square with the findings of the two captains who 
conducted the probe; they determined that Owens was following orders from his 
supervisor, who wanted videotaped documentation of several recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capt. Carter stated he takes full responsibility for the tape being made," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter told investigators that he initially ordered Owens to make a "bloopers" 
tape featuring "humorous" incidents that occurred during training drills in the 
academy from April to June, 1993. He said he came up with the idea after 
receiving positive feedback from recruits, their families and friends who 
viewed a graduation video of highlights from the previous Fire Academy class. 
</P>
<P>
 That footage "reflected the flavor of the training academy from start to 
finish," the report said of the video, which Carter also ordered made. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Carter said, he changed his mind about the bloopers tape after he heard 
from his staff and other trainees that several recruits had threatened sexual 
harassment complaints and lawsuits if they did not get hired, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then ordered Owens to single out the recruits -- who also allegedly 
happened to be having the most difficulty in training -- and document their 
mistakes on video. The report did not state at what point Carter issued his 
instructions to Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capt. Carter reiterated that he felt the 'Follies' video would in fact be 
protecting himself and his staff from any future lawsuit," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using department-supplied tapes and editing equipment, Owens began to compile 
the footage, which featured such scenes as female recruits dropping ladders on 
themselves, falling off a seven-foot-high wall as they tried to scale it and 
hunched over in apparent exhaustion as they flailed with axes on wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone were to watch this video, it would be obvious that only a strength 
problem existed with these recruits and not a problem of a racial or gender 
nature," the report quoted Carter as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other training instructors involved in shooting the footage, the 
report said, but they were not identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
 When Owens completed shooting and editing the tape, he made five copies, one 
for each of the training instructors, the report said. Carter then distributed 
the tapes to his officers and told them to take them home and save them for 
documentation purposes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the department investigation was completed, the videotapes were 
confiscated. Owens was also counseled, the report said, for calling the tape 
"Drill Tower 89 Follies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the findings of the investigation," the report concluded, "the 
preponderance of evidence does not support any violation of the department 
rules and regulations." Under Fire (Southland Edition, A28)

FAA IS SEEKING SAFETY CZAR TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTS; AVIATION: AGENCY'S 
SLOWNESS TO ACT UNDERSCORES NEED FOR REFORM. ONE STEP IS APPOINTMENT OF 
IN-HOUSE MONITOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, the government's air safety experts first noted that many 
passengers involved in small airplane crashes lived through the impact but died 
in subsequent fire and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 To give passengers more time to escape and survive such crashes, the National 
Transportation Safety Board on Sept. 9, 1980, recommended that the Federal 
Aviation Administration require crash-resistant fuel lines and fuel tanks on 
commuter planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing the recommendation had merit, the FAA launched a study. Then it 
launched another study. And another. But no definitive action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 When the NTSB convenes today in Washington to discuss last April's crash of a 
commuter airplane in Connecticut, it will take up the issue of crash-resistant 
fuel systems in small aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the oldest recommendations on the books," said Barry M. 
Sweedler, the NTSB's director of safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in 1980, we asked for some simple, logical things -- to us -- that the 
FAA could do" to make these kinds of crashes survivable, Sweedler said. "And 
here the issue has emerged again." 
</P>
<P>
 Last April 27, a twin-engine plane overshot an airport runway and crashed 
through a fence in Stratford, Conn. All nine people aboard the Piper Navaho 
survived the impact. But eight of them perished when the plane exploded seconds 
later. The ninth person, Paul Hagopian, suffered burns to half his body. The 
pilot's last words to the passengers, according to Hagopian: "Don't worry. It's 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
 To aviation safety experts, the FAA's handling of the fuel system issue 
underscores the need to restructure the nation's airline regulatory agency and 
establish the equivalent of an in-house safety czar, an observation first made 
six years ago by a special presidential commission on air safety. 
</P>
<P>
 While FAA Administrator David Hinson says safety is everybody's main concern 
at the agency, he too acknowledges that the FAA needs a high-ranking official 
whose sole responsibility is to monitor safety issues and shepherd them through 
the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Hinson said the FAA plans to compile a 
computer database from airlines, manufacturers and other sectors of the air 
travel industry to set up an early warning system that will help identify 
potential hazards before they become accidents. Critics have long held that the 
FAA does not lend enough credence to anecdotal accounts of potential problems, 
service difficulty reports and near-crashes, which air safety experts believe 
can portend future accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you keep score by accidents only, a bald tire is safe until the blowout," 
said former NTSB official Ira J. Furman. "The tire is 'safe' no matter how thin 
the rubber." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said he has launched a search for an individual to take over a newly 
created systems safety office within the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a very careful search for the right person for that job," said 
Hinson, adding that the person who fills the safety job will report directly to 
him. "It's supposed to help me see problems before they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the new systems safety office comes four months after a joint 
investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the FAA concluded 
that the agency did not have the proper procedures in place to ensure that 
safety concerns are acted upon in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and Hinson had ordered the internal 
review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the 
FAA knew about the potential danger of Boeing 757 wake turbulence long before 
two crashes that claimed 13 lives, including a 1993 accident in Santa Ana that 
killed the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the President asked me to take this job dealt directly 
with flight safety," said Hinson, whose appointment to the top post in the FAA 
was confirmed in August, 1993. "Our objective is to get zero defects." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson acknowledges he faces a "formidable" task. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-month Times review of government documents showed that in some cases 
years have passed and hundreds of lives have been lost before the FAA acted on 
safety problems, such as the 757 turbulence issue, even though the agency had 
long been aware of the hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things I'm trying to address," Hinson said. "I'm sure there 
are some examples where the FAA was slow to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the new safety chief is in place, "Hopefully, (with) things like the 757 
wake turbulence, somebody can say, 'Here's a trend . . . maybe we ought to get 
into this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of an FAA safety chief was proposed in 1988 by a seven-member 
Aviation Safety Commission. The commission, which was established by Congress 
and appointed by President Ronald Reagan, recommended that the FAA be made an 
independent agency with a "safety czar" to oversee regulation of the airline 
industry. The commission said the restructuring was necessary "to act on the 
backlog of potentially worthwhile safety improvements that have been 
languishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last six years, the Government Accounting Office, the Department of 
Transportation's inspector general and the Office of Technology Assessment have 
reached similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congressional officials have suggested that the nation's skies would be 
safer and more efficient if the day-to-day air traffic control operations were 
taken away from the FAA so it can focus on airline surveillance and safety 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been numerous suggestions on how to restructure the FAA's 
responsibilities, including one from the Clinton Administration that would 
privatize the air-traffic system. Under the proposal, a corporation, known as 
the Air Traffic Control Corp., would oversee air traffic, while the FAA would 
be free to deal with safety and airline regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a significant difference, observers agree, Hinson's new safety chief 
must be shielded from operational worries, such as airport capacity. Critics 
believe there are times when safety has taken a back seat to such issues. 
</P>
<P>
 When the FAA considered whether to require more landing distance between 
Boeing 757 jetliners and planes following behind them, the agency calculated 
how many flight reductions could result from any measures it might take. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of such calculations lies the FAA's sometimes conflicting 
mandates: to ensure the welfare of the flying public but also to nurture the 
economic welfare of the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should define promoting aviation as fostering safety," said Hugh E. 
Waterman, who worked for the FAA for 27 years before retiring in 1986. "That's 
the best -- and only -- way the FAA should be promoting aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 In striking the balance between economics and safety, the "fulcrum is placed 
too close to the economic side of the equation," said former NTSB Chairman 
James E. Burnett Jr. A safety chief accountable to the FAA administrator would 
provide "checks and balances within the FAA," Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of a vigilant FAA is as important to the industry as the image of 
the Boeing Co.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of air safety experts interviewed by The Times, including past and 
present FAA officials, agreed that having someone within the FAA with the 
authority to ferret out potential safety problems and the power to act on them 
could be the one change that would significantly reduce the delays in acting 
upon safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need dedicated, continuous follow-up on issues," the NTSB's Sweedler 
said. "I've been in this business 25 years, and I cannot recall any accident 
that has not happened before if you look back far enough and dig deep enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential safety reforms that emerged during The Times review: 
</P>
<P>
 * Amend a law that requires the FAA to perform lengthy, cost-benefit analysis 
when it wants to make changes in regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 "The safety professionals in the FAA really are committed, dedicated people," 
said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), outgoing chairman of the House Committee 
on Public Works and Transportation's subcommittee on aviation. "But they're in 
the trenches, dodging regulatory bullets, trying to cover their tracks, and 
document and substantiate everything they propose. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's safety, but then it's 'What about the cost? What about the industry?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * Simplify the regulation process.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the FAA decides to seek a regulation change on a safety issue and 
completes a cost-benefit analysis showing how many people can be saved and at 
what cost to industry, the proposal must pass through a legislative labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed change first goes to the secretary of Transportation, then to the 
Office of Management and Budget, then back to the Transportation secretary and 
finally back to the FAA. At any point along the way, it can be "massaged," 
forcing the process to virtually begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safety should not be conducted this way," said Oberstar, who has been holding 
oversight hearings on the FAA for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Catalogue, monitor and scrutinize service difficulty reports, non-fatal 
incidents, anecdotal accounts of problems from pilots and air traffic 
controllers, and near-crashes to identify trends and potential safety hazards. 
And rely less on thinking that there needs to be an accident to show there's a 
problem.  
</P>
<P>
 An April, 1994, report by DOT's inspector general concluded that FAA had "no 
formal system . . . to ensure aircraft problems do not fall into a 'black 
hole.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Following the March, 1992, crash of a jetliner at La Guardia Airport in New 
York -- one in a series of fatal crashes that prompted changes in the way the 
wings of commercial jets are de-iced before takeoff -- the FAA said there 
wasn't an urgent need to enact such measures for air taxis and commuter planes 
because those kinds of aircraft had not experienced near as many similar 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the FAA's stance, the Air Line Pilots Assn. said in a letter, 
"This is a dangerous philosophy and suggests that the FAA measures the need for 
safety improvements against the number of accidents and fatalities before they 
can justify improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 * Be less rigid about past positions on safety issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Aviation experts both within and outside the FAA say the agency hierarchy 
sometimes clings too strongly to positions it has staked out -- even in the 
face of compelling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they adopt an improper policy, they're very reluctant to change their 
stand" because they fear the public will perceive a mistake was made 
originally, said one FAA manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ensure more stable leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been six FAA administrators in the past 13 years. It's an appointed 
position, and some experts and legislators have suggested that it be 
transformed into a five- or seven-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 What both the FAA and its critics agree upon is that the agency cannot stand 
still on safety. Even if the accident rate was to remain constant, the sheer 
number of commercial airline flights is increasing so rapidly that there will 
be more crashes more frequently in the not-too-distant future, industry experts 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a scenario frightening to all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that the government does anything it can to prevent these 
kinds of things," said Michele Mikuta of Cos Cob, Conn. Her husband, Thomas, 
was killed in the March, 1992, crash at La Guardia. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, which killed 27 people, the FAA acted to prevent such 
crashes. But records show it had been known for years that the type of plane 
involved in the accident was particularly susceptible to having ice accumulate 
on its wings, robbing the plane of crucial lift on takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mikuta, who is raising her and her husband's two young children alone: "I 
never want this kind of thing to happen to anyone else."

</P>
<P>
 To complete this report, The Times reviewed about 20,000 pages of internal 
documents obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration through the Freedom 
of Information Act. The newspaper also reviewed a computer analysis of the 
causes of airplane crashes between 1983 and last July by the National 
Transportation Safety Board. The Times also studied dozens of reports by 
government oversight agencies and interviewed scores of present and past FAA 
officials, airline industry sources, aviation safety experts, members of 
Congress, crash survivors and the families of crash victims.

<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Safety Board's Priorities 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board released a "Most 
Wanted" list of air safety recommendations. Here are the four items discussed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop ways to avoid runway collisions, including use of new runway lights 
and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require more structural fatigue tests for new aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make technical changes to brake-wear tests for aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add collision-avoidance system known as Mode C Intruder Alert to radar used 
by many airports.

 A week after staggering investment losses compelled Orange County to file for 
bankruptcy, a new Times Orange County poll shows that most residents are 
frightened about the potential impact of the crisis and angrily blame 
government officials as well as Wall Street firms for the financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of county residents say they are worried about the 
disastrous turn of events, with three in 10 describing themselves as "very 
worried" about the consequences for schools, government, the economy and the 
county's image. An even greater proportion are angry about the actions of 
county officials that preceded the debacle, with 40% saying they are "very 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that the public already is parceling out blame for the crisis. 
Across all demographic and political groups, residents point the finger at 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, the County Board of 
Supervisors, Wall Street companies that brokered the county's investments and 
local governmental agencies that invested in Citron's failed bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents also do not have much faith that government will solve the 
problem. Only one in 10 say they have a "great deal" of confidence in the Board 
of Supervisors. Four in 10 have some trust, whereas about half have very little 
or no confidence in the county's elected leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Most upset and worried are people with children in public schools that might 
be hurt financially by the crisis. The poll found that people with school-age 
children are more likely to give county officials poor grades for their 
performance during the financial crisis. They also are more likely to have 
little or no faith in the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I can't say I am very optimistic, because this whole mess has been 
brought on by all these people in the first place. They are the ones 
responsible," said respondent Karen Lee Williams, 33, an aerospace worker from 
Huntington Beach. "I will remember this on Election Day. Both my husband and I 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates, is 
the first assessment of how local residents view the largest municipal 
bankruptcy filing in U.S. history and its consequences. The random telephone 
survey -- conducted Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- questioned 600 Orange County 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fearful of the implications the financial collapse will have on 
their lives, and they are angry at local officials. They are not just focusing 
their anger at Bob Citron," said pollster Baldassare. "They feel many public 
officials and private entities are responsible for this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, 68% are worried about the situation, and 75% are angry 
at local county officials who apparently did not heed official warnings about 
Citron's management of the county's gigantic bond portfolio, which has suffered 
an estimated $2-billion loss. (About a year before the collapse, county 
Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis issued an audit criticizing the treasurer 
for making risky investments and violating government codes governing the 
fund.) 
</P>
<P>
 When asked who is most responsible, 21% specifically named Citron and 16% 
named the Board of Supervisors. About 4% pointed to the companies that sold the 
investments, 2% cited County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, and 1% 
accused the cities and local agencies that invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 42% -- the largest group -- blame "all of the above" individuals and 
institutions for the crisis, which has shaken the municipal bond market and 
prompted calls from Sacramento to Washington for tighter oversight of municipal 
investing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't imagine with all these people involved, they let it go on for 
this long," said poll respondent Robert Peters, 67, of Orange, a retired 
marketing representative. "Surely other people in the treasurer's department 
and county should have known about it and could have done something. I don't 
blame it on just one guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents with children in the local public schools are the most disturbed. 
Seventy-one percent are worried, with 35% "very worried" about the impact the 
financial crisis will have on education. Eighty percent expressed anger at the 
actions of local officials that led to the crisis, with 43% saying they are 
"very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, school districts across the county had no choice but to 
invest their funds -- hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- in Citron's 
bond portfolio, which has plunged $1.5 billion to $2 billion in value as 
interest rates have climbed. Four county districts went further, borrowing tens 
of millions of dollars to invest in the fund in hopes of boosting their 
interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to smack Citron in the face. There are going to be a lot of people 
suffering because of this," said Lisalyn Jones, 32, of Stanton, who has two 
daughters in public school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, seven in 10 respondents expect county services and 
programs to be reduced in the wake of the financial debacle, with 30% saying 
they will be cut back "a lot." Six in 10 anticipate that their city services 
will be reduced at least somewhat, with 17% fearing a greater cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar six in 10 expect that programs in their local school districts will 
have to be reduced at least somewhat, with 22% predicting services will be 
trimmed "a lot." State and local education officials came to a tentative 
agreement with the county Monday to keep school funds in an account separate 
from the county treasury. But administrators in individual districts said they 
remain worried about making payroll and paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents expect to be personally affected by the county's fiscal 
collapse. Four in 10 are worried that they will be hurt financially as a result 
of the crisis, with 16% describing themselves as "very worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Green, 37, a Laguna Hills interior designer, suspects the financial 
crisis will have far-ranging impact that might hurt her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely very, very disappointed," she said. "I have two clients that 
work for Caltrans. If they can't work on the freeway and they can't keep 
ordering, that may have an effect. . . . The arrogance of somebody to play like 
that with other people's money. It's amazing to think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said the findings show that worries about losses go far beyond 
employees of governmental agencies and are especially prevalent among those who 
are less well-off. Fifty percent of those with incomes below $50,000 describe 
themselves as worried, with 24% being "very worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, one in six residents say they or a member of their family receive 
a salary, contract or some form of payment from a local government entity that 
is caught up in the crisis. There are no differences by income or other 
demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the personal impact, most residents are expecting a blow to the 
county's economy and image as a result of the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% expect negative impacts on the county's job opportunities and 
economy, with 32% anticipating a very negative effect. A total of 75% expect 
the county's image and prestige to be hurt, with 38% anticipating a very 
negative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am worried about the county and my position in the county," said Patty 
Bernard, 50, of Fullerton, a stockbroker. "I'm more worried than anything about 
what's going to become of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one in five residents rate the county supervisors as having done an 
"excellent" or "good" job in handling the county's financial crisis so far, and 
one in three rate their work as "fair" and another one in three grade them 
"poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats take a similarly dim view of the capability of the 
county's elected leaders. About half in both groups say they have little or no 
confidence in the supervisors' ability to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of local residents would ask the state for money to help the county out 
of its financial troubles, with 25% strongly favoring such a bailout. Democrats 
and Republicans are equally in favor of asking for state help. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen percent support raising local taxes to help make up for funds lost 
in the investment dive, and two in three are "strongly opposed" to any new 
assessments or fees. 
</P>
<P>
 On a brighter note, most residents do not see the effects of the investment 
fund crisis lasting far into the future. And few at this point are ready to 
leave the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Four in 10 think that five years from now, the county will be much the same as 
it was before the bankruptcy, and three in 10 believe things will be better; 
only 24% say it will be a worse place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger people, however, are considerably more negative -- three in 10 of 
those under 35 think the county will be a worse place, compared to 18% of 
people 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 One in six residents say the crisis has made them consider moving out of the 
county; 7% say they are seriously thinking about it. Among people with children 
in school, nearly a quarter have thought about moving, with 10% considering it 
seriously. Only 14% of households without children in school are thinking about 
moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it'll take several years to get over this. It's something we 
can pull ourselves out of," said stockbroker Bernard. "We're a pretty wealthy 
county -- or at least we were. But we'll be back."

 The Times' Orange County poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 adult Orange County residents was done Dec. 9-11 on 
weekday nights and weekend days, using a computer-generated random sample of 
telephone numbers. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 4% 
at the 95% confidence level. That means it is 95% certain that the results are 
within 4 percentage points of what they would be if every adult resident in the 
county were interviewed. For subgroups, the margin of error would be higher. 
All respondents were guaranteed anonymity; however, some of those polled agreed 
to be re-interviewed for this story.

FLEISS TRIAL JURORS SAY THEY IMPROPERLY DISCUSSED CASE; COURTS: FIVE PANELISTS 
ADMIT TALKING OUTSIDE JURY ROOM. DEFENSE EXPECTED TO ASK THAT PANDERING 
VERDICTS BE VOIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five jurors in the Heidi Fleiss trial have signed sworn statements saying they 
improperly discussed the case outside court before reaching verdicts -- an 
admission that could result in a new trial for the convicted Hollywood Madam. 
</P>
<P>
 In their statements, two men and three women -- including the jury forewoman 
-- said they talked about possible sentences in the parking lot, hallways and 
the cafeteria at the Downtown Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building, sources 
close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Anthony Brooklier, who solicited the affidavits from the 
jurors after the trial, is expected to file a motion today asking Superior 
Court Judge Judith L. Champagne to overturn the verdicts and grant Fleiss a new 
trial on three counts of pandering. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Fleiss ran a ring of high-priced call girls, catering to the 
whims of an elite Los Angeles clientele. At the conclusion of her trial, the 
seven-man, five-woman panel convicted Fleiss on three of five counts of 
pandering. They acquitted the 28-year-old high school dropout of a 
cocaine-related charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors said after the trial that by voting for a pandering conviction 
they hoped to spare Fleiss the penalties of the drug-related charge, which they 
believed would be more severe. The jurors said they were unaware that a 
pandering conviction carried a mandatory prison sentence. Some discussion of 
this subject, they said, occurred outside the jury room. More than one juror 
also wrote that she did not completely understand the jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, jurors are allowed to discuss a case only in the jury room 
during deliberations. And, in deciding a case, the panelists are not supposed 
to consider the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said Monday that if the verdict is overturned, his 
office will prosecute Fleiss again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury forewoman Sheila Mitrowski said she realized she had made a mistake in 
the trial after she appeared last week on the "Geraldo" show. During the show, 
a legal expert explained entrapment, or the concept of police inducing a 
criminal act. Although this was discussed during the trial, Mitrowski said she 
had misunderstood the law. "After I flew back home, I was sitting there 
watching (the "Geraldo" show on) TV. I thought, 'Holy cow! I did that wrong,' " 
Mitrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The television show forced Mitrowski to reconsider her view and ask herself 
whether any law-abiding citizen would act similarly to Fleiss, who stood to 
earn 40% of the $1,500 paid by undercover police to each of the four women in 
her ring. Her conclusion was that an ordinary person would act the same way. 
"To me, there really and truly is that possibility -- a lot of people will do a 
lot of things for that kind of money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this new understanding, Mitrowski said she gave an affidavit to 
Brooklier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very badly," said the 48-year-old phone company clerical worker from 
Bell Gardens. "I feel I made a mistake when I found her guilty of those three 
counts (of pandering)." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to legal experts, jurors can change their minds without an 
indication of misconduct. More important to Brooklier's bid for a mistrial will 
be Mitrowski's admission that she talked with panelists about the case outside 
the deliberation room. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrowski said she did not believe any of her discussions outside the jury 
room had an adverse effect. "Yes, I did have some brief conversations outside 
the deliberation room, but they certainly did not sway the way I voted." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Joseph Lechuga also acknowledged that some panelists had talked among 
themselves outside the courtroom, but added that he thought Fleiss got a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my actions, I don't know if there should be another trial," he 
said. "Another jury might give her worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Fleiss' conviction earlier this month, Brooklier has maintained that 
jurors engaged in "horse trading" and improper conduct that deprived his client 
of a fair trial. Brooklier met with the jurors Saturday, postponing the meeting 
from earlier in the week because Mitrowski and another juror went to New York 
to appear on the "Geraldo" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier declined to comment on the latest twist in the Fleiss case, which 
became the subject of international media coverage last summer and created wild 
speculation locally about the identities of Fleiss' clientele. According to 
Fleiss and her employees, their patrons included several well-known Hollywood 
producers, rock stars, foreign diplomats and international businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss -- who faces a mandatory prison sentence of three years to eight years, 
eight months -- said she had pinned all her hopes on Brooklier's effort to win 
a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My future was so bleak -- so, so bleak and now maybe there's another way," 
Fleiss said. "God, am I happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss also said she appreciated what she called the bravery of the five 
jurors who gave their sworn statements to Brooklier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of courage for anybody to come forward and admit they did 
something wrong," she said. "It's a very hard thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts not involved in the case were divided on the impact of the 
jurors' statements and whether Champagne would grant a mistrial. If the judge 
concludes that there was misconduct among jurors, that finding does not 
automatically mean she will grant a new trial, said Peter Arenella, a professor 
at UCLA Law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, it is very difficult to impeach a jury's verdict by raising 
allegations of misconduct," said Arenella, who added that these jurors faced no 
criminal charges for their recent revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne will have to determine if the jurors' actions adversely affected 
Fleiss and her ability to obtain a fair trial, Arenella said. "For example, if 
the improper discussion of sentencing consequences led the jury to acquit the 
defendant on a particular count out of fear that the sentencing consequences 
would be too harsh, that hardly constitutes prejudice to the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts said they thought Brooklier might win a new trial for his 
high-profile client. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors "are only supposed to deliberate when all 12 are present -- that 
certainly was misconduct," said Harland W. Braun, a prominent Los Angeles 
criminal defense lawyer. "That they discussed penalty at all is improper. It 
sounds to me like they have a good chance of getting this verdict set aside." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier's strategy was bolstered by the fact that five panelists -- not just 
one -- wrote affidavits, said Charles Weisselberg, a law professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strengthens the credibility of the jurors and makes it difficult for the 
court to say this didn't happen," Weisselberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other experts said it was unclear whether there was sufficient evidence 
to grant a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong for the jurors to talk about the case outside the juror room, but 
it's almost inevitable that this happens," said Victor Gold, a professor at 
Loyola Law School. "But it's probably not something that would affect the 
verdict."

SIMPSON TEAM MAY CHANGE ITS STRATEGY ON DNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throwing a fresh complication into the O.J. Simpson trial, defense sources 
said Monday that they are rethinking how they will react to DNA evidence in the 
case and may back off their publicly stated plans for a full-scale, pretrial 
assault on the scientific procedures used to test blood and hair samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources stressed, however, that the defense will not waive its right to 
contest the DNA evidence. Instead, sources said the defense has drafted a new 
set of plans for when and how the lawyers will make their objections. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest approach, they emphasized, is more likely to affect the timing and 
scope of the DNA challenge than the substance of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, declined to comment 
publicly on the changing defense approach, but sources close to the case said 
one likely scenario would be to object to the admission of some DNA evidence at 
trial, rather than to demand the extensive hearing on the issue before jurors 
begin to hear evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how prosecutors and Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito react to a 
menu of defense options that will be filed today, one possible result is that 
opening statements in the trial -- in which Simpson is vigorously contesting 
charges that he murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman -- could 
now begin in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible," Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said of the 
earlier-than-anticipated date for opening statements. "They (the defense 
lawyers) have indicated that they will make a number of proposals, several 
alternatives they may propose regarding DNA." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, remarks by Ito also appeared to suggest that the trial could get 
under way in January. Speaking to the panel of 24 jurors and alternate jurors 
who will hear the case, Ito delivered a new admonition on avoiding news media, 
and ordered them to return on Jan. 4, when the case could begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have a very happy holiday," Ito said. "There's a strong possibility we'll 
have to sequester you. I still have not decided if and when." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not more specific Monday, Ito added: "Take care of any 
pressing business. Make any arrangements you have to make. . . . Just like the 
Boy Scouts, I'd like you to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense's final plans on approaching the DNA issue remained in flux late 
Monday as Simpson's battery of attorneys continued to debate the best course. 
As he left court, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of the lead lawyers in the case, 
confirmed that the defense wanted to present Ito with a number of options for 
handling the issue of DNA evidence but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's DNA evidence consists of results from four different types 
of DNA testing, and defense attorneys may propose different approaches for the 
various tests. One test known as RFLP, for instance, is considered highly 
reliable and has been admitted in trials throughout the state. Others are newer 
and may be subject to more exacting defense scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, defense sources said the Simpson team may concede that the 
science underlying some of the tests is reliable while reserving the right to 
challenge other tests. In addition, defense sources say the team will not waive 
the right to object to the reliability of any of the tests based on their 
handling by investigators and lab technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors greeted news of the defense's shifting approach warily, warning 
that they would not accept any proposal that would break up the trial or limit 
the prosecution's ability to put on its best case. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to waive the (DNA hearing), they have to concede the admissibility 
of the DNA evidence," Clark said. "Also, that would require them to accept the 
statistical significance of the matches that were found." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA analysis can yield powerful statistical evidence about the source of blood 
samples such as those at issue in the Simpson investigation. In some cases, DNA 
results can narrow the source of a particular sample to fewer than one person 
in millions, and if the defense were to accept those statistics, it would be 
giving in to potentially powerful evidence linking Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, the defense reserved its right to object to the DNA 
evidence at trial, forgoing the hearing in January would not concede that the 
evidence could be used against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure the waiver they give us is a true waiver," Clark said -- 
not merely an attempt to delay the matter until the middle of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts expressed doubt about whether Ito would agree to put off a DNA hearing 
until after jurors had begun to hear evidence in the case, though they agreed 
that such an approach would probably be desirable for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, experts said, it would allow Simpson's lawyers to debut their 
attack on the handling of blood and hair samples before a jury and not show its 
cards to prosecutors in advance of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would play to the strength of a key defense witness, Dr. Edward Blake, 
a renowned DNA expert who has criticized the way samples were handled but would 
not be in a position to testify that the scientific techniques are suspect 
because he is the foremost advocate of some of those techniques and regularly 
testifies for prosecutors in DNA cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, putting off or curtailing the hearing on DNA evidence would allow the 
case to move more quickly, consistent with a defense strategy to move to trial 
as swiftly as possible. That also would save Simpson a substantial sum of money 
that would otherwise go to paying legal bills for a hearing that could last a 
month or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Going straight to opening statements in the trial without a ruling on the 
admissibility of the DNA evidence would vastly complicate the prosecution case, 
and some experts predicted that prosecutors would not willingly make any such 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution might very well oppose any delay in the resolution of those 
issues because the prosecution wants to know whether all of this evidence is 
admissible and the type of weight such evidence will have before they make 
opening statements," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The jockeying over evidence in the Simpson case is not limited to the blood 
and hair samples. Later this week, Simpson's attorneys will seek to prevent 
prosecutors from using any evidence of "marital discord" between Simpson and 
his ex-wife. And late Monday, prosecutors introduced a motion attempting to 
block the Simpson team from raising "remote, inflammatory and irrelevant 
character evidence regarding LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman testified at the preliminary hearing that he found a bloody glove 
outside Simpson's Brentwood mansion hours after the murders. Since then, he has 
come under intense defense scrutiny, and has been accused of racism by 
Simpson's attorneys. Through his lawyer, Fuhrman has denied those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the defense wrestled with the issue of how to propose going ahead with 
the DNA evidence, Judge Ito handed it yet another setback, ruling that veteran 
prosecutor Christopher Darden can remain on the prosecution team despite 
objections from the Simpson camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling regarding Darden's participation in the case ends the defense 
challenge, which had been based on the claim that Darden's presence on the 
Simpson team breached the wall that prosecutors said they had erected between 
the investigations of Simpson and his friend, Al Cowlings. Darden led the 
Cowlings probe, but Ito found that "there is nothing in the record which would 
support any finding of fundamental unfairness or lack of due process." 
</P>
<P>
 That ruling was greeted enthusiastically by the district attorney's office: 
"It's official now," Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said, smiling broadly at a news 
conference in which he was joined by Darden and Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Darden, who said he already has been working to prepare for the trial, said he 
was pleased that Ito's ruling eliminated any question about whether Darden had 
properly handled the grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito only affirms what we already knew," he said, "that I acted 
appropriately during the grand jury hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was not a basis for the legal objection to Darden's assignment, 
defense attorney Cochran had suggested that Darden was being added to the team 
in part because Darden is black. Cochran, who also is African American, 
stressed that he had high regard for Darden's legal skills but questioned the 
timing of his adversary's appointment to the team, which came shortly after a 
predominantly black jury was sworn in to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Darden said he would respond directly to Cochran's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't sit very well, and I was surprised to hear Mr. Cochran make that 
remark," Darden said. "I'm personally offended by it, and I am preparing a 
letter to Mr. Cochran in which I will explain my views."

THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; FEAR AND ANGER VOICED REGARDING FUND CRISIS; MOST 
RESIDENTS BLAME GOVERNMENT, WALL STREET FOR FINANCIAL MESS. FEW ARE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT RECOVERY.

<P>
 A week after staggering investment losses compelled Orange County to file for 
bankruptcy, a new Times Orange County poll shows that most residents are 
frightened about the potential impact of the crisis and angrily blame 
government officials as well as Wall Street firms for the financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of county residents say they are worried about the 
disastrous turn of events, with three in 10 describing themselves as "very 
worried" about the consequences for schools, government, the economy and the 
county's image. An even greater proportion are angry about the actions of 
county officials that preceded the debacle, with 40% saying they are "very 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that the public already is parceling out blame for the crisis. 
Across all demographic and political groups, residents point the finger at 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, the County Board of 
Supervisors, Wall Street companies that brokered the county's investments and 
local governmental agencies that invested in Citron's failed bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents also do not have much faith that government will solve the 
problem. Only one in 10 say they have a "great deal" of confidence in the Board 
of Supervisors. Four in 10 have some trust, whereas about half have very little 
or no confidence in the county's elected leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Most upset and worried are people with children in public schools that might 
be hurt financially by the crisis. The poll found that people with school-age 
children are more likely to give county officials poor grades for their 
performance during the financial crisis. They also are more likely to have 
little or no faith in the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I can't say I am very optimistic, because this whole mess has been 
brought on by all these people in the first place. They are the ones 
responsible," said respondent Karen Lee Williams, 33, an aerospace worker from 
Huntington Beach. "I will remember this on Election Day. Both my husband and I 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates, is 
the first assessment of how local residents view the largest municipal 
bankruptcy filing in U.S. history and its consequences. The random telephone 
survey -- conducted Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- questioned 600 Orange County 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fearful of the implications the financial collapse will have on 
their lives, and they are angry at local officials. They are not just focusing 
their anger at Bob Citron," said pollster Baldassare. "They feel many public 
officials and private entities are responsible for this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, 68% are worried about the situation, and 75% are angry 
at local county officials who apparently did not heed official warnings about 
Citron's management of the county's gigantic bond portfolio, which has suffered 
an estimated $2-billion loss. (About a year before the collapse, county 
Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis issued an audit criticizing the treasurer 
for making risky investments and violating government codes governing the 
fund.) 
</P>
<P>
 When asked who is most responsible, 21% specifically named Citron and 16% 
named the Board of Supervisors. About 4% pointed to the companies that sold the 
investments, 2% cited County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, and 1% 
accused the cities and local agencies that invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 42% -- the largest group -- blame "all of the above" individuals and 
institutions for the crisis, which has shaken the municipal bond market and 
prompted calls from Sacramento to Washington for tighter oversight of municipal 
investing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't imagine with all these people involved, they let it go on for 
this long," said poll respondent Robert Peters, 67, of Orange, a retired 
marketing representative. "Surely other people in the treasurer's department 
and county should have known about it and could have done something. I don't 
blame it on just one guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents with children in the local public schools are the most disturbed. 
Seventy-one percent are worried, with 35% "very worried" about the impact the 
financial crisis will have on education. Eighty percent expressed anger at the 
actions of local officials that led to the crisis, with 43% saying they are 
"very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, school districts across the county had no choice but to 
invest their funds -- hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- in Citron's 
bond portfolio, which has plunged $1.5 billion to $2 billion in value as 
interest rates have climbed. Four county districts went further, borrowing tens 
of millions of dollars to invest in the fund in hopes of boosting their 
interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to smack Citron in the face. There are going to be a lot of people 
suffering because of this," said Lisalyn Jones, 32, of Stanton, who has two 
daughters in public school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, seven in 10 respondents expect county services and 
programs to be reduced in the wake of the financial debacle, with 30% saying 
they will be cut back "a lot." Six in 10 anticipate that their city services 
will be reduced at least somewhat, with 17% fearing a greater cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar six in 10 expect that programs in their local school districts will 
have to be reduced at least somewhat, with 22% predicting services will be 
trimmed "a lot." State and local education officials came to a tentative 
agreement with the county Monday to keep school funds in an account separate 
from the county treasury. But administrators in individual districts said they 
remain worried about making payroll and paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents expect to be personally affected by the county's fiscal 
collapse. Four in 10 are worried that they will be hurt financially as a result 
of the crisis, with 16% describing themselves as "very worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Green, 37, a Laguna Hills interior designer, suspects the financial 
crisis will have far-ranging impact that might hurt her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely very, very disappointed," she said. "I have two clients that 
work for Caltrans. If they can't work on the freeway and they can't keep 
ordering, that may have an effect. . . . The arrogance of somebody to play like 
that with other people's money. It's amazing to think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said the findings show that worries about losses go far beyond 
employees of governmental agencies and are especially prevalent among those who 
are less well-off. Fifty percent of those with incomes below $50,000 describe 
themselves as worried, with 24% being "very worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, one in six residents say they or a member of their family receive 
a salary, contract or some form of payment from a local government entity that 
is caught up in the crisis. There are no differences by income or other 
demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the personal impact, most residents are expecting a blow to the 
county's economy and image as a result of the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% expect negative impacts on the county's job opportunities and 
economy, with 32% anticipating a very negative effect. A total of 75% expect 
the county's image and prestige to be hurt, with 38% anticipating a very 
negative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am worried about the county and my position in the county," said Patty 
Bernard, 50, of Fullerton, a stockbroker. "I'm more worried than anything about 
what's going to become of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one in five residents rate the county supervisors as having done an 
"excellent" or "good" job in handling the county's financial crisis so far, and 
one in three rate their work as "fair" and another one in three grade them 
"poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats take a similarly dim view of the capability of the 
county's elected leaders. About half in both groups say they have little or no 
confidence in the supervisors' ability to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of local residents would ask the state for money to help the county out 
of its financial troubles, with 25% strongly favoring such a bailout. Democrats 
and Republicans are equally in favor of asking for state help. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen percent support raising local taxes to help make up for funds lost 
in the investment dive, and two in three are "strongly opposed" to any new 
assessments or fees. 
</P>
<P>
 On a brighter note, most residents do not see the effects of the investment 
fund crisis lasting far into the future. And few at this point are ready to 
leave the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Four in 10 think that five years from now, the county will be much the same as 
it was before the bankruptcy, and three in 10 believe things will be better; 
only 24% say it will be a worse place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger people, however, are considerably more negative -- three in 10 of 
those under 35 think the county will be a worse place, compared to 18% of 
people 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 One in six residents say the crisis has made them consider moving out of the 
county; 7% say they are seriously thinking about it. Among people with children 
in school, nearly a quarter have thought about moving, with 10% considering it 
seriously. Only 14% of households without children in school are thinking about 
moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it'll take several years to get over this. It's something we 
can pull ourselves out of," said stockbroker Bernard. "We're a pretty wealthy 
county -- or at least we were. But we'll be back."

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Orange County poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 adult Orange County residents was done Dec. 9-11 on 
weekday nights and weekend days, using a computer-generated random sample of 
telephone numbers. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 4% 
at the 95% confidence level. That means it is 95% certain that the results are 
within 4 percentage points of what they would be if every adult resident in the 
county were interviewed. For subgroups, the margin of error would be higher. 
All respondents were guaranteed anonymity; however, some of those polled agreed 
to be re-interviewed for this story.

 Residents are convinced that losses in the county's investment fund will hurt

SPIEGEL FOUND NOT GUILTY OF LOOTING S & L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Spiegel, former chief executive of the failed Columbia Savings & Loan, 
was found not guilty Monday of federal charges that he looted the Beverly 
Hills-based thrift -- charges that a defiant Spiegel said "never should have 
been brought." 
</P>
<P>
 After a seven-week trial, a U.S. District Court jury in Los Angeles took only 
two hours -- with a weekend intervening -- to acquit Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crushing defeat for the federal government, whose intensive 
investigation of Spiegel produced a 55-count indictment in June, 1992, a year 
after the thrift had been seized as insolvent and liquidated at a cost to 
taxpayers of $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been accused of botching its rescue effort in the thrift 
crisis that swallowed Columbia and more than 1,000 other savings and loans 
across the country. It also has been criticized for failing to put many thrift 
swindlers in jail or win significant restitution for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, critics have said the government improperly targeted 
Spiegel for criminal charges because he was well known and made an easy 
scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the jury of seven men and five women got the case, the list of 
charges had been pared to only three, and jurors said they were not much 
impressed with those. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no real argument," jury foreman Joseph Sullivan of Granada Hills 
said of the deliberations, adding: "We kicked it around for a while, but it was 
unanimous." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's chief prosecutor defended his office's actions and branded as 
"absolute hogwash" the suggestion that Spiegel was a scapegoat for federal 
regulators who objected to his high pay and his aggressive investments in 
high-yielding, low-rated junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that it was the appropriate thing to do to bring this case, 
and in fact it had to be brought," Assistant U.S. Atty. John F. Walsh said. He 
said he could not estimate how much money the government had spent on its 
criminal investigation and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel still faces civil charges in a lawsuit that federal regulators brought 
against him after he was pressured to resign from Columbia at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is seeking $40 million to $50 million restitution from Spiegel. 
The case has been on hold pending the outcome of the criminal trial. Meanwhile, 
Spiegel's assets are under the control of a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel, 48, wearing a navy blue suit and a dark print tie, clasped his hands 
in his lap Monday as the jury handed the paper containing the verdict to Judge 
Robert M. Takasugi at 10:35 a.m. When Takasugi read the not-guilty verdicts, 
Spiegel rose and hugged his two lawyers, Brad D. Brian and Richard Marmaro. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hallway outside the fifth-floor courtroom, Spiegel embraced his wife, 
Helene, and was surrounded by his two sons, his sister and his father, Abraham, 
who had been chairman of Columbia. Spiegel family members together owned about 
half of the thrift's stock -- a stake once worth $350 million and now worth 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel, in an interview Monday afternoon, said he had rejected at least a 
dozen plea-bargain offers from prosecutors, including three or four in the 
weeks just before trial. The offers involved his pleading guilty to at least 
one felony and serving some jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never committed a crime and was not going to be pressured into pleading 
guilty to any felony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel believes he became a high-profile target for regulators and 
prosecutors because he stood at the nexus of two of the biggest financial 
events of the 1980s: the savings and loan crisis and the corporate takeover 
explosion, fueled in large part by Michael Milken and his junk-bond finance 
department at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, Spiegel had transformed Columbia into the nation's most 
profitable thrift through an aggressive and unorthodox strategy of investing in 
junk bonds and other securities connected with leveraged buyouts, many of them 
financed by Drexel and Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 With the success came high pay and lavish perks, such as Spiegel's use of a 
luxury jet to fly to Columbia's $1-million Palm Springs condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Spiegel got a $9-million bonus, pegged to Columbia's performance, 
which made him the highest-paid thrift executive in America. He said yesterday 
that that eye-popping paycheck probably triggered what his lawyers have called 
a vendetta against him by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, in his closing argument Friday, read the jury an excerpt from a 1990 
electronic mail message sent by an official of the U.S. Office of Thrift 
Supervision, the primary banking regulator for savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The sender was speculating as to why the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency 
that Congress created to supervise liquidations of failed thrifts, was firmly 
opposed to a particular plan for salvaging Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill (another regulator) said he felt it seemed the RTC . . . might have a 
vendetta against Tom Spiegel," the thrift supervision official wrote in a 
message that Judge Takasugi made available to the jury over the government's 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh, the prosecutor, Monday resisted any notion that the criminal 
charges had anything to do with regulators' ire, Columbia's failure or 
Spiegel's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't work for RTC or OTS," he said, adding: "We brought these charges 
after carefully reviewing the evidence," he said "I'm sorry we couldn't 
persuade the jury, but I accept the result. That's our system." 
</P>
<P>
 The original charges against Spiegel included allegations that he had used 
Columbia loans as a means of gaining a 50% interest in a Santa Barbara auto 
dealership, that he had caused Columbia to purchase and lavishly furnish the 
Palm Springs condo and that he had increased his personal gun collection with 
thousands of dollars worth of firearms bought with Columbia's money. All the 
counts connected with those three sets of allegations were dismissed before or 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The three charges that remained when the case reached the jury concerned 
Spiegel's alleged attempt to line his own pockets by pursuing for himself an 
investment opportunity that should have been Columbia's. The $130,000 that 
Spiegel invested from his own funds eventually grew into $7 million. Later, on 
the advice of Columbia's corporate counsel, Kenneth Heitz, Spiegel turned over 
the gains to the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed with Spiegel's defense lawyers that no crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were discussions on some of the points of law, but we were pretty 
convinced the government hadn't proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt," 
juror James George of Inglewood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has had mixed success in criminal prosecutions of 
executives of failed thrifts, but obtained convictions in three well-known 
cases: 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles H. Keating Jr., former chief of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings & Loan, 
which collapsed in America's most expensive thrift failure, was convicted of 
fraud last year and sentenced to 12 years in prison and restitution of $122 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * David L. Paul, who headed failed Miami-based CenTrust Bank, was convicted on 
49 counts of bank fraud last year and sentenced last month to 11 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don Dixon, owner of Vernon Savings Assn. in Dallas, was sentenced in 1990 to 
five years in prison for conspiracy and misuse of the failed thrift's funds.

DRUG DEALING ARRESTS INCREASE 47% AT SCHOOLS; CRIME: UNDERCOVER POLICE AT 10 
CAMPUSES, INCLUDING FIVE IN THE VALLEY, TAKE 157 STUDENTS INTO CUSTODY.

 Reflecting a resurgence of drug use among teen-agers, undercover police 
officers posing as students at 10 Los Angeles high schools arrested the largest 
number of suspected drug dealers in any semester since 1988, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover "School Buy Program" resulted in the arrests of 201 people -- 
157 of them students -- at the schools, including five in the San Fernando 
Valley. Drugs sold included marijuana, crack and powder cocaine, LSD and a 
small amount of peyote. Most of the students face drug sales charges and will 
probably be sent to alternative campuses in the school district, according to 
school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of arrests jumped 47% over last fall, when 137 suspected dealers 
were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's skyrocketed," said Lt. Bud Harper, who oversees the Los Angeles Police 
Department's juvenile narcotics section. "It's a phenomenon going on that a lot 
of people aren't aware of. It's just gone up so much in such a short amount of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 schools where young-looking officers posed as students beginning the 
first day of school this year were: Canoga Park, where 13 students were 
arrested; Cleveland, where 19 were arrested; Locke, where 20 were arrested; 
Narbonne, where nine were arrested; North Hollywood, where four were arrested; 
Palisades, where four were arrested; University, where four were arrested; Van 
Nuys, where 15 were arrested; Venice, where 27 were arrested, and Verdugo 
Hills, where 19 were arrested. Other arrests were made off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said the numerous arrests this semester mirror the 
increasing numbers of youths being caught with drugs across the city. From 
January to June, Los Angeles police arrested 1,579 juveniles compared to 1,150 
last year -- a 37% increase -- for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In one surprising arrest, a student was nabbed after selling a handgun -- on 
the Verdugo Hills High School campus -- to an officer for $60. "We don't 
solicit guns, but the student brought it from home," Harper said. "The officer 
seized the opportunity to get the gun off campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Turner, the Verdugo Hills principal who met with the student and his 
parents Monday, said the incident was shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty surprising to find a student was bringing a gun to sell to 
someone on campus," Turner said. "I feel fortunate that he sold it to an 
undercover officer." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun, which belonged to the boy's father, had been reported missing to the 
South Gate police, where the family lives. The boy is bused to the Tujunga 
school, which was informed about the missing weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the undercover officers recovered nine guns and nearly $10,000 cash. 
The officers also seized about $109,392 worth of drugs, including more than 30 
pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures reflect a trend continuing into the fall semester, according to 
Wes Mitchell, chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District police. Police 
made 46% more arrests for drugs from July to September this year than they did 
during the same period last year, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old strategies that we used to reduce it or diminish it are not working 
with this group of kids," Mitchell said. "I think we're seeing a turn in the 
times. . . . It's back to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police also said the students are selling larger quantities of 
drugs -- pounds rather than ounces of marijuana, for example -- and that more 
students are becoming the middlemen in the drug trade and are using younger 
students to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 One undercover officer was taken to a house in West Los Angeles where 11 
pounds of marijuana were being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug dealers range from suspected gang members to students just dabbling 
in drugs to make some extra money, police said. "It was a wide range -- from 
those just beginning to experiment in the drug scene all the way to some 
hard-core kids out there really hustling drugs," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 157 students arrested, nearly 25 are participating in the Police 
Department's drug diversion program in which they receive counseling and 
charges are not filed against them. The program was devised for students who 
are just beginning to sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators confirmed the increase in drugs on and around their 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Larry Higgins, principal at Canoga Park High: "Marijuana is the drug 
being used. It's back from the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, of the school police, said he believes the district, as well as 
state and national leaders, must readdress the drug problem. "It's not just 
us," Mitchell said. "It's not a problem just in Los Angeles or California. It's 
a national issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper acknowledged that officers and administrators need to be more vigilant 
about tracking drugs on school campuses. "We may have been lulled into a false 
sense (due to declining arrests) . . . so maybe we didn't have to focus on it," 
Harper said. "We do now."

SLAIN MOUNTAIN LION IS ONE THAT KILLED HIKER; WILDLIFE: A NECROPSY FINDS HUMAN 
HAIR AND SCALP IN THE ANIMAL'S STOMACH. OFFICIALS ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN A 
SERIES OF ATTACKS BY THE CATS, WHICH WERE THOUGHT TO FEAR HUMANS.

<P>
 Authorities confirmed Monday that the mountain lion shot Saturday night is the 
animal that killed a 58-year-old woman who was hiking and bird watching at 
Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were at a loss to explain why the mountain lions at the park have 
suddenly begun behaving aggressively toward humans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, zoologists have surmised that only a diseased, rabid or crippled 
mountain lion attacks people and that a healthy lion flees at the sight of a 
human. But Cuyamaca mountain lions that have menaced or attacked visitors have 
been healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lions are behaving in a way we historically did not think they would," 
said Laura Itogawa, supervising ranger at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. "I've 
been involved with this issue for two years, and I wish I had answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Trackers on Saturday night chased and shot the lion after the fatal attack on 
Iris Kenna, a career counselor at a San Diego high school. It was the fifth 
lion killed in the past 15 months after stalking or menacing people in or near 
the sprawling park east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 County veterinarian Dr. Hubert Johnstone, who performed the necropsy, said the 
116-pound mountain lion was an adult male, fully capable of hunting deer. He 
said human hair and scalp were found inside the stomach, along with deer 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Weir, assistant deputy director for the state Department of Fish and 
Game, told reporters that the department plans a study to determine why the 
Cuyamaca cougars are behaving so aggressively and what can be done to protect 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuyamaca is a hot spot for cougars," Weir said. "There are several others, 
but Cuyamaca is the hottest." 
</P>
<P>
 Weir referred to Kenna's death as "a tragedy we're not sure we can prevent 
from happening again" until more is known about the Cuyamaca cougars' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mark Super, deputy medical examiner for San Diego County, said Kenna died 
of bites and clawing to the neck, head and upper body and was probably attacked 
from behind while fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lion sightings have become increasingly common in California. The 
state mountain lion population is estimated by biologists to have tripled to 
more than 6,000 since a 1971 law made it illegal to hunt the big cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Palmer, executive director of the Mountain Lion Foundation, said that the 
biggest concentration of mountain lions is in Northern California, where there 
have been fewer sightings. "Something weird is happening at Cuyamaca," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenna's death is the fourth in California from a mountain lion attack since 
record-keeping began. A 40-year-old woman was killed in April while jogging in 
Auburn State Recreation Area in El Dorado County. In 1909, two people in Santa 
Clara County died of rabies after being bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers believe about 20 mountain lions, also called cougars or pumas, may 
live in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 By fleeing, Kenna may have done the wrong thing. "Mountain lions prefer to 
take down their prey from behind," ranger Homer Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers suggest that anyone who is confronted by a mountain lion should 
maintain eye contact with the animal, make noise and wait for the animal to 
leave. The campgrounds at the park, 50 miles east of San Diego in the Cleveland 
National Forest, will remain closed until further notice.

SUCCESS ON ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS TRIPLE THAT OF 1984 LEVEL; EDUCATION: L.A. 
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS AMONG THOSE SURPASSING NATIONAL AVERAGE ON EXAMS OF 
COLLEGE-LEVEL KNOWLEDGE. OFFICIALS CREDIT MORE RIGOROUS CURRICULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The rate at which California high schoolers succeed in passing the tough 
Advanced Placement tests in classes such as calculus, French literature and 
physics is three times greater than it was 10 years ago, providing evidence -- 
officials say -- that the state's push for schools to offer their top students 
more rigorous instruction is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials are to announce today that the passing rate for 
California juniors and seniors in the tests of college-level knowledge was 
nearly 11% last year, which was slightly above the national average. Many 
districts in Los Angeles County, including the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, also surpassed the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 But others fell short, with the Azusa, Compton and Inglewood school districts 
at the bottom. The qualifying rate in those districts was less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate is the number of examinations with a score of 3 or better on a scale 
of 5, per 100 public high school juniors and seniors. That rate was 3.4 in 1984 
and 10.8 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said students of all ethnicities shared in the gains. The rate at 
which African American and Latino students qualify for college credit remains 
far below that of Asian Americans and white students, but is far above what it 
was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying rate for African American students last year was 1.7%, but that 
was more than triple what it was a decade earlier. The rate of Latino students 
more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say the Advanced Placement tests measure only one aspect of school 
district performance. They point out that some districts are too small to offer 
the many specialized classes that prepare students for the tests or that too 
few students are interested in taking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one piece of a whole puzzle . . . but it's not a complete picture by 
itself," said Pat McCabe, an administrator with the state Department of 
Education's research and evaluation division. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Canada Flintridge, San Marino and Palos Verdes Peninsula school 
districts were the only ones in the county with a qualifying rate of 50% or 
above, and all serve generally affluent communities where the students are 
expected to attend college. The performance of each of those districts 
increased dramatically over the past decade, with Palos Verdes Peninsula 
improving more than any other district in the state except one. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes High School, the only comprehensive high school in that district, 
offers preparatory courses in all areas covered by the Advanced Placement 
tests, Principal Kelly Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school was sixth in the nation in terms of the number of students 
qualifying for college credit. "We emphasize academic excellence and we think 
the AP test is a national measure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying rate in the 640,000-student Los Angeles school district, the 
largest in the state, more than doubled during the past decade. Sheila Smith, 
who coordinates the district's education program for gifted and talented 
students, credited its commitment to providing "advanced learning opportunities 
for every child." 
</P>
<P>
 Every high school in the district has an advanced placement program, although 
they vary in the number of courses offered. Students at Van Nuys High School, 
with several magnet schools on campus, took 847 Advanced Placement 
examinations, and more than 70% of them qualified for college credit. Students 
at Garfield High in East Los Angeles took nearly 500 examinations and half of 
them earned college credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All schools are on the move, in terms of advanced placement," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said school districts offered nearly 6,000 Advanced Placement 
classes statewide, with an enrollment of nearly 160,000. The most popular 
examinations among California students last year were U.S. history, English 
literature and composition, and calculus.

STATE PANEL URGES OUSTER OF JUDGE FOR UNETHICAL CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After holding its first public disciplinary hearing in history, the state 
Commission on Judicial Performance Monday unanimously recommended the ouster of 
a Central California judge for unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, the watchdog panel suspended Kings County Municipal Judge 
Glenda Kraft Doan for failing to disclose personal connections with defendants 
who appeared before her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She attempted to manipulate the outcome of criminal cases involving friends 
or people who owed her money," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Raymond L. Brosterhous 
II, who presented the case against Doan to the state panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan was suspended with pay pending a final ruling by the California Supreme 
Court on her permanent removal. The ruling could take three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that the Corcoran judge was habitually tardy, failed to 
disclose some loans on a bankruptcy petition and on her economic disclosure 
statements and had improperly instructed witnesses not to cooperate with the 
disciplinary probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan, 50, who was elected to the bench in 1982, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Romaine, a Visalia lawyer who represented Doan before the 
commission, said in a prepared statement that she will fight to retain her 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line here is the Commission on Judicial Performance either does 
not know or does not care what it is doing," Romaine said. "It is scary that a 
collection of political hacks can play such cavalier games with our notion of 
an independent judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brosterhous said Doan deserves to be ousted. "The judge fixed criminal 
cases," he said. "The remedy is to remove someone who does that." 
</P>
<P>
 Doan released a drug defendant without bail and without disclosing that he was 
her gardener and that his wife had appealed to her for help. At the time Doan 
owed the gardener money. She also released his co-defendant, who fled and has 
not been apprehended, Brosterhous said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Doan refused to approve a plea bargain of a defendant whose 
aunt had enlisted her help, Brosterhous said. The judge owed the aunt money. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan has been disciplined three times previously for failing to report $75,000 
in gifts, loans and legal fees from a law client, asking a Superior Court judge 
to release a defendant without bail and failing to report a loan from an 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney maintained during the commission hearing that Doan had done 
nothing wrong. He also suggested that her actions were not unusual in a small 
town where many people know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 After the commission's action, he said that Doan "by every account" is a good 
judge. "She is not in trouble because she took bribes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead," he said, referring to the episode with her gardener, "she is in 
trouble because she may have acted out of sympathy in one case for the plight 
of a mother with small children and a husband in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the commission's action in the case "blatantly political." 
</P>
<P>
 Doan is the 16th judge whose removal the commission has recommended in its 
30-year history. The California Supreme Court followed the recommendation in 12 
of those cases, and one is still pending.

FATAL BOMB MAILED FROM S.F., FBI SAYS; CRIME: AGENTS ASK PEOPLE TO CONSIDER 
WHETHER ELUSIVE SERIAL BOMBER, SOUGHT FOR 16 YEARS, MAY BE SOMEONE THEY KNOW. 
LATEST ATTACK CLAIMED A LIFE SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The package bomb that killed a prominent New York advertising executive 
Saturday was mailed from a mailbox here a week earlier by an elusive serial 
bomber whose devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the FBI said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated investigators, who have been searching for the bomber for more than 
16 years, said the killer now may be based in the San Francisco area and urged 
residents to consider whether he may be someone they know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may even appear to be a very nice guy," said Jim R. Freeman, special agent 
in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's San Francisco office. "He 
might not stand out in a community. He could easily be the person living next 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI has offered a $1-million reward for the capture of the bomber and, for 
the first time in its history, has posted a notice on the Internet appealing 
for leads. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomber, believed to be a white male, has mailed or planted 15 explosive 
devices spanning the continent from UC Berkeley to Yale, killing two and 
injuring 23 since 1978. Many of the targets have been linked to universities, 
aviation and the computer industry, prompting the FBI to code-name the case 
"UNABOM." 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb that killed Thomas J. Mosser at his New Jersey home Saturday was the 
first to target a victim in the advertising business. The FBI said it was 
investigating whether Mosser or his firm, Young & Rubicam, Inc., were linked to 
any of the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly adds a new wrinkle to the equation, having an advertising 
executive join the ranks of college professors and researchers and computer 
industry executives," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents described the suspect as a loner with at least a high school 
education and a perfectionist who is meticulous in handcrafting his explosive 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he began his attacks, his bombs have become more compact and deadly. The 
one mailed to Mosser was about the size of a videocassette tape. "Over the 
period since 1978, they have become more sophisticated and more destructive," 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic experts have been able to link the bombs because of similarities in 
design, their painstaking construction and the initials "FC" found on some of 
the devices. In all, eight of the 15 bombs were sent through the mail; the 
other seven were placed at locations where they would be discovered and 
detonated. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomber began with four attacks in Illinois, targeting victims at 
universities and airlines. In 1981, he moved west, with bombings in Salt Lake 
City, Berkeley, Sacramento and Auburn, Wash. During the 1980s, he also mailed 
bombs to professors at universities in Nashville, Tenn., and Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a fair-skinned white man with a mustache was seen placing a bomb at a 
computer store in Salt Lake City. After the bomb exploded, injuring one person, 
the bomber stopped his attacks for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 But in June, 1993, a UC San Francisco geneticist was injured by a bomb mailed 
to his house in Tiburon. Two days later, a Yale University computer scientist 
was injured by a bomb sent to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 After those attacks, the bomber sent a letter to the New York Times, claiming 
the explosions were the work of an anarchist group calling itself "FC." But 
Freeman said Monday investigators believe they are searching for one man and 
have found no other indication of political motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agencies, including the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service, formed a task 
force last year based in San Francisco and are using a computer system to 
analyze more than 1 million pieces of information collected in the case. More 
than 25 investigators had been working full time on the case, and the number of 
agents increased with the latest bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said investigators believe the bomber is probably in the Bay Area 
because of the frequency of activity here: Seven of the 15 attacks either 
occurred in Northern California or resulted from packages mailed from the 
region. The bomber's letter to the newspaper was mailed from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 By reconstructing the wrapping paper on the package that killed Mosser, 
investigators have found the return address written on the package and the date 
of the postmark, Dec. 3. Agents also have come up with the ZIP code in San 
Francisco where the package -- bearing postage stamps -- was mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are conducting an intensive investigation here in the San Francisco area 
in an to attempt to determine exactly where that package may have been mailed," 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has established a hot line for tips on the bomber: (800) 
701-BOMB. The FBI also has released a new composite sketch of the suspect based 
on the 1987 sighting. The picture was drawn by Jeanne Boylan, the Oregon police 
artist whose drawing of alleged kidnaper Richard Allen Davis was widely 
circulated in the search last year for murder victim Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 While appealing for help from the public, the FBI was reluctant to share much 
evidence in the case or offer a detailed personality profile of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to speculate," Freeman said at a news conference, "because I'm 
not just speaking to you in the media and to the general public, but I am also 
speaking probably to the UNABOM suspect."

BROWN, BRULTE MEET TO DISCUSS IMPASSE ON ASSEMBLY SPEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Willie Brown proposed Monday that 10 lawmakers -- five Republicans 
and five Democrats -- begin meeting to negotiate a deal to break the leadership 
logjam that has paralyzed the Legislature's lower house for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the Assembly's top Democrat, met with Republican Leader Jim Brulte 
Monday and called it a "good first meeting" on the path to developing a 
bipartisan plan to operate the Assembly for the two-year legislative session 
scheduled to begin in earnest on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown declined to discuss details of the meeting, held in Brulte's Capitol 
office, saying the two men agreed to keep the contents of their talks private. 
Brulte also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown, in a telephone interview, was willing to talk about his general 
views on the leadership struggle, which began Nov. 8 when Republicans won a 
41-39 margin in the 80-member Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Republican -- Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar -- quit his party on Dec. 5, 
declared himself an independent and voted for Brown, leaving the seven-term 
Speaker and his less experienced foe in a 40-40 deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly effectively can do no other business until a Speaker is chosen. 
Brown predicted that the issue would be resolved on Jan. 4 -- or sooner if 
Orange County lawmakers, all of whom are Republicans, tell him they want the 
Assembly to meet in special session to act on that county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to organize the house first," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said in a 
letter Monday to Gov. Pete Wilson that he sees no need for a special session 
before January or February, noting that county officials need more information 
about their financial problems before asking the Legislature for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown described as "a framework" a proposal made Monday by two Democrats to 
elect co-speakers, one from each party, to govern the house until one can gain 
a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said the idea, copied from a plan used in the evenly split Michigan 
House, would not work as well in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he suggested, he should be elected the sole Speaker for the first 
year, with the power to appoint members to committees, which would have an 
equal number of Republicans and Democrats. Each member, he said, would be given 
an equal amount of money to run his or her personal office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the best method to ultimately achieve the goal of shared 
leadership," Brown said.

 The former owner of an abortion clinic was convicted Monday of second-degree 
murder for botching an abortion, failing to call for help and trying to stuff 
the body in a trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Ruiz Hanna, 33, covered her face and began shaking and crying as the 
Orange County Superior Court jury returned its verdicts, also convicting her of 
performing illegal abortions. She faces 15 years to life in prison when she is 
sentenced on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, who ran a financially ailing clinic in Santa Ana, sought to increase 
profits by performing abortions herself without a license, rather than using a 
physician, prosecutors contended. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, 1993, Angela Nieto Sanchez, 27, came to her clinic for an 
abortion. As two of Sanchez's children sat in the waiting room, she died on an 
examination table after reacting violently to an unknown drug injected by 
Hanna, according to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty, Rick King told jurors that Sanchez did not have to die; a 
fire station staffed with emergency workers was less than one mile away. But 
Hanna admitted to jurors that she did not dial 911 because she feared being 
arrested for performing illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Steve Biskar conceded that his client erred in 
practicing medicine without a license, but asked jurors to convict his client 
on a lesser charge of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the court, jurors said they believed Hanna was a selfish businesswoman 
more interested in making money than guarding the welfare of her patients. "She 
knew the risks and she did it anyway," juror Michelle Franks of Orange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Charles Buezis of Stanton said, "There really wasn't a lot of 
sympathy for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna testified that she tried desperately to revive Sanchez with 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The clinic's emergency equipment, including an 
empty oxygen tank, was not operating. A clinic employee, who was a key 
prosecution witness, testified that Hanna hatched a plan to dump the corpse in 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna ordered an assistant to tell Sanchez's children that their mother had 
left the clinic. The children remained at the clinic most of the day until an 
uncle picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez's frantic relatives searched the neighborhood and returned to the 
clinic later that night, hoping to find the missing woman. But Sanchez's 
daughter, Maria, now 14, testified that she found Hanna trying to hoist her 
mother's body into a car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence in the trial indicated Hanna had performed numerous abortions. After 
one botched abortion, the patient discovered months later that she was still 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Sanchez wept during the court hearing and said outside of court that the 
verdict was just, but does nothing to bring her mother back.

SUCCESS ON ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS TRIPLES OVER PAST DECADE; EDUCATION: L.A., 
GLENDALE, BURBANK AND LAS VIRGENES DISTRICTS SURPASS NATIONAL SCORES ON 
COLLEGE-LEVEL EXAMS. 
</P>

<P>
 The rate at which California high schoolers succeed in passing the rigorous 
Advanced Placement tests in classes such as calculus, French literature and 
physics is three times greater than it was 10 years ago, providing evidence -- 
officials say -- that the state's push for schools to offer their top students 
more rigorous instruction is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials are to announce today that the passing rate for 
California juniors and seniors in the tests of college-level knowledge was 
nearly 11% last year, which was slightly above the national average. Many 
districts in Los Angeles County, including the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, also surpassed the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 But others fell short, with the Azusa, Compton and Inglewood school districts 
bringing up the bottom. The qualifying rate in those districts was less than 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate is calculated by dividing the number of Advanced Placement 
examinations scoring at least 3 on a scale of 5 by the total number of high 
school juniors and seniors. That method of reporting the scores allows for 
year-to-year comparisons even though the number of students varies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said students of all ethnicities shared in the gains. The rate at 
which African American and Latino students qualify for college credit remains 
far below that of Asian Americans and white students, but is far above what it 
was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying rate for African American students last year was 1.7%, but that 
was more than triple what it was a decade earlier. The rate of Latino students 
more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, school districts generally showed increases in the 
numbers of students who qualified for college credits by taking and passing the 
AP exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Burbank Unified School District, where 1,840 students took the AP 
tests, 15.3% of the Class of 1994 qualified for college credit by passing the 
rigorous exams -- an increase of 11.3% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Glendale Unified School District, where 4,155 students took the exams, 
13% of the seniors qualified for college credits -- an increase of 9.1% over 
seniors the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 At Antelope Valley Union High, where 4,176 students took AP tests, 5.8% earned 
college credits -- an increase of 5% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Canada Flintridge, where 528 students took the tests, 55.1% qualified -- 
an increase of 37.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Las Virgenes Unified district, where 1,522 students took the exams, 21% 
earned college credits -- up 10.6% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the William S. Hart Union High School District, where 3,327 students 
took the exams, 6.8% qualified -- an increase of nearly 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say the Advanced Placement tests measure only one aspect of school 
district performance. They point out that some districts are too small to offer 
the many specialized classes that prepare students for the tests or that too 
few students are interested in taking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one piece of a whole puzzle . . . but it's not a complete picture by 
itself," said Pat McCabe, an administrator with the state Department of 
Education's research and evaluation division. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Canada Flintridge, San Marino and Palos Verdes Peninsula school 
districts were the only ones in the county with a qualifying rate of 50% or 
above, and all serve generally affluent communities where the students are 
expected to attend college. The performance of each of those districts 
increased dramatically over the past decade, with Palos Verdes Peninsula 
improving more than any other district in the state except one. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes High School, the only comprehensive high school in that district, 
offers preparatory courses in all areas covered by the Advanced Placement 
tests, Principal Kelly Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school was sixth in the nation in terms of the number of students 
qualifying for college credit. "We emphasize academic excellence and we think 
the AP test is a national measure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying rate in the 640,000-student Los Angeles school district, the 
largest in the state, more than doubled during the past decade. Sheila Smith, 
who coordinates the district's education program for gifted and talented 
students, credited its commitment to providing "advanced learning opportunities 
for every child." 
</P>
<P>
 Every high school in the district has an advanced placement program, although 
they vary in the number of courses offered. Students at Van Nuys High School, 
with several magnet schools on campus, took 847 Advanced Placement 
examinations, and more than 70% of them qualified for college credit. Students 
at Garfield High in East Los Angeles took nearly 500 examinations and half of 
them earned college credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All schools are on the move, in terms of advanced placement," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said school districts offered nearly 6,000 Advanced Placement 
classes statewide, with an enrollment of nearly 160,000. The most popular 
examinations among California students last year were U.S. history, English 
literature and composition, and calculus.

BRAZIL'S EX-PRESIDENT CLEARED OF CORRUPTION; LATIN AMERICA: JUDGES FIND COLLOR 
AND HIS CAMPAIGN TREASURER NOT GUILTY OF USING POWER TO GAIN KICKBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after he was impeached by Congress and left office in disgrace, 
former Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello was cleared by the Supreme 
Court on Monday of corruption charges in a case the court called weak and 
pocked with errors. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of eight judges ruled 5-3 that Atty. Gen. Aristides Junqueira failed 
to show proof that Collor and his former campaign treasurer, Paulo Cesar 
Farias, used their power to get kickbacks from business leaders and politicians 
seeking official favors. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict came after a three-day trial -- which none of the defendants 
attended -- in Brasilia, the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor, Farias and seven others were charged with "passive corruption," which 
in Brazilian law means receipt of illicit gains or "undue" advantages while in 
public office. A guilty verdict could have brought Collor up to eight years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor's attorney, Evaristo de Moraes, hailed the judges' finding as a "double 
victory for democracy." The case, he said, showed not only that "a president 
can be brought to the defendant's chair" but also that he can receive a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling was a bitter one for those who poured into the streets two 
years ago to demand Collor's ouster and lobby for a cleanup of Brazilian 
politics. "This is one of the greatest political, judicial and ethical 
absurdities this country has ever seen," said Herbert de Souza, a sociologist 
whose Movement for Ethics in Politics led street protests against Collor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, Junqueira argued that Collor and Farias had solicited bribes 
from business leaders and then laundered the money through "ghost" companies 
and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 He charged that Farias, acting on Collor's behalf, pocketed $295,000 from a 
construction magnate as a pay-back for having him named secretary of 
transportation, and that Farias used his influence to win an illegal 
$1.1-million campaign contribution from Mercedes-Benz for a candidate friendly 
to Collor. Junqueira also said Farias invoked Collor's name to pressure the 
state oil company, Petrobras, into granting a loan on unusually favorable terms 
to an airline company, Vasp, owned by a close friend and former business 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judges argued that in these and other cases the prosecution 
either failed to document its claims or backed them with inadmissible evidence, 
such as computer files seized illegally from Farias' home and tape recordings 
discarded as hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict marked another turn of fortune for Collor, the onetime governor of 
a backwater state who rose to the center of the political stage by vowing to 
sweep crooked politicians from power. His crusade resonated deeply in a country 
where political corruption has traditionally gone unpunished and white-collar 
citizens rarely go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor, now 45, rode that wave of indignation to power in 1990, becoming 
Brazil's first popularly elected president in nearly 30 years. The military 
dominated Brazilian politics from 1964 to 1985 and cast its shadow over 
government until general elections were called in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But two years after taking office, the polished Collor, who wore Hermes ties 
and always had a bon mot for the TV cameras, saw the country turn against him 
as he was tarred in a massive political scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional panel concluded that Collor was the behind-the-curtains 
beneficiary of a massive system of corruption, branded the "P. C. scheme" after 
its alleged mastermind, P. C. Farias. Congress charged that the P. C. scheme 
squeezed at least $100 million in kickbacks, "commissions" and favors from 
business leaders, industrialists and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor was alleged to have received a car, fancy clothes for his wife and home 
improvements worth about $4.7 million. Collor's attorneys claimed that unspent 
campaign funds paid for those things. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the congressional findings, the lower house in late 1992 moved, with 
only three dissenting votes, to impeach him and send him to trial in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor resigned just as the Senate began deliberations, but the upper house 
found him guilty of breaching the trust of office and stripped him of the right 
to seek political office again until the year 2001. Monday's Supreme Court 
acquittal will not reverse the political ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Farias fled the country but was spotted in Thailand and deported to Brazil, 
where he was indicted and jailed awaiting trial on 51 counts ranging from tax 
evasion to influence peddling. He still faces several criminal charges, 
including bribery and coercion of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Junqueira vowed to "battle on to make sure the rich and not only the poor are 
brought to justice."

HEALTH; FDA TO FACILITATE PRESCRIPTION OF ADULT DRUGS FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pediatrician who wants to prescribe a drug for a child frequently faces a 
confusing and potentially dangerous dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, there is little or no information available about the 
correct dosage or possible adverse side effects of that drug for children. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, children often either do not get access to the drugs that they 
need -- because the medicines are not officially approved for use in that age 
group -- or they face the risk that they could be hurt by a drug that is 
administered improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many instances, you're flying by the seat of your pants," said David A. 
Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, who was a practicing 
pediatrician before assuming the federal post. "It's not the way to practice 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 So the FDA plans to propose new rules today designed to alleviate the problem 
by allowing drug companies, in certain situations, to extrapolate guidelines 
from adult studies and apply them for use in children. In doing so, they would 
be required to revise labels and other information available to pediatricians 
on how the drugs should be used in children. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal amends a 1979 regulation that requires full clinical trials in 
children before a new drug can be approved for pediatric use. Many drug 
companies typically don't conduct tests of new drugs in children because their 
main market for a drug is usually adults, and they may be worried about testing 
on youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, most therapies end up being approved for adults only. Yet many doctors 
still routinely prescribe them for children because the drugs have come into 
standard practice through physician experience -- trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now when your pediatrician prescribes a drug, chances are that the drug 
companies haven't done the studies in children," Kessler said in an interview. 
"The data are not there. An enormously high number of drugs are being 
prescribed for kids where pediatricians do not have this information." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that about 80% of currently 
approved drugs have been studied and licensed for use in adults, with virtually 
no information available on pediatric use. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet such drugs routinely are being used in children to treat asthma, cancer, 
blood diseases, lupus, psychiatric and behavioral disorders, as well as routine 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally troubling, some drugs that are known through practice to work in 
children for one condition actually are licensed only for use in adults for an 
entirely different ailment. This could mean that a doctor unfamiliar with 
standard practice either might not know of its value in treating a particular 
pediatric disorder or simply might be reluctant to prescribe it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "there is one drug that has only one indication -- treatment of 
hypertension in adults -- that is used extensively for behavioral problems in 
children," said Dr. Cheston Berlin Jr., who heads a special committee on drugs 
for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The profession tries very hard to be as devoted to children as it can," 
Berlin said. "We try very hard to provide patients with the right therapy, but 
we need more help in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said some of the impetus for the new rules came from a meeting he had 
three years ago with Elizabeth Glaser, founder of the Los Angeles-based 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser, who recently died of AIDS, made a convincing case that children with 
AIDS deserved as much access to experimental AIDS drugs as adults, Kessler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized something needed to be done, because drugs needed to be developed 
and studied in kids," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are expected to be quickly endorsed by the pediatric medical 
community.

LAW; IN FLOOD CASE, WATER SEEKS ITS OWN LEVEL; SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE IF BARGE 
ACCIDENT THAT LED TO CHICAGO MISHAP IS COVERED BY MARITIME OR STATE STATUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's "landmark" case in maritime law began, of all places, along Kinzie 
Street in downtown Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 13, 1992, the basements of buildings all over downtown were flooded. 
Electricity and phone service were cut off. For days, the central business 
district sat paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, investigators determined the Chicago River had "sprung a leak" 
when a barge, hired by the city to repair the Kinzie Street Bridge, had 
inadvertently poked a hole in an underground tunnel. This in turn allowed water 
to pour into a network of century-old rail tunnels that were once used to 
deliver coal throughout the center city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Supreme Court gets to answer what could be a $1-billion question. Was 
this a "maritime" accident, like two ships colliding on the high seas? 
</P>
<P>
 If the answer is yes, the barge owners probably will escape the huge liability 
for the accident because maritime laws, which would supersede Illinois state 
law in the case, protect the owners of vessels from liability in most 
circumstances. The city of Chicago would then be forced to pay the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the U.S. appeals court in Chicago dealt the city a stunning setback 
when it ruled that admiralty laws did apply, for several reasons. The repair 
barge was a "vessel" that was capable of moving. It was sitting on a "navigable 
waterway." And it was engaged in something akin to "traditional maritime 
activity" -- in this case, repairing a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers both for the city and for the thousands of downtown business 
owners have appealed to the high court, calling this an "absurd result" that 
could shield the barge owner from paying for the damage. Court claims have 
ranged from $300 million to $400 million in direct damages and up to $1 billion 
if lost business is included. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-19th Century, the admiralty laws have usually protected 
shipowners from paying the full cost of accidents on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress granted the protection in 1851 to encourage the development of an 
American merchant fleet, following the same legal rule that had protected 
British shippers and financiers. Under the Limitation of Vessel Owner's 
Liability Act, owners of U.S. vessels were not responsible for damage caused by 
their ships, so long as they did not have direct knowledge of or personally 
cause the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 That law still stands. But it has been amended in recent decades to allow 
damage suits when people are injured or killed, and it now excludes shippers 
who cause pollution damage, such as in the Exxon Valdez accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly then, vessel owners fight hard to force lawsuits into federal 
admiralty court, where a judge presides, rather than go before a state court 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking at a difference in liability between $600,000 (the cost of 
their two repair barges and a tugboat) and $400 million," said University of 
Texas law professor Michael F. Sturley, an expert in maritime law. "That's 
certainly worth fighting over." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high for the city of Chicago too. If the damage suits are 
ultimately tried in state court, the city will not have to pay. Under Illinois 
law, a city is not responsible for damage caused by negligent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the damage suits go to a federal admiralty court, the barge owners 
could escape liability, while the city would lose the immunity it has in state 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court of late has not had an easy time determining what is a 
maritime case. For most of American history, the rule was simple: If an 
accident took place on water, it was a maritime case. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the court amended the rule when faced with the case of a small 
private jet that took off from Cleveland and crashed in Lake Erie. This was not 
a maritime accident, the court said, because it had nothing to do with 
"traditional maritime activity." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the justices broadened the definition of "traditional maritime 
activity" to include docked pleasure boats. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 24, 1985, Everett Sisson's boat sat at a marina on Lake Michigan when 
a washer-dryer on board short-circuited. The fire not only destroyed Sisson's 
boat but also burned much of the marina. The damage claims amounted to 
$275,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1990, the Supreme Court threw out all the claims against the boat owner 
and ruled this was a maritime accident. Why? Because the "storage and 
maintenance of a boat" is a "traditional maritime activity," the justices said 
in Sisson vs. Ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the U.S. appeals court in Chicago relied on this precedent for its 
decision calling the downtown flood a maritime accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 12, the Supreme Court heard the case, Chicago vs. Great Lakes Dredge 
and Dock Co., 93-762. Predictably, the argument had moments that were all wet. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the business owners said his case was "buoyed" by maritime 
precedents that speak of ships and vessels that move on their own power. The 
barge in this case was "stationary, more like a dock or platform." 
</P>
<P>
 But that argument "evaporates," a justice commented, when you recognize the 
barge moved up and down the river for repair jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the argument did not go well for the city's lawyers. While they 
stressed the damage "involves an injury on land," the justices sounded more 
inclined to rule that an accident that begins on water is a maritime case, 
regardless of whether all the damage occurs on land.  
</P>
<P>
 The court will likely issue a written opinion in the case early next year, and 
then it will go back for trial in Chicago.

MORE FIREPOWER SOUGHT FOR U.N. TROOPS; BOSNIA: U.S. AND FRANCE CHANGE COURSE, 
SEEK ALTERNATIVE TO EVACUATING PEACEKEEPERS. ALLIES MUST STILL APPROVE PLAN.

 The U.S. and French defense ministers proposed a series of measures Monday 
designed to make U.N. forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina better able to fight back 
against harassment by Serbian nationalists -- as an alternative to evacuating 
the U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense chiefs, declaring that withdrawing U.N. troops would only spread 
the war, called for consolidating existing U.N. units to give them more 
firepower and for revamping the rules of engagement to enable the troops to use 
their own heavy weapons and to shoot back more readily. 
</P>
<P>
 They also proposed setting up a humanitarian aid corridor from the Adriatic 
coast to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, and backing it up with heightened use 
of NATO warplanes to protect aid convoys and other U.N. missions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry and French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard, who outlined the proposals after a meeting here, said they hope to 
persuade other allies to embrace them at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in Brussels this week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the allies go along, the two ministers said, NATO will then take the 
measures to the U.N. command in Bosnia and recommend that it put them into 
practice. They asserted that the plan would not require any new authority from 
the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, private analysts cautioned that the series of 
measures could also heighten the potential for military conflict between the 
U.N. forces and the Serbs, embroiling the allies more deeply in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Leotard's proposal marked a sharp about-face from the French position 
expressed last week by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who hinted that France was 
about to withdraw its U.N. peacekeeping forces and argued that more aggressive 
action by NATO would only endanger them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Leotard warned that withdrawing U.N. forces would further displace 
Bosnia's civilian population, spread the conflict to neighboring countries and 
seriously undermine the credibility of both the United Nations and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 He also expressed concern that if U.N. forces were to leave Bosnia, that would 
"bring . . . Islamic forces" into the region to side with the Bosnian 
government. France is having political difficulties with Islamic governments 
and is reluctant to see their power grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "My government does not wish to see this withdrawal take place," the French 
defense minister told reporters here. " . . . We refuse to grant the 
(nationalist) Serbs the reward that they are apparently seeking and think that 
they will get (from a U.N. withdrawal)." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials stressed that the proposals -- which were drafted by Leotard -- 
were preliminary and had not yet been agreed to by other NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Leotard worked together a few months ago to draw up proposals for 
intensifying NATO air strikes, but, while NATO adopted the plan, the U.N. 
commanders never took advantage of it. Under current rules, the United Nations 
has final say in such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Leotard emphasized Monday that even under the new proposals, NATO forces still 
would have to wait for U.N. commanders to formally request air support before 
NATO warplanes would take off. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that for us is totally unthinkable and totally unacceptable 
is to carry out (NATO) air strikes without the prior agreement of the U.N. 
forces in the field," Leotard said. France has about 4,000 troops in the U.N. 
peacekeeping contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan that the two ministers outlined for strengthening U.N. peacekeeping 
forces involved these proposals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alter the rules of engagement for U.N. and NATO forces to enable them to 
fire at Serbian nationalist units if they harass or attack U.N. peacekeeping 
troops or take U.N. soldiers hostage. Under current rules, it is difficult for 
U.N. and NATO troops to return any fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use NATO air power more fully to provide close air support protection for 
U.N. supply convoys and humanitarian relief missions and to secure the Sarajevo 
airport. The warplanes would also be allowed to hit larger Serbian targets, 
such as radar installations and command posts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consolidating U.N. peacekeeping forces into larger units, to make them less 
vulnerable to Serbian attacks, redeploying them into positions that can be 
defended more easily and allowing them to use the heavy weapons they have to 
help fend off or attack Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commanders already have consolidated their forces into fewer sites. But 
some analysts say they still are too spread out to be very effective 
militarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also reiterated a promise by President Clinton to help evacuate U.N. 
peacekeeping forces if the allies decide to withdraw them. But he agreed with 
Leotard's assessment that such a move would prove counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Leotard suggested at one point that the allies could also send reinforcements 
into Bosnia if they wanted to bolster the peacekeeping forces there, but he 
conceded that at least for the moment such a proposal "does not seem like a 
very likely scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Juppe, who laced his remarks last week with criticism of the United 
States for not providing ground troops for U.N. peacekeeping missions, Leotard 
praised the Clinton Administration for what he called the "U.S. presence in the 
former Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people often forget that the United States is present in the area," 
Leotard said. He ticked off a list of places where U.S. military personnel are 
serving, including on aircraft and ships enforcing U.N. embargoes and at U.N. 
headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. More on Bosnia

 The United States and Vietnam have reached agreement on the fate of U.S. 
government properties seized when Communist forces won the Vietnam War nearly 
20 years ago, U.S. officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, initialed in Hanoi on Friday, includes the former U.S. Embassy 
in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, from whose roof helicopters lifted 
Americans and Vietnamese in a last-minute evacuation during the fall of Saigon 
on April 30, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is expected to be signed by top officials next month, clearing the 
way for the two former enemies to open diplomatic liaison offices in each 
other's capitals. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's Foreign Ministry said the two sides were aiming to open the offices 
by the end of this year, a target set by the Hanoi government months ago.

GOP GEARING UP FOR A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF U.S. FOREIGN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The incoming chairman of the Senate panel that appropriates foreign aid is 
proposing an overhaul of the U.S. foreign assistance program to dismantle the 
Agency for International Development and cut back funds for development in 
Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will become head of the Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said Monday that he 
envisions a much leaner foreign aid budget, with all areas except the Middle 
East and Europe taking a 20% cut in assistance next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of the November election was that we ought to downsize 
government, and I don't think foreign aid should be exempt," said McConnell, 
who is to take over the subcommittee when the new Congress convenes in January. 
He said the United States could no longer afford to finance "ongoing, perpetual 
entitlement programs" that do nothing to contribute to "our national security 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest changes he proposed was not in the level of foreign aid but 
in the manner in which it is doled out. McConnell is preparing legislation that 
would eliminate the Agency for International Development, the sprawling 
bureaucracy that oversees most economic aid, by moving its functions to the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 His bill would also put the Peace Corps, currently an independent entity, 
under the State Department. And it would put more emphasis on promotion of U.S. 
commercial interests abroad by consolidating the Trade Development Agency and 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation into a single entity with control 
over a greater portion of the total foreign aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
 With welfare reform a top priority of the new Republican-controlled Congress, 
McConnell said that the "guiding principle" of the foreign aid bill, which he 
will introduce in January, will be to discontinue "funding abroad for anything 
that we wouldn't fund" at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McConnell will head the subcommittee that controls foreign aid 
spending, the revisions he proposed would have to be approved by the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, which will be chaired by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional observers believed that McConnell, one of the GOP's acknowledged 
experts on foreign aid, wanted to preempt the more conservative Helms from 
defining the debate because the North Carolinian's views on the subject are too 
extreme for most Republicans. Helms said recently that one of his priorities 
next year will be to save taxpayer dollars from being poured down "foreign rat 
holes." 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell said that his reforms are meant to give foreign aid "a new lease on 
life" after the changes that have taken place in Congress since the Nov. 8 
elections and in the world since the end of the Cold War.

WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS ELIMINATING ENERGY DEPT.; POLICY: THE AGENCY IS TOLD TO 
DEVISE PLAN FOR CUTTING ITS BUDGET BY 20%. SOME PROTEST TALK OF ROUTING ITS 
NUCLEAR-RELATED FUNCTIONS TO THE PENTAGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House, seeking major budget cutbacks to help pay for a middle-income 
tax cut, has directed the Energy Department to prepare option plans for at 
least a 20% reduction in funding and possibly for complete elimination of the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a civilian agency, the Energy Department is responsible for 
development of the nation's nuclear weapons and for cleaning up the massive 
radioactive waste problems that are part of the legacy of the Cold War. But 
government sources said the department's $6-billion environmental management 
program and its $4.3-billion defense program would be hit hardest by the 
expected cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department's budget is about $18 billion a year, and by no means 
could all of that be saved even if the department were abolished. Officials 
said many of its functions -- including the environmental and weapons programs 
-- would have to be transferred to other government agencies if the department 
were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with resurgent Republicans vowing to slash taxes for middle-income 
Americans, President Clinton is under political pressure to come up with a plan 
of his own -- especially since he made middle-class tax cuts a theme of his 
1992 election campaign but shied away from the issue as President when faced 
with the realities of the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said over the weekend that he would cut taxes on the middle class if 
ways can be found to avoid increasing the deficit. That means identifying 
spending cuts for existing government programs to offset the revenues lost in a 
tax cut. Administration officials have talked in terms of a $40-billion to 
$50-billion reduction over five years; the GOP has vowed to enact far larger 
cuts but has not yet offered details of how it would pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore and budget officials involved in the search for 
spending cuts are scheduled to confer with Clinton today on the options 
prepared by various departments. The President apparently will sign off on some 
cuts in time to announce them in a speech he plans to deliver from the Oval 
Office at 6 p.m. PST Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of Energy Sue Tierney acknowledged in a news briefing 
Monday that the department was facing "painful cuts everywhere," but she 
declined to give any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a range of numbers that would take us to really the most 
bare-bones kind of government functions, in all of our mission areas from 
science, national security, energy and environmental management," Tierney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry J. Haas, an Office of Management and Budget spokesman, declined to 
comment on the directive to the Energy Department. He insisted that neither 
Clinton nor any of his advisers have issued "an across-the-board edict of any 
kind regarding the size of the department or agency budget cuts throughout the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton "is not targeting any one or any few agencies for dramatic change, but 
will consider dramatic change in quite a number of different departments and 
agencies," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials confirmed the directive to the Energy Department, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has strongly opposed suggestions that her 
department might be targeted for elimination. Tierney said that O'Leary 
welcomes "healthy discussions of whether or not the department's missions 
should be done at the department or somewhere else." But she said O'Leary 
doubted it would "save a lot of money" to transfer the department's functions 
to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that if the Energy Department were eliminated, its 
nuclear weapons-related functions would go to the Defense Department. Critics 
have argued that this would undermine a long-standing bipartisan agreement that 
stewardship of nuclear stockpiles should rest in civilian hands. 
</P>
<P>
 An Energy Department official, who declined to be named, said O'Leary urged 
Clinton and his top advisers to put more emphasis on seeking cuts in "the whole 
government rather than just willy-nilly eliminating one department." 
</P>
<P>
 A 20% cut in the department's budget, the official said, "will hurt some of 
the initiatives that President Clinton has considered priorities, such as 
environmental cleanup and defense work. It would severely limit our defense 
role of taking care of nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Several interested organizations, after hearing from energy officials that 
their department might be eliminated, sent letters of protest to Clinton on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are writing to urge you in the strongest possible terms not to abolish the 
Department of Energy or transfer its nuclear weapons-related functions to the 
Department of Defense," wrote Robert Wages, president of the Oil, Chemical & 
Atomic Workers International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union of Concerned Scientists declared that abolishing the department 
would be "a historic mistake" that would put valuable programs at risk "for 
questionable political or economic benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the White House -- caught between the fiscal rock of the federal 
deficit and the political hard place of an unhappy electorate -- has little 
choice but to consider significant spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 No final decisions have been made, said a senior White House official, "but we 
all know the public remains dissatisfied with how the federal government 
works."

 As Michele Mikuta watched it unfold on television, she knew instantly her 
husband was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A news bulletin said a USAir jetliner had crashed in a swirling snowstorm at 
La Guardia Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In a jag of panic, her thoughts swirled too: Her husband, Thomas, would never 
see their toddler grow up, would never witness the birth of the second child 
she now carried. The children would never know their father. She had lost her 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
 When rescue workers finished counting the dead from USAir Flight 405 on March 
22, 1992, there were 27 people, among them, Thomas Mikuta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, you sit there with hope, but you know what you know," Mikuta of 
Cos Cob, Conn., said. "I sat on the couch for hours just trapped in my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with her daughters, "Tommy was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
I've never been so happy as I was with him," she said. "He was just a great 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
 In its report on the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board found the 
Federal Aviation Administration partially to blame for failing to act on safety 
recommendations made years prior. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir Flight 405 was the latest in a series of crashes involving aircraft 
that, records show, were particularly susceptible to control problems with ice 
on their wings. Two months after the crash, the FAA convened a worldwide 
conference on the issue of "de-icing." The agency instituted many of the 
procedural changes that had been urged for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the crash happened because of a problem that might have been prevented 
"keeps the anger there," Mikuta said. "You just hope and pray that they just 
get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year, she plans to go to Hawaii, where she and Thomas honeymooned, 
to finish a book of memories of her husband that she will pass on to her 
daughters. She has also asked friends to write down their memories of Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though still quite young, the children recognize the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "As they get older," Mikuta said, "they get more aware of differences. Why 
doesn't she have a daddy? Why is Mommy sad? Why is Mommy crying?" 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Kenneth and Charolette Combs' three children can't hear enough stories about 
their parents these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love to talk about their mom and dad," said the children's uncle, Bob 
Combs, of Anchorage, Alaska. "They want to know more about them -- what we did 
with them when we were younger." 
</P>
<P>
 The Combses were among 18 people killed in the crash of a Northwest Airlink 
plane flying from Minneapolis to Hibbing, Minn., on Dec. 2, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had flown from their home in Minnesota to attend their niece's 
wedding when the commuter plane went down near the Hibbing airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pilot was faulted, the NTSB concluded: "FAA oversight of the 
airline was inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB noted this wasn't the first time the FAA's inspections program had 
been found to be a contributing factor in an accident. "The safety board has 
addressed the subject of inadequate FAA oversight and surveillance in numerous 
accident reports and safety recommendations over the past 10 years," the board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Combs children continue to live in their parents' home and are looked 
after by various relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how sad that was," Bob Combs said. "I have his picture on the 
wall and I think about it every day. . . . It's always there."

 Doug Hainje was driving back to his home in Dell Rapids, S.D., with a friend 
when the radio crackled to life with the awful news. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been a small plane crash near Dubuque, Iowa. Among the eight dead 
were the governor of South Dakota, George S. Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Hainje, 39, didn't give it much thought. But as he and his friend 
motored along, more details on the crash trickled out. Finally, the names of 
the dead were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the name "Roger Hainje" was read, Doug's friend clicked off the radio and 
the two sat in stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Doug Hainje's 43-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a matter of days, Hainje would find out that six weeks before the April 
19, 1993, crash the NTSB had warned the FAA that the propellers used on 
Mitsubishi MU-2 aircraft could cause a "catastrophic accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB's warning was actually the third admonishment in seven months and 
followed a similar incident in New York two years before. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said the special inspections the NTSB was seeking were not warranted. 
But the agency changed its mind 10 days after the South Dakota accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting a little easier," Doug Hainje said. "But it's still hard. It 
will always be a part of our lives."

 With Daniel Jameson gone, "something is missing in the house," his wife, 
Polly, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, who worked for the FAA, was traveling with two other agency employees 
when their plane slammed into a mountain near Winchester, Va., on Oct. 26, 
1993. All three were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 When two close friends rapped on her door, she knew the news she and her 
16-year-old son were about to receive wasn't going to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw them come to the door I knew something serious had happened," 
Polly Jameson of Ocean City, N.J., said. "They wanted my son and me to hear it 
from someone close and not from an impersonal call or on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to realize he wasn't coming home. There were times when I still 
expected him to call and say to pick him up from the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was just as disturbing for her to hear what had caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB concluded that the crash happened, in part, because the FAA had 
shoddy flight operations for its own fleet. Moreover, the safety board found, 
the FAA itself had discovered these shortcomings four years before, following a 
crash in 1988, but had not acted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the crash that killed Daniel Jameson, who was 50, the agency 
has promised to make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try thinking about the funny, silly stuff," Polly Jameson said. "My husband 
loved to cook. On weekends he took over the kitchen. Which was fine, because I 
could burn water."

HOW THE FAA HANDLED AIRCRAFT DE-ICING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to the National Transportation Safety Board, seven U.S. accidents 
that killed at least 100 people during the past 12 years were caused at least 
in part by a buildup of ice on aircraft wings. Despite repeated warnings that 
some planes were more susceptible to icing, it took years and numerous fatal 
crashes before the Federal Aviation Administration changed de-icing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 27, 1968: Ozark Airlines DC-9 crashes on takeoff in Sioux City, Iowa; 3 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 14, 1973: McDonnell Douglas reports several DC-9 "control problems 
that may be related to heavy and unexpected airframe icing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 26, 1974: Turkish Airlines Fokker F-28 crashes; 66 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 14, 1980: NTSB makes de-icing-related recommendations in a letter to 
the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 * February, 1981: FAA begins a study of problem, but stops for lack of 
resources and support. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 24, 1981: NTSB, as a result of a special study on aircraft icing 
avoidance, makes four additional recommendations to FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 13, 1982: Air Florida Boeing 737 crashes in Washington, D.C.; 78 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 28, 1982: NTSB makes 10 more safety recommendations to FAA to prevent 
icing-related accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 10, 1982: NTSB says de-icing problems with Boeing 737s "were first 
reported over 10 years ago," but preventive actions taken by both manufacturer 
and FAA have been limited to dissemination of advisory information. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 17, 1982: FAA issues advisory emphasizing danger of icy wings and 
suggesting practices for flight crews. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 4, 1983: NTSB letter to FAA says it is "unrealistic to expect" flight 
crews to detect small accumulations of ice or snow at night or during times of 
poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 5, 1985: After DC-9 freight liner crashes in Philadelphia, NTSB 
recommends that DC-9 flight manuals emphasize hazards of even a small amount of 
wing ice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 27, 1986: Airborne Express issues warning that "special precautions" 
must be taken when preparing a DC-9 for departure in freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 15, 1987: Continental Airlines DC-9 crashes in Denver; 28 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 29, 1988: FAA, having learned that advisory issued after Air Florida 
crash was not widely distributed before Continental crash, reissues advisory. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 10, 1989: Air Ontario Fokker F-28 crashes in Dryden, Ontario; 24 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 17, 1991: NTSB issues third series of recommendations on de-icing after 
DC-9 cargo flight crashes in Cleveland; 2 dead.

 The Orange County transportation authority -- the largest contributor to the 
paralyzed investment fund -- said that bus and rail service will continue, as 
will most major projects. But the authority has postponed a key Interstate 5 
widening project in Anaheim. WATER

 The Orange County Water District asked a bankruptcy judge for permission to 
withdraw from the county's shriveled investment fund. Without the money, the

</P>
<P>
 Most residents are frightened about the impact of the crisis and blame 
government officials as well as Wall Street firms for the financial collapse, 
an Orange County Times Poll found. Four in 10 residents said they were "very 
angry" about the actions of local officials that preceded the county's 
financial crisis. STATE STUDY

 State and local education officials came to a tentative agreement with the 
county to segregate all money earmarked for public schools from the county 
treasury. But administrators in individual districts said they remain worried 
about making payrolls and paying bills. Schools were expected to feel the 
biggest hit because so much of their money was tied up in the Orange County 
portfolio.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FALLOUT STILL SPREADING ACROSS U.S.; FINANCE: 
INVESTORS FLEE TEXAS FUND. OHIO COUNTY AND GEORGIA UTILITY SUFFER FINANCIAL 
LOSSES.

<P>
 The impact from Orange County's financial crisis continued to ripple through 
the rest of the country Monday as some local governments had to deal with fresh 
threats to their fiscal stability. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, investors continued to flock from a short-term investment pool run 
by the state treasurer's office for more than 1,300 different municipalities 
after it became clear that the $3.7 billion TexPool fund borrowed heavily to 
invest in securities. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, withdrawals doubled to $655 million even as the government tried to 
soothe local investors. The state denied that its strategies were the same as 
Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio, Cuyahoga County officials have outlined a plan to slash 11%, or more 
than $35 million, from next year's county budget, after losing $115 million on 
a $880-million investment fund that borrowed heavily for its investments. 
Spending will be frozen for three years after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment pool included scores of suburban governments and public 
agencies such as libraries and sewer districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, a company that jointly owns four 
power plants, told investors it will be able to absorb a more than $40-million 
loss in its $907-million investment portfolio, which included risky derivative 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasuries apparently free of problems are also trying to calm investors. 
Massachusetts, which runs a $1.3-billion money-market fund, mailed a letter to 
investors that reassures them their money remains safe and secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them there are no derivatives and we don't leverage the fund's 
assets, which is exactly the type of risky behavior that led to the problems on 
the West Coast," said Eric Fehrnstrom, assistant treasurer for Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Humboldt County in Northern California, about to issue a bond for 
a jail, estimate that they'll have to pay $50,000 more now in bond insurance 
because of the fallout from Orange County's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, the day's withdrawals totaled more than 19% of TexPool's assets as 
state Treasurer Martha Whitehead sought to reassure the pool's governmental 
investors that the fund is sound and unrelated to the troubled investments in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met our commitments to TexPool members today," Whitehead said. "We'll make 
those commitments tomorrow, next week, next month -- whenever a TexPool 
participant seeks to make a withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
 TexPool is a 4-year-old investment fund run by the state treasury. It serves 
1,300 school districts, cities, counties and other local government bodies in 
the state by investing their tax revenues and paying them a rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool was created in 1990 to give smaller governmental units access to the 
same kind of money-management services large cities have used. 
</P>
<P>
 Only $15 million was deposited in the fund Monday, making the net drop $640 
million. On Friday, withdrawals totaled $348 million and deposits $42 million, 
for a net drop of $306 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool had total assets of $3.6 billion before Friday. As of Monday 
afternoon, that total was down to about $2.7 billion, said Monte Williams, a 
spokesman for the treasurer.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BILL WOULD TIGHTEN RULES ON GOVERNMENT INVESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County lawmaker on Monday introduced legislation designed to limit 
the sort of risky investment that fueled the county's current financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said his bill would effectively 
reverse the decade-long trend that has seen the state pass increasingly lenient 
laws letting local governments put money in chancy investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, the laws have been changed and it allowed Orange County to 
invest in riskier investments than they should have," Pringle said. "There 
should be no gambling at all with taxpayers' dollars. Unfortunately, the way 
the system is, that can happen. It's got to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle's measure would require local government portfolio managers to follow 
the strict requirements currently used by the Local Agency Investment fund run 
by the California treasurer's office. The state investment fund holds the funds 
of 2,200 local agencies and has been lauded as a model of fiscal 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pringle measure would go even further than a bill recently introduced by 
Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), which would place restrictions on some 
high-stakes investment tools. Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has promised to 
introduce a third measure calling for stronger oversight of local government 
investment funds, stricter reporting requirements and other prohibitions that 
are similar to those Pringle has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle's bill would limit derivative investments, reverse-repurchase 
agreements and other investment tools used in the Orange County investment 
portfolio. It would restrict derivatives to 5% of a fund's portfolio and 
reverse repurchases to 10%. Currently, there are no limits on either. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would also bar local governments from borrowing money solely to 
invest the proceeds in an investment pool. That tactic of borrowing money in 
hopes of gleaning a big investment return has caused problems for several 
school districts and cities in Orange County, which have seen their investments 
crumble and put their principle at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from restricting certain investments, the bill calls for greater 
disclosure of how government money is invested by a portfolio manager and the 
rate of return. It would require preparation of an investment plan showing how 
money has been distributed and what sort of return is being generated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these restrictions had been in place, I don't think Orange County would 
have been where it is today," Pringle said. "With these types of protections, 
you can still invest the funds, receive a responsible return and protect the 
taxpayers' money."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NONPROFIT GROUPS AGONIZE OVER FUNDS; SOCIAL 
SERVICES: SUPERVISORS ASSURE MONEY FOR ESSENTIAL HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY 
NEEDS -- BUT GIVE FEW DETAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Private health and social services agencies pressed for details Monday about 
whether money crucial to their operations will be frozen as a result of Orange 
County's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors allayed some concerns late in the day by 
saying it will continue to pay for essential health, welfare and safety 
services -- including foster care, hospital care and indigent medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those services were not described in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm a little more comfortable than I was," said George Hood, director 
of Child Or Parental Emergency Services, a Santa Ana group-home service for 
abused youngsters. "We were waiting for some instruction or insight, and it 
would appear that (our) revenue streams still are pretty much intact and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, known as COPES, receives 90% of its $1.4-million annual 
budget from the county to operate four homes for 24 abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Hood and other administrators of nonprofit agencies, 
including those that receive state or federal funds funneled through the 
county, said they were not getting information from the county about whether 
they would be paid for services billed before the county's Dec. 6 bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several agencies said they had heard nothing from local officials and feared 
that all or much of their funding would be frozen, along with other county 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects "will range from limited to very dramatic," depending on which 
funds are delayed and for how long, said Kevin Meehan, executive director of 
Orange County Youth and Family Services, a nonprofit agency whose services 
range from counseling victims of child abuse to housing adult offenders in the 
county's work furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan said he is trying to remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 At his agency, he said, "we try to teach people . . . not to worry about 
things beyond their control. We'll see how it works out." 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan said his agency generally receives about $150,000 of its $250,000 
monthly budget from county sources, so any delay would be painful. The agency 
is owed $200,000 for services provided before the bankruptcy filing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Burby, executive director of the county Mental Health Assn., said her 
agency has a $600,000 contract with the county to operate two daytime activity 
centers for homeless, mentally ill adults, and it is determined to keep them 
open regardless of the crisis. "We're committed to providing services one way 
or another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nonprofit service providers said Monday that they fear that state and 
federal payments made through the county will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said those concerns are unwarranted. Distribution of such 
"pass-through" funds will be uninterrupted, county spokesman Jim Bourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth of the matter is that nobody knows, and nobody is giving us 
anything official," said Joan Cobin, executive director of Laguna Beach 
Community Clinic, which is awaiting about $65,000 in state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is essential to the clinic, which has a staff of 28 and operates on 
a budget of $100,000 a month, Cobin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nonprofits don't operate on much of a margin," she said, "and we're in a 
worse place than most people. We just moved into a new building last February. 
Right now, payday . . . is in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hood of COPES said he is confident that the county will view his 
organization's work as essential. "All of our kids are preschool-age victims of 
child abuse," he said. "We're caring for them, and if we don't have the money 
to do that, we as an agency -- and as a county -- have a serious problem."

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; DAXON ARRIVES WITH A RESUME OF SUCCESSFUL TURNAROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.R. MOEHRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man asked to help save Orange County is a kind of financial firefighter 
with 20 years of front-line experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Daxon, 46, former state auditor and inspector of Oklahoma, has 
rescued government agencies, high-tech companies and a chaotic Resolution Trust 
Corp. processing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he will tackle the Orange County crisis, leading a team of accountants 
from Arthur Andersen & Co., where Daxon was an adviser on government audit and 
account issues from 1983 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected Oklahoma's state auditor in 1979, Daxon inherited an office on 
probation with the federal government and faced a cutoff of all federal money 
because of shoddy audit practices. 
</P>
<P>
 After one year under Daxon, the office was taken off probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon tried to build on his political success with a 1982 bid for governor. 
Running as a Reagan Republican, he was easily beaten by the incumbent, Democrat 
George Nigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, Daxon combined a passion for government with a 
penchant for numbers. Repeatedly, he warned that Nigh's spending policies were 
jeopardizing the treasury. When his warnings went unheeded, he returned to his 
career as a certified public accountant, moved his family to Virginia and 
signed on with Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Daxon managed an investment partnership that made rescue loans 
to high-tech companies. He also took control of a widely criticized Resolution 
Trust processing center, clearing up six months of unreconciled accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get to the bottom of this and find out what the problem is," he 
said Monday, shortly after his hiring was announced. "We've got to sit down and 
start asking questions. It'll be a while before we have any answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon, who has a bachelor's degree in economics from the Oklahoma State 
University, said Orange County's crisis dwarfs most financial crises, but he 
said he and his team of accountants are up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 As his first formal act, Daxon gave approval to the supervisors' efforts at 
freezing spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with the action that the board took today," he said. "They 
clearly want to do what's best for the county -- get control of the situation 
and turn it around."

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; OCTA OUTLINES PLAN FOR NEXT 100 DAYS; TRANSPORTATION: THE 
AGENCY SEEKS TO REASSURE BONDHOLDERS THAT IT WILL PAY INTEREST. BUS OPERATIONS 
AND MOST FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WILL CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though at least one major freeway project will be delayed, the Orange 
County Transportation Authority launched a 100-day plan Monday to reassure 
jittery investors that the agency will go forward with other freeway 
construction, continue bus and rail operations and still make a $46-million 
bond interest payment in February. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA Chief Executive Officer Stan Oftelie said that construction on five major 
freeway projects will move ahead as planned, but that other projects still in 
the design stage will be put on hold, including the widening of the northbound 
Santa Ana Freeway through Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the agency's strategy relies heavily on assurances given by state and 
federal officials that transportation funds already approved for local projects 
will be distributed early so the transit agency can continue operating while a 
large chunk of its operating funds are tied up in Orange County's bankrupt 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie announced the operational plan, which was hammered out by the transit 
agency's staff over the weekend, at a somber board of directors meeting, where 
members spent more time discussing strategy behind closed doors then they did 
in open session. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also voted to hire the Los Angeles-based law firm of Sulmeyer, 
Kupetz, Baumann & Rothman to represent the agency in Orange County's bankruptcy 
proceedings. OCTA has more than $1 billion invested in the county's portfolio, 
which was ordered frozen by a bankruptcy judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $46 million needed to pay bond holders by Feb. 15, the 
transportation authority will need $28 million to continue bus and rail 
operations during the next 100 days and $17 million to fund the 
agency-sponsored freeway projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said that the transportation authority is counting on the already 
approved early release of state and federal funds for Orange County to make the 
plan work. He said the strategy is designed to reassure the investment 
community and the public that OCTA is "moving prudently" to work its way out of 
the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program we outlined is very heavily dependent on state and federal funds. 
But I'm comfortable that we'll get the money," Oftelie said. "We're not asking 
for new entitlements, but simply claiming money that's already earmarked for 
us. I'm confident that we will get the cooperation of the state and federal 
governments." 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency is scheduled to receive $16 million in payments from the 
state next spring. However, state transportation officials have agreed to hurry 
the money along before the next interest payment on the bonds is due in two 
months, said Oftelie. State officials could not be reached Monday for 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 The $16 million will be used with $30 million expected from Measure M funds 
before the end of February to pay bondholders, Oftelie said. Measure M, passed 
in 1991, authorized a half-cent sales tax in Orange County to pay for 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said the transit agency has received inquiries from nervous investor 
groups worried about the scheduled February interest payment. Although most of 
the bonds are insured, Oftelie said the transportation authority has obtained a 
line of credit from the Industrial Bank of Japan to make sure bond holders are 
paid in the event that the $16 million payment from the state is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've secured a protected source of revenue to make sure there is no loss," 
Oftelie said. "We can meet our obligation to investors and still provide bus 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese bank provided the agency with a $78-million loan last week so it 
could pay off notes that were due last Wednesday, a source close to the bank 
said Monday. The loan was made available under terms of a line of credit that 
the OCTA has had with Industrial Bank of Japan since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The source indicated that the bank did not view the $78-million short-term 
loan as risky because it is secured with certain collateral, which was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, federal officials are willing to send within 45 days $8.8 million 
in transportation funds that the transit agency normally would receive in May, 
Oftelie said. The federal money would be used along with $1.4 million in 
property tax revenue that was due Monday and $17.4 million in state gas tax 
funds to pay for bus and rail operations for the next 100 days, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation authority also expects to have available the $17 million 
needed to continue construction on the following freeway projects: 
</P>
<P>
 * Widening of El Toro Y, where the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways meet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Car-pool lanes on the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interstate 5 car-pool lanes in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the interchange of the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways and the 
interchange of the Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove freeways -- the so-called 
Orange Crush -- is being funded by the state and these projects are not 
affected by the county's financial troubles, said OCTA spokesman John 
Standiford. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation authority, which operates on a $625-million annual budget, 
provides bus service for about 55,000 passengers, who take more than 43 million 
trips each year. It also provides Metrolink service for 2,500 commuters, 
Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, chairman of the transit agency's board of 
directors, praised the 100-day operational plan as "positively aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff has identified 100 days of essential action that has to be taken," 
Vasquez said. "Action will be taken in increments." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Vasquez warned that "we haven't seen the full assessment" of the 
county's financial crisis and how it might affect long-term plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said that he still does not know how the transit agency's $1 billion 
investment in the county's portfolio has fared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The least optimistic expectation is that we will lose everything. The most 
optimistic is that we will lose only the interest. At this point, your guess is 
as good as mine," said Oftelie. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the OCTA board appointed Oftelie as the agency's treasurer, 
replacing Robert L. Citron, who was treasurer for the transit agency as well as 
the county before his resignation two weeks ago.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; OF LAWYERS, RESOLUTIONS -- AND ANGER; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS: 
CITY AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS TAKE A MEASURED, CAUTIOUS APPROACH. SOME HIRE LEGAL 
HELP, OTHERS PASS LEGISLATION. AND THE IRE IS UNIVERSAL.

 A week after Orange County filed for bankruptcy, a dozen local government 
agencies met Monday night to plot strategy for responding to the ongoing 
financial fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hired attorneys. Others passed resolutions. And for some, it was just a 
chance to vent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable that one person could create such a catastrophe," said 
Anthony R. Selvaggi, during his last meeting as mayor of Los Alamitos. "It's 
mind-boggling that this thing could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most agencies took a measured, cautious approach: 
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington Beach officials met in closed session with a bankruptcy attorney 
from the San Francisco law firm Poppin & Shier and a financial adviser from the 
consulting firm Stone and Youngberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will postpone all capital projects not under way, continue its hiring 
freeze and keep operating expenses to a minimum, meeting payroll with money not 
tied up in the county pool, officials said. "We are all waiting for the dust to 
settle from the financial earthquake that has shaken Orange County," Mayor 
Victor Leipzig said. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Palma and Seal Beach each took an even smaller step, simply authorizing 
city administrators to join other cities that have already hired a private 
bankruptcy attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no interruption of payroll, no interruption of employees and 
every project now in motion will continue," La Palma Mayor Wally D. Linn said 
at the city's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Mayor George Brown, though, worried about the expense of fighting 
on the legal front. "There is no way in God's world that we can afford to hire 
the kinds of attorneys they are talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Alamitos, City Manager Robert C. Dunek assured council members that 
the city has no outstanding debts, and that investments from other funds should 
offset any losses from the city's $2.2 million now frozen in the county pool. 
But Dunek said local street improvement projects would likely be slowed because 
they are being funded by the Orange County Transportation Authority, the 
largest of the pool's 187 investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joining several other school districts, Brea-Olinda Unified trustees passed 
a resolution urging the county to segregate all incoming funds earmarked for 
schools, and discussed becoming part of a group of school districts represented 
by the law firm Best, Best & Krieger. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board also voted to send a letter to their representative on the 
County Board of Supervisors, Gaddi H. Vasquez, urging him for better ongoing 
communication during the crisis. "I just think that Gaddi has been a phantom," 
Assistant Supt. Gary Goff said, "and I think we should put him on the spot and 
ask him for help." 
</P>
<P>
 * Capistrano Unified trustees met in closed session late Monday to consider a 
resolution similar to Brea-Olinda's and to discuss joining with Saddleback 
Valley Unified in hiring a bankruptcy attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the meeting, several school board members hesitated before 
approving a normally routine certification of the school district's budget and 
sending it on to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not willing to put my name on something that says we can meet our 
obligations when we don't know what's happening," Capistrano Unified trustee 
Crystal Kochendorfer said.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; SOME COUNTY EMPLOYEES FEAR SAVINGS MAY BE IN DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 100 county employees, worried that Orange County's financial fiasco 
could soon become their own, have halted payments to the county's retirement 
savings program in the days since the bankruptcy filing, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my children's whole future, and I don't know if they're ever going to 
see it," said Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson, who said she has switched 
her future payments to another savings plan outside the county and is trying to 
get whatever she can out of the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what's going to happen," said Anderson, a county employee for 
nearly two decades who has always put the maximum allowed into the retirement 
savings fund, which is similar to a 401k plan. "It now looks like I could have 
just taken that money to Vegas -- that's what the Board of Supervisors and 
(resigned Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L.) Citron did." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people participate in the county-run savings plan, in which 
employees can place up to $7,500 a year tax-free, and double that amount for 
the three years immediately preceding their retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees can retrieve money they have had automatically taken from their 
paychecks and put into the account only when they retire or move to another 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund contains $80 million, according to senior accountant Suzanne Luster. 
Although only $3 million of that money was directly invested in the county's 
failed pool, many employees worry that all of it will be considered "county 
assets" available to creditors because of last week's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a huge percentage of people, but it's much more than we normally 
have," Luster said of the 100 employees who have called her office during the 
past week to stop their automatic payments into the retirement fund. "A lot of 
them are saying, 'I think I'm going to stop it for now, I can always start up 
again, can't I?' I think they're taking a wait-and-see attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Monday that they are unsure how the bankruptcy will 
affect the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, two of the county's five supervisors are among those poised to be 
most immediately affected by what happens to the fund, as they are due to 
retire in January. Thomas F. Riley, the board's chairman, has $100,000 tied up 
in the fund; Harriett M. Wieder has an undisclosed sum invested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned, of course, but there isn't a great deal I can do about it 
until I know something. I can't go off half-cocked," Riley's wife, Emma Jane, 
said Monday. "I get very annoyed with everybody trying to groan, moan and 
figure out what's going to happen without even thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to last year's annual report from the deferred compensation plan, 
the $80 million was invested in a variety of short, medium and long-term notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The county offers a second place to put retirement funds, and many employees, 
including Anderson, are now considering switching their savings to the 
Columbus, Ohio-based Public Employees Benefits Services Corp., hoping that 
because it is run outside the county it will not be affected by the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they're telling us it's safe, we know from reading the contract 
that the creditors can attach it in dire emergencies. This is a dire 
emergency," said Deputy Public Defender Mindy Graves, who has put money in the 
Ohio-based fund for three years. "They're talking about layoffs, they're 
talking about salary cuts, they're talking about losing benefits. There are a 
lot of rumors flying around, but at this point we're all hoping for the best, 
hoping for a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees who put off saving for the future are now breathing an ironic 
sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was postponing getting involved in (the retirement plan) until January. I'm 
quite relieved," said Stewart Hicks, a deputy district attorney in the writs 
and appeals section who has worked for the county for eight years.

GOP SEEKS MORATORIUM ON NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS; POLICY: NEW REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS JOIN FORCES TO PRESS THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO BAN 
ISSUING ANY NEW RULES FOR 100 DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The new Republican leaders of the House and Senate, joining forces for the 
first time on a high-profile legislative issue, called on the Clinton 
Administration Monday not to issue any new federal regulations during the first 
100 days of the 104th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP proposal would take away one of the executive branch's most potent 
powers at a time when there is significant political momentum for legislative 
measures that would roll back federal regulations and bar new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to the White House on Monday, incoming House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.) and his Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), 
urged President Clinton to issue an executive order, effective immediately, 
that would impose a moratorium on new federal rules that govern everything from 
air pollution to airline travel to banking transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the House and Senate leaders asked Clinton to direct Cabinet 
secretaries to rout out unnecessary or inefficient regulations already on the 
books and provide Congress with the internal analyses supporting its 
rule-making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokeswoman said it was too early for the White House to react 
to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take a look at it -- obviously we'll take a careful look at anything 
that comes from the congressional leadership," said White House Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers. "But we don't have any response to it at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-day period coincides with a Republican timetable for acting on a range 
of promised legislation designed, among other things, to lighten the regulatory 
burden imposed on the economy by Washington. Republicans on Monday cited 
private estimates suggesting that abiding by all federal regulations costs 
American industry between $588 billion and $860 billion annually and 
constitutes a "hidden tax" that imposes an "enormous burden on our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed moratorium appeared designed to thwart many agencies' plans to 
bypass what they see as a new, Republican-dominated Congress hostile to 
strictures on businesses. Many agencies had hoped to move quickly to tighten 
some public health and safety protections through the issuance of regulations, 
which are interpretations of laws, rather than ask Congress to reform the laws 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most controversial regulatory proposals in the works, the Food 
and Drug Administration has been drafting regulations that could affect the 
lucrative tobacco industry by defining nicotine as a drug. At the same time, 
the Environmental Protection Agency has said it would propose new regulations 
to assure the purity of drinking water, and Interior Department officials have 
discussed ways to tighten environmental rules on the mining industry through 
the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said that any moratorium should exclude regulations that 
"respond to emergencies such as those that pose an imminent danger to human 
health or safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans, flexing their new political muscle, said they believed 
Clinton would have little choice but to take them up on their challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (members of the Clinton Administration) see change coming and reforms 
bigger than they anticipated having to consider and say: 'The ground is 
shifting beneath us. We'd better reinvent government more,' " said Sen. Thad 
Cochran (R-Miss.), one of eight GOP congressional leaders who signed the 
letter. "It seems we ought to explore some ways to work together to meet the 
objectives the President is now talking about. . . . We're suggesting something 
he may very well be able to do or want to do, judging by his recent 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders' bold gesture came as House and Senate lawmakers prepared a raft 
of proposals designed to roll back regulation. That objective is one of the 
House Republicans' "contract with America" items, and is expected to be a major 
theme among Republican presidential candidates in the coming election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said Dole and Gingrich, who have had strained relations in the past, 
had joined forces to press for the moratorium "because this is such a high 
priority."

ACCORD REACHED IN RACIALLY TORN SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A settlement has been reached to resolve discrimination complaints at an 
Alabama school district where a principal threatened to cancel a prom if an 
interracial couple attended, the Justice Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached by the Randolph County school district, a group of 
county residents and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district agreed to create a non-discriminatory discipline policy 
and to set up a committee to enforce unbiased personnel rules. The district 
also agreed to ensure that minorities are not steered into less challenging 
programs or deterred from certain extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's intervention followed reports that high school Principal 
Hulond Humphries made racial remarks and told a students he would call off the 
prom if an interracial couple planned to attend. The school burned down in a 
suspicious fire in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement does not address the fate of Humphries, who was temporarily 
reassigned. Hearings on his future are to begin Jan. 10.

NEARLY 50% OF 12TH GRADERS LINKED TO DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of resurging drug use by young Americans, an authoritative 
national survey released Monday found that nearly half of all high school 
seniors have tried illicit drugs -- an increase of 3.2 percentage points over 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest increase was in marijuana use, with the number of 12th graders 
who use the drug daily jumping to 3.6%, up by half from the 1993 level, 
according to the 20th annual survey by the University of Michigan's Institute 
for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are losing precious ground we had gained," said Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. The survey, funded by HHS' National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, tracked an expansion of drug use by young Americans into the late 1970s, 
a substantial decline lasting through 1991, and a resurgence since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala, joined by Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and federal drug czar 
Lee P. Brown, blamed "drug glorification messages" for much of the increase and 
said that the primary cause is that "fewer young people believe that marijuana 
is harmful." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the 
pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are OK," Shalala said. Displaying 
T-shirts bearing pro-drug use slogans and symbols that her staff purchased in 
the Georgetown neighborhood where she lives, Shalala said: "Increasingly, drug 
glorification messages are creeping back into our popular culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd D. Johnston, the survey's principal investigator, said there also has 
been a decline in peer disapproval of drug. "If the softening of attitudes and 
peer norms continues unabated, we can expect to see continued increases in drug 
use among our children," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said that clear scientific evidence shows "marijuana is a dangerous 
drug that can have acute and hazardous effects, including the impairment of 
learning, memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills, including 
skills needed to drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless young people are educated to the dangers, the problem will grow 
rapidly, Riley said. Nearly 7 million more young people will enter the nation's 
school system over the next 10 years, a 14% increase. The number of 14- to 
17-year-olds will jump 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for trouble is enormous," Riley said. "We need to turn around 
this new 'no sweat' attitude about drugs that seems to be gaining hold among 
some of our young people." 
</P>
<P>
 While use of marijuana has changed the most markedly in the 1990s, other 
illicit drugs -- including LSD and other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimulants, 
barbiturates and, this year, cocaine and crack -- rose gradually as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most disturbing is that for the third year in a row, we are seeing 
statistically significant increases in marijuana use for 8th grade students," 
Shalala said. "We're talking about 13 year olds." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related report, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration reported that drug-related emergency room cases increased 8% 
last year over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The data, compiled by the Drug Abuse Warning Network, showed a 31% increase in 
heroin-related emergency room visits, a 22% increase in those tied to marijuana 
and hashish and a 53% increase in "speed," or methamphetamine cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report suggests that we continue to have a large group of aging habitual 
drug users who are experiencing more and more drug-related medical problems 
and, as a result, have become dependent on hospital emergency rooms for medical 
services," said Nelba Chavez, administrator of the substance abuse agency.

JUSTICES ALLOW VETERANS TO SEEK DISABILITY FROM VA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a $1-billion setback for the government, the Supreme Court ruled Monday 
that veterans who emerge injured or paralyzed from a Veterans Administration 
hospital are entitled to disability pay, even if the hospital itself was not at 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 9-0 vote, the justices reversed a 60-year-old regulation in which the 
veterans agency said it would not pay benefits unless a patient was injured 
because of "negligence, carelessness (or) lack of proper skill" by VA doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is good news for about 8,000 vets who claim they suffered because 
of their treatment at a VA hospital, but were unable to show the hospital was 
at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's super news," said Jerry Lodl, a 60-year-old Korean War veteran from 
Ventura who was paralyzed after a 1967 back operation at the VA hospital in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodl said his claims for disability benefits have been rejected because he 
could not prove the hospital erred in treating him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's ruling, the high court said veterans such as Lodl are due 
disability benefits because the original 1924 law establishing such benefits 
gave veterans an open-ended, no-fault entitlement to compensation if they 
"suffered an injury, or an aggravation of an injury, as the result of 
hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 There is not "so much as a word about fault on the part of VA" in the law, 
said Justice David H. Souter, speaking for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling was striking on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the conservative-leaning court is inclined to defer to government 
agencies, especially when a large amount of money is at stake. In this case, 
government lawyers argued it is absurd to force the Veterans Affairs Department 
to pay compensation for an injury its doctors did not cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, all the justices concluded the "plain language" of the law 
required the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the ruling demonstrates the impact of a 1988 law that, for the first 
time, gave veterans a chance to appeal agency rulings in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose when Fred Gardner, a Korea veteran, entered a VA hospital in 
Texas in 1986 for treatment of leg pain that was unrelated to a service injury. 
After back surgery, he emerged from the hospital with continuing leg pain. He 
sought benefits for a partial disability, but was turned down because of the VA 
regulation requiring him to show the hospital was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 But the still relatively new Court of Veterans Appeals reversed the agency's 
decision and threw out its regulation. Clinton Administration lawyers appealed 
to the high court in the case of Jesse Brown vs. Fred Gardner, 93-1128, and 
estimated that a ruling in the veterans' favor would cost the agency an extra 
$1 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruled that states can tax income that people receive from some mutual funds 
that invest in U.S. government securities. Normally, these securities cannot be 
taxed by states, but the court said it was different if mutual funds buy the 
securities in "repurchase agreements." Nebraska vs. Loewenstein, 93-823. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let stand a ruling that makes paramedics eligible for overtime pay. Federal 
law says workers must receive overtime after 40 hours a week, but makes an 
exception for firefighters and law enforcement personnel. In an unsuccessful 
appeal in Chicago vs. Alex, 94-704, the city said its paramedics should be 
considered firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to hear a further appeal from anti-abortion activists who claimed 
they could not be sued under the federal anti-racketeering act. (Scheidler vs. 
Delaware Woman's Health Organization, 94-716).

 Three people were feared drowned Monday as floods described as the worst in 
recent history ravaged western Scotland. The homes of more than 100 were still 
under water. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 1/2 inches of rain fell over the weekend at Glasgow Airport, the most 
since record keeping was started in 1888, the Glasgow Weather Center reported. 
It said flooding was the worst in at least 106 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 17-year-old boys were missing after their car was swept off a bridge over 
the swollen River Kelvin, north of Glasgow, Strathclyde police said. A third 
person escaped before the car went over. 
</P>
<P>
 Police called off a search for a man feared swept away by the River Nith at 
Dumfries, in southwestern Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, police and soldiers launched a huge cleanup operation, and 
officials called for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said some areas were under six feet of water. Water pouring from 
blocked sewers added to the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of travelers were halted by flooded roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst-hit area was Renfrewshire in western Scotland, where more than 300 
people were evacuated -- many by boat. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the flooding Sunday, 645 people were evacuated from their 
homes in and around Glasgow, police said. About 100 were still homeless Monday 
night.

22 FROM SUNKEN CARGO SHIP STILL SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rescuers, refusing to abandon hope, combed 3,000 square miles of the blustery 
North Atlantic Monday for 22 crew members from a Ukrainian-registered cargo 
ship that sank Friday in a violent storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain optimistic that there will be more survivors out there," said U.S. 
Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Uhlenhopp, adding that bad weather remained a 
major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're facing 15-foot seas and 40-knot winds," Uhlenhopp said. "Visibility and 
weather are just very poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Two survivors have been rescued. Seven bodies have been spotted in the water 
by merchant vessels, four of which have been recovered, Uhlenhopp added. 
</P>
<P>
 The 450-foot Salvador Allende, with 31 crew members aboard, sank Friday 
morning 1,200 miles east of the New Jersey coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhlenhopp said six merchant vessels were assisting the search effort Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers have said the two crew members rescued Friday and Saturday probably 
owe their lives to the warm Gulf Stream current that has kept water 
temperatures above 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 No cause has been determined for the sinking.

POSTAL SERVICE APPROVES 32-CENT STAMP; IT GOES IN EFFECT IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Year's Day will ring in a stamp price increase, with the cost of a 
first-class letter going to 32 cents and a post card to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service board of governors voted Monday to approve the first 
rate increase in four years, providing an additional $4.7 billion a year in 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The new charges represent a 10.3% increase for first-class postage, less than 
the 12.2% general inflation rate during the past four years, noted board 
chairman Sam Winters. 
</P>
<P>
 The current first-class rate of 29 cents remains in effect for the rest of the 
holiday season, traditionally the heaviest mailing period of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Post offices throughout the nation will begin selling special stamps today 
that can be used until ample supplies of the new 32-cent issues can be printed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service has printed 3 billion copies of the special stamp, without 
a marked price, that bears a picture of a U.S. flag with the phrase "Old Glory" 
above it and "USA G/ For U.S. addresses only" underneath the flag. It is good 
for the 32-cent usage. The "G" stamp is the seventh in a series of unpriced 
stamps used while rates changed at various times since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service also will issue a "make-up rate stamp" with a dove holding 
an olive branch in its beak. It is worth three cents and has "G rate make-up 
stamp" printed across the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular 32-cent stamps will be available in late March or early April. No 
specific dates of issue have been announced, but the year's varied crop of 
stamp subjects will include President Richard Nixon, actress Marilyn Monroe, 
Milton Hershey of chocolate fame, playwright Tennessee Williams, and jazz 
greats Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. Sheets with 20 
separate Civil War subjects -- including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis -- 
and 10 World War II stamps also will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 While raising the first-class rate, Monday's decision leaves the charge for 
additional ounces unchanged at 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The post card, now 19 cents, goes to 20 cents. Priority mail, now $2.90, will 
cost $3. Express mail, now $9.95 for a letter, will cost $10.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service had requested an across-the-board increase of 10.3% for all 
classes of mail. But the rate commission revised the package of rates and 
decided to impose higher rates, 14%, on second-class mail, such as newspapers 
and magazines, and third-class mail, such as advertising materials, circulars 
and catalogues, and fourth-class books. The decision shifted an additional $400 
million in proposed costs from first-class mail to the other categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service said that cost-cutting measures made it possible to hold 
the 29-cent rate for an extra year -- normally rates increase every three 
years. However, losses during the last two years -- $914 million in fiscal 1994 
and $1.8 billion in the prior year -- made a price hike "inevitable," according 
to the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-cent rate will be "a world-class bargain," said Winters, noting that 
"in two countries highly rated for their productivity, the Japanese pay 80 
cents to mail a letter and the Germans pay 64 cents." 
</P>
<P>
 The average consumer will spend between 60 cents and 75 cents more a month 
next year because of higher rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have indicated the new rates should be good for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's decision, the Postal Service's eight-member board of governors 
voted unanimously to accept the rate structure recommended by the independent 
Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the governors asked the rate commission to reconsider the portion of 
its decision dealing with the complex way in which costs are calculated for the 
work of letter carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 This could have an impact on the next rate case. The particular methods are 
important because they determine how much is paid by each class of mail in 
figuring the direct costs of delivering mail, and how much is paid for the 
overhead costs of operating the postal system, with its massive collection of 
real estate, vehicles and personnel.

ORANGE COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME; LATKA STILL ANSWERING THE BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Latka's 60 years in boxing are as storied as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 As an amateur, he won 151 of 159 fights. As a professional, he beat four world 
champions and was ranked as one of the world's top 10 lightweights from 1940 to 
1942. As a referee and judge, he officiated 35 world title fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Latka's accomplishments earned him four Hall of Fame inductions -- in his 
hometown of Gary, Ind., at his alma mater, San Jose State, and with World 
Boxing, once as a boxer and once as a referee. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Latka was informed by John Hall, a publicist for the Orange County 
Sports Assn., that he would be inducted into the Orange County Hall of Fame, 
Latka naturally took it in stride, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started crying," Latka said as his voice started to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, kind of like he is right now," Latka's wife, Trudie, said. "He gets 
real emotional when he starts talking about the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Latka has only lived in Orange County -- Huntington Beach -- for the 
last 22 years, he is honored to be going into the Hall of Fame with such 
athletes as Nolan Ryan and Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack Snow didn't even make it," Latka said. "For me to be mentioned with the 
caliber of guys that are going in . . . that's almost impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 What's almost impossible to believe is that Latka is 80 years old -- he could 
pass for 60 -- and that he had more than 200 amateur and professional fights. 
Many world-class boxers don't age well, and ones who do, rarely do boxing 
exhibitions for their 80th birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Latka in the Westminster Gym last week, training for his 
three-round fight last Saturday night at the Lindborg Racquet Club in 
Huntington Beach. Longtime friend Jackie McCoy, who saw about 10 of Latka's pro 
fights some 50 years ago, couldn't believe what he was seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he probably shouldn't make a comeback, but he looked pretty good," 
McCoy said. "He was quick and he had those good moves. He was going through 
this routine like it was a regular workout." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as if time has stood still the last 50 years, Latka believes he still 
could hold his own in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reflexes are still so keen," he said. "I can still slip a punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Trudie, Latka's second wife, said, "When you've done something your whole 
life, it's what you do. George is a boxer, so it's natural to him to be in the 
ring boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 But McCoy said Latka isn't like most boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most fighters don't age that well," he said. "The punches they take through 
the years seem to catch up with them. But you talk to George and you'd never 
know he was a boxer." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's because Latka was a boxer. Not a brawler, a slugger, or even a 
puncher -- a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's equivalent of Latka would probably be world super middleweight champ 
Roy Jones or world lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one hell of a fighter," McCoy said. "He was very hard to hit and when 
he did get hit, it didn't seem to hurt him. If he was around today, he'd be a 
world champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Latka, told by Trudie to stop being so modest, didn't dispute McCoy's 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my era, I don't think there was a fighter superior to me defensively," 
said Latka, who was never off his feet during his professional career. "My 
reactions were so quick. If I were around today, I'd have four or five titles. 
I just wish I was boxing now so I could benefit from all the money that's out 
there. I'd be a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead Latka, whose nickname was "The Boxing Professor," spent much of his 
five-year professional career making a comfortable living and working to get a 
lightweight title bout. Though four of his 49 victories came over world 
champions, none of the fighters were champions when Latka beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Latka did fight Sammy Angott, the world lightweight champion who had just 
defeated featherweight champion Willie Pep, to a draw. The fight was originally 
supposed to be for Angott's title, but the boxing commission didn't approve of 
the bout's promoter and it was ruled a non-title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why he was never a world champion," McCoy said. "I think there 
was even more politics then than there is now." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Latka notes, there were also fewer champions in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only eight champions because there were fewer weight classes and 
only one organization," Latka said. "But I'm happy for these guys now. I think 
everybody should get the chance to become a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 When Latka realized he probably would never become a champion, he retired in 
1942 at the age of 28 with a record of 49-6. His manager for the last two years 
of his career was actor George Raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Latka spent the next 50-some years involved in boxing as a trainer, manager, 
promoter, matchmaker, referee and even as an acting referee. He has had bit 
parts in five movies and several television situation comedies. His biggest 
part came in "Raging Bull," where he played the referee during the fight 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fraser, who promoted the Irvine Marriott boxing shows for 10 years, was 
hired by Latka the promoter for $3 a show to publicize The Times' Golden Gloves 
Tournament in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I didn't do a very good job," Latka joked. "That was the last Times' 
Golden Gloves Tournament there was." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fraser and Latka stayed together to co-manage fighters and the two are 
still close friends. Fraser was among the crowd of about 220 who attended 
Latka's 80th birthday party, hosted by Lenny Lindborg, who also managed a few 
boxers with Latka. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see that kind of turnout for somebody 80 years old these days 
unless it's for a funeral," Fraser said. "But George is the kind of guy I don't 
think anybody has a bad thing to say about." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Latka's old friends and former foes showed up in a documentary of 
Latka's life that was produced by Trudie's son, Patrick Murphy. But it was 
Latka's boxing exhibition against Joe Bahash, one of his former fighters, that 
stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was electrified," said Latka, who actually turned 80 on Nov. 12. "I felt so 
good, I surprised myself. I could have gone another two rounds."

KNOX WON'T SAY QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chuck Knox said Monday that quitting "is not in my vocabulary," but Ram 
President John Shaw said the coach's future will be discussed with owner 
Georgia Frontiere after the season. Although the Dallas Morning News reported 
Monday that the Rams already have had conversations with former Dallas Cowboy 
Coach Jimmy Johnson and his attorney about Johnson coaching the team, Shaw 
insisted that was not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had a number of conversations with Jimmy Johnson," Shaw said, "but I 
have had no conversation with him about employment. And I have not discussed 
any such thing with his attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morning News reported Monday that Johnson's attorney has had talks with 
the Philadelphia Eagles, the Rams and prospective owners of the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. The newspaper said Johnson will announce this weekend whether he 
intends to become coach of the Eagles or remain at Fox-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, who is paid more than $700,000 a year, has one year remaining on a 
four-year contract. A 15-31 record, dwindling interest from local fans and the 
prospect of a fresh start elsewhere have raised speculation that Knox will be 
fired at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate talking about him (Knox) with ownership at the end of the 
season," Shaw said. "There are a number of factors involved: Whether we move, 
or don't move, for example. But there have been no discussions at this time and 
there won't be until the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Monday, if the team moves, he intends to go with it, and under no 
circumstances will he resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this a long time, and no, that would not be something I would 
think about. I have never walked away from anything in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say I was going to come in here and turn this around in three years. 
I expected to have a good year this year based on the people we had gotten 
signed, but some things have happened and we haven't gotten it done. I signed a 
four-year contract and I still have a year to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnson rumors began early this season, but Johnson was quoted recently as 
saying that his attorney has had talks with the Rams about his return to 
coaching. Knox, who particularly enjoys league-wide gossip and who regularly 
stays in touch with league officials, said he was unaware of the Jimmy 
Johnson-to-the-Rams talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard that," Knox said. "I wouldn't bother to check it out, and I 
haven't heard it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he has not spoken to management about his future. "Why should I?" he 
said. "I don't speak to management about those kind of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Why should Knox be given an opportunity to remain as Rams head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've been competitive and we're just a player or two here from 
getting it done," he said. "And we can get it done. There have been a lot of 
coaches that have coached a lot longer in one place than I have here that have 
not won. And some have coached for a long time at certain places and not won 
Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've lost it. Obviously I'm not going to be a fool and tell you 
that we are playing like I want us to play or that we have won as many games as 
I want to win. But I don't think it's a question . . . I could turn this around 
and ask you questions about certain coaches in this league if you think they've 
lost it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we turned it around the first year here. We doubled the number of 
wins (six) from the year before. As far as the won-loss record, there could be 
a lot of reasons for that, too: Injuries last year, the quarterback situation, 
you have to look at it all. You see when those kind of questions are asked, you 
put me in the position of sounding like a guy that's alibi-ing or something, 
which is what I don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox inherited a team that finished 3-13, and guided it to a 6-10 mark in 
1992. Last season the team opened 2-2 only to finish 5-11; this year the Rams 
again were 2-2, but are now 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's performance of late has been especially disappointing. The Rams 
have not run the ball well, lacked discipline against Tampa Bay and appeared to 
cash it in against New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to look at all of it," Knox said. "Certainly I take 
responsibility, accountability for whatever the record is. There are a lot of 
other reasons involved, to be correct, that I don't want to go into at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But what glimmer of hope is there for Ram fans? 
</P>
<P>
 "My record is there -- prior to coming here -- for one thing," Knox said. "And 
that's something that's an historical fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Before rejoining the Rams, Knox compiled a 171-114-1 record. Knox led the Rams 
to five consecutive NFC West Division titles between 1973-77 and then went on 
to make the Bills AFC East Division champs in his third year at Buffalo. Knox 
put the Seahawks into the playoffs in his first year on the job in Seattle in 
1983 and won the AFC West Division title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 His overall record is 186-145-1, however, and this will be the sixth straight 
season that his team has failed to advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of perception," Knox said. "We just have not been able to win 
those close games like we used to win them and you could say, well, maybe the 
coaching isn't what it should be. I can't give you the answer for it, other 
than the fact I think we still can get the job done. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record is there, and we'll see what happens. I don't have any control 
over what people may or may not say and I'd like everybody to think positive 
and not be negative. Obviously I don't have any control whether or not I will 
be back here, so why worry about it?"

RAM BOOSTER LEAVES MEETING PESSIMISTIC; NFL: AFTER TWO-HOUR CONFERENCE WITH 
FRONTIERE AND SHAW, GROUP'S PRESIDENT THINKS TEAM WILL MOVE TO ST. LOUIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-hour meeting with Ram Owner Georgia Frontiere and President John Shaw 
left the president of the team's booster club even more pessimistic about 
Orange County's chances of keeping the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the sense they're fairly committed to going to St. Louis," said Frank 
Bryant, who joined booster club vice president Linda Moomau for the meeting 
Thursday night at Frontiere's home in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't say that, but during the conversation it sounded more like a 
conclusion than a possibility. They were talking about how things 'will' be 
rather than how they 'might' be. That leads me to believe someone is already 
thinking they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting marked the first time Frontiere has discussed the team's possible 
relocation with a group trying to prevent the move. Repeated attempts by the 
Save the Rams task force, of which Bryant is a member, for a meeting with the 
owner have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was strictly from a fan's viewpoint -- we weren't representing Save the 
Rams," Bryant said. "She wanted to meet with us primarily because she feels 
that even though she might make a decision to move, she owes the fans something 
after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant said he stressed to Frontiere that "it's only a small minority" of fans 
who say disparaging things about the owner, and that there are a number of 
sincere fans who don't want the team to leave, regardless of what she reads in 
the paper. "But that doesn't reduce the hurt of what some fans say," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boosters asked Frontiere what they could do to persuade her to stay. "She 
said it's a business decision, that the dollar amounts are so large (in St. 
Louis) that it's difficult to not give that serious consideration," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis is offering a new, publicly financed, 70,000-seat domed stadium and 
a lucrative lease that could net the Rams profits of about $25 million a year. 
The Rams, suffering from sagging attendance, are projecting a $6-million loss 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't seem to blame the fans, but they mentioned several times they're 
very disappointed there are not more fans who come to games regardless of the 
team's win-loss record, like they do in other communities," Bryant said. "Based 
on that, they're losing money, and they're not willing to continue losing 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the group did not talk about specifics of the Save the Rams' package -- 
which includes a renovated stadium, new practice facility and season-ticket and 
luxury suite guarantees -- the impact of Orange County's financial crisis was 
discussed.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Frontiere) asked about it and we talked about it, and I think it will impact 
her a little bit," Bryant said. "It's going to make it a little easier when 
they make their (relocation) presentation to the NFL," which would likely vote 
on the move at its March meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll have a better story to tell to get other owners to empathize with 
them. They'll think, 'Shoot, if the county is going bankrupt, how are they 
going to fulfill their promises to the Rams?' It's not going to lessen our 
resolve or change our strategy (to keep the team). It just makes it tougher."

VALLEY COLLEGE RECEIVER TO SIGN WITH CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Comer, an All-American receiver from Valley College, said Monday he will 
sign to play football at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer, who caught 81 passes for 1,753 yards and 15 touchdowns in 11 games this 
season, said he had also scheduled recruiting visits to Wyoming and UNLV, but 
he canceled those after deciding on Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer said he chose the school "because I will be challenged in the classroom 
academically and will be challenged athletically on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-foot-11, 180-pound sophomore, Comer holds the Valley College career 
records for receptions (139), yardage (2,657) and touchdowns (26). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County Bowl earlier this month, he caught 10 passes for 205 
yards and two touchdowns, leading Valley to a 36-28 victory against Rancho 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Chatsworth High, he was an All-City Section quarterback. During his 
senior year in 1991, he passed for 1,125 yards, leading area City quarterbacks. 
He redshirted at Valley in 1992, still trying to play quarterback, and was then 
moved to receiver to make room for Sean Fitzgerald, who now plays at 
Pittsburgh. JEFF FLETCHER

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: IRVINE VALLEY BASKETBALL TEAM 
FINALLY GETS A PLACE TO CALL A HOME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bill Mulligan, the Irvine Valley basketball coach, is a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
 But his joy isn't limited to the improving play of his team. He has another 
reason for his glee. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley is about to play its first game in the new campus gym. The 
Lasers, in their third year, play their first home game at 7:30 p.m. Friday 
against Palomar. Irvine Valley plays host to Grossmont at the same time 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first two years of the program, Mulligan's team led a nomadic life, 
playing home games at Capistrano Valley and Laguna Hills high schools. 
Practices were on the road -- and often in the evening after the high school 
teams were finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled to have a gym," Mulligan said. "We are really looking forward 
to that home game. I hope we have a big crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself also will be important for Irvine Valley, because center Keon 
Clark is scheduled to return to the lineup after recovering from an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a 6-foot-11 freshman from Danville, Ill., has received high praise from 
Mulligan, who said he has the potential to be a first-round NBA draft pick if 
he continues to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark averaged 25 points in the first four games, then sprained his ankle in 
the final minutes of a practice. He is expected back Friday after missing about 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big guy was the best he's ever been before he got hurt," Mulligan said. 
"I don't know how he's going to come back but he should be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley was 3-1 with Clark, and Mulligan wasn't sure how the team would 
react with him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushed by the improved play of several, including Josh Porter, the Lasers have 
won five of their last seven and are 5-4 without Clark. Irvine is 8-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, a 6-5 freshman forward from Mater Dei, was selected to the 
all-tournament teams at the Riverside and Orange Coast tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Final poll: Bakersfield (10-1) was the top-ranked team in the season-ending 
Southland football poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley (10-1) was second, Rancho Santiago (9-2) third, Long Beach 
(9-2) fourth, College of the Desert (9-2) fifth, El Camino (9-2) sixth, 
Cerritos (8-3) seventh, Palomar (8-3) eighth, Fullerton (7-3-1) ninth, and 
Moorpark (8-3) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago finished 12th and Fullerton 28th in the final J.C. Grid-Wire 
national rankings. Trinity Valley of Texas was 12-0 and won the Grid-Wire's 
title. City College of San Francisco (11-0) finished second. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tournaments: Cypress plays host to a men's basketball tournament and Orange 
Coast has a women's tournament this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress tournament starts Thursday with El Camino vs. College of the 
Canyons at 2 p.m.; Golden West vs. Santa Monica at 4 p.m.; L.A. Trade Tech vs. 
Long Beach at 6 p.m. and Cypress vs. Victor Valley at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament continues Friday and the championship is at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (10-3) is coming off a third-place finish in the 16-team Riverside 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Accurate three-point shooting is one reason for Cypress' success. The Chargers 
are averaging 11 three-pointers in 26 shots per game. Gil Gonzales, a freshman 
from Orange High, has made 56. Matt Kennedy has 42 and Jeff Rutter has made 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena tournament also starts Thursday with Fullerton taking on Los 
Angeles Valley at 4 p.m. and Rancho Santiago playing Cuesta at 6 p.m. Rancho 
Santiago beat Fullerton in the championship of the tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast is the site of the Coast Christmas women's tournament starting 
Friday with Los Angeles Trade Tech vs. Saddleback at 1:30 p.m.; Chaffey vs. 
Fullerton at 3:30 p.m.; El Camino vs. Southwestern at 5:30 p.m. and Los Angeles 
Valley vs. Orange Coast at 7:30 p.m. The El Camino-Southwestern meeting is a 
rematch of last year's title game, won by El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament continues Saturday and the championship game is at 4 p.m. 
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior forward Terrance O'Kelley, whose academic performance has disappointed 
Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg, was suspended Monday for one game, the 
school announced. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley, 6 feet 7 and 245 pounds, will miss the 49ers' nonconference game 
Dec. 21 against Montana at The Pyramid.O'Kelley remains in good academic 
standing at Long Beach and is eligible according to Big West Conference and 
NCAA standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrance didn't tell us the truth (about his academic situation)," Greenberg 
said. "You don't lie to people who care about you." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley did not start the season opener against Detroit Mercy for failure to 
turn in a class project. He is averaging 6.6 points and five rebounds for the 
49ers (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, O'Kelley was selected third-team all-conference. He averaged 11.9 
points, 6.8 rebounds and a team-leading 2.2 blocks. JASON REID

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; HARDSHIPS CATCH UP TO 49ERS AT REGION 
FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They pushed forward through more obstacles than they had ever faced, but the 
roadblock from the Midwest ended the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers were thwarted in their quest to win their second consecutive 
national women's volleyball title when Ohio State overpowered them, 15-5, 
14-16, 15-9, 15-5, in the Northwest Region championship match Saturday at The 
Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was trying to make its fourth consecutive appearance in the final 
four. Long Beach's 27-6 record was its worst since 1988 (26-7). Long Beach had 
won at least 30 matches the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the challenges they faced, though, the 49ers had a remarkable 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the 49ers' least talented team in several seasons. Long Beach lost 
three starters to graduation from its 1993 title team, including national 
player of the Danielle Scott, an outside hitter, and All-American setter Joy 
McKienzie. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was still the class of the Big West Conference, winning its fourth 
straight title with a 16-2 record. The only other team to win four in a row was 
Hawaii (1987-90). 
</P>
<P>
 However, the conference race was draining. Long Beach lost two matches the 
previous three seasons combined. The 49ers didn't wrap up the title until their 
final conference match against Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the team was affected by the illness and death of the father of 
senior middle blocker Traci Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Dahl died Wednesday of lung cancer and pneumonia. Dahl, a first-team 
all-conference selection, played in Friday's five-set regional semifinal 
victory over Hawaii and in the final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking anything away from Ohio State, but I think everything finally 
just caught up with us," Coach Brian Gimmillaro said. "With all that has taken 
place this year, it was just too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 49ers shouldn't become a doormat next season, a steep drop in 
success isn't out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Big West player of the year Nichelle Burton, an All-American outside hitter, 
Dahl and defensive specialist Prentice Perkins have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Brita Schwerm, a junior outside hitter, was selected first-team all-conference 
and should become a bigger force next season. She finished third on the team in 
kills with 413 and kills per game at 3.47. Schwerm joined Burton on the 
all-region team. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters Heather Hofmans, a sophomore setter, and Kristin Harris, a freshman 
outside hitter, also return. What's more, Newport Harbor's Misty May, one of 
the top recruits in the nation, has committed to Long Beach. May, an outside 
hitter, probably will play setter for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gimmillaro said a rebuilding phase begins next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go with some young talent and see if we can develop back into 
a championship team," he said. "After six years of being at the top and near 
the top, you have to expect this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saying goodby: The entire volleyball team and coaching staff attended funeral 
services Monday for Dahl at St. Barnabas Church in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "An amazing number of people were there," Gimmillaro said. "He certainly was a 
loved man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a roll: The women's basketball team, way down the last two seasons, is 2-1 
after consecutive nonconference victories over Southern Utah and Loyola 
Marymount last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers defeated Southern Utah on Monday, 88-74, and the Lions on Tuesday, 
77-60. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're starting to get an attitude," Coach Glenn McDonald said. "They 
understand if you give the effort, then positive things are going to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach leaves Saturday for games at No. 8 Colorado on Dec. 19 and Colorado 
State on Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important trip," McDonald said. "It would be nice to go in there and 
give a team like (Colorado) one hell of a game on their home court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very comfortable with our players. I look at the matchups, and I feel 
that if we can go in there and play under control, we can be right in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top player: The Big West chose Melissa Gower, a senior center and co-captain, 
player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gower had 36 points and 14 rebounds in the victory over Southern Utah and 27 
points and 13 rebounds against Loyola Marymount. Gower, 6 feet 2, has 
team-leading averages of 28 points and 14.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect this, but I knew I could do it," Gower said. "It's just 
happening."

OETTINGER DECIDES TO ATTEND STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill's Tara Oettinger said Monday she has signed a letter of intent to 
attend Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger, The Times' Orange County girls' track and field athlete of the year 
last season, said she considered only one other school, Cornell, because her 
brother, Ryan, went there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really liked it," she said, "but I didn't want to go to school in the 
East." 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior last season, Oettinger won four events at the Orange County 
Championships and became the school's first State champion by winning the long 
jump at 19 feet 7 1/2 inches.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; BASHEER GETS HER WISH: LOTS OF PLAYING TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allah-mi Basheer leads the UC Irvine women's basketball team in scoring (16 
points per game) and blocked shots (three) and is second in rebounding (eight). 
Her mastery of the numbers game is a credit to a high school math teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos High's Ann Dena Sjoerdsma, who also coached the girls' basketball 
team, got the ball rolling when she asked a lanky sophomore if she wanted to 
try out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really good friends with her," Basheer said, "so I said, 'OK.' But I 
was really, really intimidated and really scared because I knew nothing about 
the game. Nothing at all. I was totally clueless." 
</P>
<P>
 Basheer, who had played soccer and competed on the track team as a freshman, 
had never played basketball, never even watched an entire game. So she had good 
reason to be nervous when tryouts began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that you scored two points for getting the ball through the basket and 
that was it," she said. "And I embarrassed myself every day in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she made the team. "Thankfully, I sat on the bench my whole sophomore 
year," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Basheer figured the only way to improve was to play, so she did . . . at 
every, and any, opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next summer, I played every day with all the guys at the park near my 
house and I learned a lot from that," she said. "I had a personal coach who 
worked with me on the weekends. And I played for a couple of traveling teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know, all that time, I wasn't playing because I liked it. I just kept 
playing because everybody kept saying they could see something in me. It was 
like my nickname in those days was 'Potential.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Basheer persevered and by the time her senior season was over, the 
potential was manifesting itself on the court and she was named to the All-San 
Gabriel Valley League and All-Los Angeles Times teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw in high school was just the tip of the iceberg," Irvine Coach 
Colleen Matsuhara said. "She was young, too, only 16 when she graduated. It was 
baptism-of-fire learning for her, but she's made gigantic strides." 
</P>
<P>
 Basheer was recruited by Long Beach State, Nevada and UC Santa Barbara, but 
chose Irvine because she thought it would offer the most playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Beware what you wish for. The 6-foot-2 junior center is becoming the 
Anteaters' marathon woman. She played 36 minutes during their 76-65 victory 
over Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's become a much more aggressive offensive player," Matsuhara said. "She's 
looking to the basket for shots she passed up last year. And she's starting to 
take her turns at being a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Basheer's late start in the game may have put her at a disadvantage at times, 
but it clearly hasn't stilted her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't reached my peak yet," she said. "In terms of fundamentals and the 
mental aspect, I learn something every day. Right now, I'm working on staying 
on the floor on defense. I have a knack for jumping, that's how I get the 
blocked shots, but I need to keep my feet and think more about playing body-up 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when it comes to scoring, I feel like I can take anybody. I don't think 
anybody can stop me. My confidence is really high this year, in terms of 
knowing what I can do and really believing I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fit to be victorious: Rod Baker's recent impersonation of a turnstile appears 
to be a hit. The Irvine coach has been spinning in front of the bench as he 
waves players into the game in a substitution frenzy that has left the last two 
opponents gasping in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters outscored Pepperdine, 18-6, in the final 7 minutes 12 seconds of 
a 75-68 victory in the consolation game of the Iowa Hawkeye Invitational. And 
Saturday at San Diego, they turned a seven-point halftime deficit into a 73-70 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No Anteater averaged more than 29 minutes and 10 players averaged 12 or more 
during those two victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to play, so it's good for morale," said senior forward Khalid 
Channell, who is averaging 17 minutes per game off the bench. "But this 
rotation is good because everyone is fresh and able to play at their maximum 
ability when they're on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Platooning: With the Anteaters holding the advantage at the end of the last 
two games and their opponents forced to foul, Baker has been using the stoppage 
of play to change personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Anteaters are shooting free throws, he has the best perimeter 
defender, guard Zuri Williams, and the best post defender, forward Michael 
Tate, on the floor. When Irvine has possession, he puts in guard Chris Brown, 
who has made all 12 of his free-throw attempts this season, and forward Shaun 
Battle, who is shooting 75% from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A fresh force: Brown, the nation's No. 1 three-point shooter last season, is 
shooting only 23% from the field. But the Anteaters aren't hurting at the 
off-guard spot, thanks to freshman Brian Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two games, the two have combined for 39 points, with Keefe 
contributing 13 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters went on a 12-0 run midway through the second half against San 
Diego Saturday night and Keefe scored eight of those points on a nifty baseline 
drive, a fast-break layup, a three-pointer from the wing and a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to contribute to a win," said Keefe, who usually says the kinds 
of things freshmen ought to say. "The guys made some great passes and I made 
some shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable. We're starting to play together 
pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater notes 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Popi Edwards has been named to the All-Northwest region 
second team for the second consecutive year. Edwards, who led the Anteaters 
with a 4.15-kills-per-game average, is the first Anteater volleyball player to 
be named to all-region and all-conference teams two years in a row . . . 
Cross-country runners Todd Coulston, Ryan Gauss, Laura Monson and Karin Schick 
were named to Big West all-academic teams.

IBM STOPS SHIPPING PENTIUM PCS; TECHNOLOGY: COMPUTER MAKER SAYS CHIP'S FLAW IS 
WORSE THAN INTEL HAS REPORTED. INTEL CALLS THE ACTION UNWARRANTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intel Corp.'s efforts to dispose of the controversy over a flaw in its Pentium 
microprocessor were dealt a severe setback Monday when IBM Corp. said it was 
suspending shipments of Pentium-based personal computers because it believes 
the bug is substantially worse than Intel has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's announcement sent shudders through the PC industry, dragging technology 
stocks down in heavy trading on Wall Street and raising fears that consumers 
could grow wary of PCs in the midst of the industry's best-ever holiday selling 
season. It also highlighted some of the difficulties computer companies face as 
they try to appeal to non-technical consumers, whose expectations are different 
from those of traditional computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel denounced IBM's decision as unwarranted, saying its own extensive tests 
showed no evidence of any increased probability of encountering the bug. Since 
the flaw was publicized by a Virginia mathematics professor in October, Intel 
has steadfastly maintained that the flaw is of no concern to anyone except a 
few mathematicians and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always contrive situations that force this error," Andrew S. Grove, 
Intel's president and chief executive, said in a statement Monday. "In other 
words, if you know where a meteor will land, you can go there and get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's action is its second Pentium-related salvo in less than two weeks: On 
Nov. 30, the company offered to replace faulty Pentiums for customers who 
feared that their computations might go awry because of the bug, which can 
produce errors in some complex division problems. IBM's double- barreled 
barrage is viewed by many in the industry as an opportunistic attempt to 
disparage Intel and garner support for its own PowerPC, a Pentium rival that 
IBM developed with Apple Computer and Motorola. Pentium PCs account for only a 
tiny portion of IBM's sales. No other PC manufacturers followed IBM's lead 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM denied any ulterior motives. "Our main concern was to respect the 
trust" of our customers, said Bill Pulleyblank, director of mathematical 
sciences at IBM's research division in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "We're willing to 
take whatever are the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will sell Pentium systems on a case-by-case basis to customers who are 
aware of the flaw and feel comfortable that they will not be affected, 
spokeswoman Tara Sexton said. "If they want to accept the risk now, fine," she 
said, noting that IBM would later replace the Pentium chips free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer makers such as Dell and Compaq, meanwhile, said they will continue to 
ship Pentium systems while they await replacement microprocessors from Intel 
containing a "patch" that fixes the bug. Widespread distribution of repaired 
Pentiums will begin in the first three months of 1995, Intel has said. 
</P>
<P>
 After IBM's Monday morning announcement, the stocks of semiconductor and 
computer makers and computer retailers took a drubbing, though many edged back 
up in the afternoon. Intel closed down $2.375 at $60.375, IBM dropped 87.5 
cents to $70.625, Dell slumped $1.25 to $39.625, and Compaq was off 87.5 cents 
at $39. Retailer CompUSA fell 50 cents to $13.375. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel has said a typical computer user using a spreadsheet and doing 1,000 
divisions per day would notice a problem from the Pentium bug just once in 
27,000 years. In its tests, however, IBM found that common spreadsheet 
programs, recalculating for 15 minutes a day, could produce errors as often as 
every 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have been buying PCs in record numbers for homes and small offices 
this holiday season, and many are particularly attracted to Pentium-based 
machines: The powerful chip makes them especially good for games and other 
multimedia programs. The popularity of on-line services and the global Internet 
has also boosted mainstream interest in computing. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, fanning the Pentium controversy has been a spate of fiery electronic 
mail complaints on the Internet about Intel's handling of the problem. Two 
weekends ago, Intel's Grove took the unprecedented step of posting a statement 
on the Internet to defend his company's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to industry observers, this is the first time a high-tech flaw has 
received such a public airing on the Internet. The Internet's role in spreading 
the news fast has been "quite astounding," said Jeff Contompasis, senior 
quality assurance engineer at Simulation Sciences, a software company based in 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Internet users were particularly incensed that Intel, based in Santa 
Clara, Calif., knew of the problem as early as last June but did not disclose 
it publicly until after its discovery by mathematician Thomas R. Nicely, a 
college professor in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel has steadfastly declined to recall the 5 million or so Pentiums already 
on the market. It has said that any customer affected by the glitch will be 
sent a replacement at any time during the PC's life. In the meantime, it is 
racing to produce bug-free chips in quantity. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the Pentium controversy raises anew the debate about whether the 
high-tech industry, especially given its push into the home market, should 
develop a better set of quality-control standards for its equipment to reassure 
potentially wary customers. 
</P>

 Intel's Pentium processor, introduced in March, 1993, represents the fifth 
generation in a line of microprocessors that dates back to 1979 and the 
original IBM PC. While the fourth-generation chip, the 486, is currently the 
chip of choice for personal computers, the more powerful (and more expensive) 
Pentium is expected to overtake the 486 by the end of next year. An overview of 
the Pentium marketplace:

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SOME VENDORS TIGHTEN CREDIT OR DEMAND ADVANCE 
PAYMENT; FINANCE: O.C. PURCHASING OFFICIALS ASSESS WHICH SUPPLIERS ARE TO 
RECEIVE PRIORITY WITH THE COUNTY'S REMAINING CASH. 
</P>

<P>
 Worried about whether they will be paid while Orange County struggles through 
bankruptcy, some businesses have stopped shipments of goods to the county's 
agencies or are demanding payment in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Serrato, president of Far West Meats in Highland, near San Bernardino, 
said his company -- one of several meat suppliers to the county -- has ceased 
shipments to the county's jails. They had been averaging about $6,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to continue to deliver, but we're supposed to call on a 
day-to-day basis to see if we're going to be paid. So as far as I'm concerned, 
we're not going to deliver," Serrato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the prisoners start starving, then they'll probably start calling to say 
they'll buy COD," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other vendors of food to the county's jails said they would continue shipments 
and that they did not expect there would be food shortages for the county's 
roughly 4,700 prisoners, split between five different facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some smaller vendors said they would be willing to do small jobs on a credit 
basis but would want cash for significant work. "If it were a valve (repair) on 
a fire engine, we'd probably do it. But if they needed an engine, we'd want to 
know how we're going to be paid on it," said Jack Devine, owner of Associated 
Diesel Service and Equipment Co. in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County owes his company about $13,000 for work on a sanitation truck, 
Devine said. "I'm not that concerned about it for our direct contracts, but I 
have concerns because of the trickle-down effect," he said. "We do business 
with a number of contractors, and if all of a sudden they have a lot of money 
due from the county and they're not going to get it, that would affect us." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Fry, manager of Mini Blind Laundry, in Santa Ana, said the county owes 
him about $3,100 for maintenance work the company completed recently. "It's not 
something we care to absorb," he said. "If the county asked us to do some more 
work, we'd probably do it if it were a repair situation. But if it were 
something new, where it was a cash outlay, then we'd probably have to ask for 
cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kolodisner, director of the county's purchasing department, said his 
office is only beginning to survey which vendors and which departments should 
be given priority as the county studies how to manage its remaining cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sorting through what everybody needs, and we have to make sure we're 
spending on the most critical ones first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Food for the county's jails and fuel for emergency and sanitation fleets are 
the two most significant items that the county will probably seek to protect 
from interruption, purchasing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the county's three main fuel supply companies said they have 
been given assurances that they will be paid out of funds that will not require 
Bankruptcy Court approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're continuing to provide fuel after the bankruptcy, on the understanding 
that it's an administrative claim, so that current deliveries are paid out of 
administrative cash," said Fred Whitaker, general counsel for Southern Counties 
Oil Co. in Orange, to which the county has paid $1.37 million for fuel so far 
this year, according to records from the county's General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said shipments to area cities were being made on a "day-by-day" 
basis, however. 
</P>
<P>
 George Hopwood, government sales manager at General Petroleum, said his 
company decided Monday that the assurances were strong enough to continue 
selling to the county without asking for payment upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking last week about looking for some other arrangement with the 
county, but we thought it was really vital that we continue deliveries."  
</P>
<P>
 Not all vendors contacted said they are worried about the county's ability to 
pay. Joe Stidman, president of Heartland Meats Inc. in National City, said he 
expects to continue his shipments to the county's jails, which total about $1 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of products in inventory, so the (bankruptcy) doesn't seem to 
be too much of a concern," he said. "I don't think we'll not get paid . . . but 
it's new to us, too. We'll see how it goes."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; A FEW HOME BUYERS ARE SEEKING A WAY OUT TOO; 
REPERCUSSIONS: THEY FEAR THEY COULD BE WALKING INTO TAX INCREASES OR CUTBACKS 
IN PUBLIC SERVICES RESULTING FROM CRISIS. 
</P>

<P>
 Fed up with urban life, the Greenwalds scouted Orange County's waterfront for 
years looking for their dream property. They finally decided on an apartment 
building in exclusive Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Orange County's bankruptcy filing a week ago -- and the Greenwalds 
got nervous, very nervous. With upward of $400,000 at stake, the couple halted 
escrow on their purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a traumatic decision," said Alicia Greenwald, 39, who had planned to 
move her family from an expansive earthquake-damaged home in Glendale. "I had 
to call the bank and stop the check." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a few home buyers like the Greenwalds are having second thoughts 
about Orange County's real estate market until the crisis over the county's 
bankruptcy filing -- and the continuing financial uncertainty -- has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers fear the bankruptcy could cause an increase in taxes or a reduction in 
public services to cope with the estimated losses of more than $2 billion from 
the county's investment pool, which was valued at more than $20 billion earlier 
this year. That, in turn, could affect the value of their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The full repercussion of the bankruptcy is just starting to come out," said 
Lionel Punchard, president of First Republic Mortgage Corp. in Santa Ana. 
"There are a lot of things (possible) as a result of bankruptcy. The home buyer 
does not yet know the effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents echo those sentiments, saying that they are receiving phone 
calls from earlier clients wondering how the debacle will affect home values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had calls from people asking my opinion. . . . There is some concern 
whether property values are going to be negatively affected. But my opinion is, 
I don't think so," said Gil Thibault, an agent for the Grubb & Ellis real 
estate office in Laguna Beach. "I told them I thought (the impact) was minimal, 
that the economic recovery is progressing very well and expectation are strong 
for 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers, however, have already balked at making new home decisions in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cortens, a real estate broker specializing in properties at Capistrano 
Beach, said he has already had one client postpone purchase of a $900,000 
vacation home because of Orange County's petition for Chapter 9 bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was concerned about the effect on real estate and real estate 
taxes," Cortens said of the client, an Orange County lawyer whom he declined to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to convince him that, although it is a large amount of money on a 
property . . . there would not be that much effect," said Cortens, adding that 
he believes rising interest rates and the rebounding economy's effect on home 
prices would be more detrimental than the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Greenwald said she expects to wait at least a month before wading back 
into the Orange County real estate market. She said she is eager to move 
because she is frustrated with crime in Glendale; her 10-year-old daughter was 
mugged during a school Halloween carnival. She says she also wants better 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 After much searching, the Greenwalds decided on a four-unit apartment 
building. They planned to live in one three-bedroom unit and rent out the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm risking losing our beautiful apartment, but you can't take your 
family into something that is the same situation you're in," she said, 
explaining that she fears the financial crisis could lead to a lowering of 
public services or school quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was hurried. On Dec. 2, Greenwald and her husband, a doctor who 
practices at Kaiser-Permanente in Bellflower, had presented their real estate 
agent with a $10,000 escrow check. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she picked up the newspaper the following Wednesday and read about 
Orange County's bankruptcy filing, Alicia Greenwald said, "I almost passed out 
. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I circled everything with three colors of pencils. I took it to my husband 
and made him get up and read it. I literally put cold water on my face. He 
said: 'Oh, my gosh! We have lived through this before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed they had. The Greenwalds resided in New York during that city's 
financial crisis in the mid-1970s. She said they saw the repercussions and 
service cutbacks firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Alicia Greenwald admits that the pull to move may be too strong to 
resist. "My heart really wants to be in Orange County," she said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; INTEL'S HANDLING OF THE PENTIUM DEFECT CHIPS AT ITS IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Intel Corp.'s handling of the outcry over the flaw in its Pentium 
microprocessor is shaping up as a textbook case of how not to handle a crisis, 
management experts said Monday. As did Exxon Corp. after the Valdez oil spill 
and USAir after its recent string of plane crashes, Intel is turning a 
difficult but isolated problem into one that threatens long-term damage to the 
company's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will have a crisis sooner or later. The key is how you respond and 
accept responsibility," says Ian Mitroff, director of the USC Center for Crisis 
Management. "I don't think they've done very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Intel's bungling began when it discovered the flaw in the Pentium last summer 
and decided not to tell anyone, reasoning that the flaw would affect hardly 
anyone and that it was all but commonplace for a complex microprocessor to have 
a few bugs. After a Virginia mathematics professor discovered and publicized 
the flaw, however, Intel's secrecy looked suspiciously like a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when it was forced to acknowledge the problem, Intel dismissed the 
chances of its causing problems for the average user as exceedingly rare -- 
once in 27,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad move, say crisis management experts. Statistics are a classic defense in 
such situations, but they are unpersuasive at best and genuinely misleading at 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probabilities are always off," says Mitroff, pointing out that few believed 
Exxon's claim after the Valdez spill that such an accident would happen only 
once in 250 years.

<P>
 Intel's statements are already looking suspect now that IBM has concluded that 
a Pentium user could encounter problems as often as once every 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Another blunder: Intel has offered to replace the chip only in cases in which 
it believes the flaw could cause a problem -- a classic case of focusing on the 
short-term problems caused by the crisis rather than on the more important 
long-term issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should take (the chips) back, no questions asked," says Larry Kamer, a 
San Francisco public relations executive. "They have a good, solid reputation 
that they have spent years and millions of dollars to develop. That's the 
equity they have to protect." 
</P>
<P>
 By refusing to replace the chips for any customer who asks -- especially when 
Compaq and IBM have both offered to do so -- Intel "comes across as the bad 
guy," Kamer says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentium debacle is following the path of the classic "crisis" as described 
by David Umansky, a crisis management expert in Baltimore. He says a crisis 
begins with a surprise occurrence, develops in an atmosphere of insufficient 
information, results in an increasing flow of events, loss of control, siege 
mentality, intense scrutiny from the outside and short-term focus. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical action required of Intel, Umansky says, is to be more open and 
communicative about its view of the situation. "If you're not, you're leaving 
the media to say what the problem is and what should be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost irrelevant what Intel says. If IBM thinks it's a problem, it's a 
problem," Mitroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Already there are signs that the problem is undermining Intel's reputation, 
just as the company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build a 
brand image among consumers. On the Internet and elsewhere in computing 
circles, the jokes are flying. One refers to the widely displayed "Intel 
Inside" logos on PCs that use Intel chips. Goes the line: "Intel Inside, Can't 
Divide."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; HOLLYWOOD COMBS SCRIPT REPOSITORIES FOR 
GOOD OLD TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Hollywood these days, it's not just talented young writers who are being 
pursued. It's dead ones as well. With the competition for good scripts heating 
up, talent agents and producers are combing through studio vaults and libraries 
for unproduced gems from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much of an archeological expedition," says Creative Artists 
Agency's Jon Levin, who has researched everything from old production logs to 
the memoirs of Hollywood legends. "There are only so many movies that were made 
every year, and a number of more scripts that were developed. So chances are 
there are good (unproduced) works." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin's most significant find so far is a 30-year-old "Don Quixote" project by 
the late Waldo Salt, who won Academy Awards for "Midnight Cowboy" and "Coming 
Home." Warner Bros. is developing the movie in conjunction with Arnon Milchan's 
New Regency Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber was another big advocate of lost 
scripts. As a result of his encouraging producers to rifle through Hollywood's 
vaults, Sony's Columbia Pictures unit is exploring the possibility of making "A 
Nice Place to Visit," an unproduced 1961 comedy by Garson Kanin and Ruth 
Gordon. Sony also released the video of "Twenty Bucks" this year. The 
low-budget film was based on a 49-year-old screenplay written by Endre Bohem. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenario, a New York-based quarterly magazine, publishes unproduced scripts as 
a regular feature. And several talent agencies and studios have assigned 
executives to unearth lost works, which are partly in vogue as a result of 
companies cutting back on the amount of money they spend to develop new 
material. Libraries are another big repository for screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road from the dust bin to the fast track isn't always paved in gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading tens of thousands of scripts that may have been rightfully consigned 
to the junk heap is an intimidating task. Rights issues often have to be 
resolved. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Margaret Herrick 
Library, for one, keeps a tight lid on unproduced scripts out of liability 
concerns. There is no master list of titles, and researchers are forced to sign 
agreements stating that the screenplays will not be copied or otherwise 
appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy library director Linda Mehr says it's "not appropriate" for the 
library to be used as a clearinghouse for material that could be exploited. 
"We're not a shopping agency for people looking for unproduced scripts," she 
said. "People go to agents for that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That helps explain a massive misunderstanding between the academy library and 
the Paul Kohner Agency that has caused a potential mother lode of material to 
remain hidden away. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohner, which once represented such renowned writers as John Huston, William 
Wyler and Billy Wilder, donated about 65 boxes of material to the academy in 
1981, much of it unproduced. Paul Kohner died in 1988. Irene Heymann, a 
longtime agency executive who supervised the donation, says she was 
subsequently told that the unproduced scripts had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an awful lot missing when we got back the inventory that I know I 
had given them," she said. "They said they were unproduced pictures, and they 
couldn't keep them because of copyright complications -- that the ones that 
were unproduced had been shredded." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Salt, another Kohner agent who was there when the scripts were donated, 
said the library continued to tell visitors over the years that the scripts 
were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out clearly thinking they were going to put them into the 
collection," Salt said. "Several years later, people called, knowing we were 
the source of the scripts and wanting duplicates. We asked why. They said, 
'Because the academy disposed of them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, an academy thank-you letter to the Kohner agency that is dated shortly 
after the donation says that "a portion of the unproduced scripts will be 
destroyed" to "avoid potential problems" in accordance with conversations 
between the agency and the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehr, who came on board a year after the Kohner donation, was asked recently 
if the library had destroyed any of the material, and emphatically denied it. 
"There's no basis for that," she said. "Our policy is not to destroy things. 
I'd be outraged if that were the case. There is no way we would have ever 
gotten rid of those scripts. We hold on to those things dearly." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Mehr subsequently launched a search for the missing unproduced 
Kohner scripts and found them last week, sitting in 34 boxes inside the 
academy's remote storage facility. She describes the storage area as a place 
for "things that are not supposed to be seen . . . a no man's land." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly 14 years, neither side can say exactly what's inside, though a 
partial list found by the library contains references to an Orson Welles 
project called "The Dreamers" and an unproduced script that at one time was 
supposed to star Jane and Henry Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann says it's possible there are unproduced works by former clients such 
as Huston and Wilder. Salt says the collection also included Jean Paul Sartre's 
massive original "Freud" screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens next is anyone's guess. The prospect of hordes of people 
descending on the library in search of lost treasures offends Mehr's scholarly 
sensibilities. Plus, she says nothing will change until the Kohner agency 
formally authorizes the release of the scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann says she'll be happy to do so, but there have been misunderstandings 
before, not to mention the thorny liability issue. "I think they should put 
them into their records and let people see them if they want to," Heymann said 
last week. "That was the idea of our gift to the academy in the first place. 
Gee, we might also have a higher tax write-off . . . ." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 NBC chief Robert Wright confirms in this week's issue of Newsweek that merger 
talks are still being held with Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting. Wright says 
Turner and NBC have complementary programming and that Turner is the one 
"orchestrating" the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright also indicates that Turner's powerful partners, Tele-Communications 
Inc. and Time Warner Inc., still have reservations. Turner has been stymied by 
his partners in the past, but he remains adamant about acquiring a network to 
add to CNN and his other assets. Time Warner was separately engaged in serious 
discussions about acquiring a piece of NBC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 As expected, Seymour Stein has been named president of Elektra Entertainment. 
He will report to Elektra Entertainment Group Chairman Sylvia Rhone. In a 
related move, Elektra parent Warner Music has acquired a minority stake in the 
Sub Pop record label, whose artists include Velocity Girl. Sub Pop music will 
be affiliated with Elektra.

investors to reduce expenses, cut the full-time jobs and launched a 
reorganization of its New Jersey-based fashion facility. Kmart Corp. Chairman 
Joseph Antonini said the layoffs, affecting almost every department at Kmart's 
international headquarters, are part of the company's efforts to reduce 
expenses to $600 million from $800 million by 1996.

 Cooper Cos. to Settle Fraud Charges for $2.77 Million: Without admitting or 
denying guilt, the Ft.Lee, N.J.-based maker of ophthalmic products agreed to 
surrender $1.62 million and pay a civil penalty of $1.15 million, according to 
an order by a New York federal court. In an unusual move, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission also released an investigative report criticizing the 
Cooper board for failing to take steps to prevent the fraud. The SEC alleged, 
among other things, that former Cooper executives Gary and Steven Singer 
participated in a manipulative plan to sell high-yield bonds at inflated prices 
to investment funds.

 FDA Panel Rejects U.S. Bioscience Inc.'s Ethyol: The advisory panel 
unanimously killed the firm's second attempt to have Ethyol recommended for 
approval.Ethyol is designed to protect cancer patients from the side effects of 
chemotherapy. The medical experts assembled by the Food and Drug Administration 
found that the drug appears to have some biological effect in ovarian cancer 
patients but not enough to recommend approval. The full FDA generally follows 
its advisory panels' recommendations. The European Union's drug review 
committee recommended approval for Ethyol in September based on the same 
clinical trial data presented to the FDA panel. Britain has approved Ethyol.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BLUE CHIPS UP STRONGLY; BONDS SUFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors waiting anxiously for signs of a year-end rally in stocks saw a 
glimmer of hope in a blue-chip rally Monday, but the overall market closed 
mixed as bond yields rose again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average jumped 27.26 points to 3,718.37 in a late buying 
surge, but advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange were 
nearly even in moderate trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market stole investors' focus once again, as long-term yields 
reversed after sliding last week. In fact, Treasury bond yields rose across the 
board as jittery investors braced for economic reports that could reignite 
inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the government will report on November wholesale prices, and consumer 
prices for the month are due Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were predicting a 0.5% increase in wholesale prices and a 0.3% rise 
in consumer prices. In contrast, wholesale prices fell 0.5% in October, and 
consumer prices were up just 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say slightly higher prices would reflect the economy's strength and 
would thus increase the odds that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to 
tighten credit to restrain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market, fearing higher-than-expected inflation numbers, pushed the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.92% on Monday from 7.85% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, last week's sharp declines in the wake of Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing led some bargain hunters to Wall Street, but the blue chips' 
rally was offset by a plunge in key technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index, laden with tech issues, added just 0.07 point to 
719.12, but that was much improved from its low for the day of 712.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "after the calm of the weekend and the realization that Orange County 
isn't going to go down the drain, things have begun to stabilize" in the stock 
market, said Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First 
Securities in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, however, worry that another jump in interest rates could sound 
a death knell for stocks, as more investors return to bank CDs and other 
now-higher-yielding short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Blue-chip issues rebounding included Alcoa, up 1 3/8 at 80 1/4; 3M, up 1 1/4 
at 52 3/4; International Paper, up 1 at 73, Dow Chemical, up 1 1/8 at 64; 
Mobil, up 1 7/8 at 85 1/8, and Texaco, up 2 at 62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retailers got a boost as a cold snap spurred holiday apparel sales. 
Dayton Hudson surged 2 to 78 1/2, Nordstrom rocketed 3 1/8 to 46 5/8 and Sears 
added 7/8 to 44 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks also continued their recent rebound. The Dow utility index 
jumped 2.31 points, or 1.3%, to 181.65. Rising utility stocks have historically 
signaled interest rate peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, computer chip giant Intel led a selloff in many tech 
issues, after IBM announced it was suspending shipments of PCs run by Intel's 
troubled Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel plunged 2 3/8 to 60 3/8 in extremely heavy trading of 16 million shares. 
IBM lost 7/8 to 70 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling spread to other computer makers, with Dell dropping 1 1/4 to 39 
5/8, Gateway 2000 off 3/8 at 22 and Compaq down 7/8 at 39. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Dynamics leaped 3 3/4 to 42 3/8 and McDonnell Douglas was off 1/2 at 
142 1/2 after a federal claims court judge on Friday vacated the Navy's A-12 
attack jet contract termination, which the companies have been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, London's FTSE 100-stock index fell 33.9 points to 2,943.4, 
while Frankfurt's DAX index eased 3.51 points to 2,024.82. Tokyo stocks lost 
early gains and closed a little lower. The 225-share Nikkei average slipped 
3.20 points to 18,975.10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City market was closed for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodities trading, January crude oil futures dropped 22 cents a 
barrel to $16.91 on the New York Merc after gasoline futures plunged anew, 
reacting to word that the government will not enforce a Jan. 1 deadline in the 
Northeast to use cleaner "reformulated" gasoline.

MUNICIPAL BOND YIELDS RISE

<P>
 Municipal bond yields inched up Monday amid lingering concern about Orange 
County's bankruptcy filing and a rebound in yields on U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think people are afraid there will be another Orange County," said 
Paul Hylle, who manages about $1.6 billion in funds at IDS Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Muni yields both in and outside California jumped last week as some investors 
bailed out of bonds. The market had calmed Friday, but many analysts said 
investors remain uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds issued by Orange County continue to be priced from 60 to 85 cents on the 
dollar, depending on the security, but dealers say few are trading at those 
fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major California muni bond mutual funds saw their prices erode by 1 to 3 
cents a share Monday, reflecting further downward pressure on California bond 
values in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the Bond Buyer muni yield index rose to 7.06% on Monday from 7.04% 
on Friday.

 Santa Fe May Try Leveraged Buyout: The Schaumburg, Ill.-based railroad, hoping 
to defeat a hostile takeover bid by Union Pacific Corp., is reportedly 
assembling a leveraged buyout that could help complete a merger with Burlington 
Northern Inc. Santa Fe Pacific Corp. would not comment on the report in the 
Journal of Commerce, although the LBO is a familiar tactic for the 
railroad.Burlington Northern and Union Pacific have made competing offers worth 
more than $3 billion each to acquire the parent company of Atcheson, Topeka & 
Santa Fe Railway Co. A leveraged buyout is Santa Fe's latest move to fend off 
Union Pacific. Its argument that the government would not allow the combination 
fell apart after regulators approved an independent trust for Santa Fe.

U.S. WORKERS WAX POSITIVE IN NEW POLL; WORKPLACE: THE RESULTS ARE A SURPRISE IN

 Despite widespread restructurings and recent downsizings at many U.S. 
companies, workers report feeling almost as secure in their jobs now as they 
did in 1987, and about two-thirds say they are happy with their jobs, according 
to a national survey to be released today by a Washington consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 WorkUSA survey, conducted from July to September by Wyatt Co., asked 
more than 4,300 employees about a variety of work-related issues. Wyatt 
conducted similar surveys in 1987, 1989 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55% of the respondents agreed this year that their companies provide 
good job security, down slightly from the 58% who felt that way in 1987. About 
65% of the respondents said they were satisfied with their jobs, while only 10% 
said they were dissatisfied, virtually the same as in earlier surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 The results surprised Wyatt officials, who attributed the positive attitudes 
both to the recovering economy and to the trend of companies retaining more 
specially trained employees who would feel more confident in their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are seeing is that jobs in organizations are moving more and more 
toward jobs that are individually knowledge-based," said Paul Sanchez, director 
of survey operations for Wyatt. "These employees, because they have the 
training, have a higher degree of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Chasnov, a consultant with Hay Group, a Los Angeles-based human 
resources management consulting firm, said the improving economy was more of a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are feeling more upbeat with the economy and their jobs," Chasnov 
said. "Most of the corporate downsizings have already taken place, and that 
activity is slowing significantly. . . . It might be a little early (for 
employees to feel confident), but it's a refreshing change, because if people 
are feeling more confident, they're spending more and thus making the economy 
even stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said the survey was compiled from a random sampling of Americans 
working in companies with more than 100 employees, which represents about 65% 
of the total U.S. work force. That portion of the population, Sanchez said, 
would probably feel happier and more secure at work than employees of smaller 
companies, which could more easily fall victim to rough economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, the survey found that more than two-thirds of the respondents 
felt their companies did not pay them enough, take their input into 
consideration when making decisions or promote the most competent employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, most employees said they felt their companies were 
doing a better job with customers and informing the workers of company goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employees say that they are getting more information from above," Wyatt 
consultant Gwen Stern said. "But it's not yet a two-way street. Many employees 
are frustrated that they don't have more say in work decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survey's other findings was that significantly fewer African 
Americans felt satisfied with their jobs (56%) than did Latinos (72%), Asian 
Pacific Islanders (70%) and whites (65%). 
</P>
<P>
 Also, more women reported being satisfied with their jobs (66%) than did men 
(63%). However, 62% of the men said they are paid fairly, compared to 58% of 
the women. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of age differences, the report found so-called Generation X employees 
(those under 30) to be the most positive, while the baby boomers (ages 30 to 
49) to be the least positive. For instance, 50% of Generation Xers said their 
company was well-managed, compared to 41% of the baby boomers. Stern attributed 
this to the fact that younger employees are new to the work force and largely 
escaped the negative changes of a few years ago.

MAJOR HMOS ANNOUNCE SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES

 PacifiCare Health Systems on Monday announced the unexpected retirement of one 
of its co-founders and top executives, and the return of a key executive who 
two months ago defected to a big Midwest health care company. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated management change at another Southern California health 
maintenance organization, Glendale-based Cigna HealthCare of California said 
President Mark Wagar resigned just seven months after he was named to that 
post. A Cigna spokesman said Wagar resigned to "pursue other business 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigna had announced to customers last month that Wagar had been granted a 
personal leave of absence. The company said his resignation, announced late 
Friday, was effective Dec. 2. Cigna spokesman Jim Hill said the leave of 
absence was not for health reasons, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigna, which has 650,000 members in California, said Wagar's position will be 
filled temporarily by chief counsel Leslie Margolin. The company has begun 
searching for a permanent replacement, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagar, who joined Cigna in 1992, was named president of the company's 
California operations in May. He succeeded Bert Wagener, who was promoted to a 
senior executive post with Cigna in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, PacifiCare announced that co-founder and Executive Vice President 
Richard Lipeles will retire in November, 1995. Lipeles, 41, who helped found 
PacifiCare in 1978, will remain a consultant and director after his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress-based HMO also said that former executive Jeffrey Folick, who was 
lured away by Minneapolis-based United Healthcare in November, has decided to 
return to the company. Folick, former president and chief executive of 
PacifiCare's California operations, will become executive vice president and 
chief operating officer of the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick, 47, will oversee PacifiCare's national business operations for its 
commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health plans beginning Jan. 3, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving Southern California and leaving PacifiCare was more difficult than I 
expected it to be," said Folick, a longtime resident of Southern California. He 
said the new job is attractive because it offers him broader responsibilities 
at PacifiCare, which has 1.4 million members in six states. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we will be sorry to see Rich Lipeles retire from PacifiCare, we are 
very pleased that Jeff Folick has decided to remain in Southern California and 
assume this important position with our company," said Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick's former job as president and chief executive of PacifiCare of 
California and head of the company's Western region will be filled by Jon 
Wampler, the firm's top executive in Texas, the company said. Those duties had 
been filled on an interim basis by Lipeles.

DEAL WOULD CREATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE GIANT; ENERGY: WILLIAMS SEEKS 
CONTROLLING STAKE IN TRANSCO FOR $3 BILLION. WALL STREET HAS QUESTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Williams Cos., a major operator of natural gas pipelines, said Monday that it 
will pay $3 billion for a controlling stake in Transco Energy Co., a deal that 
would create the nation's biggest natural gas carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Williams would acquire up to 24.6 million shares, or 60%, 
of Transco's common stock for $17.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase price is a 39% premium over Friday's closing price for Transco's 
common stock. On Monday, Transco shares jumped $3.625 to $16.25 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, while Williams' sank $2.75 to $24.125. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the transaction would create a natural gas carrier with 27,000 
miles of pipeline crisscrossing the country. The company would transport 4 
trillion British thermal units of gas each year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street traders said Williams' stock fell because the companies, in a 
conference call, did not sufficiently spell out the reasons for the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Bailey, president, chief executive and chairman of Williams, said the 
company will be able to more "fully describe the benefits" of the merger to 
shareholders once it has made regulatory filings concerning the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is constrained from talking about the deal until that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said the deal must be approved under U.S. antitrust laws and that 
approval is expected in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they have been in discussions about the merger for the past 
few weeks and that their boards approved the deal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Transco's properties include Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., which 
operates 10,500 miles of pipeline extending from the Gulf of Mexico through the 
South and along the Eastern Seaboard to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main customers are natural gas and electric utility companies in the East 
and Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also owns Texas Gas Transmission Corp., an Owensboro, Ky., 
operator of 6,100 miles of pipeline that runs from the Louisiana Gulf Coast up 
the Mississippi River Valley to Indiana and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams owns Northwest Pipeline Corp., a 3,900-mile interstate natural gas 
pipeline system that serves the Pacific Northwest. It also owns Williams 
Natural Gas Co., a 6,200-mile natural gas pipeline that feeds the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams also owns WilTel, a telecommunications firm that 
built a national fiber-optic network in the late 1980s.

 Short-Term Treasury Bill Rates Drop: The interest rates fell in auction to the 
lowest level in two weeks.The Treasury Department sold $13.7 billion in 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.76%, down from 5.83% last 
week. Another $13.7 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 6.32%, down from 6.33%. The three-month bill rate was the lowest since 
it averaged 5.44% on Nov. 28. The six-month bill rate was the lowest since it 
averaged 5.86%, also on Nov. 28. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors: 5.93% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,854.40, and 6.62% for a six-month bill selling for $9,680.50.

billion in the July-September quarter, compared to $1.24 billion in the 
previous three months. With short-term interest rates continuing to climb, 
thrifts paid out 3.63% of their assets in interest expenses, compared to 3.42% 
for the second quarter. Interest income rose more slowly in the third quarter,

 Cold Snap Heats Up Sales: Chilly weekend weather gave apparel retailers a shot 
in the arm, stirring demand for winter clothing as the sprint to Christmas 
nears its finish, industry analysts said. Holiday sales had slowed at several 
large chains earlier this month as warm weather hit many areas. Some experts 
began to doubt forecasts of robust sales. But the cold front that blew through 
the Midwest and East last week jump-started apparel sales.

DOES YOUR PC HAVE THE PENTIUM BUG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flaw in Intel's Pentium computer chip involves the so-called floating 
point unit, which performs certain high-speed mathematical operations. 
Specifically, the Pentium makes mistakes on a very specific set of floating 
point division operations. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to think about it is to visualize the way we were all taught to do 
long division with paper and pencil. When we divide long numbers by hand, we 
actually spend most of our time multiplying numbers down the page in order to 
find the largest number that will go into the numbers remaining in the 
dividend. People who have the multiplication tables memorized beyond nine times 
nine can divide a lot faster than the rest of us -- if, of course, they have 
memorized the tables correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pentium divides floating point numbers, it uses a look-up table 
embedded in the chip: The table tells it the quotient for division of any two 
pairs of binary numbers. (Computers use binary numbers -- ones and zeros -- at 
the chip level to represent the numbers we humans understand.) The look-up 
table in the Pentium is a matrix with about 1,500 numbers, but five entries 
were mistakenly left out. Whenever a Pentium encounters division of two pairs 
of binary numbers where the missing entries should be, it assumes the quotient 
is zero, when in fact it should be two. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel says only one in 9 billion sets of randomly generated numbers could be 
expected to trigger the error, and thus the average computer user is likely to 
encounter it only once in 27,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM did its own probability analysis and concluded that a more likely 
error rate is once in every 100 million division operations. IBM said typical 
financial spreadsheet users could encounter an error every 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combine this with the fact that there are millions of Pentium users 
worldwide, and we quickly come to the conclusion that on a typical day a large 
number of people are making mistakes in their computations without realizing 
it," IBM said in a summary of its findings posted on the Internet on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Does your computer have the Pentium bug? Even if you don't have a Pentium, you 
can try these tests to see which answer you get. All you need is a spreadsheet 
program or even the Windows calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 Compute the following division formula: (4,195,835 x 256) (3,145,727 256). A 
Pentium computer with the flawed chip will erroneously answer 87,407.9, while a 
486 computer will correctly answer 87,413.3. If you want to see how specific 
this problem is, try changing any one digit in any one of the numbers. You 
should then get the same result whether you do the problem on a Pentium or a PC 
with another microprocessor. If not, maybe you've discovered another cluster of 
numbers that cause the problem. RICHARD O'REILLY

COMPANY TOWN; BEACH BOYS' MIKE LOVE WINS HIS CASE, STANDS TO COLLECT MILLIONS; 
MUSIC: A FEDERAL JURY SIDES WITH LEAD SINGER IN A DISPUTE OVER AN AWARD RELATED 
TO THE SALE OF THE GROUP'S SONG CATALOGUE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beach Boys lead singer Mike Love on Monday won songwriting credits and past 
and future royalties for 35 of the group's songs, a decision that could net him 
at least $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury unanimously found that band co-founder Brian Wilson and his 
lawyers failed to make good on a promise to give Love a 30% share of a 
$10-million settlement Wilson won in connection with the 1969 sale of the 
band's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming damages phase of the trial will determine exactly how much money 
Love will receive, as well as punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors found that Wilson was not liable for punitive damages but that 
attorneys who represented him in the song-sale case are liable. Love sat 
quietly as the judge read the 25-page verdict form, which took 28 minutes to 
complete. Wilson was not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors reached their verdict after deliberating over an eight-day period after 
an eight-week trial. Love had argued that he deserved money and additional 
writing credits for his alleged contributions to 79 songs, from "California 
Girls" to "Good Vibrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lawyers argued that Love is about 30 years too late in bringing up 
the matter, further alleging that he was seeking credit for songs he didn't 
write or hardly contributed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Love asked for a third of a $10-million out-of-court settlement Wilson 
received in 1992 after he alleged that the Beach Boys' "Sea of Tunes" song 
catalogue was fraudulently sold by his domineering father, the late Murry 
Wilson, for $700,000 to Irving Music. 
</P>
<P>
 The $700,000 paid for the catalogue is considered a huge bargain today. Some 
estimate it could be worth $40 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, both Love and Wilson took the stand to testify, along with 
other members of the group, including Bruce Johnston and Al Jardine.

 Music: Singer George Michael lost a bid Monday to speed up an appeal in his 
legal battle for a "divorce" from record company Sony Corp. Michael, who 
British courts say is tied to a contract with Sony that has six albums and 10 
years to run, wanted to accelerate his appeal against the ruling, saying his 
career remains "blighted" until it is settled. The singer's career was becoming 
"a wasting asset," his attorney Charles Gray argued."Millions and millions of 
people all over the world listen to this man's music. There is deprivation over 
a huge field." But the British Court of Appeal ruled there is no good reason to 
let the 30-year-old singer's case leapfrog over others. Michael has already run 
up legal bills totaling about $4.7 million trying to scrap his 15-year contract 
with the company, and he has vowed he will never record for Sony again.

COMPANY TOWN; NEWS ANALYSIS; NBC CHALLENGE LIKELY TO SLOW FOX; TELEVISION: 
ANALYSTS SAY STATION OWNERS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SELL UNTIL THE FCC SORTS OUT 
THE NETWORK BATTLE.

<P>
 In the war between NBC and Fox being waged on the battleground of the Federal 
Communications Commission, the first impact is likely to be a chilling effect 
on Fox's plans to purchase TV stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has challenged Fox's planned acquisition of two Fox affiliates, WFXT-TV in 
Boston and WTXF-TV in Philadelphia. On Friday, NBC filed petitions asking the 
FCC to deny the transfer of ownership of two NBC affiliates and one ABC 
affiliate -- WVUE-TV in New Orleans, WALA-TV in Mobile, Ala., and KHON-TV in 
Honolulu -- to a separate Fox-related partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Those stations had been acquired, pending FCC approval, by SF Broadcasting, a 
joint venture between Fox Television and Savoy Pictures. Fox says it is a 
non-voting partner in the deal, but NBC says Fox is attempting to use the 
partnership to get around ownership limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The question in the NBC-Fox fight is whether Fox, as part of Rupert Murdoch's 
Australia-based News Corp., is a foreign-controlled company that is violating 
longstanding laws against foreign ownership of U.S. broadcasting companies. 
Ninety-nine percent of the funds used to buy the original station group came 
from News Corp, but the network maintains that Murdoch, who became a U.S. 
citizen, has voting control over the stations and de facto control of News 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has filed a petition before the FCC, charging that the stations that 
formed the heart of the Fox station group violate the law that forbids 
foreigners from owning more than 25% of a broadcast station's license. NBC is 
asking the FCC to bar Fox from owning any new stations or, if it does not take 
that action, to allow NBC and other station owners to sell parts of their 
companies to foreign buyers.

 NBC had already challenged the purchase of WLUK-TV, the NBC affiliate in Green 
Bay, Wis., by SF Broadcasting. The loss of Green Bay, NBC executives 
acknowledge, was the straw that broke the peacock's back in deciding to 
challenge Fox's ownership. The total purchase price of the four stations is 
estimated at $267 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC is not going to act on applications for transfer while they're 
investigating Fox's ownership," said Ted Hepburn, a media broker who has been 
buying and selling TV stations for 25 years. "Sellers might be reluctant to 
make a (station) deal with Fox until they see how this thing comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides station acquisitions, Hepburn said, "I would imagine that people who 
might have tried to get Fox to back them in a non-voting equity way, like the 
SF deal, also will put their plans on hold."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hepburn added, SF Broadcasting-type partnerships in general could be 
affected. "I've already had a call from someone who was thinking of structuring 
a deal similar to the SF deal, expressing concern that the FCC might rule 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Atarino, an entertainment analyst with Dillon Read, agrees. "Potential 
sellers could have second thoughts and get some contingencies built into the 
deals," he said. "It's like buying a house. There may be some kind of financial 
adjustments built into the deal to provide compensation to the seller if the 
deal gets delayed or undone." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston Padden, president of network distribution for Fox Broadcasting, 
declined to comment on the impact of the FCC's inquiry on Fox's pending station 
buys. But Charles Giddens, managing director of Media Ventures Partners, which 
is handling some of the Fox deals, said in an interview: "None of our sellers 
are panicking. Some deals may get delayed because the FCC is reviewing them. 
But our sellers believe that Fox ultimately will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building of the Fox network originally was praised as a way to 
bring new competition to the broadcast marketplace, NBC and others charge that 
Fox, now a major competitor, has received special privileges.  
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC has consistently granted Fox significant regulatory advantages," NBC 
general counsel Richard Cotton said. "NBC is prepared to compete head-to-head 
with Fox. But fair competition requires that everybody plays under the same 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox executives have questioned the timing of NBC's actions, saying the 
broadcast networks did not have a problem with Fox until it raided their 
network affiliates and took NFL football away from the Big Three broadcasters. 
In documents countering NBC's challenge, Fox charged, "NBC isn't concerned 
about the appropriate application of FCC rules but about the collapse of the 
old boy's club that has dominated network broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
 But Neil Braun, president of the NBC network, said in an interview: "We're 
after one thing: a leveling of the playing field. If someone does something 
against the law and against your interest, don't you think you should use the 
law to protect your interest?" 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, some industry observers say, NBC could benefit from the FCC 
inquiry. If the FCC rules to allow foreign ownership, NBC, which has been 
seeking a minority partner, could be able to look abroad for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC is expected to meet Thursday to begin discussing TV ownership rules. 
Sources say the discussion could send a signal about how deeply a company such 
as Fox can be involved with a station's ownership and not count the station 
against the limit of 12.

SETTLEMENT GIVES U.S. CRACK AT JAPAN'S FLAT-GLASS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Japan announced settlement Monday of longstanding 
complaints that foreign manufacturers of window glass and related products have 
been systematically excluded from the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the agreement constitutes a 
significant crack in Japan's system of closely interlocked business networks 
that have proved very hard for foreigners to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the agreement, Japan's three dominant producers of flat glass 
will issue a statement reaffirming that Japanese glass distributors are free to 
purchase from foreign suppliers if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said this would provide vital "cover" to 
distributors, most of whom have been unwilling to offend the three dominant 
Japanese flat-glass manufacturers by purchasing foreign products. Distributors 
will pledge not to discriminate based on the nationality of a glass supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been the pattern in recent trade agreements between the two powers, the 
Japanese side offered a very different picture of the dispute and the 
significance of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agreement calls for a detailed monitoring of imports, no goals are 
set for increasing foreign market share. "These discussions were based on the 
principles of free trade, including the avoidance of numerical targets," 
Ryutaro Hashimoto, minister of international trade and industry, said in a 
prepared statement, suggesting a victory for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to see concrete results within the next year," said Deputy U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. "To the extent we don't . . . there 
will be action under U.S. trade laws." American firms now get less than 1% of 
the $4.5 billion in annual flat-glass product sales in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan imports relatively little flat glass, as does Europe, a Japanese 
official said. That is not because the Japanese and European markets are 
closed, the official said, "it's because glass is bulky and breakable, so it's 
not good to send it by ship." About 3% of U.S. flat-glass production is shipped 
to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph J. Gerson, president of Guardian International Corp., a leading U.S. 
flat-glass manufacturer, challenged that statement. "Japanese plants are 
shipping glass all over Asia by ship," he said. "We can be very competitive in 
Japan. Prices are much higher because there has been a cartel. All we've asked 
for is a chance to sell."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LUMPS OF COAL FILL KROQ'S 2ND STOCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the first night of of KROQ's "Almost Acoustic Christmas" benefit on 
Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre was a sweepstakes mega-winner, with such 
exciting and passionate acts as Hole, Liz Phair, Luscious Jackson and the Jesus 
and Mary Chain, the second night on Sunday, with one blase band after the next, 
was the cheesy door prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple Minds, Brian Setzer and Love Spit Love (with Richard Butler of the 
Psychedelic Furs) were able to motivate the audience only with old, proven 
hits, while even more recent acts -- such as Sheryl Crow and the Black Crowes 
-- rang of retro. 
</P>
<P>
 Weak "alternative" bands such as the Cranberries, Candlebox and Weezer sounded 
like diluted versions of Sinead O'Connor and Nirvana. The entire five-hour show 
show seemed to linger in a void of mediocrity, with no one artist ever truly 
hitting a nerve or standing apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaur Jr. took the honors for best set -- a rare win for a band that's 
renowned for its noisy and shapeless live shows. As the antithesis of acoustic, 
the trio inspired much of the crowd to plug its ears against its wall of 
massive guitar pop. The din eventually mutated into a hypnotic mantra that 
lifted rather than smashed the listener. 
</P>
<P>
 Second best were the Black Crowes, whose set consisted mainly of material from 
their 1991 debut album. The Georgia band played a strong set of Faces-inspired 
tunes while singer Chris Robinson hammed up each line as if he were delivering 
a sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst act from the Saturday show, Live, came back as a substitute for the 
scheduled Mazzy Star and played one more excruciating set marked by 
over-dramatic vocals. Seal's smooth R&B was more suited to a dinner party than 
a rock show. Singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, one of the year's best-selling 
arrivals, turned in a set of generic adult-pop, while Setzer's 16-piece 
orchestra gave the audience the tightest blast from the past: a big-band 
rendition of his old Stray Cats hit "Rock This Town." 
</P>
<P>
 The finale came with Simple Minds -- the veteran Scottish band thought to have 
gone the way of skinny ties -- doing its 1985 hit "Don't You Forget About Me." 
That title seemed like an appropriate but futile plea for the whole evening.

TV REVIEW; 'SCIENCE FICTION' ON FOX IS A JOURNEY INTO TV HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MARGULIES, TIMES TELEVISION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Science fiction has been a programming staple throughout television's history. 
Yet it has never been a big ratings getter; the only sci-fi shows that have 
ever finished in the Top 20 for a season have been "The Six Million Dollar Man" 
and "The Bionic Woman" (unless you count "Bewitched" or "My Favorite Martian" . 
. . or "The Millionaire"). 
</P>
<P>
 Why this is so, and why TV executives keep trying such series anyway, are 
questions that never get asked in tonight's "Science Fiction: A Journey Into 
the Unknown." Instead, the Museum of Television & Radio, which produced the 
two-hour program, is content to chronicle the shows that have populated this 
genre -- from the standard-bearing "Star Trek" and "The Twilight Zone" to such 
forgettable efforts as "Battlestar Galactica" and "The Invaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort serves as a pleasant reminder that, ratings notwithstanding, there 
have been a lot of memorable sci-fi shows on the tube -- some of which managed 
to comment on the human predicament as pointedly as any contemporary drama, 
some of which simply offered cool monsters and special effects. The clips are 
grouped by subject -- aliens, outer space, time travel, robots, the macabre -- 
and cover a wide array of programming that includes "Time Tunnel," "Max 
Headroom," "Babylon 5," "Lost in Space," "The Outer Limits" and "The Prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
 But no mention of cable's Sci-Fi Channel? For shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Science Fiction: A Journey Into the Unknown" airs at 8 tonight on Fox 
(Channels 11 and 6).

JAZZ REVIEW; STEPHANIE HAYNES: READY FOR THE MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that Los Angeles has a large number of first-rate jazz 
performers who have difficulty finding work, much less landing a recording 
contract. Music business professionals offer various explanations: a surplus of 
talent, the complexities of developing new artists, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of singer Stephanie Haynes, however, the only logical rationale 
for her mystifying absence from the roster of a major jazz record label has to 
be a kind of mass executive auditory myopia. Appearing Sunday afternoon on a 
Hermosa Beach "Jazz at the Beach" program, Haynes confirmed -- as she does 
virtually every time she performs -- that she is one of the finest jazz singers 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the piano accompaniment of frequent musical partner Dave MacKay, 
Haynes was brilliant. Her voice is a sumptuous contralto that moves easily from 
resonant chest tones into a rich, focused soprano. But Haynes, unlike Sarah 
Vaughan, who is clearly an influence, never allowed her exquisite sound to 
dominate an interpretation. On ballads such as "If You Could See Me Now," for 
example, the warmth of her tone and her elegant musical revisions of phrase 
were placed at the service of a poignant rendering of the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 On faster pieces -- "Let's Get Lost," "Get Out of Town" and Antonio Carlos 
Jobim's "Useless Landscape" -- her firm sense of timing came to the fore. 
Reverting to scat syllables only once or twice, she demonstrated that true jazz 
singing has far more to do with the lift and momentum that is generated by 
precisely swinging rhythmic phrasing than it does with rapid-fire successions 
of mindless shoo-be-doos. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKay was a perfect accompanist. Like Haynes, he maintained a relentless 
drive via rhythmic implication and inference. Working on an electric 
Fender-Rhodes instrument, he adapted his playing accordingly, replacing his 
subtle acoustic piano touch with hard- grooving bass lines and ringing tonal 
clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Were there any open-eared record company honchos in the highly responsive 
crowd? Unlikely. If there were, Stephanie Haynes would be signing a contract 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jazz at the Beach continues Sunday on lower Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach 
with an appearance by the Southbay Big Swing and Jazz Orchestra. Performances 
from noon to 4. Admission free. Information: (310) 376-0951.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TAPED TRACKS WEAKEN WILTERN 'HOLIDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most artists invariably look pretty silly singing to taped instrumental 
tracks. So such singers as Mary J. Blige, Blackstreet, Immature and Shanice 
were doomed from the start of Sunday's second annual "Holiday Cooldown," an R&B 
extravaganza at the Wiltern Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this show, sponsored by KKBT-FM, was to benefit a worthy cause -- My 
Friend's Place, a resource center for homeless kids. And you really had to give 
the artists the benefit of the doubt, realizing that most would have come 
across much better backed by a live band. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's cattle-call approach also operated against anyone's making a 
significant impact. The limit was four songs, and following their brief 
performances the artists were shuffled offstage to make way for awkward patter 
sessions, with hosts Barry White and Karyn White bantering with the KKBT 
deejays. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there's an art to singing to backing tracks, but most of these 
singers didn't seem to have a clue about it. They were constantly ahead of or 
behind the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Immature, who are in their early teens, fared the worst, 
engaging in a game of tag with the beat -- and never quite catching up to it. 
The vocal group Blackstreet, which has the big hit "Before I Let You Go," and 
the female group Changing Faces, with the steamy "Stroke You Up," did the best 
job working with the taped tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the worst performer was Blige, who was singing songs from her new 
album, "My Life." She undermined her considerable vocal talent with some 
unbelievably klutzy dance moves and by registering a big zero on the charisma 
meter. 
</P>
<P>
 The two artists who sounded best were singer-songwriter Brian McKnight and the 
R&B vocal group Silk. That's because neither used the canned accompaniment, 
opting instead for simple solo piano backing on their ballads. It's amazing how 
rich the sound of a live instrument can be after a steady diet of taped tracks.

 Investors waiting anxiously for an overall year-end rally in stocks were 
disappointed Monday, though blue-chip stocks closed with double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury yields rose as jittery investors braced for price reports that could 
suggest that higher interest rates have not restrained inflation. The yield on 
the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 7.92% from 7.85% on Friday.

 Today's November producer price index and a consumer price report due later in 
the week are expected to show some inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were predicting a 0.5% increase in wholesale prices and a 0.3% rise 
in prices at the consumer level. Producer prices fell 0.5% in October, while 
consumer prices rose 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's sharp stock declines due to the investment turmoil surrounding 
Orange County led some bargain hunters into the market, but there was 
uncertainty on the inflation front and weakness in the technology issues. The 
competing forces left stocks mixed to slightly higher at the close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 27.26 points to 3,718.37, but 
advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange were nearly even, 
with 1,123 declining, 1,112 advancing and 699 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.51 at 449.47. The Nasdaq 
composite, which suffered the most during the day due to its high concentration 
of technology issues, recovered and was up 0.07 at the close to 719.12. 
</P>
<P>
 The market suffered heavy losses last week after Orange County's risky 
investment strategies put it in Bankruptcy Court. But analysts said Monday that 
the selling went too far, making some buying likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the calm of the weekend and the realization that Orange County isn't 
going to go down the drain, things have begun to stabilize," said Don R. Hays, 
director of investment strategy at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Sons 
in St. Louis, said a report by the newsletter Investors Intelligence showed the 
percentage of bears in the market at 59.1%, the highest level since April, 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Some market theorists hold that the number of pessimists has peaked and that a 
turn upward in investor optimism is due. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is acting like the sellers are just about exhausted and December 
is the best month of the year for stocks," Goldman said. "When you come into 
mid-December having had a very bad six weeks, that enhances the chances of 
getting a knee-jerk bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Among sectors benefiting from the bargain hunting were economically sensitive 
blue-chip, retail and utility stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a lot of just a return to reason," said Hays at Wheat First 
Securities. "Last week it was a real lemming type of stampede to sell anything 
at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, a rush to sell Intel and other high-tech stocks Monday 
after IBM announced it was halting shipments of its Pentium-based PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, which called IBM's decision unwarranted, ended off 2 3/8 at 60 3/8 on 
heavy trading of more than 16 million shares. IBM closed 7/8 lower at 70 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling spread to other computer makers, with Dell dropping 1 1/4 to 39 
5/8 and Gateway 2000 dipping 3/8 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a little bit of a panic going on in the tech stocks," said Bob Smith, 
institutional trader at Janney Montgomery Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's reaction to today's data on November producer price 
inflation and Wednesday's consumer price numbers will provide clues as to Wall 
Street's direction in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers got a boost as a cold snap spurred holiday apparel sales. Dayton 
Hudson rose 2 to 78 1/2 and Nordstrom climbed 3 1/8 to 46 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Williams, a major operator of natural gas pipelines, said it will buy a 
controlling stake Transco Energy for $3 billion. Williams fell 2 3/4 to 24 1/8 
and Transco jumped 3 5/8 to 16 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Dynamics leaped 3 3/4 to 42 3/8 and McDonnell Douglas was off 1/2 at 
142 1/2 after a federal claims court judge on Friday vacated the Navy's A-12 
attack jet contract termination, which the companies have been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, January crude oil closed down 22 cents a 
barrel at $16.91 after gasoline futures plunged on news that the government 
will not enforce a Jan. 1 deadline in the Northeast to use cleaner 
"reformulated" gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 January gasoline dropped to 50.70 cents a gallon before closing at 51.06, down 
1.63. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip London FTSE 100-stock index closed near the session's low, down 
33.9 at 2,943.4. German stocks also closed lower, with sentiment hit by weaker 
futures. The DAX index ended down 3.51 points at 2,024.82. Tokyo stocks lost 
earlier gains and closed a little lower as small-lot selling hit cash prices in 
thin trading. The 225-share Nikkei average closed down 3.20 at 18,975.10.

N.Y.'S EX-BANKING ADVISER MORE TROUBLED BY O.C.; FINANCE: INCOMPETENCE COST BIG 
APPLE IN '70S, HE SAYS, BUT ORANGE COUNTY WAS 'GAMBLING PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York investment banker who helped that city avoid filing for 
bankruptcy during the mid-1970s said the lack of oversight on former 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron makes Orange County's financial mess 
even more troubling than the Big Apple's brush with disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can apply moral judgment, it's worse, the Orange County situation," 
said Felix Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres & Co. in New York. "Our 
situation was just irresponsibility and incompetence, but in Orange County's 
case it was gambling people's money away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always more than one culprit; it takes many people to tango in these 
things," he said. "The question of what kind of ground rules should be set up 
for these investments, and what kind of supervision there was, is what needs to 
be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn, reached while vacationing in Venice, Italy, said he didn't have 
enough information to judge whether the Orange County Board of Supervisors was 
correct last week in deciding to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the filing resulted in exactly the sort of loss of control that he was 
proud of having helped New York avoid, he said. "We always felt that bankruptcy 
clearly would be the last resort," he said, "that it would create such levels 
of uncertainty, in terms of welfare checks, or paying off the cops, paying off 
the bondholders, that it would create a dynamic reduction in services and 
probably drive businesses and taxpayers out of the city because of the 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing that bankruptcy could accomplish that we couldn't 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Enlisted by Gov. Hugh Carey in 1975, Rohatyn chaired the newly created 
Municipal Assistance Corp., which oversaw the refinancing of the city's debt, 
and advised officials as they cut services, capital spending and jobs in order 
to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also created a Financial Control Board, with representatives of the 
state and city controller's offices and the public, to monitor the city's debt 
and revenue projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County might consider setting up similar boards, Rohatyn said. 
Administrators are pursuing the right types of solutions in hiring outside 
consultants, such as former State Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes as its financial 
adviser during it restructuring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn said he didn't know enough to offer additional suggestions except to 
point out that Orange County doesn't have the social spending needs that many 
large cities face. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in Orange County isn't the result of the urban problems that 
are bringing the major cities into the budgetary problems that are caused by 
joblessness or poverty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems of Orange County were created by running a big casino with 
taxpayer funds, and losing. That's a very difficult situation, in terms of 
rescheduling debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn stepped down from the assistance corporation in 1993, handing the 
reins over to a protege. He left saying he did not wish the agency's criticisms 
of the budget of then-Mayor David Dinkins to appear to be in conflict with his 
personal endorsement of the mayor during his reelection campaign.

 Shopper Profiles: Some holiday gift-shopping advice from American Demographics 
magazine, courtesy of Stephanie D. Greene, marketing director at Westminster 
Mall: Before shopping, find out what kind of shopper you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasers buy presents that are designed to please friends and family.Providers 
buy gifts that are useful -- jeans for the kids or an appliance for the 
homemaker. Compensators hope that their gifts make up for previous 
deficiencies, while socializers pick gifts they think the receiver should have. 
Acknowledgers use gifts to fulfill real or imagined obligations to co-workers, 
distant relatives and business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you don't fit any of American Demographics' categories? 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that you're an avoider: someone who opts not to give gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "By not giving gifts, the avoider sends a clear message that she or he does 
not want any relationship at all" with would-be gift recipients, Greene said. 
"That may be suitable in some situations, but a chronic avoider is likely to 
wind up unhappy and alone during the festive holiday season."

 Top Cooks: El Pollo Loco has presented checks totaling $3,500 to six finalists 
in the Irvine-based restaurant chain's annual Chicken Challenge cook-off. Cooks 
represented restaurants in four states and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than a test of speed and quality," said Ray Perry, president of 
El Pollo Loco. "These cooks take pride in their work comparable to the chefs at 
many fine restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 One Orange County chicken cook placed in the top six. Rafael Villalobos, who 
works at an El Pollo Loco restaurant on Harbor Boulevard in Garden Grove, made 
it through four rounds to win a place in the company's championship cook-off.  
</P>
<P>
 What does it take to be a top chicken chef?  
</P>
<P>
 Cooks were judged on whether their birds had the proper "golden brown color 
and crispy skin."  
</P>
<P>
 Next year, El Pollo Loco will add a new contest: The Great Burrito Race, which 
will determine the company's fastest burrito-maker.

 The manufacturer of customized military computer systems is in the midst of a

Monday, it lost 87.5 cents a share to close at $3.25.

 Because the Anaheim-based company's stock price has been so low in price and

GUIDE SELLS SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SHOPPING; CONSUMERS: 'SHOPPING FOR A BETTER 
WORLD' RATES COMPANIES' COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES -- AND 
BOARDROOMS ARE LISTENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world filled with myriad political and social agendas, the last place one 
would think you'd be able to make a statement is in the shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar is a powerful tool, perhaps the most powerful Americans have, 
and what you buy can indeed send a message -- all the way to the corporate 
halls of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to buy, or not to buy, an item based not only on its quality and 
price, but on the policies of the company that makes it, is the theory behind 
socially responsible shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 This practice has consumers make choices that take political, social or 
environmental issues into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price has to be the No. 1 criterion for many, but it doesn't have to be the 
only," said Alice Tepper Marlin, president of The Council on Economic 
Priorities, editors of the just-published "Shopping for a Better World," a 
guide to socially responsible shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we make a trade-off of price for quality, price for taste," she 
said, adding that one could also make a choice of "price for social 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that a trade-off is always necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the socially responsible product is the least expensive -- price is 
not always the best indicator" of a company's policies, she said from the New 
York-based organization's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 What constitutes social responsibility differs with each person. For example, 
one may be primarily concerned with the environment or workplace issues or 
animal testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The book rates about 200 companies, listing thousands of their products, with 
ratings on how the companies score when it comes to commitment to the 
environment, charitable giving, community outreach, women's advancement, 
minority advancement, family, workplace issues and disclosure of information. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional comments disclose whether the company is involved in animal 
testing, and to what degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Grades are given A to F. A is outstanding, worth four points, and F is 
failing, worth zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the companies rated in "Shopping for a Better World," 20 earned a grade 
point average of 3.5 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 The book says: 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, no company is perfect. But these certainly are companies that 
deserve a lot of credit, companies whose product you may want on your shopping 
list, where you might want to work, and whose securities you might like to see 
in your investment portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies on the honor roll range from the privately held Aveda Corp., maker 
of hair, beauty, skin and household products from organically grown plants and 
flowers, to computer giants Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Other honor roll members include Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., 
Colgate-Palmolive Co., General Mills Inc., Johnson & Johnson, S.C. Johnson & 
Son Inc., Kellogg Co., Levi Strauss & Co., Nordstrom Inc., Rhino Records Inc. 
and Tom's of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is divided into numerous product categories and looks at consumer 
goods, foods and supplies -- the contents of a typical shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Sure & Natural feminine hygiene products, made by Johnson & 
Johnson, receive straight A's for all categories except environment, where they 
received a B. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments showed that Johnson & Johnson used animal testing for medical 
products only and was making significant alternative efforts. It also has 
on-site child care for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another product, Good Humor ice cream, owned by Unilever Plc, a U.S.-Dutch 
owned conglomerate, did not fare so well. It got Bs in environmental and 
workplace issues, Cs in charitable giving, community outreach, family and 
disclosure of information, a D in minority advancement and an F in women's 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to buy only those products that rate high on the socially responsible 
scale is not always feasible, Marlin said. Price, availability and preference 
are vastly important when making shopping decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to buy everything that's socially responsible," she said. "As 
long as companies know this is one factor, companies will pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 If a shopper makes one socially responsible choice, she said, that's still 
enough to send a message to the corporate headquarters that this is something 
consumers think is important. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that socially responsible shopping can work in the opposite 
direction as well, sending a message that you choose not to buy a product 
because of corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, helping corporations become more responsible to the 
needs of its workers as well as the outside world is the goal, even if 
particular products never end up on your kitchen shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can write to a company, too." Marlin said. "That doesn't cost any more 
than a piece of paper and a stamp." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shopping for a Better World," published by Sierra Club Books, can be ordered 
by calling (800) 935-1056. It costs $14.

INCLUDE TAX STRATEGY IN HOLIDAY WEDDING PLANS; FINANCE: IT'S NOT A JOLLY 
SUBJECT, BUT SOME SMART PREPARATIONS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR MAY SPARE YOU 
UNPLEASANT SURPRISES.

 How romantic to be married under the mistletoe or to have a wedding toast on 
New Year's Eve -- just don't expect a honeymoon from the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're considering getting married during the holidays and both of you 
work, you might want to postpone it until January to avoid the marriage 
penalty," said Larry Scheinfeld, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. "Marital 
status is determined on the last day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 And so is your tax bill. Although the deadline for filing '94 returns is 
months away, the chance to reduce what you pay the IRS is drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still plenty of ways to lower your tax liability before year's end, 
like increasing charitable contributions, deferring annual bonuses, even 
putting off a wedding to avoid the so-called marriage penalty. (That's a quirk 
in the system that frequently requires people to pay more taxes when they're 
married than when they're single.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really lots of things that can be done," said Nancy Anderson, manager 
of special tax projects for H&R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson suggests preparing a rough return now to determine what course of 
action can be taken. A good accountant or tax publication can also help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you need to look at is what your situation for '94 is as of 
today," added Andrea Markezin, a principal for Ernst & Young, which offers 
tax-saving tips through its "Tax Saving Strategies Guide, 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 "That means looking at your pay stub and projecting how much compensation and 
withholding you will have for the whole year . . . (and) estimating interest 
and dividend income by looking at your bank statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a feel for what your baseline is before making any changes." 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially important to ensure that your estimated tax payments or 
withholding are correct. To avoid penalties, you must withhold through payroll 
deductions or quarterly estimated payments an amount at least equal to 90% of 
this year's projected federal income-tax liability or 100% of last year's 
actual liability, whichever is less. If your adjusted gross income exceeds 
$150,000 a year, it's 90% of this year's liability or 110% of last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is essential. The rule of thumb among tax experts is to defer income 
and accelerate deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 While you can't defer salary that is already earned or available to you, you 
can have expected year-end bonuses, free-lance or consulting fees paid out in 
1995, thereby delaying tax payments on them, Scheinfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Scheinfeld noted, you shouldn't overlook available tax 
shelters like company-sponsored 401(K) plans or Keough plans for the 
self-employed. Tax is deferred on the portion of your salary put into the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Income from investments must also be considered since it's taxable in the year 
earned, regardless of whether you reinvest it. However, investments that 
generate long-term capital gains won't be subject to taxation until they're 
sold, tax experts note. The maximum rate is 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax experts suggest taking some capital losses this year to offset any gains 
you might have. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheinfeld, however, thinks individuals should hold off on selling appreciated 
stock or other investments that may incur capital gains until next year. 
"There's talk of cutting the tax (rate) to 14%. That may happen with a 
Republican Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many ways to accelerate deductions, meanwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have real estate taxes due in January, you can pay them in December," 
Markezin said. "You can also make your January mortgage payment in December . . 
. to get the extra interest deduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Planned charitable contributions also should be made before Dec. 31. You may 
even consider giving a portion of your 1995 contributions this year. (Just 
remember to get a written receipt if your gift to one organization exceeds 
$250; canceled checks won't suffice as proof.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's not too early to think about your filing status, either. A divorced 
mother would probably owe less taxes if she files as a head of the household 
rather than a single person. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-income couple might fare better filing separate returns rather than 
jointly. Then maybe they can go ahead with their wedding plans.

FIRST-NAME BASIS CAN BREAK THE WORKPLACE ICE

<P>
 Should Dagwood Bumstead start calling his cranky boss by his first name, 
Julius, instead of Mr. Dithers to improve their working relationship? 
</P>
<P>
 That could be a big step in the right direction, said David (Call Me Dave) 
Morand, a professor of management at Pennsylvania State University. 
</P>
<P>
 He released a study this week concluding bosses and workers are better off 
when they call each other by their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important device and a symbolic leveling of status," Dave 
said. "Your relationship is supposed to be collegial, this sets the tone for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave said his two-year study found first names are much more common in the 
workplace today than they were 20 years ago as society has grown more 
democratized. 
</P>
<P>
 A boss establishing a first-name basis on the first day of work "would set an 
immediate positive tone" for an employee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could mean just as much, if not more, to you than the fact that I've 
eliminated the executive dining and washrooms, the preferred parking and office 
spaces, and the time clocks and dress codes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in many major companies, reciprocal first-naming is universal from 
the lowliest maintenance worker or receptionist to right up to the chief 
executive. Dave's study drew from interviews with employees and officials at 
Hewlett Packard, Mars Inc., Xerox Corp. and Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In those companies, if employees call top officials and the chief executive by 
a title and last name, they are openly corrected in a friendly way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At United Parcel Service, he said, there was even an explicit policy calling 
for all employees to use their first names within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the hundreds of employees he interviewed preferred being 
on a first-name basis with their bosses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave said one of the biggest problems arises when employees aren't comfortable 
calling the boss by a first name or last, resulting in what he calls "name 
avoidance." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people reported spending years literally avoiding naming their superiors 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
 He said those workers are uncomfortable with the connotation of status and 
deference that goes with the use of a title and last name, like Mr. Jones, but 
without direction from the boss find it too risky to use the first name 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Managers may need to listen for the silence of an employee not using any 
name," Dave said. "It's better having bosses make clear what they prefer to be 
called than having name avoidance fester in workplaces." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in some places, such as the military, banks and government agencies, 
Dave concedes traditional naming patterns are expected to persist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to know what President Clinton's Cabinet calls him in those 
meetings," he said, noting Clinton, a product of the 1960s, seems to be more 
informal. Dave predicted many Cabinet members use name avoidance. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokeswoman said Cabinet members refer to Clinton as Mr. 
President. "Just the fact that they claim they call him Mr. President shows 
they want to portray him in a conservative direction," Dave said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said most organizations that have to be competitive in the global 
economy and are increasingly decentralized and use words like teamwork and 
camaraderie need to go to a reciprocal first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
 What about bosses who want to hold on to that traditional power? 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a question of a manager who likes being 'sir-ed' a lot, then that's a 
problem. It's a tricky situation," Dave admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, he said, the employee may need to take the initiative and start 
calling the superior by a first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if Dagwood could only stop Mr. Dithers from kicking him in the seat.

KABC TALK HOST TO CALL IT A NIGHT; RADIO: AFTER 27 YEARS, DEEJAY RAY BRIEM, A 
CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVE CAUSES, SAYS HE'S HAD ENOUGH OF HIS MIDNIGHT-TO-5 A.M. 
GIG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After 27 years on the graveyard shift, KABC-AM's Ray Briem says he'll miss the 
political patter and the crusades he conducted on the air, but he's ready to 
give it all up for a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 65 and my body says staying up all night ain't the right thing to do," 
said Briem, whose midnight-to-5 a.m. talk show on KABC (790) is one of the 
longest-running in the market. "You never get used to it. Your biological 
clock, your circadian rhythms are always upset. There will be times when I will 
miss it, but being able to sleep at night -- oh, how wonderful! That will more 
than compensate for the pangs of not having a forum." 
</P>
<P>
 Briem will retire after Friday's broadcast. He will be replaced Monday by Ira 
Fistell, who spent 15 years at KABC until being fired in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And though he will miss taking on President Clinton and other liberal 
politicians, and championing such causes as Propositions 13 and 187, the 
conservative talk-show host is looking forward to more free time to pursue his 
hobbies -- flying, operating a ham radio and listening to big-band music. 
</P>
<P>
 The station recently celebrated Briem's impending retirement with a party at 
the Century Plaza. More than 1,000 loyal listeners paid $50 apiece to attend 
the gala, at which Briem was treated to the performances of some of his 
favorite musical artists -- including the Mills Bros., Frankie Laine, Tony 
Martin and Bea Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described protege of legendary in-your-face talk-show host Joe Pyne, 
Briem focused on political issues but also featured lighter fare, such as 
interviews with his favorite performers from the big-band era. He consistently 
has drawn the largest ratings of any overnight talk show -- attracting 15.7% of 
the available audience during the most recent survey period. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California night owls have come to look upon Briem as a kind of 
late-night pal, a reliable presence during the dark, early-morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoy his hobbies -- the big-band thing and the reminiscing and the ham 
radio and the flying," said longtime listener Judith Seneff, 64, of Palos 
Verdes. "I don't always agree with him, but I do a lot. He's got a great radio 
voice, and I like the personality behind it. It's like Middle America. My 
husband and I would listen to him when we were staying up. We own our own 
business so sometimes we can't sleep. He's our age and talks about things that 
we knew a lot about. It's going to be kind of hard in the middle of the night 
without him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I don't sleep real well and I'll get up and I'll turn him on," said 
David Shook, a 50-year-old Baptist pastor from Redondo Beach. "Then, a lot of 
times it kind of stirs me up and I'll stay up quite a while listening to it. 
His demeanor was just real relaxed, and his voice coming over the air is kind 
of a comfort. I just don't think there's anyone who can replace that particular 
niche. I'm hoping he'll come back on the air sometime. Maybe he'll come back in 
the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
 If he ever does return to radio, Briem said, it will only be in the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be able to be economically independent because I have taken care of 
myself pension-wise," he said. "I can then cherry-pick if I decide to come back 
to radio -- but nothing before 9 a.m. or after 7 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Briem began his radio career 50 years ago in his hometown of Ogden, Utah. As a 
15-year-old, he and his buddies came up with a 15-minute radio drama called 
"The Adventures of Vivacious Vicky" and, when a staffer went out on a drunken 
binge on V-E Day and didn't show up for work, Briem was offered the chance to 
fill in. Later that year, he was hired full time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint with Armed Forces Radio during the Korean War, Briem came to Los 
Angeles in 1953 to spin records at KGIL-AM, a San Fernando Valley station. He 
remained a deejay through the early 1960s, including hosting an "American 
Bandstand"-style show in Seattle from 1958 to 1960. He was spinning records at 
KLAC-AM here in the mid-'60s when the station switched to a talk format at the 
behest of then-announcer Pyne. Briem was forced to change his style. 
</P>
<P>
 He admits he did not take to the talk format initially. He had decided in his 
teens that he wanted to be an announcer and deejay, not a newsman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into it kicking and screaming," Briem said wryly. "I liked playing the 
music. I realized what a dumb head I was. I knew very little about politics or 
the workings of government, and the first year I was an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 But his style evolved with the station, and by the time he came to KABC in 
1967, he had persuaded management to let him try his issues-oriented show in an 
overnight time slot. Prior to that, the station had not aired any programming 
after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Briem keeps a folder of all the news stories in which he has appeared, notably 
in Howard Jarvis' campaign to pass Proposition 13, the state taxpayer 
initiative that severely restricted the amount of property taxes. He is also 
credited by Harold Ezell, who co-authored Proposition 187, for his help in 
getting the initiative to cut state services for illegal immigrants on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will miss being able to help influence the way things happen in the city," 
Briem said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the job was not without its drawbacks. Besides the disrupted sleep 
schedule, Briem was the target of several death threats and even wore a 
bulletproof vest to his retirement gala. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take (the threats) seriously," he said. "I'm not paranoid, but I know the 
facts. And there are some people who would like my head." 
</P>
<P>
 But starting next week, his concerns will switch to practicing scales; 
politics will take a back seat to music lessons. His new crusade is to learn to 
play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm buying a baby grand," Briem said. "If I can just knock out a little 
melody, I'll be happy."

PRIDE, TRADITION TAKE CENTER STAGE AT FIESTA NAVIDAD

 A sense of pride in folkloric tradition pervaded the Fiesta Navidad on Sunday 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Yet, this was no assembly of 
humble street entertainers.On the contrary, coordinator Natividad Cano presided 
over a highly stylized cross-section of regional musics and dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's own Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano, based in Los Angeles since 
1969, held sway among the multifaceted participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ensemble -- most of whom switched adroitly between positions as 
singing instrumentalists and as solo vocalists -- brought verve and adeptness 
to realizations of their director's demanding arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For this program, which was sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society and the center, Mariachi Tlaquepaque and Conjunto Hueypan joined them 
to present festive examples of the genre, from Veracruz, Michoacan and Jalisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Several strong voices stood out from among the throng -- if only for sheer 
lung power -- but Arturo Palacio's evocative performance of the popular 
"Granada," by Agustin Lara shone brightest. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the event drew its inspiration from the fiesta of Las Posadas, a 
symbolic re-enactment of the story of Joseph and Mary's pilgrimage to Bethlehem 
and their search for shelter. Part of the group requests lodging from the 
"hosts," who initially refuse, but later relent, thereby beginning the 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, two Ballets Folklorico -- Olin and UCLA, which train under Adriana 
Almaquer and Virginia Diediker, respectively -- lent colorful vibrancy. Roper 
Tony Munoz fascinated with lasso acrobatics, aptly accompanied by strains of 
"Las Olas" (The Waves). 
</P>
<P>
 Cano urged the capacity audience in 2,994-seat Segerstrom Hall to join in some 
of the most familiar portions -- including a set of traditional carols, sung in 
Spanish. He found eager cooperation. Apparently, the energy and cultural 
self-esteem onstage communicated well.

SHE'S A CLASS ACT -- IN THREE COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her roles in Hollywood films, Caroline Goodall has been the wife of a guy 
who can't decide whether he wants to grow up ("Hook"), the wife of a womanizing 
Nazi war profiteer ("Schindler's List") and a lover to a psychotic ex-CIA agent 
who wants to kill Sylvester Stallone but settles for killing her 
("Cliffhanger"). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Goodall finds herself wed to a Michael Douglas who can't keep his 
trousers zipped up in "Disclosure." In the film, Goodall plays Susan, whose 
husband, Tom (Douglas), is almost seduced against his will by Meredith (Demi 
Moore), his conniving new boss and vengeful old girlfriend. When Tom accuses 
Meredith of sexual harassment, Meredith deflects the charge back upon him, and 
Susan must decide just how unfaithful a husband Tom truly is. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall, 34, laughs while reflecting at just how many men have done her wrong 
on celluloid. "You don't really pick your movie projects based on what the 
guy's doing," she says, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders how Goodall can decide what to choose at all. In addition to 
offers for work in Hollywood, she is also a film star in England and Australia. 
She has done four different accents -- aside from her native British -- in her 
last six films, including an American one in "Disclosure" that is so convincing 
that audiences may not recognize her from her previous work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in kind of a strange position -- I have a strong Australian career and a 
strong British career," she says. "Then there's the American career. For every 
movie I do here, I do two somewhere else. I bounce back and forth between the 
three places." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Disclosure," audiences will see her in the Aussie import "Hotel 
Sorrento," in which she stars as a novelist whose family is unhappy with the 
way she has mined their private lives for her public fiction. In January, she 
begins work on "Cutthroat Island," with her "Cliffhanger" director Renny 
Harlin, playing what she calls a "slightly crazy countess." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall was born and grew up in England, but spent much time in Australia, her 
father's homeland. She spent the first five years of her acting career in such 
prestigious troupes as the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of saw my career dedicated to doing new serious political plays or 
reinterpreting the greats," she says. "However, things change, thank God, in 
life, because (if they didn't) there would be no surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 While in Southern California performing in a stage production of "The Secret 
Rapture," Goodall's Hollywood career took off in typical Hollywood fashion. "As 
I was packing to go back to England, I received a phone call -- Steven 
Spielberg wanted to see me for 'Hook.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg approached her again for the role of Emilie Schindler in 
"Schindler's List." "The influence of Steven Spielberg to my career is 
unquantifiable," she says. "Every day on the set with him is a master class in 
filmmaking." 
</P>
<P>
 When Goodall met her real-life counterpart, it was an emotional experience, 
particularly when they filmed the final sequence of the film where the 
Schindlerju den visit Schindler's grave. "It was the first time she had ever 
seen her husband's grave," Goodall says. "I felt immensely protective of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilie helped her husband rescue the Jews much more than the film made out, 
but because she declined to speak at length to Thomas Keneally, author of the 
book that inspired the film, she has received short shrift, Goodall says.  
</P>
<P>
 "She'd always been in the shadow of her husband, and because she was a very 
private person, she never cared. But even at 80-something, you care when all 
this attention is focused on him and you become a footnote. It's very hard when 
you have to go around, accepting humanitarian awards on behalf of your dead 
husband who abandoned you." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the gravity of "Schindler's List," there was the lightheadedness of the 
action romp "Cliffhanger." No one could have told Goodall "thank you" enough 
for some of the things she had to endure during that production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest day for me was lying in the snow face down for 14 hours 
pretending to be dead as this helicopter went 'round and 'round and 'round," 
she recalls. "The crew was miles away, and I was communicating with a 
walkie-talkie. I couldn't move, I was absolutely soaked, and I was listening 
for the helicopter . . . and it's going the other way. The walkie-talkie would 
crackle, 'No, we didn't like that one, try again.' I wanted to kill someone, 
but I couldn't, because there was no one near me. After that movie, I don't 
think anything will ever be quite so tough again." 
</P>
<P>
 She did receive some compensation in the form of Nicola Pecorini, a camera 
operator who became her husband in September. They have a 10-month-old 
daughter, Gemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall began work on "Disclosure" a few months after having her baby, when 
she was still a little out of shape. Director Barry Levinson, she recalls 
somewhat incredulously, called her up and instructed her, "Don't lose weight." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's one Hollywood director in the world who would tell an 
actress that," she says. "I have a real problem with watching movies where I 
see this perfect woman who is married to the man in question, who has a perfect 
life, who has perfect hair, perfect clothes, and doesn't give you any of the 
kind of reality that you're used to." 
</P>
<P>
 And Goodall makes it plain that she doesn't have a whole lot of use for the 
actresses who buff up to play those parts: "I don't believe in auditioning for 
my next movie role from the movie that I've just been doing. A lot of actresses 
feel the pressure to constantly look good, to constantly show how well-toned 
every inch of their bodies are and how much they've been to the gym, not 
necessarily to do justice to the role they're in, but to point out to the 
producers out there, 'Hey, look what I've got -- remember me for your next 
project.' "

 Director's Take: American filmmaker Oliver Stone, talking to 600 media 
representatives in Cairo, defended his use of violence in "Natural Born 
Killers" and said that it's American news broadcasters who are guilty of 
excesses. "Money is at the root of the TV networks," said Stone at the 18th 
Cairo International Film Festival. "And their news is dictated by money and 
competition. To get the highest ratings, news must be presented in the most 
sensational way possible." Stone said he was referring not only to coverage of 
celebrated crimes, but also to basic news coverage. "The invasion of Haiti was 
presented like a miniseries," Stone said. "It was promoted around the clock in 
order to incite a kind of Pavlovian reaction wherein people get excited about 
the potential of a violent showdown between U.S. troops and Haitian forces." 
The Oscar-winning director suggested that it would be better to make TV news 
nonprofit "so that news can be presented in a sober, dignified fashion." As for 
"Natural Born Killers," which got its first screenings in the Arab world at the 
festival this weekend, Stone said his intention was to hold "a very harsh 
mirror to a very troubled society that is riddled with violence."

 Cinema in Havana: Mexican films were the surprise big winners at the close of 
Havana's annual Latin American film festival Sunday, the first time in the 
16-year history of the festival that one country had captured the three top 
awards. The best film prize among the festival's "Coral" awards went to Arturo 
Ripstein's "Principio y Fin" ("Beginning and End"), a fitting award for the man 
to whom this year's festival was dedicated and who is viewed as one of the most 
important Latin American directors. Based on a novel by Egypt's Naguib Mahfouz, 
it is a dark and disturbing account of the collapse of a family after the death 
of the father. The second and third prizes also went to Mexican films: Maria 
Novaro's "Jardin de Eden" ("Garden of Eden"), which addresses the issue of 
emigration from Mexico, and Gabriel Retes' "Bienvenido-Welcome."

 An Oscar Record: Gilbert Cates will produce the Academy Awards telecast for a 
record sixth year in a row, motion picture academy president Arthur Hiller 
announced. Under Cates' guidance, the international broadcast has collected 39 
nominations and eight Emmy Awards in the last five years. Cates, a veteran film 
and TV producer-director, is dean of UCLA's School of Theater, Film and 
Television. Only Howard W. Koch has produced more Oscar shows -- eight -- but 
no more than two consecutively. The awards will be presented March 27 at the 
Shrine Auditorium.

 Mickey Rourke Cleared: Charges of spousal abuse against actor Mickey Rourke 
were dismissed Monday in Municipal Court after a prosecutor conceded that the 
actor's wife was unavailable to testify against him. Actress-model Carre Otis 
had cooperated in the investigation that led to the misdemeanor charges but had 
since declined to participate in the prosecution, Supervising Deputy City 
Attorney William N. Sterling told Court Commissioner Robert J. Sandoval. 
Rourke, who was not in court, had been accused of slapping and kicking Otis in 
Hollywood on July 18. TELEVISION

 Multimedia Approach: CBS Television will air "500 Nations," an eight-hour 
miniseries on the history of North America's Native Americans, in April. At the 
same time, five other companies will issue related materials in what is being 
called an unprecedented cross-media partnership. Alfred A. Knopf Inc. will 
publish two books, Microsoft will offer an interactive CD-ROM, Random House 
will release the audio book, Epic Records will release the soundtrack and 
Warner Home Video will be selling the video. Kevin Costner will host the 
four-part program made by his Tig Productions, Inc. STAGE

 'Oliver' Revived: "Oliver," the most successful musical ever staged in London 
with 2,618 consecutive performances, is back on the British stage. A revival of 
composer Lionel Bart's play opened last week 34 years after its initial 
performance and advance ticket sales zoomed above $11 million. Jonathan Pryce 
heads the cast as the villainous Fagin. The $5-million production recreates the 
Victorian era with state-of-the-art technology and computer-controlled sets.

 Thirty Christmas trees designed and decorated by Hollywood stars including 
Sharon Stone, Candice Bergen, Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne, Mel Gibson, Bob Hope 
and Annette Bening and Warren Beatty are up for grabs in a silent auction 
taking place this week at the Beverly Hilton. The bidding closes Saturday; 
proceeds benefit City Hearts, an arts program for Skid Row children. . . . West 
Hollywood's House of Blues is holding a toy drive in conjunction with the Magic 
Johnson Foundation. Unwrapped toys may be dropped off at the club and at all 
Blockbuster music stores through Saturday, when Johnson will host 400 children

GUERRERO GETS HIGH MARKS ON HIS RAPPORT CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time we saw Tony Guerrero was during his last-minute substitution for 
cornetist Bill Berry at Kikuya in November. There, Guerrero was among perfect 
strangers. But he rose to the occasion that night, meeting his newfound sidemen 
more than halfway in a program of standards that challenged his trumpet and 
fluegelhorn playing in unaccustomed style. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, during his Christmas concert at Cafe Concerto, he was definitely 
back among friends. There were friends on the bandstand -- most of the 
musicians were regulars from Guerrero's touring ensemble -- and friends in the 
audience who voiced loud approval at everything that was done. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing they were there. How's that Beatles tune go? Something about 
getting by with a little help . . . ? Because help was needed. The band was 
ragged and far from its peak. The sound was uneven, filling the evening with 
whining feedback and barely amplified solos lost behind the over-amped rhythm 
section. Even Guerrero's playing was uncharacteristically distant, minus the 
warm lyricism that makes his play attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of it seemed to matter to the capacity crowd that packed the 
comfortable coffeehouse. Almost every note from the stage was greeted with 
whoops, cheers and strong applause. Guerrero's special guests, though hardly 
the caliber of those who haunted Christmas concerts past, were given especially 
enthusiastic reception. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's edition of Guerrero's almost yearly affair (no concert was held in 
1993) was scaled down from the 3 1/2-hour extravaganzas held at the Coach House 
in San Juan Capistrano in '91 and '92. Clocking in at just over two hours 
(without figuring in the half-hour late start), this year's edition welcomed 
only few guests to the bandstand, a decided change from past affairs when as 
many as 25 to 30 musicians would rotate duties on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the core group of Guerrero cronies worked the entire show. That gave 
it a flow that was missing from earlier concerts, which were repeatedly 
interrupted as the various participants set up or moved off stage. But like 
those bygone events, this one was decorated with fine individual efforts, 
albeit from a smaller number of participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Rippingtons saxophonist Jeff Kashiwa, recently returned from an 
extended tour with that band that included two weeks in Jakarta, Indonesia, as 
well as a stint in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Kashiwa, who stuck mainly to soprano, added gutsy, R & B-styled tenor sounds 
to the more upbeat numbers and took a single turn on alto during his own 
smoothly conceived "Coastal Access" from a forthcoming solo album. But his best 
work was on flute during an arrangement of "The Little Drummer Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Pat Kelly was another solid member of the proceedings, adding cool, 
electric tones from his Gibson on some tunes and tougher, more rock-oriented 
sounds from a second guitar on others. His wah-wah accompaniment during 
Guerrero's "Bumpin' " was a high point. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Guaraldi's somber "Christmas Time Is Here" from the television special 
"A Charlie Brown Christmas" gave keyboardist Mark Zink a chance to show a more 
reflective side, and his improvisation on the melodic piece (not to be confused 
with the upbeat "Linus and Lucy" theme from the same special) was one of the 
evening's most musical. 
</P>
<P>
 Though hurt by bad amplification at times, bassist Dave Enos showed plenty of 
snap and power, especially during the uptempo numbers. Drummer Tony Shogren, a 
regular with the Brazilian groups of bassist Octavio Bailly and singer Katia 
Moraes, varied the usual backbeat tempos with rhythmic variations that 
suggested samba and bossa nova beats during even the funkiest numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest appearances from keyboardist-vocalist Jon Gibson and guitarist-composer 
Michael Martin gave the affair a needed change of pace. Country singer Kelly 
Rae's rendition of Trisha Yearwood's "Take a Walk Through Bethlehem" also made 
for a pleasant variation. And with Crissy Shumaker's vocal on "Silent Night," 
sung in both Spanish and English, the concert closed with a suitably seasonal 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero made the right choice in scaling down this Christmas concert and 
presenting it in a more intimate atmosphere (the owners of Cafe Concerto should 
consider presenting jazz on a regular basis; the room seems perfectly suited 
for it). So what if everything didn't go as smoothly as it should have? Among 
family, you can do no wrong.

 BASIC 'BLACK' AND PEARLS OF WISDOM; A FEW STRIKING, METAPHORICALLY ENGAGING 
PIECES DRESS UP AN OTHERWISE RACIALLY PREDICTABLE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "In the Black," through Feb. 26 at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, is freighted 
with a daunting and not altogether logical sociocultural agenda: to explore the 
various meanings of blackness as a way of somehow reclaiming the work of black 
artists from the ghetto to which the white art world habitually assigns it. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest curator Myrella Moses has chosen 37 works by made by a wildly eclectic 
roster of well-known and obscure or fledgling artists. Most of the pieces are 
concerned primarily with blackness in its racial sense; only a few (made 
primarily by non-black artists, as it happens) explore other meanings of the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the show's catalogue (with an essay by J.S.M. Willette) deals only in the 
most belabored and obvious ways with biased assumptions on the part of white 
viewers. One wishes for the insights of last year's UC Irvine exhibition, "The 
Theater of Refusal: Black Art and Mainstream Criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, "In the Black" comes across mostly as a wishful attempt at 
promoting understanding among the races -- always a welcome sentiment, but one 
that could have used more intellectual rigor. 
</P>
<P>
 This thematic vagueness throws the burden of the show on the strength of 
individual works. Unfortunately, a few of the notable artists in the show -- 
John Outterbridge, Tim Hawkinson, Vernon Fisher -- are represented by work that 
is less than their best, and some of the work by the unknowns is thin or 
narrowly didactic. But several visually striking and metaphorically engaging 
pieces make the exhibition worth seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rose Tattoo," Alison Saar's bust-length sculpture of a black women, is 
covered with nailed-on pieces of tin bearing images of roses: a direct and 
lovely way of conveying the inner spirit of a person some may categorize purely 
on the basis of skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorna Simpson's "Holding and Breaking" consists of a large Polaroid photograph 
of a young black man in business attire, seen from the rear. Below, under the 
words "an agreement," the drinking glass he holds is shown smashed to bits. A 
fragile everyday object, the glass symbolizes the bond of trust and respect 
that a younger black generation has warily come to expect from whites, but 
which routinely is ignored and broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Ma-Dau-Sha, a Haitian artist in her 70s, fled her homeland after dictator 
Francois Duvalier came to power. In her painting "Pere le Brun" (Father Brown), 
fire engulfs a screaming black man, presumably the victim of a political 
attack. The bright, roiling colors and stick figure composition give the piece 
a poignant transparency. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon Huerta's "Reflections No. 9" -- a scrap of paper with childish writing 
by a young Chicano, with Huerta's likeness of the child's pensive face -- 
appears to be raw documentation of a child's beliefs awkwardly amended by 
lessons in toleration. The piece offers an unusually frank account of the heart 
of the fears and superstitions that block cross-cultural understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavialle Campbell's sculpture "Throne" is a giant Afro, big enough to sit on 
(there's a small indentation where the scalp attachment would be on a wig). A 
luxurious fuzzy dome, it rests on a base majestically decorated with golden 
hair picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell has taken a key visual element from the black pride movement of the 
1970s and given it a witty, Pop Art dimension in a way that hilariously 
satirizes a hairdo while quietly reaffirming the values it embodied. By 
transforming the formerly de rigeur explosion of hair into a throne, Campbell 
forges a link with enthroned African rulers immortalized in indigenous 
sculpture. It's deft and ingenious. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Dingle's painting "Two Girls, One With More Hair Than the Other" -- part 
of a series of images of little girls tussling -- is a teasingly elusive work, 
for all its apparent simplicity. Although the girl with more hair is black, and 
the other child is white, Dingle has been quoted as saying that such contrasts 
were purely painterly decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the creamy whiteness of the black girl's socks wouldn't register 
so vividly against a white surface. But it's hard not to see the pale arm 
bisecting velvety black skin in racial terms, even as you wonder whether the 
white girl is hugging her friend or preventing her from doing something -- and 
whether they both are posing for an unseen voyeur. 
</P>
<P>
 The white girl's extraneous black arm -- the one that looks like a rejected 
early painting attempt -- raises further questions. Its presence in the 
finished painting suggests the arbitrariness of a painter's creative decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Is a white artist like Dingle somehow freer to portray blackness without the 
same burdens of inherited injustices? What does it mean for a black artist to 
choose to make art that apparently doesn't refer to racial experience? Is that 
even possible? Such are the knotty questions left for another exhibition to 
tackle. 
</P>

 VISIONARIES: At the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art through Dec. 23, 
"Six: A SLAMB Show" introduces local viewers to an artists' collective that 
traffics in the mystical side of life. Pieces by Kate Savage and Siobhan 
McClure stand out by virtue of their alluring eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage's mixed-media paintings with delicate renderings of women's hands in 
various positions and accouterments borrowed from Old Master paintings -- a 
tassel, an ornate sleeve, an astrolabe -- have a dreamy, timeless quality, 
pulling into the foreground the tactility and ornamental value of forgotten 
details from well-born lives in other eras. Savage's assemblage "Perpetua's 
Ladder" -- a meditation on the life of a saint -- creates a sweetly 
logic-defying realm of fantasy, grace and private grief. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure's paintings, which variously resemble vintage photos or obscure fairy 
tale fragments, sidestep the cloying aspects of her mixed-media pieces to focus 
on children in mysterious distress -- two uniformed Russian schoolboys in "The 
Edge of Winter," a disquieting landscape of faceless babies in white dresses in 
"The Weaving of Words; The Wrapping of Wounds."

'GREASEPAINT' CAN'T HIDE PALLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who flee street mimes may be well-advised to skip "The Roar of the 
Greasepaint . . . The Smell of the Crowd," the vintage musical by Leslie 
Bricusse and Anthony Newley now being revived -- or rather, administered 
intensive CPR -- in Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 All the heroic measures on the part of director Allison Bergman and her cast 
cannot breathe life into Bricusse and Newley's recumbent book -- an 
expressionistic parable about the evils of Britain's class system that mingles 
mime with vaudeville in a stylized but insubstantial jumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentleman con-man Sir (Andrew Craig) engages in a never-ending, chess-like 
"game" with his Cockney adversary Cocky (BK Kennelly), a virtual slave to the 
godlike Sir's every whim. Of course, the game is fixed, and the low-born Cocky 
can't hope to compete with Sir's breeding and guile. However, as surely as 
worms turn, dogs have their day and turkeys gobble, Cocky eventually triumphs. 
Peripheral characters are roughly spliced into the formless collage, while a 
strange episode concerning the murder of a straw effigy provides meager fodder 
for a crisis and resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case at least, Bricusse and Newley may not have been able to tell a 
story, but they could certainly pen a tune. The show's score remains a 
phenomenon, with every other number a standard. Classics like "A Wonderful Day 
Like Today," "Where Would You Be Without Me?," "Look at That Face," "Who Can I 
Turn To?," "Feeling Good" and "Nothing Can Stop Me Now" uplift the flagging 
action along with the audience's spirits.  
</P>
<P>
 With his lithe physicality and commanding voice, Kennelly bears up this flawed 
vehicle by sheer effort of his considerable will and talent. Kennelly is also a 
gifted mime, as is Jennie Kaplan as the spunky Kid (who looks a lot like Jackie 
Coogan as a tyke). Add a bevy of cutely bedraggled urchins (shades of "Annie") 
to the mix, and the show actually shows signs -- however brief -- of becoming 
animate. 
</P>

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; DISCLOSURE' IS HOT ON A SLOW WEEKEND

 Falling short of expectations, "Disclosure," the steamy Warner Bros. drama 
about sexual harassment in the workplace starring Michael Douglas and Demi 
Moore took in $10 million on its debut, capturing first place at the box office 
in a largely lackluster weekend for most films. Warner Bros. had to have hoped 
that the film would do better, given the racy theme and major stars involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Disney continued to cruise with the season's major hit, "The Santa 
Clause." The holiday comedy starring Tim Allen raked in another $8.9 million, 
sending its five-week total climbing toward the $100-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in third place was Paramount Pictures' "Drop Zone." The action film 
starring Wesley Snipes just didn't sizzle like the studio anticipated, grossing 
$6.1 million. "Interview With the Vampire," which has taken in $95 million, 
dropped to seventh place after five weeks. The weekend total of $2.2 million 
was a 57% drop from the previous week. Weekend Box Office 04,35,18,10,10

A MODERN JUXTAPOSITION IN 'HERCULES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in a town noted for the eccentricity of its art, Charles Garabedian's 
seems quirky. These days he's seen as a forerunner of the neo-Expressionism of 
the '80s, but neither before nor since has he been identified with any set 
style or movement. He just works away producing compelling images that appear 
more or less bumbled together. 
</P>
<P>
 A current exhibition of about 20 large paintings at the L.A. Louver Gallery 
pursues the theme "The Labors of Hercules." There's an almost humorous 
disjuncture between the classical heroic theme and Garabedian's entirely ad hoc 
style. It's like imagining a "Venus and Adonis" by the Douanier Rousseau.  
</P>
<P>
 This kind of grand subject isn't new to Garabedian. He's always grappled with 
the paradoxical relationship between gritty reality and sublimated myth. His 
previous show was devoted to the Odyssey. There was a lot of battle-scene gore 
in it, but it came across with the innocence of an ancient James Thurber 
cartoon. In it, a fencer has just decapitated his opponent. The severed head 
says, "Touche." Garabedian's a lot like that.

 The present show is more lyrical. Its leitmotif image is probably "Amazons in 
Albania." In it two figures lie recumbent in an Italian Renaissance square in 
forced perspective. A horse rears in one corner like something out of Uccello. 
Edges are rendered in a stuttering line, and hues are as liquid as watercolor. 
It's a picture that joins a Renaissance Italian like Mantegna to a modern one 
like Di Chirico, bringing out the culture's smiling weariness and charm.

 Garabedian's quotations from old master art seem as unlikely as his classical 
themes. Turned inside-out they point to the piston that drives his aesthetic 
engine. Its basic attitude is one of populist egalitarianism. This is an 
Everyman art that seems to say, "Just a second. I don't wish to be 
presumptuous, but I believe a regular citizen like myself has something to say 
about these matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he's as direct as in "In the Ocean Stream," in which a little fire 
evokes early Matisse and his sophisticated grasp of the primal. At other 
moments Garabedian is philosophically oblique and discursive. "Hercules and 
Antaeus" includes an image recalling Pollaiuolo's famous little sculpture of 
the subject and sets it next to another based on Manet's paintings of the 
American Civil War vessel the Kearsarge.  
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely juxtaposition carries the idea of violent solutions to human 
conflicts across the gulf of time. There's an unflinching gentleness about this 
art. It's baffled and bemused by the human condition but never tries to hide 
either its beauty or its ugliness.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: GLENDALE FEDERAL TO BUY $205 MILLION IN DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank said it has signed a definitive agreement to purchase 
$205 million in deposits from Independence One Bank of California for about 
$210 million. The transaction is expected to close in the June, 1995, quarter, 
and is subject to regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to search for retail deposits in California as we seek to 
build our branch office franchise," said Stephen J. Trafton, chief executive of 
Glendale Federal. "We believe the recovery of the California economy and the 
alienation of customers by big, impersonal, commercial banks provides a 
significant opportunity and potential for growth." 
</P>
<P>
 With the closing of the transaction, Independence One's retail deposits at its 
Beverly Hills, Century City, Corona Del Mar, Laguna Hills and La Jolla branches 
will be transferred to Glendale Federal, which will assume the leases on all 
but the Laguna Hills branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Glendale Federal already has branches in Beverly Hills and Laguna 
Hills, offices of the two institutions will be consolidated at those locations. 
Glendale Federal, a Glendale-based savings and loan, had total assets of $16.8 
billion on Sept. 30.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CANOGA PARK FIRM ASKS FOR STOCK PROBE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Styles on Video Inc., a Canoga Park maker of computer imaging systems for hair 
salons, said it asked the American Stock Exchange to investigate recent trading 
of its stock for possible attempts to manipulate the price. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it believes that short selling might have occurred that 
violates Securities and Exchange regulations. In a short sale, an investor 
borrows stock and sells it, hoping the price will decline so the investor can 
repurchase the stock at the lower price and garner a profit.

QUAKE-RAVAGED INSURER SEES HELP ON THE WAY; INVESTMENTS: 20TH CENTURY 
INSURANCE'S SHAREHOLDERS ARE EXPECTED TO APPROVE THIS WEEK A $216-MILLION 
INFUSION BY THE NATION'S BIGGEST COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1994 was a lousy year for 20th Century Industries. Just last Thursday, the 
Woodland Hills-based insurer once again boosted its total earthquake damage 
claims, this time to a staggering $900 million, up from the $815 million it 
estimated in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its losses from the January earthquake, 20th Century has been 
pushed to the brink of insolvency. Under pressure from its lenders and the 
California Department of Insurance, which warned the company it must boost its 
flagging cash cushion against losses, 20th Century hopes to make a step in the 
right direction this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed $216-million capital infusion by New York-based American 
International Group Inc., the nation's biggest commercial property and casualty 
company, will be voted on Thursday by 20th Century's shareholders. The deal, 
which is expected to sail through, could result in AIG's investing $432 million 
in 20th Century and leave it with more than 40% of the beleaguered company. 
</P>
<P>
 With AIG's backing, 20th Century will be poised to expand its successful auto 
insurance business both inside and outside of California, analysts say. 20th 
Century has also begun a three-year process to get out of the homeowners' 
insurance business, which produced less than 10% of its nearly $1 billion in 
annual premiums, but which nearly sank the company because of claims from the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring another major earthquake in the Los Angeles area, where 20th Century's 
business is concentrated, the company stands to profit quite nicely from its 
auto business, analysts say. Many expect 20th Century to post a net profit of 
more than $100 million for 1995 -- about equal to its 1993 profit. In the nine 
months ended Sept. 30, 20th Century lost $449.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's no major quake, they're going to be very profitable in 
1995," said Jeanne Dunleavy, assistant vice president of property and casualty 
at the insurance-rating firm A.M. Best. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, analysts expect AIG to impose further management changes at the 
Woodland Hills company and possibly to install executives handpicked by AIG's 
aggressive chairman, Maurice R. (Hank) Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century has been guided by its founder and chairman, Louis W. Foster, 81, 
since he started the company in 1958. 20th Century management now "consists of 
the old Lou Fosterites," said analyst Blair Sanford at the San Francisco 
investment firm Hoefer & Arnett. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 20th Century executives have already announced their departure. In 
October, James O. Curley resigned as president, and group Vice President Paul 
Castellani, who oversees claims operations, announced his retirement last 
month. Under the proposed deal, AIG will receive two seats on 20th Century's 
11-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster was long praised for his groundbreaking marketing of auto insurance 
policies directly to consumers, which kept costs low by bypassing agents. But 
in recent years, Sanford said, the company hasn't worked as hard to capture new 
business. While AIG isn't expected to mess with 20th Century's proven formula 
for auto insurance, Sanford, for one, thinks that "the more ambitious AIG style 
will permeate 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 AIG, which mostly sells property and casualty insurance policies to other 
companies, is one of the world's most profitable insurers. It operates in 130 
countries and last year had $1.94 billion in profit on more than $20 billion in 
revenue. While AIG has tended toward internal growth rather than acquisitions, 
the 20th Century deal would help fulfill its goal of expanding its small 
personal auto insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies have announced plans for a joint venture into auto insurance 
markets outside California, with the start-up capital to be provided by AIG. 
But so far they haven't elaborated on how the venture would be structured. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the two companies declined to comment on the future of 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, analysts expect that the companies will move quickly into Nevada 
and Arizona. Such a move could be made cheaply and efficiently, they say, but 
it could take years to build a substantial level of premiums in the new areas. 
"It's hard to pry business away from existing carriers," Sanford noted. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, new insurance business tends to be less profitable than renewals 
because a company understands the risks better with existing policies, said 
analyst Ira H. Malis at the investment firm Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 New York might be another area of expansion targeted by 20th Century and AIG, 
said analyst Ira L. Zuckerman at SBS Financial Group in Westport, Conn. Not 
only is it a big auto market, but the state is familiar turf for AIG, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unresolved for 20th Century is its longstanding battle against auto 
insurance rebates required by the passage in 1988 of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 The company last month obtained a stay of a California Supreme Court ruling 
that approved state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's order for 20th 
Century to pay a rebate to customers. 20th Century's potential rebate now 
stands at $121 million. But Foster has long opposed the Prop. 103 rebates, and 
was willing to keep the battle up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century says it will file a petition by the end of the year asking the 
U.S. Supreme Court to consider hearing its appeal. The company said in a recent 
SEC filing that it has set aside enough funds to pay the rebates if it loses 
the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts wonder if 20th Century might again boost its estimate of total 
earthquake losses. Since the quake, the figure has ballooned from the company's 
original estimate of less than $100 million to the $900 million announced last 
week. As of Thursday, 20th Century said it had paid $722 million to its 
customers for earthquake damages and expenses, plus another $46 million in 
claims-adjustment expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year will also bring a new insurance commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, 
whose relations with the industry are expected to be less contentious than his 
predecessor's. But that might not help 20th Century, analysts say, because a 
more friendly regulatory environment in California might encourage more 
companies to enter the market, thus creating more competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an improved outlook for 20th Century, "it's going to be a fairly long 
road," said David Anthony, an analyst at the New York investment firm of 
Fox-Pitt Kelton. "1995 is just the beginning of it."

COMPAQ ACTION HAS GOLDEN SYSTEMS SCRAMBLING TO SURVIVE; COMPUTERS: SIMI VALLEY 
FIRM STRUGGLES TO MEND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NO. 1 CUSTOMER, WHICH CANCELED 
$5 MILLION IN SALES DUE TO QUALITY PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Less than two years ago, Jay Tandon watched his older brother's 
personal-computer company, the once-giant Tandon Corp., crumble under industry 
price-cutting pressures and go bankrupt. Now Jay Tandon is struggling to avoid 
his brother's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandon is chief executive of Golden Systems Inc., a Simi Valley-based 
manufacturer of power-switching devices used to make personal computers. The 
company disclosed Dec. 2 that its biggest customer, personal-computer maker 
Compaq Computer Corp., found quality problems with Golden Systems power supply 
units and shipped back $5 million of the units that had been delivered over the 
past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The canceled sales could represent a death blow to Golden Systems because 
Houston-based Compaq has accounted for 70% of Golden's sales. And Golden 
Systems was already staggering after posting a $2.38-million loss on revenues 
of $6.95 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Golden's stock price, 
sagging because of unmet sales expectations, was trading at a meager $1.25 per 
share before the bad news from Compaq, and has plunged even further, closing 
Monday at 38 cents a share, down 6 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Systems said the quality problems have been fixed, and the company is 
scrambling to repair its relationship with Compaq. Compaq said it is willing to 
consider repurchasing the Golden Systems units if they are repaired and pass 
stringent quality tests, but there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Golden Systems has already violated covenants on its lines of bank 
credit because of the Compaq action. And Raymond Thomas, chief financial 
officer of Golden, said failed negotiations with Compaq "could place the 
continued existence of Golden Systems in serious doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Golden Systems might survive this scare, but could still suffer 
long-term consequences if current quality problems spook other potential 
customers. "Others may say this is a bad company to do business with because 
they screwed up their main customer," according to Mohan Mankikar, president of 
Santa Rosa-based Micro-Tech Consultants. "That is the danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1991, Golden Systems began as a supplier of power-switching devices 
to the computer company owned by Jay Tandon's brother, Jugi. Power-switching 
devices are crucial computer components that convert alternating electric 
current from wall outlets into direct current at voltage levels required to 
power computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tandons built their companies by relying on cheap labor from their native 
India, where wages are still as low as 40 cents per day. With all of its 
manufacturing operations based in India, Golden Systems grew from a company 
with $4.5 million in sales in fiscal 1992 to $29.4 million in the fiscal year 
that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacture of power supplies involves soldering electronic capacitors, 
resistors and other components into place on a small, flat surface called a 
printed circuit board. The process is relatively simple, Thomas said, but 
cracks had developed in some of the solder connections on units shipped by sea 
from India and trucked to Compaq's Houston facilities. The cracks could have 
led to power failure in computers equipped with the damaged units. 
</P>
<P>
 Only power supply devices shipped to Compaq were affected, said Thomas. He 
added that Golden Systems believes the problem was not with how the devices 
were assembled, but arose because Golden Systems used faulty printed circuit 
boards purchased from a vendor in India during the summer. The problems weren't 
detected in initial quality inspections, but showed up after the units had been 
shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Systems no longer uses the vendor that supplied the defective boards, 
Thomas said, and the company has stepped up its inspections to include 
vibration tests that duplicate the conditions units are exposed to when shipped 
great distances. Compaq has agreed to accept 2,000 new units for test and 
inspection, Thomas said, and Compaq engineers found no problems in an 
inspection of Golden's facilities in India two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reasonable chance we can convince them" to accept repaired units, 
Thomas said. "But there's no commitment on their part that they'll do it." He 
added that Compaq is expected to make its decision within a few weeks.

VALLEY HOUSE SALES INCREASE 12% WHILE PRICES DECLINE 8%; REAL ESTATE: THE 
AVERAGE RESALE FIGURE DROPS TO $220,500 IN NOVEMBER. THE HIGH SALES VOLUME IS 
CONSIDERED UNUSUAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

 The San Fernando Valley housing market rambled down the same path in November 
that the market has followed for more than a year: Sales were up, but prices 
were down. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, sales of existing single-family houses totaled 908, which 
represented a 12% jump from a year earlier, and a 3% increase from October's 
total of 880 sales. But the average resale price slid to $220,500, down 8% from 
November of 1993, and $6,800 below the average price in October, according to 
the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales volume last month was the highest for any November since 1989, while 
prices last month were the lowest for any November since 1988. The heavy 
activity was out of character for this late in the year, when the market 
usually settles in for a winter lull. 
</P>
<P>
 The median sale price of a single-family house last month was $175,000, down 
9% from the same month a year ago, and $3,500 below October's median. The 
$175,000 median price means half the houses sold for more than that price, and 
half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Link, executive vice president of the association, said prices have been 
sinking for 24 months, as the market has continued to feel the effects of 
Southern California's economic woes. Prices have also been deflated by the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake, which is bringing an abundance of foreclosed 
properties to the market, as well as homes that were sold with quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time buyers have fueled market activity by snapping up bargains, but 
prices may be scraping bottom, Link said, and the market might be even more 
active if it weren't for recent interest rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect sales activity to remain higher than normal as long as interest 
rates remain . . . under 10%," Link said. "Let interest rates drop to where 
they were earlier this year, and you would see local real estate activity take 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 1,051 houses and condominiums were sold in November, up 11% from a 
year earlier, and 4% higher than in October. The average sales price of a 
condominium was $105,300 last month, $25,900 below the average a year earlier, 
and down 10% from October. The median sale price last month for a condominium 
was $101,500, down 18% from November, 1993, and $2,000 below the median sale 
price in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory of available houses and condominiums also continued to decline. 
There were 7,523 houses and condominiums listed for sale last month, which 
represents a 30% decline from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER SEES 3RD-QUARTER PROFITS JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Amplifier Inc., a Camarillo-based maker of components used to 
receive television signals, reported a sharp increase in profit for its third 
quarter, which ended Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted net income of $714,000, up 28% from $558,000 in the same 
three-month period a year earlier.Sales increased by 3% to $11.7 million, 
compared to $11.4 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For its nine-month period, the company reported profit of $1.67 million on 
sales of $34.2 million, compared to a year-earlier profit of $1.64 million on 
revenue of $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 California Amplifier attributed its improved results to surging sales of its

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: SOME REAL ESTATE AGENTS SHIFT 
TO REPRESENTING ONLY BUYERS; PROPERTY SALES: COMPANIES SEEK TO AVOID POSSIBLE 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BY WORKING EXCLUSIVELY FOR HOUSE-HUNTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is your real estate agent really working for you? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a home buyer, the answer may be no. The real estate agent who is 
representing you as a potential buyer is also officially acting as an agent of 
the seller -- thus creating possible conflicts of interest. Traditional real 
estate agents argue that their code of ethics and state laws guarantee that 
both buyer and seller are fairly represented. But, a few real estate brokers 
are concentrating on serving buyers only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're testing the waters right now," said J. Duncan DeMoss, marketing manager 
at Buyers Advantage Realty, a 3-month-old real estate brokerage in Westlake 
Village. The company is representing only about six buyers now, but DeMoss 
expects the numbers to grow now that the company has eight agents. With so many 
aspects of a sales contract that can be negotiated, it's important for buyers 
and sellers to each have their own dedicated representatives, DeMoss argued, to 
avoid any conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 David R. Feigin is so confident about the future of buyer brokerages that he 
left his job at Exclusive Realtors in North Hollywood and in November started 
his own firm, Buyer's Agent Home Buyer's Specialist in Ojai. He has become one 
of the 96 franchises of Memphis, Tenn.-based franchisee Buyer's Agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had questions about the ethics of dual agency relationships. Even 
when I was working for the buyer, I was also working for the seller," Feigin 
said. That's because, officially, even buyer agents are working for a seller in 
traditional real estate contracts. "The industry is lagging behind what the 
consumers are asking for," he said. "There's never been a company to just help 
the buyer. It seems almost silly." 
</P>
<P>
 Feigin takes a retainer fee from the buyer of about $100 to $250 to start his 
search. Buyers must also be pre-qualified by a lender up to a certain maximum 
bid for any purchase, and they must sign an agreement that states that Feigin 
will be the buyer's exclusive representative in a home purchase for a certain 
period of time. If Feigin finds the buyer a home, he will generally just split 
the sales commission with the seller's agent. Feigin reports that he has a 
handful of clients right now -- but they are all serious buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements generally last about 90 days and the fees vary. Some buyer 
brokers ask for a retainer up front of several hundred dollars; others don't. 
Industry analysts estimate that about 30,000 buyer brokers are operating 
nationwide -- about 4% of the 750,000 members of the National Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is one potential pitfall in this new, buyer-only agent system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conventional residential property sale, the seller pays roughly a 6% 
commission on the sales price. Half that commission goes to the brokerage that 
listed the home for sale (and is then divvied up with the specific agent who 
listed the property), the other 3% goes to the brokerage firm that found the 
buyer (again splitting the fee with a particular agent). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the buyer-only agent system, in exchange for finding a house the buyer 
wants to buy, that agent may be paid 3% of the purchase price, a flat fee or a 
fee based on the number of hours spent helping the buyer. The catch is this: 
Usually, the buyer broker fee is paid by the seller. But if the seller refuses 
to pay the commission, the buyer is contractually obligated to pay up that 3%, 
or so, of the commission. On a $300,000 home, that could mean an extra $9,000 
bill for the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 George Rosenberg is a Ventura real estate broker who specializes in 
representing buyers, but he remains skeptical about a widespread future for 
real estate brokers who concentrate exclusively on representing buyers. "I 
tried buyer-only representation about five years ago," Rosenberg recalled. "My 
income plummeted." Rosenberg now represents both buyers and sellers -- but 
never in the same transaction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a growing demand for real estate brokers who will exclusively 
represent a buyer, Rosenberg said, but there aren't many qualified brokers who 
are willing to concentrate just on buyers. There is a somewhat larger pool of 
agents, he said, committed to so-called single agency -- where the agent 
represents only one side of a transaction and turns down representing certain 
buyers or sellers that might be in conflict with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg publishes the Buyer's Broker Registry, which lists about 350 buyer 
brokers in 25 states. He reported that he gets an average of nine calls a day 
from would-be buyers looking for exclusive representation. In exchange for 15% 
of an agent's commission, Rosenberg refers these callers to people listed on 
his directory. The registry, Rosenberg conceded, is not limited to buyer 
brokers exclusively but to agents and brokers committed to the principles of 
single agency. Only a small number of real estate agents and brokers are really 
ready to limit themselves to even single agency transactions, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will never happen on a wide basis and it will never happen with the 
larger companies. There's no way they'll let go of the dual agency system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, both agents in a transaction have (officially) worked for the 
seller but buyers have still gotten a fair deal," said Mary Lou Williams, 
assistant executive vice president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors. "I don't really see conflicts of interest now. The agents do a really 
good job of representing the buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams doesn't see buyer brokerage expanding in the San Fernando Valley. "I 
have not heard of any increase in this happening," she said. "It's a very small 
percentage of our total membership." The association does sell a buyer-broker 
service agreement, Williams reported. "But it's a slow seller."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: CAL-PAC WILL REPLACE DEFECTIVE PENTIUM 
CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thus far, no Ventura County computer users are known to have been tripped up 
by a defect that's been discovered in Intel Corp.'s high-speed Pentium chips. 
But if you're equipped with the units, a Ventura firm, Cal-Pac Computing, is 
offering to replace them free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Pac's president, Gerhard W. Orthuber, says his company will donate the 
labor, using new chips supplied free by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Pac is an independent company that repairs computer equipment and also 
serves as a consultant. An Intel rival, IBM, has also offered to replace the 
chips with its own products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Intel chips reportedly become inaccurate when asked to calculate to the 
ninth figure after a decimal point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of many people or companies who would want to figure things 
that fine," Orthuber said. "If somebody's in doubt, we'll be glad to advise 
them whether they ought to make the changeover." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Pac can be reached at (805) 653-6006.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: FOUNDER OF AMGEN INCREASES OWNERSHIP 
SHARE IN ICOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Rathmann, the founder of Amgen Inc., the Thousand Oaks biotechnology 
concern, has increased his ownership in another biotech firm, Bothell, 
Wash.-based Icos Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathmann, who is Icos' chairman, along with Microsoft Corp. founder William 
Gates bought about half the Icos shares available in a special offering last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The two executives, who are among Icos' largest shareholders, acted 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathmann raised his stake to about 7.8% from 6.5%. Gates doubled his holdings 
to 15% of Icos. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Icos' top products, an antibody aimed at treating multiple sclerosis, 
is in the early stages of clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also working on anti-inflammatory drugs to help people 
suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Icos has a joint research venture with Glaxo Holdings PLC, a 
London-based pharmaceutical firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Icos raised $23.3 million in last month's stock sale. Rathmann and Gates 
exercised their rights to the stock after other shareholders declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathmann stepped down from Amgen several years ago and planned to retire. But 
he was bored and decided to get involved in another start-up biotechnology 
company.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: COUNTY TREASURER HAS CONFIDENCE IN 
INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The manager of Ventura County's $700-million-plus investment portfolio says 
there's no danger that it will suffer massive losses like those taken recently 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment portfolio, which is managed by Ventura County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Harold S. Pittman, and a separate $900-million county employees 
pension fund, are both in good shape and earning respectable returns, he 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman does not manage the pension fund but helps guide it as a member of the 
county retirement board. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment portfolio is made up of the cash reserves of about 20 school 
districts and other public agencies, including the county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the Ventura County aggregations includes any investments in the 
complex derivative instruments that have been blamed for most of Orange 
County's estimated $1.5 billion in losses, Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until less than a year ago, derivatives proved highly profitable for the 
Orange County fund, providing a yield about 2% above that earned by Ventura 
County's investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all gets down to the old rule: The greater the yield, the greater the 
risk," Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed sympathy for Orange County's former treasurer-tax collector, 
Robert L. Citron, who used derivatives to bet that interest rates would 
continue to fall, bolstering the yields of highly volatile "inverse floater" 
derivative bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him. He's highly knowledgeable," Pittman said of Citron. "He simply 
became too concerned with seeking high returns." 
</P>
<P>
 When interest rates started to climb, Citron was left with $8 billion in 
derivative bonds whose yields were falling quickly. Citron resigned under 
pressure last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "For several years, he was considered a hero," Pittman said. "Some people 
probably wondered why our relatively small fund didn't do as well as they were 
doing in Orange County. We were sticking with conservative things like Treasury 
bonds and high-quality commercial paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its conservative approach, Ventura County's government portfolio has 
grown from about $450 million six years ago to between $700 million and $750 
million now, Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county government agencies' investment fund will earn an overall yield of 
about 5.25% this year, Pittman estimated. And he expects the employee pension 
fund, which invests in blue-chip stocks as well as debt instruments, to show a 
gain of more than 8%, even though it's had some setbacks recently due to the 
stock market's slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides avoiding derivatives, Ventura County's investment managers also eschew 
leveraging -- the risky practice of investing with borrowed money, Pittman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, most of Orange County's $20-billion portfolio represented 
borrowings, leading to a debt load that now threatens to overwhelm the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's questionable whether some of the Orange County practices were authorized 
by the state code. But whether they were or not, I don't consider them 
appropriate ways to use county money," Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's investment pool also refuses to accept investments from 
outside the county, Pittman noted. To the contrary, he said, until its 
downfall, the Orange County fund was considered such a high flyer that 
outsiders from such areas as Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman, a former deputy county treasurer-tax collector, was appointed to his 
present post two years ago. He won a full four-year term in the Nov. 8 
election.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonight on "M*A*S*H," see Ed "Hawkeye" Coyle perform triage. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene: Coyle, San Clemente's second-year basketball coach and amateur 
physician, wanders through his gym/trauma center shouting, "Season-ending 
injuries on the left, guys who'll limp back next week on the right."  
</P>
<P>
 A lanky kid, teary-eyed, asks: "Dr. Coyle, please help." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Shin splints." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait your turn, we have real-life, TV-type, gut-wrenching dramas to deal with 
here, kid. Next!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Name: D.J. Reynolds, 6-foot-9 center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Torn ligaments in knee. Thought rehab would cure it. It didn't. Had 
surgery. Out for season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: This really hurts our inside game. This is our biggest loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, just wait Ed, just wait.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Joey Harrison, 6-5 forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: No one really knows. Hurt back during the summer. Thought it was a 
broken vertebra. Wrong. Thought he could play this season. Wrong. Can't even 
sit on bench because the pain's so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: He's trying acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 Next step, voodoo?  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Jan Tatala, 6-5 forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Dislocated shoulder twice in summer league. Took time off. Went 
surfing in August, shoulder popped out again. Now has three pins in his 
shoulder. Could be back in January but can't lift arm over head. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: He's not going to be 100%, but I'll take him. 
</P>
<P>
 Beggars can't be choosers.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Mike Castaneda, 6-0 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Sprained wrist, missed one game. Came back, sprained ankle. Looks 
like mummy with all that tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: I was hoping he would carry us. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to do that from a litter.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Eli Engle, 6-3 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Came to school with arm in cast. Broken bone in wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: He plays a lot of tennis and it was really bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis wrist?  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Paul Anderson, 6-1 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Was walking on beach and punctured foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: He's going to help us. He's got to help us. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing, tennis, walks on the beach? These aren't exactly at-risk activities.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Gabe Gardner, 6-9 center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Excellent water polo player but going from water to court is tough 
transition. Sits out half of every practice with sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: We call him Grandpa because of how he walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sore knees? A misdemeanor around here.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Josh Parks, 5-10 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Was playing basketball at the beach and passed out. Tests were 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: So far, no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Geez, not since Blood Beach has there been so much carnage.  
</P>
<P>
 Name: Adam Fischer, 6-3 forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailment: Hurt wrist before weekend. Went to doctor for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle: At this point, I don't even want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance is bliss.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons, 0-5 at the moment, have heart. They just need a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle won three league titles in seven seasons at West Covina. The Tritons won 
12 games under him last season, more victories than the team had had in any of 
the 12 previous seasons. Things looked bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Coyle cringes every time he hears an ambulance. He gets home and his wife 
asks, "Who was it today?" His players are talking about sacrificing a cow to 
change their luck before their next game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed's dealing with it. He even recruited a player from a P.E. class. 
Amazingly, the kid agreed to play. Brave lad. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are bound to get better, Coyle knows they can only get better. Besides, 
Ed's fine. And remember, when you've got your health, you've got everything.

</P>
<P>
 He was youngest of four sons. Four very large sons, all of them Mater Dei 
offensive linemen. That could mean only one thing for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always getting picked on," said Motherway, The Times Orange County 
lineman of the year. "They'd always take my shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 A strange and somewhat bizarre ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there were advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could watch them and learn," Motherway said. 
</P>
<P>
 What lessons he was taught stuck. Motherway, the last and possibly the best of 
his family, has lived up to his billing this season. He was considered among 
the best in Orange County and did nothing to change that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway, a 6-foot-4, 264-pound senior, was a big reason the Monarchs won the 
Southern Section Division I championship. He anchored an offensive line that 
wore down one opponent after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like his brothers before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine he gets a lot of support and a lot of criticism from his brothers," 
Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "It's a close family. 
</P>
<P>
 And a big one. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Tom, now 28, played at Air Force and then UCLA. Brother Mike, 26, 
played at Princeton. And brother Ryan, 22, was a senior at UCLA this past 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway may be the best of the lot. Many schools are after him and UCLA, 
Stanford, Colorado and Oregon are at the top of his list. All like his 
quickness and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes him so tough is intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very bright and you have to be to play that (weak side) tackle," 
Rollinson said. "You're on an island there. You have to be smart. That's why 
he's a great pass blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway had great tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a lineman from birth, like his brothers. But he never got to play until 
he was a freshman because of his size. Youth leagues all have weight limits. 
The closest he came was flag football in junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't mean he couldn't learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went and watched all my brothers play and they were good," Motherway said. 
"It looked like a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious from the first day at Mater Dei that he was going to be a 
quality lineman, according to Rollinson. First, he had the size. Second, he had 
the brains. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could look at him and tell he could was going to be a good lineman," 
Rollinson said. "He had the raw size and he just worked extremely hard in the 
weight room." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson was so impressed by Motherway that he moved him along quickly, maybe 
too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 He was thrust into the starting lineup as a sophomore against Dana Hills. 
Motherway had to go nose-to-nose against David Cruickshank, who is now at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long evening, which ended with the Monarchs' first and only South 
Coast League loss in the three years they have been in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost made a big mistake bringing him along so quickly," Rollinson said. 
"He didn't have much success that night, but he has lived up to expectations 
ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 And even a few things that weren't expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway wanted to play defense. He asked to play defense. He almost begged 
to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he showed coaches that he could play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could contribute, but it wasn't until this summer I got a 
chance," Motherway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rollinson: "He just bowed his neck and went at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway is used on defense, extensively against strong running teams. But he 
knows his future is on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like his brothers.

WINNING IS WHAT GRIFFINS' MELSBY DOES BEST OF ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took 41 games before someone could beat Brad Melsby and the Los Alamitos 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, The Times Orange County back of the year, led the county in receptions 
and receiving yardage this season. He finished his three-year varsity career as 
Orange County's all-time leading receiver in receptions, yardage, and 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the ball is in the vicinity he'll get it," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. 
"He has great hands, will take the big hits and still hang on to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy Melsby leaves is his penchant for winning. Los Alamitos was 
39-1-1 during a career in which many great players and teams were left in the 
Griffins' wake. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Grant Pearsall and Villa Park got close in 1992, but Los Alamitos 
prevailed, 28-27, in Game 3 of the Melsby era. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Travis Kirschke -- a two-time Times Orange County lineman of the year 
-- and Esperanza lost 34-14 to Los Alamitos in Game 8. Later that season, the 
Aztecs could manage only a 14-14 tie with Melsby and the Griffins in the '92 
Southern Section Division II championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Tony Gonzalez -- The Times lineman of the year in 1993 -- and 
Huntington Beach barely got within three touchdowns of Melsby and Los Alamitos, 
which won its third consecutive section title with a 39-21 victory over the 
Oilers in the '93 Division II game. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, 12 more opponents fell by the wayside as Los Alamitos ran its 
unbeaten streak to 47 games, a section record. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, only a perfectly executed onside kick recovered by Mater Dei with less 
than four minutes remaining helped the Monarchs erase a 10-point fourth-quarter 
deficit in the Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 That night at Anaheim Stadium, Mater Dei defeated Los Alamitos, 28-24, before 
toppling La Puente Bishop Amat in the championship game a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We executed, we just didn't execute well enough," Melsby said after the only 
loss of his high-school career. Two section championships and a fistful of 
individual records were small consolation in Melsby's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the records he has compiled are mind boggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, the Sunset League's most valuable player, caught 77 passes for 1,204 
yards this season and scored 14 touchdowns. He finished his career with 185 
receptions to break the record of 177 set by a former teammate, Los Alamitos' 
George Sagen (1990-'92). 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby's 2,979 yards receiving and 35 touchdown receptions broke 19-year-old 
Orange County records set by Kennedy's Rick Parma.  
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, a 6-foot-1, 183-pound senior who is being recruited by UCLA, Stanford, 
Arizona State, and Minnesota among others, also started at free safety, where 
his defensive skills were just as instrumental to the Griffins' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a special, special kid," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said. "Brad is 
one of the few guys we've ever asked to play both ways all of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he scores, he acts like it's all in a day's work. He just flips the ball 
to the official and there's no hot-dogging. I think that's what makes him extra 
special because he doesn't do any of that. But everyone else still tells me 
what a great player he is."

BARNES A WINNER, PLAYOFF DEFEAT NOTWITHSTANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos death watch began in earnest in Week 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponent? Carson. The result? Carson was beaten, 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Pasadena Muir. Beaten, 39-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison. Beaten, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza. Beaten, 35-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly. Beaten, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the year to beat Los Alamitos, a team down on talent and high on 
history, but it wasn't until the Southern Section semifinal against Mater Dei 
that someone finally ended The Streak -- at 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 30,065 watched as Los Alamitos lost, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
 It was over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' success this year depended largely on the players, because there 
was plenty of talent -- just not as much as usual. But to be the force the 
Griffins were took a certain amount of direction. And after three section 
championships, it's in the year that his team lost that John Barnes is The 
Times Orange County coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with developing a program as powerful at Los Alamitos is the 
inherent expectation; 47 games without a loss will do that to a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to the point that if you don't win by two or three touchdowns," 
Barnes lamented during the course of the season, "people think you had a bad 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 There weren't many of those. Against a formidable list of opponents, Los 
Alamitos was poised, and it performed as well in its defeat as it had in many 
of its victories. And if the team takes on the character of its coach, then 
Barnes has to get much of the credit no matter how much he wants to spread it 
around to assistants Barry Sher (offensive coordinator), Bob Brakke (defensive 
coordinator) or Jim Van Gorder (assistant head coach). 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely confident in his coaching, in his assistants and in his 
players; that affects the way we feel, and we go into every game feeling we can 
win," wide receiver Brad Melsby said. "The way Coach Barnes is really affects 
the way the team is." 
</P>
<P>
 No team has played more big games than Los Alamitos the last four years. 
Perhaps the measuring stick of a program is when the media remark of a program, 
"It's news when you lose." And it was certainly news whenever the Griffins were 
playing someone who had even a chance of beating them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many thought Orange County's second-ranked team, Mater Dei, would 
beat top-ranked Los Alamitos (12-1), Barnes looked forward to the game before 
the playoffs even began -- just to settle the question. Fear? There was never 
any fear. Let the programs make their case on the field and leave the posturing 
to the pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a season dominated by highlights, so much so that even the loss -- 
the school's first in four years -- wasn't considered a lowlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those memorable moments were victories against Carson and Muir without 
Feterik, which was a testament to the strength of the program and the system as 
much as anything. And in beating Edison and Esperanza in successive weeks, Los 
Alamitos rallied in the final minute to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were others. Winning the revamped Sunset League, and beating Long 
Beach Poly in the playoffs, and playing in front of 30,000 at the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never know it from watching him on the sidelines in those two games 
against Edison and Esperanza -- he always acted as if the game was in the bag 
no matter the score or time remaining -- but Barnes admitted he had succumbed 
to formulating The Speech -- the dialogue he would deliver when The Streak 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 He would tell his players about the great run they had and how proud he was of 
them. But then the players pulled each game out in the final seconds and Barnes 
looked as calm and brilliant as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that brilliance comes in the form of looking for the right kind of 
athlete to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better be dependable, responsible and respectful of people," Barnes said. 
"I'm looking for that kind of kid. With those kinds of kids, I know we have a 
chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Who can argue with his success? 
</P>
<P>
 The Streak now over, Barnes can concentrate on next season -- when the 
Griffins are supposed to be good.

SCHUSTER LEAVES MARK ON SEA KING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Corona del Mar was a first-round loser in the football playoffs, 
first-year Coach Mark Schuster's imprint on the program was evident. He did 
away this year with the helmet logo that looked like the L.A. Raiders' shield 
and replaced it with a side view of a charging Sea King, trident pointed 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were trying to get a real Raider look -- that's what (former Coach Dave 
Holland) told me," Schuster said. "I'm more a 49er or Dolphin kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a valid reason -- to Schuster's way of thinking -- for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think an athlete has to have a connection with his high school team, not a 
pro team," Schuster said. "These kids are old enough to have their own identity 
and relate to their own city and not some professional team. We need to 
identify with Corona del Mar."

 Mater Dei, Tustin, Servite, and Los Alamitos are among the Orange County teams 
participating in the Tournament of Champions boys' basketball tournament this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament features some of the strongest teams in the Southern 
California, including Los Angeles Fairfax, Westchester, Nogales and Manual 
Arts. The semifinals are Friday and the championship game is scheduled at 8 
p.m. Saturday at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley, Long Beach Jordan, Estancia and Trabuco Hills are playing in 
the Irvine World News tournament at Irvine, University and Woodbridge High 
Schools. Saturday's final is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. at Concordia University. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora, Cypress and La Quinta headline the Sonora Cage Classic tournament with 
the finals scheduled for Saturday at Sonora. Sunny Hills, Canyon, Valencia and 
host El Dorado play in the El Dorado Coed Classic. The final is scheduled for 
7:30 p.m. Saturday at El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are six girls' basketball tournaments this week. The 16-team Cypress 
Classic ends Friday with Newport Harbor a probable choice to be one of the 
finalists and the host team hoping to make a return to the championship game, 
which it lost last year to Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 16-team field is in the Lady Matador Classic at Bolsa Grande, which 
ends Saturday; among the teams in that field is Capistrano Valley, fresh off a 
title in the University tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Two eight-team tournaments are the Estancia Lady Eagle Classic, which ends 
Thursday with a probable Marina-Estancia final; and the Orange Lutheran Pride 
Invitational, which begins Thursday and ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two round-robin tournaments, the El Dorado Coed Classic, which features an El 
Dorado-Canyon matchup on Wednesday, ends Saturday; the La Quinta Lady Aztec 
Classic ends Friday. 
</P>

<P>
 The unranked Ocean View girls' soccer team pulled off two surprise victories 
last week, beating sixth-ranked Edison and No. 2 Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Seahawk forward Kimberly Engesser, who scored three of Ocean 
View's five goals in the week, has been outstanding, but the rest of the team 
has also come up big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's clicking," Coach Ron Uehle said. "It's taking all 15 people to do 
what we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Uehle said the defense -- stopper Karen Dawes, Jessica Funke, Heather Gordon, 
Melissa Bellmore and Danielle Flowers -- has been excellent and the main reason 
the Seahawks outshot Edison and Mater Dei by two to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawes and Funke even played goalkeeper in the 1-0 victory over Edison because 
Jacqueline Knebel was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much drama in Brea-Olinda's title run in the Ladycat Classic, but 
there was an intriguing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 On consecutive nights, in the semifinals and championship, sophomore guard 
Jennifer Saari made baskets from beyond half court as the clock ticked down at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a one-point game when Saari made her long basket in the championship 
game against Torrance Bishop Montgomery, which the Ladycats won, 64-42, blowing 
open the game in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, of course, is an offensive play we just put in," Coach Jeff Sink said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were a couple of big punts this season. Among them, Capistrano Valley's 
Chris Culbertson had an 81-yarder against Edison, and Corona del Mar's J.J. 
DiCesare had a 76-yarder against Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section record is held by Deron Johnson of San Diego High School. 
That's Deron Johnson, the former baseball player, and that's really San Diego, 
which was part of the Southern Section when Johnson boomed the big one -- 98 
yards in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran quarterback Joe Juliano is the first player in school history 
to rush for more than 1,000 yards and pass for more than 1,000 yards. He 
surpassed the rushing milestone in Saturday's 53-13 loss to Montclair Prep in 
the Division X championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with 1,047 yards rushing, 1,723 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's Division V championship victory over Servite, 20-15, was the 
school's first football title and the 100th career victory for Coach Jeff 
Brinkley; his record at Newport is 72-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brinkley: "That was pretty good timing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's Casey Rouintree, who caught the game-winning touchdown against Los 
Alamitos in the Division I football semifinals with 43 seconds remaining, paid 
the price -- he suffered a hairline fracture on his right lower leg and played 
only a few plays in Saturday's 28-21 victory over La Puente Bishop Amat before 
deciding he couldn't go on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to be a football player to play with pain. Katella's Silvia 
Panak showed as much moxie as anyone in an Empire League volleyball match 
against Cypress in the final week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Panak, with a sprained ankle, entered the gym on crutches. She watched from 
the bench as her team split the first two games, 1-15, 15-9, but it bothered 
her terribly; she had trainer Wendy Webber fit her with an air cast and tape 
her ankle. She had the three minutes between periods to warm up and she hobbled 
onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemistry of this team is so good, and she's like our quarterback," Coach 
Mary Starbuck said.

 Panak's teammates passed the ball as closely to her as possible and, limping 
badly, she set the ball back to them; The Knights won the next two games, 15-6, 
15-0, behind Panak's effort, putting the finishing touch on a 12-4, 9-1 regular 
season.

 Jennifer Garrett, Capistrano Valley, Senior 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball/Center 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley Coach Pete Belanto was hoping to win at least two games in 
the South Coast Holiday Classic, but thanks largely to Garrett, the Cougars won 
four and the title. Garrett, who averaged 19 points and 16.5 rebounds, 
dominated the tournament."She pretty much carried us," Belanto said. "She was 
going to be the most valuable player of the tournament even if we didn't win 
it." Garrett, who is 6 feet 3, had nine points and 15 rebounds in a 43-38 
victory over Trabuco Hills in the title game. Trabuco Hills limited her 
offensive output by double-teaming her, but she compensated in other ways. "She 
still made good passes," Belanto said. "She rebounded and did other things to 
help us win." Basketball

<P>
 FIRST-TEAM PROFILES 
</P>
<P>
 Student: Kevin Feterik 
</P>
<P>
 Position: QB 
</P>
<P>
 School: LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
 Year: JR. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season as a starter, Feterik (6-2, 180) completed 68% of his 
passes for 2,911 yards and 27 touchdowns with only six interceptions, all in 9 
1/2 games. Feterik broke a bone in his left hand in the first half of the 
season opener and missed the next three games. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Student: Dahrin Footman 
</P>
<P>
 Position: RB 
</P>
<P>
 School: ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's one-back offense maximized the number of times Footman (5-8, 185) 
would get the ball. He rushed for 1,852 yards, averaging 7.5 yards per carry, 
and scored 24 touchdowns. Fresno State and Nevada Las Vegas are among the teams 
recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Student: Brendan McGraw 
</P>
<P>
 Position: RB 
</P>
<P>
 School: LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw (6-1, 186) finished second all-time in single-season rushing (2,511 
yards) and first in touchdowns (45) in county, despite skipping six halves--the 
equivalent of three games--because Hawks were so far ahead. California and San 
Diego State are recruiting. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Student: Kris Farris 
</P>
<P>
 Position: OL 
</P>
<P>
 School: SANTA MARGARITA  
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 Farris (6-8, 275) has the size scouts drool over. He is an excellent backside 
pass protector and improved his run-blocking this season. He has quick feet, is 
athletic for a big man, and is rarely beaten by opposing defenses. UCLA, USC 
and Stanford are recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Student: Jason Grain 
</P>
<P>
 Position: OL 
</P>
<P>
 School: SONORA 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-time letterman and All-Freeway League selection, Grain (6-5, 270) can 
count Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA and USC among teams recruiting 
him. Solid as both a run- and pass-blocker. Was Sonora's offensive lineman of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Student: Jeff Hagstrom 
</P>
<P>
 Position: OL 
</P>
<P>
 School: IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagstrom (6-1, 265) is athletic with good quickness, and Irvine Coach Terry 
Henigan says Hagstrom is the strongest football player ever at Irvine. A 
center, the Vaqueros left him to block one-on-one; an excellent run-blocker, he 
was even better against the pass rush. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Student: Matt Motherway 
</P>
<P>
 Position: OL 
</P>
<P>
 School: MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. One of the top linemen prospects in the county. Being recruited by 
USC, UCLA, Colorado and Stanford, among others. A solid run-blocker with quick 
feet. A two-time All-South Coast League selection and three-year letterman. 
Also plays defensive tackle.

<P>
 Student: Brett Samperi 
</P>
<P>
 Position: OL 
</P>
<P>
 School: SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. Could be the best lineman in San Clemente history. USC, California, 
Arizona State and Oregon are among the teams recruiting him. Has good speed to 
go with his size (6-5, 270). Could walk in and play at most colleges. A 
two-time All-South Coast League selection.

<P>
 Student: Brad Melsby 
</P>
<P>
 Position: WR 
</P>
<P>
 School: LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins were 39-1-1 during his three-year career. Melsby (6-1, 183) 
finished as Orange County's leader in career receptions (185), yardage (2,979), 
and touchdown receptions (35). UCLA, Stanford, Arizona State and Minnesota are 
among the schools recruiting him.

<P>
 A fast and dangerous receiver, he had 59 receptions for 1,191 yards--the

<P>
 School: ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
 Year: JR. Forth (6-1, 180) has soft hands and was fearless over the middle. He 
was versatile; the Aztecs also used him as an outside receiver and occasionally 
as a wing back to carry the ball. He led the team with 59 receptions for 995 
yards and nine touchdowns.

<P>
 Position: DL 
</P>
<P>
 School: LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
 Year: SR. 
</P>
<P>
 Although small for a defensive lineman, Houston (5-9, 173) still caused havoc 
in opponents' backfields. Houston's performance typified the Griffins' 
undersized defense, which had a penchant for making big plays. Los Alamitos 
allowed only 14 points per game.

<P>
 School: NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>

<P>
 Although Johns (5-9, 195) is small for a lineman, he used his exceptional 
quickness and strength to get in on 105 tackles, including 14 sacks; he had one 
fumble recovery. He provided relentless pursuit, and was named the Sea View 
League's defensive player of the year.

 Has that linebacker mentality. Has the size (6-3, 240) and talent to be a 
Division I inside linebacker. At least Kansas and Colorado State think so. 
Those are two of the teams chasing him. Also a solid offensive lineman. A big 
reason the Mustangs made the Division I semifinals.

 McDonough (6-1, 215) continued Newport Harbor's tradition of developing 
linebackers. He was in on 134 tackles (including 11 for losses), two sacks, an 
interception and one fumble recovery. He is aggressive, and one of his greatest 
assets is an ability to make great reads.

 Hector (6-1, 172) was one of the best pass defenders in the county. His 
coverage was tight and receivers rarely beat him. He was also a fierce hitter. 
Hector finished with six interceptions and held Los Alamitos' Tony Hartley to 
one reception in a 35-32 loss.

<P>
 Lachappelle (6-1, 190) is one of the biggest hitters to play in Orange County, 
and he showed it. A free safety, he had four interceptions, caused four 
fumbles, recovered two fumbles, blocked seven kicks and was in on 102 tackles. 
Pacific 10 and WAC teams are recruiting him.

 A pretty fair quarterback--1,604 yards and 11 touchdowns passing, 376 yards 
rushing. But he's even more celebrated as a defender with 31 solo tackles, 20 
assists, two sacks and five passes broken up. He is being recruited by San

 Averaged 44 net yards per kick for the Golden West League champions. But his 
real skill came with the loft and spin he put on the ball; opponents fumbled at 
least one punt in 13 of Servite's 14 games, and the Friars recovered five of 
them. Also played some defensive end. THE SECOND TEAM
