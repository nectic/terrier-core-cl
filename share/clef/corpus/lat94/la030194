 The annual migration of California gray whales is under way, with hundreds of 
the huge mammals making the trip from Arctic waters to the warm lagoons of Baja 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 Several organizations offer whale-watching trips and educational programs 
about these creatures and other marine life. Space is usually limited, so 
reservations are a must. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Olguin, director emeritus of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, will lead 
the American Cetacean Society's 16th annual "Around Catalina Island Cruise" on 
Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Experts in oceanography, sea birds, marine 
mammals, sea life and the geology of Catalina Island will explain the rich 
diversity of life encountered during the circumnavigation of the island aboard 
a Catalina Cruises vessel. (310) 548-6279 
</P>
<P>
 * Whales have perennially navigated Dana Point's head land, providing an 
opportunity to view these magnificent animals from terra firma. The 1994 Dana 
Point Festival of Whales will provide visitors with many activities on Saturday 
and Sunday. Events will include marine life presentations at the Orange County 
Marine Institute, tide pool tours and programs aboard the tall ship, Pilgrim. 
(800) 290-DANA 
</P>
<P>
 * Naturalists from the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium will lead cruises from Long 
Beach, San Pedro and Redondo Beach through March. Cruises to view whales and 
other marine life generally are three hours long and operate daily. (310) 
832-4444 
</P>
<P>
 * Informational booths, educational activities, lighthouse tours and 
entertainment for children and adults will make for a "Whale of a Day," the 
annual event at Point Vicente Interpretive Center on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. (310) 377-5370 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society is conducting the 
annual gray whale census from the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. Volunteers 
are needed to observe and note population levels and migration patterns. (310) 
519-8963 
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History will be offering trips aboard 
the 88-foot Condor out of Sea Landing in the Santa Barbara Harbor during the 
first three weekends in March. Trips will depart at 9 a.m. and return at 11:30 
a.m. In addition, the museum will have a number of other events during Whale 
Awareness Week, March 7-11. Call (805) 682-4711 for information and trip 
registration materials. 
</P>
<P>
 * On March 12, the Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society will 
offer Floating Fiesta, a cruise to Catalina Island to view whales from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., departing from San Pedro. (310) 827-5045 
</P>
<P>
 * A nine-day cruise to explore the Baja Peninsula aboard the 95-foot vessel 
Searcher will follow the migration route of California gray whales March 6-15. 
Los Angeles County Natural History Museum naturalists and members of the 
American Cetacean Society will be on hand to instruct participants in the 
habits of marine life and the natural history of the area. (213) 744-6912 
</P>
<P>
 * A cruise to San Ignacio Lagoon and the Sea of Cortez in Mexico will be 
offered by the national American Cetacean Society March 18-29. Leaving from San 
Diego, participants will look for gray whales, blue whales, fin whales and 
humpbacks, along with other marine life. (310) 438-8960 NONA YATES

 Where do talk show guests come from? 
</P>
<P>
 When we chatted with Christopher Darryn of Reseda last year, he was just 
starting his National Talk Show Guest Registry. For $3 a month, he'll enroll 
you in a computer bank and advertise your availability to Geraldo and Oprah and 
the rest of them. Darryn now has more than 1,800 clients, including these 
recent additions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry Conrad, a professional ghost-buster from Studio City, who took part in 
what he calls the "San Pedro Haunting" of 1989. (We must have been on vacation 
when it happened.) He said he helped evict some poltergeists who were so 
vicious that they attempted to hang one of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Chappell of Miami, who is a expert on the "elongated second toes of the 
rich and famous," many of whom were Hollywood celebrities, including Marilyn 
Monroe. Those blessed with big second toes, Chappell claims, have more sex 
appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rick Rosner of Encino, who has one of the highest IQs in the nation and is 
the only person "to take an IQ test naked and in public as a stripper." We 
weren't there, so have no information on his second toes. 
</P>

 After schlocks: One post-quake fax now rumbling through the Southland purports 
to show a list of "magnitudes by ZIP code . . . provided by Caltech." But this 
is no Kate Hutton production. It's a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually things like this die down," said Caltech spokesman Jay Aller. "But 
not this one. We first saw it before Valentine's Day. It must have some sort of 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the numbers seem plausible, Aller noted that, according to 
the list, his father survived the Big One in Reseda -- a 9.4 quake. "Obviously, 
if you were hit by a 9.4 quake you wouldn't still have a house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech has received numerous calls about the list from businesses, especially 
real estate brokers. "We've also heard from Universal Studios and Disney," 
Aller said. "Even FEMA called." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the callers were "pretty suspicious," Aller added, except for one 
resident in the Newhall area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really upset," Aller said, "because some of the worst shaking was out 
there and his ZIP code wasn't on it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-shakes: They're still coming in, those clues that a quake was near. A few 
days before it struck, Everett Fong saw a church marquee in Torrance that said: 
"This is your last chance to pray before the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vanity tectonic plates: It's also sort of eerie that the February issue of Car 
& Driver magazine went to press before the quake with a segment on memorable 
vanity plates, including 5 12 PM. If that one doesn't ring a bell, or an alarm, 
it's probably because you're a Southern Californian. The plate refers to the 
time of the 1989 Loma Prieta (sometimes called the World Series) quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Anthony Higdon thought he had a ready-made Official Quake License 
Plate -- at least until Caltech went and upped the magnitude to 6.8. Higdon's 
plate, which refers to a family trip along a famous route, says: WE DID 66.

 Caffeine, published by Hot Water Press in Woodland Hills, is a new poetry 
magazine that also offers "An Existential Guide to the Coffeehouses of Los 
Angeles." Most eye-catching name is the Grassy Knoll, a Silver Lake joint that 
has a small theater called the Book Depository.

AL MARTINEZ: RETURN OF THE DEAD DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a week since I wrote that wonderful little column about the 
disappearance of my old dog Hoover in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lyrical essay linking two old dogs in the rain, full of emotional 
nuances and spiritual imagery that had him trotting off forever toward a 
distant horizon and me calling his name with tears in my eyes, like Shirley 
Booth in "Come Back Little Sheba." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, forget it. The damn fool is back. 
</P>
<P>
 I came home from work one day and there he was in the middle of the living 
room looking bewildered as usual and trying to remember who I was. 
</P>
<P>
 My first thought was that he was some sort of spectral projection returned to 
haunt me for the rest of my life. I could see him floating above the bed like a 
manatee and drifting across the ceiling of my work room. 
</P>
<P>
 I crossed myself automatically and was preparing to run screaming from the 
house, which is what I do when faced with earthquakes, fires or resurrections, 
when my wife Cinelli said, "Thought you had lost your darling doggie, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
 She was standing just out of my vision and that gave me a start too. The woman 
has a way of popping up when I least expect her, which is why I check the room 
thoroughly before I sneak a forbidden martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about ready to call an exorcist," I said. "Is he real or is he 
ectoplasm?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He's real," she said. "I found him at the animal shelter. You write the sweet 
words but I'm the one who goes grubbing for the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," I said, "this is embarrassing. We can't have him back after I wrote 
that touching essay. We're going to have to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was someone found the dead dog Hoover wandering in the rain the 
day he escaped from his yard and took him in. He was no doubt headed for that 
distant horizon, but the good Samaritan, damn his soul, intruded. 
</P>
<P>
 The person kept Hoover for several days, during which time Cinelli checked the 
pound, and he wasn't there. We figured he was lost forever. Even though he made 
a frequent habit of digging out from his yard, he had never wandered far and 
had never been gone long. 
</P>
<P>
 I recall saying to Cinelli after the third day of his disappearance, "He was 
such a dear old dog," and her replying, "You never did like him. Hoover wasn't 
even his real name." 
</P>
<P>
 True. His real name was Brownie but everyone called him Barney until I began 
calling him Hoover, I'm not sure why. It made him slightly schizo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what his name was," I said, "his personality was 
electrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when I gave him up for lost and began writing the column (a dead dog is 
never wasted), Cinelli kept looking. She is Italian and not one to give up 
easily. The Romans did not conquer the world by abandoning every little 
dog-hunting expedition they went on. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the good Samaritan took the dead dog Hoover to the pound, and he 
was there when Cinelli went in for one last look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe my eyes," she said. "For a moment, I thought it was some 
kind of weird vision and that God had condemned him to be your puppy forever, 
the poor thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both cursed," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead dog Hoover, meanwhile, managed a glare and began pacing around the 
fireplace clockwise, his toenails clicking on the tile. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt like I was in Hell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It cost $32.50 to bail him out of the pound. Ten dollars was the basic fee, 
and $22.50 was for room and board. It's about what you'd pay at Motel 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did they feed him?" I asked Cinelli. "The dead dog Hoover won't eat just 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "He does look skinnier," she said, studying him, "but it's hard to tell. He's 
so old and kind of scrawny. But he's here and he's alive and I wish you'd stop 
calling him the dead dog Hoover." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not really disappointed that he has risen like Lazarus from a presumed 
state of demise. I have become accustomed over the past 18 years to him staring 
at me through baleful eyes and being forever underfoot and cringing at the 
slightest danger and barking at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 What does bother me is disappointing all of those who had such a good cry 
thinking that my doggie was gone and I was in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't count the number of letters, telephone calls and comments from people 
saying things like "You've got to go on despite your grief," and offering to 
bring me casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to thank you all and apologize for the fact that the dead dog Hoover 
is, to the best of my knowledge, still breathing. So hold the grief and the 
casseroles, I have a feeling he's going to be around for a long, long time.

EDUCATION WATCH; FAILING THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year the California Education Department introduced new tests for 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders that it said would better test students' 
reasoning ability, rather than just test their luck in guessing at 
multiple-choice questions. Included for 10th-graders were excerpts from the 
Alice Walker short story "Roselily."Now, those excerpts will not be used this 
spring, thanks to what seems to be the department's bow to special-interest 
pressure. That shouldn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In the excerpts Walker, who won a 1983 Pulitzer Prize for her novel "The Color 
Purple," presents the thoughts of a black, previously unmarried mother at her 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, which in recent years 
has become a major lobbyist on conservative and religious issues. The coalition 
objected to the new tests on the fuzzy grounds that they emphasized emotions 
over intellect, and it claimed that the "Roselily" excerpts were anti-religious 
and anti-clergy -- a position correctly rejected by the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In removing the excerpts, the department was right in pointing out that 
because of the publicity some students would have advance knowledge of the 
"Roselily" questions. However, it admitted that pressure also played a part in 
its decision. And that's unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has put all of Walker's works on its recommended reading list 
and said it may use "Roselily" on future tests. When it can, it should, as an 
example of the department's refusal to surrender to censorship.

THE EVIL OF POLITICAL EXTREMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eulogies of hate spoken at Sunday's funeral of Dr. Baruch Goldstein, the 
West Bank settler who killed 48 praying Palestinians last week, are beyond 
contempt. Fanatics who rejoice in the slaughter of the innocent hardly speak 
for all West Bank settlers; they speak for only a small fraction of Israelis 
and an even tinier fraction of Jews worldwide. Jews and indeed decent people 
everywhere are deeply shamed and repulsed by both the massacre and the remarks 
made at Goldstein's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The American immigrant physician was beaten to death by worshipers after he 
methodically fired more than 100 rounds inside a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred extremist Jews gathered Sunday in Jerusalem, many toting 
automatic rifles, to eulogize Goldstein as a righteous hero. "The act itself 
was one of greatness. It was a great act of sanctifying (God)," said a 
spokesman for Kach, the small extremist group of which Goldstein was a member. 
No, it was not. Goldstein's action was unspeakably evil. "One million Arabs are 
not worth a Jewish fingernail," said another mourner at the funeral. "We are 
all Goldsteins!" shouted others. 
</P>
<P>
 What vile thoughts. Goldstein was a fanatic bent on a mission of his own 
making. And the fundamentalist group to which he belonged represents the views 
of only itself and a smattering of other hatemongers in the Middle East and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to preserve the fragile progress toward peace in the Mideast 
talks, the Israeli government, commendably, has moved quickly to isolate Kach 
followers. On Sunday it ordered some of the toughest measures ever imposed 
against militant Jews. Several leaders of the Kach movement, an offshoot of the 
Jewish Defense League, were ordered detained. The government also plans to 
disarm and restrict a number of West Bank militants. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and a majority of Israelis are saying with a clear voice: No, 
we are not all Goldsteins; the massacre was an atrocity; it is the extremists 
of the Middle East -- Jewish as well as Arab and Palestinian extremists -- who 
are the mortal enemies of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 To permit the peace process to flag now would be to permit the extremists to 
dictate the course of history. The determined people of goodwill in the Middle 
East must not allow that to happen.

THE APPEAL OF THE ZAPATISTAS; REBELS STRIKE HOME WITH CALL FOR POLITICAL REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government may be close to a peace agreement with rebels in 
Chiapas that could have positive ramifications not just for that impoverished 
southern state but for all of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last week negotiators representing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
and the Zapatista National Liberation Front have been meeting in Chiapas, 
trying to reach an accord to end the armed rebellion, which has claimed more 
than 100 lives since it began Jan. 1. Many of the issues under discussion are 
unique to Chiapas, where a rural, heavily Indian population is locked in 
poverty stemming mainly from a near-feudal land ownership system. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of the rebel demands has resonated even with urban Mexicans: The 
Zapatistas want a more responsive, truly democratic political system in Mexico. 
That has won them the support of intellectuals in Mexico City, business people 
in Monterrey and ranchers in northern Mexico. Just as important, it has won the 
Zapatistas support from political parties on both the left and right that have 
been frustrated for years over the stifling dominance of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI has never lost a presidential election, and only rarely has it 
conceded defeat on the state or municipal level. That has led most Mexicans to 
cynically conclude that when the PRI can't win honestly, it simply steals 
elections. And even if that is not always true, the effect is to undermine 
faith in the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to clean up the PRI's image at home and abroad, Salinas promised 
electoral reform before the presidential election next August. Although a few 
reforms were made, critics say they did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Salinas reportedly has decided to call a special legislative session, as 
early as this week, to present a new reform initiative. The package will 
include placing international election observers at polling stations, equal 
media access time for all political parties and putting the Federal Electoral 
Institute, which sets election rules and verifies all voting results, under 
nonpartisan control. Until now the institute has been controlled by the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of these steps would be a noteworthy break with the past; for example, 
accepting international election observers would mean swallowing national 
pride. As a package, they are unprecedented and impressive.  
</P>
<P>
 Government sources deny that Salinas' reform proposals have suddenly been 
revived because of the Chiapas rebellion, but the timing cannot be a 
coincidence. It is most unfortunate that it took bloodshed to get political 
reform in Mexico moving again. But what's important is that the process has 
begun anew. This time it must not be stopped.

A REBUKE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury in Texas has brought a properly anticlimactic conclusion to the 
horrific events that led to the incineration of the Branch Davidian sect's 
compound near Waco last year. The jury acquitted 11 of the survivors of 
conspiracy and murder charges in the deaths of four federal agents, killed Feb. 
28, 1993, in the original, botched raid on the compound; seven of the 11 
defendants were convicted on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts were a stinging rebuke to the government, which mounted the raid 
even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) knew it had lost 
the element of surprise. Later, the FBI failed in 51 days of negotiations to 
get the armed sect and its messianic leader, David Koresh, to surrender. In the 
end, on April 19, a raid resulted in the deaths of Koresh and 81 other 
Davidians by fire and self-inflicted gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waco events followed another incompetent raid by federal agents -- an 
August, 1992, attempt to arrest Randy Weaver, a white separatist who was a 
fugitive from trial on weapons charges, at his mountain cabin in northern 
Idaho. During an 11-day standoff, a federal marshal and Weaver's wife and 
14-year-old son were killed. In a foreshadowing of the Waco verdicts, a jury 
acquitted Weaver on murder and conspiracy charges, convicting only on a lesser 
charge. The Justice Department is probing possible official misconduct.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone involved in the Waco affair has been sullied by it. The ATF's 
director was forced to resign after a Treasury Department report found serious 
intelligence deficiencies, poor planning and a "general failure" of the 
agency's management. And from some quarters there was criticism of the then-new 
attorney general, Janet Reno, who oversaw the final calamity, in which about 25 
children perished. While admirably accepting responsibility, she has still not 
issued an adequate public report on the FBI's failure to find a peaceful end. 
</P>
<P>
 One does not have to hold much sympathy for the distorted views of Koresh and 
Weaver to see they were victims of excessive force. The Waco jury said as much 
in its verdict. The federal government must enforce weapons laws. But let the 
Waco verdict stand as a statement that it must use less Wild West bravado and 
more finesse in the future.

PAT NOLAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The lament that it's "like a death in the family," by supporters of 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), in response to his guilty plea, and their 
statement ". . . he's incorruptible" (Feb. 19) fill me with wonder at what 
other kinds of behavior some Republicans will applaud in their legislators. For 
instance, all Republican assemblymen (except one) supported Nolan who, in his 
sworn statement filed with the court, conducted his Assembly office as a 
"racketeering enterprise" for extorting campaign contributions from those who 
sought his support on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we await the March 21 court trial of two other Republicans some five 
years after they were caught in the FBI sting operations, Sen. Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) and legislative aide Terry E. Frost. They say they will continue 
to fight even though they know the prosecution charges are backed up by 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did we have to wait until there was an attorney general appointed by a 
Democratic President for the Republicans caught in the 1988 FBI sting operation 
to be brought to trial?

 Strange, however, that among those named, only Pat Nolan is identified by

Paul Carpenter" had no political affiliation. (He was a Democrat from Downey.)

 Let's publicly denounce all these rascals with full name, rank and party

GUNMEN SLAY POLICE OFFICERS

<TEXT>

 * I found it ironic that the same day the killing of LAPD Officer Christy 
Hamilton was on the front page (Feb. 23), The Times carried an advertisement 
for an interview of Rodney King on CNN. King has become a household name, a 
celebrity of sorts. But who will remember Christy Hamilton's name one month 
from now? She does not have the option of being on TV and telling her story 
because she did not survive her ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet where is the mayor and why isn't he calling a press conference to denounce 
this terrible act? Where are the City Council members and church leaders 
expressing their outrage at what happened? We as a community must stand behind 
our police officers and let it be known that we will no longer tolerate the 
killing of our peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to protest Christy Hamilton's murder the same way we reacted to Rodney 
King's beating. If we do not take steps to stop the indiscriminate shooting of 
police officers, more of them are going to lose their lives while trying to 
protect citizens.

 * Regarding the shooting of two police officers, Feb. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the gun lobby's theory that everyone should be armed for 
counterattack and defense. David Fukuto attacked a room full of police 
officers, and even if they were each armed it wouldn't have helped. Gun 
violence is a deadly force that takes people by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The only solution at this point, with over 200 million guns in circulation 
(and growing by the minute), is to ban the manufacture, sale and possession of 
guns and ammunition. Fukuto had legally amassed an arsenal.

 * Two men were gunned down in cold blood on Feb. 14. Both of these men were 
police officers and they were killed by a deranged gunman during a seminar, 
which was attended by the top brass of the Palos Verdes Estates Police 
Department and City Hall. I did not know Sgt. Tom Vanderpool but I had the 
pleasure of knowing Capt. Mike Tracy for the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not know Mike as captain of a police department but I knew him as just 
another guy with similar recreational interests as mine. I knew Mike as a warm 
and caring family man who always had time (or made time) to help a friend or 
stranger. Mike's sense of humor was second to none and he could always make us 
smile when we started to take ourselves too seriously. As we go through life we 
make many acquaintances and, unfortunately, very few true friends. I considered 
Mike Tracy a true friend in every sense of the word.

 * I read your article regarding the 17-year-old who killed a police officer, 
his father, and then himself (Feb. 23). While I had not seen Steve Golly for 
nearly 10 years, I was a close friend of his for a number of years in the late 
1970s and early 1980s. His wife Pam worked for me as a secretary for about four 
years in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reporter quoted a neighbor of the Gollys to the effect that Steve was "an 
unfriendly and humorless" person. He went on to say that he "always felt that 
he (Steve) would be a difficult father." My experience is that Steve Golly was 
a warm, friendly and extremely generous man who, above all else, loved his son 
dearly. My sense in reading your article was that the reporter was trying to 
create a picture of a strange and dysfunctional family, which, in my 
experience, it was not. Rather, you have missed the real story: that drugs 
destroyed a warm, loving and happy family.

AIDS PREVENTION FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is in reference to your Feb. 17 editorial, "Get the Information Out!" 
As a graduate of Glendale's Hoover High School, I am horrified and disgusted by 
the news that the neighborhood which I remember as so intelligent, and 
particularly its school board, seems to be unwilling to use every possible 
means to fight the AIDS epidemic. I realize that sexual activity and 
orientation are subjects much too "human" and "delicate" for some adults to 
even discuss, but the agonizing (and expensive) death of people at the point 
where society is just beginning to obtain a return on its investment in their 
lives should, at the very least, be looked at as a gigantic economic problem. 
Will the response be as pussyfooted if the present rise in tuberculosis becomes 
epidemic?

 * Abstinence is the answer to stop the spread of AIDS, but when one is dealing 
with teen-agers -- who are in the age of experimentation -- one needs to inform 
them of the dangers of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In my junior year at Norwalk High School, Kaiser Permanente staged its play, 
"Secrets," on our campus. I found the play to be responsible by stressing 
abstinence, yet the play discussed the use of condoms as protection if one 
chooses to experiment with sex. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to believe that Glendale school district officials are willing 
to jeopardize students' health. It is a fact that high school students are 
having sex. I am not promoting promiscuity, but what I am saying is that if 
teen-agers choose to become sexually active, they should at least be aware of 
how to protect themselves from a deadly disease. KAREN D. CARRANZA

<P>
 * Teen-agers are sexually active. Like it or not! I cannot believe that the 
Glendale school board refuses to face facts and promote the proper use of 
condoms. The play "Secrets" could save some young lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that abstinence is the very best preventive method for any sexually 
transmitted disease. As president of Being Alive South Bay, in speaking with 
young people, I repeat that message time and time again. After clearly stating 
that, I then state, if, however, your choice is sexual activity, never even 
think about it without a condom properly used. I can only say to the Glendale 
school board: Take a reality pill!

 * Re "Minority Scholarships," Feb. 18: 
</P>
<P>
 This piece depicts how far the feds are going to promote disenfranchisement. 
Special privileges to specific groups violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964.This 
act is still a good and fair law. It prohibits discrimination for reasons of 
race, color, creed and national origin. It also violates the U.S. Constitution 
in that it doesn't authorize the feds' involvement in education or anything 
else not specified. See the 10th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Education Richard Riley's contention that minorities have been 
discriminated against is not my bone of contention. I am a first-generation 
American. I am not now or have I ever been responsible for discrimination. How 
about my rights? 
</P>
<P>
 This is how totalitarian governments promote hatred, emphasizing differences 
instead of similarities. Special privileges to specific groups achieve this 
diabolical purpose.

 Except for the condition of the economy, the most significant social problem 
in California today is the divisiveness and sense of isolation afflicting 
members of our society, particularly in urban areas. It is in this social 
environment that crime flourishes.When Californians do not feel connected to 
one another, when we have no sense of identity with each other's fate, we have 
a situation where criminals can freely prey upon us.  
</P>
<P>
 Business is not a social-welfare institution. Any business, however, expects 
to adapt to its environment to succeed. At Rebuild L.A., we worked with Smart & 
Final stores. They opened a new grocery in a high-crime area on Crenshaw 
Boulevard. Before opening, they knocked on the doors of each house in the 
neighborhood. They hired employees from the neighborhood. For a store in its 
first year, Smart & Final reported that this store had the highest gross and 
net revenues of any store in the history of the chain. Even more notable is the 
fact that this store has among the lowest theft rates of any urban store in the 
chain, new or old.

JEWS HAVE LONG SUFFERED IN HEBRON; TERRORISM: THE CRIME OF ONE GUNMAN CAN'T BE 
EQUATED WITH CENTURIES OF ARAB VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ELIEZRIE, Rabbi David Eliezrie is director of the National Conference 
on Jewish and Contemporary Law in Yorba Linda.

<P>
 For centuries, blood has flowed in Hebron -- in almost all cases, Jewish blood 
spilled by Arab violence. In 1929, as in 1517, 1841 and 1851, the Jews of 
Hebron were slaughtered. Because of Arab pogroms, in 1936, the British forcibly 
removed most Jews from Hebron, after more than 3,500 years of continued 
residence. Jews were not permitted to return until after the Six-Day War of 
1967. Since then, there have been numerous attacks, the most notorious in 1980, 
when Arab terrorists waylaid a group of Jews walking back from evening prayers 
at the Tomb of Abraham and murdered six of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement last September, the situation 
has deteriorated, with almost daily Arab terrorist attacks resulting in at 
least 30 Jewish deaths in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The act of Baruch Goldstein last Friday -- entering a mosque and killing at 
least 40 people there -- is reprehensible. It defies both Jewish law and 
tradition: While Judaism supports acts of defense, indiscriminate violence is 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the world's uproar over this great crime is one-sided. Arab terrorism is 
organized; Goldstein acted alone. He was a quiet man, and his closest friends, 
even his wife, had no idea of what he intended to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein went to Hebron years ago to serve as a physician. Daily, he saw 
firsthand the carnage as those wounded in Arab attacks were brought to his 
care. Since the gunning down of his closest friend and his friend's son in 
December, Goldstein became deeply distressed. Last Thursday night, during a 
Purim service at the Tomb of Abraham, he heard, along with many others, the 
cries of Arabs in the mosque next door: " Etbak el Yahud -- kill the Jews." 
Many of Goldstein's friends feel that this pushed him over the edge. The next 
morning, he rose at dawn and went to the mosque and killed those he thought 
were going to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hypocritical for the world to condemn the irrational act of one man and 
ignore the organized efforts of Arab terrorist groups. In the last 10 days 
alone, they murdered a pregnant mother and an army reservist and made dozens of 
other unsuccessful attacks. Hamas, the Fatah hawks of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and other groups have been orchestrating a systematic policy of 
terror against Jewish civilians in the West Bank. These efforts are the cause 
of the tensions, not the actions of one person, terrible as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, we witness the murder of one Jew after another and there is 
nothing but silence from the PLO and the world. Now, after this terrible 
carnage, the PLO demands that the settlers be disarmed. Who then will protect 
the Jews from the daily attacks -- Yasser Arafat, the man with the blood of 
hundreds if not thousands of Jews on his hands? 
</P>
<P>
 Jews are not interlopers or settlers in Hebron. They have a historic right to 
live there. The first Jew, Abraham, buried his wife Sarah in Hebron. Despite 
pogroms, expulsions, attacks and murders, Jews have continued to live in the 
city of their forefathers. Goldstein's grandparents were from Hebron, forced 
out by Arab violence decades ago. He, like many other Jews, just wanted to live 
in the home of his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Hebron has not been easy for Jews. A very close friend of mine, Sara 
Nachshon, a mother of 10, was one of the first Jews to renew the ancient 
settlement after the Six-Day War. She has been attacked numerous times. One 
day, the bus she was riding in was machine-gunned; the bullets missed her by 
inches. Another time, as she was going to pray at the Jewish cemetery, an Arab 
tried to kill her with a knife. Her oldest son, Yehuda, was stabbed in the back 
as he walked through the market; the thick seam on his denim jacket saved his 
life. Every Jew in Hebron has been the target of such violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arafat-Rabin agreement has accelerated the violence. The Arabs of Hebron 
and the West Bank are hoping to accomplish what they did in 1935: drive the 
Jews out. The world, naive, without a sense of yesterday, only sees the 
terrible carnage of today. It does not see the fresh grave of a mother gunned 
down with a baby in her womb a week ago or the dozens of others who have met 
similar fates. 
</P>
<P>
 The present Israeli government carries much of the responsibility. It has 
failed to protect its citizens from Arab terrorism. This breakdown in basic 
security calls into question the very agreement that the government is 
supporting. If the army cannot protect its citizens from Palestinian terrorists 
now, what will happen when Palestinians themselves are the police? Things will 
only get worse, not better, with Arafat in Jericho instead of Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jews, we must condemn an act of violence against another human being, even 
if that person is filled with hatred toward us. Baruch Goldstein was wrong to 
spill blood in the mosque in Hebron. But we cannot let the world compare the 
acts of one person to the continuous attacks of Arab groups that are dedicated 
to pushing Jews out of our homeland.

COLUMN RIGHT/ MICKEY EDWARDS: POLICY PUTS GOP BACK IN CONTROL; WITHOUT RELYING 
ON POLITICS OR PERSONALITIES, THE REPUBLICANS ARE SETTING THE NATIONAL AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY EDWARDS, Mickey Edwards, a former congressman (R-Okla.), is teaching 
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and writing a column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans, without the White House, without either house of Congress, a 
political minority for most of the past half a century, are again seizing 
control of the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with Richard Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornburgh was a popular governor of Pennsylvania, and after having picked up 
some federal experience as attorney general, he would have made a good U.S. 
senator. Instead, Thornburgh, a Republican, was defeated for a Senate seat by a 
Democrat named Harris Wofford, a distinct underdog, who had latched onto the 
public's anxiety about rising health-care costs. Republicans were dismayed. As 
it turns out, however, Thornburgh's stunning loss may well prove to have been a 
blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 When the heavily favored Thornburgh was sent crashing to defeat, Democrats 
across the country thought they had finally found the magic bullet that would 
end Republican control of the White House. When Bill Clinton did in fact win 
the presidency with health-care reform as one of his major issues, the 
Democrats were certain they had found the political equivalent of the death 
ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton immediately staked a good part of his presidency on creating the 
national health-insurance program that had eluded both Harry Truman and Lyndon 
Johnson. Once more, for the umpteenth time since 1920, we were told that a 
comprehensive national health program was an idea whose time had come. The 
President showed his commitment to the effort by placing his wife in charge. 
From every corner, policy wonks gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 And on this roll of the dice, Bill Clinton is about to come a cropper. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Clinton misread his election victory. Like Ronald Reagan, who 
mistakenly interpreted the public's rejection of Jimmy Carter as a mandate for 
the entire Reagan legislative agenda, Clinton thought the voters were electing 
him when, in fact, they were unelecting George Bush. And even then, 57% of the 
voters cast their ballots for the two candidates who advocated neither a 
national health program nor a major expansion of government. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's second major miscalculation was the belief that congressional 
Republicans would either draw a line in the sand and suggest that people who 
were not wealthy should simply be left to die, or simply spin about 
ineffectually, caught between right-wing rhetoric and political fear. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Republicans had been hard at work for more than a year before 
Clinton's election trying to devise their own programs to deal with what they, 
too, perceived as problem areas in the nation's health-care system. They 
neither spun nor dithered. They came forth with solid programs that made 
considerably more sense than did Clinton's. When one of conservatism's 
brightest new spokesmen, William Kristol, stated boldly that the country had 
health-care problems but no crisis -- a sentiment shared by the majority of 
Americans -- Republicans had found their voice, and Clinton's health plan began 
to lose steam rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Clinton's chickens are coming home to roost. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), 
the Ways and Means subcommittee chairman who gets first crack at the Clinton 
plan, has proclaimed large parts of it dead on arrival. And Stark, who is even 
more liberal than the President, says that all the President will get is a 
smidgen of the program he sent to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, voters told pollsters that their principal concern was the 
high rate of violent crime in the nation's cities, precisely the message 
Republicans had been hammering home all through the Bush presidency. The best 
line of Clinton's State of the Union speech ("Three strikes and you're out," he 
told criminals) was a Republican line. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats now see their President pushing a welfare-reform program 
that is a virtual carbon copy of Republican initiatives. We are closer than 
ever to putting a balanced-budget amendment in the federal Constitution. The 
Administration's campaign to "reinvent government" is nothing more than a 
stitching together of Republican reform proposals dating back to the early days 
of the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans control no levers of power. They don't have the White House, they 
don't have a single chairmanship in Congress, they have no consensus spokesman, 
but in the long run what politics is all about is neither partisanship nor 
personality. It's about policy, and policy is a game the Republicans are 
winning.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: REAL WARS, NOT WAR MOVIES, SPAWN MURDER; THE 
KILLING URGES OF A CHRISTOPHER GOLLY GO BEYOND HEAVY-METAL AND CRYSTAL METH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A terrible set of killings in Northridge has renewed the hunt for the roots of 
social violence by the young. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early hours of Feb. 22, 17-year old Christopher Golly turned up to full 
volume a Jim Morrison song called "The End," in which the singer fantasizes 
about killing his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Christopher had planned it, his 49-year old father, Steven Golly, got 
out of bed to tell him to cut the noise. Son killed father with one shot from a 
military-style AR-15-type assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as he'd outlined his plans to a close pal a day earlier, 
Christopher Golly opened fire on the police cruisers drawing up in front of the 
house. One in a fusillade of at least 14 shots killed Christy Lynne Hamilton, 
who had graduated from the Los Angeles Police Department academy only four days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Christopher Golly went back indoors, picked up a .22-caliber handgun and 
finished his own life. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no shortage of efforts to figure out what pushed young Golly 
into this destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 His was a broken home. His mother, Pamela, had left some years earlier, and 
died of a cocaine overdose in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's father was a Vietnam veteran. By some accounts he was a hard man 
whose main point of amicable contact with his son was through guns, of which he 
had a fair number in the house. Father would take son for target practice, 
often using the AR-15-type rifle. But he was tough on Christopher. More than 
once, the son confided to school friends that one of these days he'd kill his 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher did speed -- crystal methamphetamine was his current preference -- 
and also listened to speed metal, a variant of heavy-metal music influenced by 
late 1970s punk. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, this adds up to an Identikit profile of anomic '90s youth, hyped on 
paranoia-inducing drugs and mayhem-inducing music. The only thing missing is 
someone blaming TV violence for setting Christopher off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent furor about the role of TV and Hollywood in provoking violence 
does, indirectly, offer some possible insight into the forces that spawned the 
murders and the suicide. Back when the recent blame-TV-and-Hollywood uproar was 
at its peak, a friend of mine, Doug Lummis, sent me a letter from Japan. He has 
been a schoolteacher in Tokyo for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, Lummis pointed out, poses certain problems for the 
media-causes-violence school. The place is flooded with violent media -- TV, 
comic books and so on -- including violent porn, rape and sadism fantasies, 
guns and swords. But this doesn't spill into violence in the society. 
</P>
<P>
 Some point to Japan's relative homogeneity. And the police keep everyone under 
very careful watch. Japan has gun control, so when people do resort to 
violence, they rely more on kitchen knives and baseball bats. But there's 
another factor. Japan hasn't fought a war for 50 years and has a comparatively 
minuscule standing military. Nobody under the age of 65 or so has ever shot a 
gun at anybody under the right of belligerency of the state. The society isn't 
rife with people who have tasted first blood in some foreign land, in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring this back to the United States, argued Lummis. "The cause of real 
violence in society is not fantasies of violence, but other real violence. How 
many people convicted of crimes using weapons first learned to use those 
weapons in the military? Any relation between violence in the black community 
and the huge number of black men who go through the military training mill? OK, 
not true of the kids, but the indirect effects can be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the U.S. murder rate surged 42% over the five years after the Vietnam 
War. Such homicide increases are invariable after wars large and small, in 
defeated countries as well as victorious ones, among veterans and non-veterans, 
among men and women. By a process of legitimation, wartime homicide, sanctioned 
by the state, becomes a model for subsequent homicides by individuals. This 
model has been kept alive in the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years by mini-wars and 
interventions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 20 years since the Vietnam War ended, but it seems likely -- though there 
can be no certainty here -- that the rubble that was Golly family life and its 
terminal cataclysm had its source in that war, still exercising its malign and 
fatal contagion on youths like Christopher, unborn when the last, 
state-sanctioned bullet in that conflict was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The war is not over and the prime model in violence is not TV or heavy metal 
but the U.S. military, and the attendant militarist culture. Diminish 
state-sanctioned violence and, in the end, you diminish the generalized social 
violence that derives from it.

PREP SOFTBALL '94 / SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Paula Cervantes (11th year, 205-83-2). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 19-10, 10-4 in the Garden Grove League; lost to finalist Los Alamitos, 
3-2, in eight innings in the first round of the Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Andrea Carreira, Jr., first baseman; Wendi Griffin, Jr., 
shortstop; Jennifer Johnson, Sr., catcher; Mandy Mendoza, Sr., center fielder; 
Angela Sifuentes, So., third baseman; Amy Silva, So., second baseman; Duffy 
White, Sr., pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Melissa Beck, So., utility; April Booth, So., right field; Gina 
Huizar, So., left fielder; Kathy Moore, Fr., 3B. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The league title still goes through Kennedy, OC's No. 1 team at 
regular season's end, but Garden Grove has potential of dethroning the Fighting 
Irish. They'll have to get over loss of leadoff batter Autumn Gwinner (.483, 23 
runs); she transferred to Pacifica, which may be best team in league, but the 
Argos should be able to piece together enough of an offense for White (14-9, 
0.63 ERA). The lineup features Griffin (two home runs, 19 RBIs, 14 runs), 
Mendoza (two HR, 14 runs) and White (two HR, 16 runs).

KINGS REMAIN FIT TO BE TIED, BY CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings and the Montreal Canadiens in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's new? 
</P>
<P>
 At least this time, Marty McSorley didn't lose his stick. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kings didn't lose the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams, opponents in last season's Stanley Cup finals, skated to a 3-3 
tie at the Forum before a sellout crowd of 16,005 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal beat the Kings in five games in last season's finals, three of the 
Canadiens' four victories coming in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's tie extended the Kings' winless streak to nine games 
(0-6-3), it enabled the club to remain five points behind the San Jose Sharks 
in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
San Jose tied the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are 21-33-9, three of their last four games having ended in ties. 
The Canadiens are 33-22-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing Montreal goalie Patrick Roy for the second time this season, the Kings 
were still looking for their first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't have to wait long Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Wing Dixon Ward scored 14:10 into the game to get the Kings the early lead. It 
was Ward's ninth goal and his third with the Kings since coming from the 
Vancouver Canucks in a trade on Jan. 8. Taking a cross-ice pass from Rob Blake, 
Ward skated in front of the net and slipped the puck past Roy's glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments have been rare of late against Roy, who is enjoying a season 
befitting the man considered by many the league's best goalie. Roy has a 
league-leading seven shutouts this season and had given up only one goal in the 
two games before Monday, having stopped 68 of 69 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 His counterpart, Robb Stauber, is a virtual unknown around the league compared 
to Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stauber's esteem in the eyes of Coach Barry Melrose has grown considerably 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere fact that Stauber was starting against the defending Stanley Cup 
champions over No. 1 goalie Kelly Hrudey shows how much Stauber's star has 
risen. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber has started three of the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, he took the puck up the ice, stickhandling as if he thought 
he were Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, Stauber got into a struggle against the glass behind the net 
with Brian Bellows, Stauber acting as if he thought he were McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 As did Roy, Stauber gave up a goal in the first period Monday night, John 
LeClair getting his 14th on a short shot from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings regained the lead in the second period on Robert Lang's fourth goal. 
Taking a pass from Luc Robitaille, Lang spun around Paul DiPietro and then 
smashed the puck between Roy's pads from the right circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' lead held up for only the first 1:11 of the final period, Gilbert 
Dionne scoring his 17th goal to make the score 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings went in front for the third time after Bellows was given a double 
minor for high-sticking Lang, opening a cut across the King center's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, who was a central figure in last year's finals when his illegal 
stick led to a Montreal victory, took a shot from 55 feet out, the puck 
bouncing off Robitaille's leg to go past a helpless Roy. Although McSorley did 
all the work, Robitaille got credit for his team-leading 36th goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But again the Canadiens came back to tie, Mike Keane getting his 14th goal off 
a Dionne pass with 14 seconds remaining on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Doug Houda suffered a separated right shoulder in the first period 
when he was checked by forward John LeClair. Houda is expected to be sidelined 
four to six weeks. . . . The Kings will hold their annual Tup-a-King charity 
event at Hollywood Park on March 13. Variety, a children's charity, the Kings' 
Youth Hockey Foundation, Kings in the Community and Kings' Wives for Kids 
Foundation will all receive donations from the event. VIP sponsorships are 
still available. For more information, call the Kings' office.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Shelly Luth (fourth year, 72-15). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 23-4, 13-1 in the Sunset League; Seeded No. 2, lost to finalist Los 
Alamitos, 1-0, in 22 innings in Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Stacy Byers, Sr., left fielder; Marcy Crouch, Jr., pitcher; 
Faith Fuata, Jr., right fielder; Heather Hibben, So., third baseman; Rainey 
Keiter, Sr., shortstop; Becky Thompson, Jr., second baseman; Lynette Velasquez, 
Sr., first baseman; Heather Williams, Jr., catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Angela Alvarez, Jr., center fielder; Michelle Castorena, Sr., 
center fielder; Jennie Hoff, So., left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Replacing outfielder Robyn Yorke (.603, 30 runs, 33 stolen bases) is 
paramount to impossible, but no one will feel sorry for Marina, which returns 
Fuata (.400, 27 RBIs) and Crouch (.348, 16 runs) and nearly everyone else. As a 
pitcher, Crouch (12-1, 0.31 ERA) can make do with less offensive support than 
most, though the Vikings should get a real test from Ocean View (22-7 last 
year), which has dominating pitcher Kathy Ponce, and Fountain Valley (18-7), 
which might have one of county's best offenses.

<P>
 Coach: Joe Gonzalez (fifth year, 86-32). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 19-10, 8-2 in the Century League; lost to Marina, 2-0, in second 
round of Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Amie Barnes, Jr., second baseman; Stacey Brunansky, Jr., first 
baseman; Michelle Churnock, Jr., shortstop; Dawn Davidson, Jr., catcher; Shelby 
Feldmeier, So., third baseman; Marie Gieron, So., right fielder; Marissa Holms, 
So., outfielder; Tara Lawrence, So., first baseman/outfielder; Julie Metzger, 
Sr., left fielder; Carley Rutledge, Jr., center fielder; Amy Tessman, Sr., 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Jenny Baltran, Fr., infielder; Lauren Bauer, Fr., utility; Ali 
Stalker, Jr., C; Robin Tessman, Fr., 3B/1B. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Only cleanup hitter Christina Mazurie is missing from 1993's 
rebuilding lineup, meaning Foothill should be among the county's top five 
teams. Leadoff batter Churnock (.432, 26 stolen bases) is a Times All-County 
player, and Tessman (16-6, 0.32 ERA) is one of the county's best pitchers. 
Foothill must do a better job of generating runs this year.

 Coach: Alan Dugard (fourth year, 77-16) 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 25-6, 13-1 in the Sea View League; seeded No. 1, lost to San Dimas, 
1-0, in Division III quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Carrie Brown, Jr., shortstop; Keri Byrd, Jr., first baseman; 
Alison Johnsen, Sr., center fielder; Courtney Spelber, Sr., second baseman; 
Jackie Sukiasian, So., pitcher; Corey Washington, So., P; Lisa Weaver, Jr., 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Stephanie Bernritter, Fr., P; Ashley Boone, Fr., OF/first 
baseman; Michelle Hague, Jr., catcher/third baseman; Lolita Harper, So., C/OF; 
Lizzie Lemire, Fr., 2B/OF. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Washington (17-3, 0.41 ERA) is a year older, but the infield behind 
her is new, with exception of Spelber (.292, 11 RBIs). Johnsen (.492, 19 RBIs, 
53 stolen bases) is a Times All-County pick and Fastpitch World Magazine 
All-American who needs 21 stolen bases to set the Section career record. The 
Warriors continue to have strong team speed, defense and pitching, but would be 
improved if a clutch RBI hitter developed. One person who might fill that role 
is Byrd (.260, eight RBIs), an all-league second-teamer.

 Chicago Coach Phil Jackson changed his starting lineup by benching guard Pete

MORNING BRIEFING: OLYMPIC GOLD ENDS UP ICED BY BIG BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS announcers called the end of Sunday's gold-medal hockey game between 
Canada and Sweden "the most exciting moment in Olympic history," but instead of 
seeing the heroics in Lillehammer, Norway, viewers in Lexington, Ky., got their 
own version of the "Heidi Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 WKYT-TV, the CBS affiliate in Lexington, cut short its broadcast at about 
12:30 p.m. -- moments before Sweden wrapped up the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 2-2 after 70 minutes, each team was given five penalty shots in 
a shootout. Each scored on two of them, sending the game into a sudden-death 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when WKYT cut away to 2 1/2 minutes of commercials and then the start 
of the "Rick Pitino Show," starring the Kentucky basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 After WKYT went to the commercial, Sweden won the gold medal on the second 
shot of sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Heidi Bowl: The incident was reminiscent of the infamous "Heidi Bowl" on 
Nov. 17, 1968. NBC outraged football fans by cutting away from the final 
minutes of a New York Jet-Oakland Raider game to begin airing "Heidi" on 
schedule. Viewers missed seeing the Raiders come from behind to beat the Jets, 
43-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: As Wayne Gretzky closes in on Gordie Howe's NHL record of 801 
goals, which goalkeeper has given up the most goals to the Kings' captain? 
</P>
<P>
 Summer games: Leander Paes, who is expected to lead India against the United 
States in a first-round Davis Cup match March 25-27 at New Delhi, was conceived 
in Munich during the 1972 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 His father played on India's bronze medal-winning field hockey team, his 
mother on its women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," Paes told Tennis magazine. "They were supposed 
to be concentrating on sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood talk: The Orlando Magic's Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway 
recently made their big-screen acting debuts in the movie "Blue Chips." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsday film critic Jack Mathews said: "Shaquille O'Neal doesn't fool anybody. 
You know you're watching a jock read his lines, but he's perfectly pleasant 
company, and Hardaway . . . holds his own in a couple of dramatic scenes with 
(Nick) Nolte." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Bear: California's Jason Kidd has people everywhere talking about his 
remarkable court game, but columnist Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Examiner 
may have put it best: 
</P>
<P>
 "He flogs the game until it meets his specifications." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Richard Brodeur, 29, in nine seasons with the New York 
Islanders, Vancouver Canucks and Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Former NFL coach-turned-race car owner Joe Gibbs, on the death of 
stock car driver Neil Bonnett: "Life is a constant weighing of the rewards and 
the risks. Here's a guy who had been out of the car, counted the costs and got 
back into one. To take the safe path, for a lot of us, is not quality life."

NHL ROUNDUP; RANGERS BEAT FLYERS, 4-1, FOR 40TH WIN

<P>
 The New York Rangers became the first NHL team to win 40 games this season 
with a 4-1 victory over Philadelphia Monday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning goaltender Mike Richter, who earned his 100th NHL victory, made 25 
saves and was only beaten by Mikael Renberg's fluke goal with 6:11 left in the 
game.Renberg's turnaround wrist shot deflected off Ranger defenseman Jeff 
Beukeboom and bounced into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 3, San Jose 3 -- Alexei Zhamnov's power-play goal with 9:11 left in 
the third period at Winnipeg enabled the Jets to tie the Sharks and end a 
club-record 10-game losing streak. But the Jets are still winless in their last 
19 games (0-16-3). 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose is 0-4-1 in its last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Florida 3 -- Rick Tocchet's second goal of the game with 4:40 
left in the third period led the Penguins over the Panthers at Miami. Mario 
Lemieux, playing in only his ninth game of the season, had a goal and two 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, St. Louis 1 -- Bill Guerin scored two goals to lead the Devils 
over the Blues in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Ottawa 1 -- Wendel Clark scored three goals as the Maple Leafs beat 
the Senators in Ottawa.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 About the only thing I didn't like about Dominique Wilkins' debut as a Clipper 
at the Sports Arena was the public address announcement that accompanied his 
field goals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nique!" bellowed Dennis Packer, the same way they used to in Atlanta. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique is such a great name. There is no need to shorten it. I don't care 
what his nickname is. "Dominique!" would be beautiful music to my ears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who enjoyed playing with the eight-time NBA All-Star on Sunday was 
the Clippers' other starting forward, Loy Vaught. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a lot of fun to watch and a lot of fun to play alongside," Vaught said. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 How does Wilkins compare with Danny Manning? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're both great players, but they have different styles," Vaught said. 
"Dominique is faster and more upbeat. Danny is a more methodical, post-up type 
of player." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is up to Donald Sterling to sign Wilkins to a multiyear contract. The 
owner says it will happen. Agent Steve Kauffman has talked informally with 
Sterling and said negotiations might begin by the end of the week. . . .  
</P>

 Elgin Baylor, Clipper general manager and Hall of Fame member, had two good 
seasons after his 34th birthday. . . .

 He averaged 24.8 points in 1968-69 and 24.0 in 1969-70. He played a total of 
only 11 games the next two years because of a torn Achilles' tendon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar," Baylor said about the legend who was an 
integral part of an NBA championship team at 41. "Of course, he was a center 
and that's different than playing forward. But he was able to stay away from a 
serious injury, he took care of his body and he got smarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long Dominique can perform at a high level, but our doctor 
who examined him says he's in terrific shape." . . .

 Better late than never that Phil Rizzuto was voted into the Hall of Fame by 
the Veterans Committee. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rizzuto had a career batting average of .273 and hit only 38 home runs in 13 
seasons, but was an excellent fielder and key contributor to seven World Series 
champion New York Yankees teams. Another Hall of Fame shortstop, Rabbit 
Maranville, batted .258 and hit 28 homers in 23 seasons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I like the fact that Ramon Martinez has put on weight, but I'm not so sure 
about Jose Offerman. I hope he doesn't fancy himself a home run hitter. . . .

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: O.C. WOMEN'S TEAMS DOMINATE STATE 
FIELD

 The strength of Orange Empire Conference women's basketball was proved beyond 
a doubt Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, three teams -- Golden West, Cypress and Orange Coast -- earned 
berths in the eight-team State tournament, which starts Thursday at Solano 
College in Suisun City. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams ended up in the same place, but each took a different path to get 
there. Here's a look at the teams and how they reached the State tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (31-4): Talk was the Rustlers were in trouble this season. Kristin 
Brun was back at one guard position, but otherwise the Rustlers were unproven. 
Co-coaches Dave and Dick Stricklin said the best they had hoped for was to 
contend for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Golden West, calling on hustle and unity, spent much of the season as 
the top-ranked team in Southern California. The Rustlers not only contended but 
also won their fifth consecutive conference title. This is Golden West's eighth 
consecutive trip to the State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if his team should have done as well as it has, Dave Stricklin 
said: "Probably not. As far as pure athletic talent goes, we don't have one 
player that could go to another program and turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Deana Itow, a freshman guard, is averaging 17 points and freshman forward 
Julie Murdent is at 15. Katie Miner averaged eight rebounds and Brun has 
averaged five assists and is making 79% of her free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (24-9): Cypress won eight games in the three seasons before Kevin 
Kiernan took over as coach last season. The Chargers went 13-15 in his first 
year, and figured to improve on that this season. But few expected this much 
success. This is the program's first appearance in the State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main reasons Cypress has done so well is freshman forward Sara 
Works, who has emerged into one of the best post players in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Works, the co-most valuable player of the Orange Empire Conference, is at 20 
points and nine rebounds. She averaged 27 points and 12 rebounds in two playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress is a forward-dominated team, thanks to Works and sophomores Jennifer 
Johnson and Yolanda Hearvey. Johnson is averaging 10 points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearvey, a swing player, is averaging 10 points and eight rebounds. She holds 
the Cypress career rebounding record with 566. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls are very excited," Kiernan said. "We just need to remember we still 
have some basketball left to play, otherwise it will be a short trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (21-12): The Pirates earned their first berth in the State 
tournament last season but didn't figure to return this season. LeAnn Kazmer 
was the only returning starter. Kazmer, from Wisconsin, averaged 20 points and 
11 rebounds, both best in the conference. She was the co-MVP, with Cypress' 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazmer holds the OCC single-season record for rebounds with 331. She needs 16 
to break the career rebounding record set by Erika Manning (1989-91). America 
Robledo, a freshman forward, is averaging 14 points and seven rebounds and 
freshman guard Flo Luppani is averaging 6.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast Coach Mike Thornton said he's most proud of the way his team came 
back after losing to Golden West in overtime, then at Riverside by one point in 
the first round of conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get it back together after those two difficult losses," Thornton said. 
"That's what I'm most proud of. I'm pretty happy right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pairings: The tournament starts Thursday with Los Angeles Harbor (28-6) 
playing two-time defending State champion Lassen (26-6) at 2 p.m. Cypress takes 
on Butte (28-3) at 4 p.m., Golden West 31-4) plays Merritt (29-4) at 6 p.m. and 
Orange Coast (21-12) plays San Mateo (30-2) at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals are at 6 and 8 p.m. Friday and the title game is at 8 p.m. 
Saturday. San Mateo is the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind playing (San Mateo) at all," Thornton said. "I think we have 
everything to gain and nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Men's basketball: Saddleback (22-8) plays host to Rio Hondo at 7 p.m. in 
Wednesday's second-round Southern California playoff games. This is the third 
consecutive year the teams have met in the playoffs. Saddleback won the 
previous two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos' gym will be nothing new to first-year Rio Hondo Coach Ernie Carr, 
who was the Saddleback interim coach in the 1988-89 season when Bill Brummel 
was on a sabbatical. Rio Hondo is 18-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (21-11) is off to top-ranked Ventura (32-2) for the second 
consecutive season in a 7:30 p.m. game. Ventura eliminated the Dons, 111-83, 
last season, also in the second round.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (24-10) is at Los Angeles City (26-5) at 7:30 p.m. in the other 
second-round game involving an Orange County team.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: SUCCESS PROVES BITTERSWEET FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY'S 
GOFFREDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Goffredo knows he is supposed to be smiling these days, but forgive him 
if has trouble working through his tears. 
</P>
<P>
 His boys' basketball team, Crescenta Valley High, is the surprise of the 
Southern Section playoffs. The Falcons, who finished fourth in the Pacific 
League and made the tournament only after receiving an at-large berth, have 
pulled off four upsets in a row to advance to the Division I-AA championship 
game. They will face third-seeded Long Beach Poly on Saturday night at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest upset was a 69-67 victory over Santa Ana Valley in a semifinal game 
last Saturday before a capacity crowd at Glendale High. The Falcons (18-8) have 
not played in a title game since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The improbable finish surprises even Goffredo, the school's coach for 16 
years. But he believes it is merely a reward for what undoubtedly has been his 
most difficult season. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo, 42, was not even sure he would be back because his wife of 19 years, 
Kathy, died of cancer last summer. Goffredo, who lives near the school in La 
Crescenta, was left to bring up their three children, who range from 9 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is going to raise my children but me," said Goffredo, who grew up in 
the San Fernando Valley and attended Burbank Burroughs High. "My days are full 
now, and I seldom get everything done before 11 at night. But we're together." 
</P>
<P>
 His assistant coaches and players urged him to return, and have been 
supportive. But it has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My two girls are just upset that their mom can't be here to share this with 
them," Goffredo said. "They know she would have loved going to the championship 
(game). Somehow, I have to believe all of this is happening for a reason. But 
it is hard for me to be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are bittersweet for me right now. My coaching career is at the 
pinnacle, but my emotions are at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo's young team lost three starters to injuries before the first game. 
One of them, sophomore forward Mike Greco, has still not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school's gymnasium was severely damaged during the Jan. 17 
earthquake, forcing the team to play at a variety of facilities in the area. 
Last weekend, the Falcons were forced to practice outside for the first time in 
Goffredo's tenure. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section took a smart gamble when it agreed to allow Santa Ana 
Mater Dei and Loyola to hold their boys' basketball Division I-A semifinal game 
last Friday at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find a suitable gymnasium, Loyola administrators called UCLA. They 
were finally able to work out a rental fee of about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, agreed to put up $5,000 and let 
the schools split the other half. Mater Dei's 78-60 victory was played before 
6,000, ensuring that the game would generate a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember our office ever putting up more for a basketball playoff 
game," Crowley said. "But we anticipated a decent crowd, and we didn't want to 
have to turn anyone away at the door. Pauley was the perfect site, and UCLA was 
more than cooperative." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Craig Murray, boys' basketball coach at Los Angeles High, reluctantly shook 
hands with Crenshaw Coach Willie West after L.A. was routed, 139-51, last 
Tuesday in a City Division 4-A first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 13 players scored for Crenshaw, Murray said West played his starters 
in every quarter and continued to press until the final second. The top-seeded 
Cougars scored 71 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With Crenshaw leading by 60 points entering the fourth quarter, Murray said he 
started putting in his second- and third-string players. West did not ease up, 
however, continuing to shuffle in starters. L.A. was outscored, 35-4, in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is bogus to continue to press in the fourth quarter when you're leading by 
60 or 70 points," Murray said. "They have a lot of talent and they were very 
hot that day, but after a while what does it mean? My kids actually took it all 
in stride, but I guess Willie is trying to make a point to the rest of the City 
that his team is the very best." 
</P>

 Prep Notes

 Palos Verdes Peninsula and Lynwood will play for the Southern Section Division 
I-AA girls' basketball championship Saturday night at Cal Poly Pomona. The game 
is a rematch of the 1992 final, which Peninsula won, 54-44. Peninsula went on 
to win the State Division I title and finish the season 34-0. Four of its 
starters received scholarships to Division I colleges. Graduation and injuries, 
however, resulted in a disappointing season for the Panthers in '93. They were 
eliminated by Lynwood in the Division I-AA quarterfinals and finished 16-7. 
"Certainly, when you are used to being on top, it is difficult to go through a 
season like that," said Wendell Yoshida, Peninsula's coach. "But the community 
did not get too down on us because they knew we were a young team that was 
pretty banged up. Getting to the quarterfinals is also nothing to be ashamed 
of." Peninsula is back on top this season. It improved to 24-3 with a 60-38 
victory over San Gabriel in the semifinals Saturday night. Senior guard Mimi 
McKinney, a four-year starter, is one of the nation's top prospects.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Calvary Chapel is expected to win its second State wrestling title 
in a row this weekend. The two-day tournament, at the University of the Pacific 
in Stockton, will begin Friday at 9 a.m. The championship round is set for 
Saturday at 7 p.m. . . .The South Gate boys' soccer team was removed from the 
City playoffs last week after school officials learned that one of its players, 
striker Carlos Osorio, had played the entire season while being academically 
ineligible. Osorio scored the winning goal in the team's 3-2 victory over San 
Fernando in the opening round of the playoffs. South Gate was replaced by San 
Fernando in the second round. Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

WILANDER HAS NIGHT ON TOWN; TENNIS: FORMER SWEDISH STAR DEFEATS HORST SKOFF, 
6-4, 6-4, IN FIRST ROUND OF AT INDIAN WELLS TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fittingly, they let an elder statesman do the honors on the first-ever evening 
session at the Newsweek Champions Cup here Monday. Such an occasion demanded a 
quality master of ceremonies, and Mats Wilander handled the duties like the 
star he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that was. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilander, once the greatest in the game and now, at 29, still an occasional 
force to be reckoned with, properly christened night tennis in the desert with 
a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Austrian Horst Skoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening session drew 5,471, and combined with the 9,090 that came for the 
regular day session gave the tournament a total of 14,561, its biggest 
single-day attendance. Because this is the first time organizers have had split 
sessions here, each day through Friday is likely to top that mark, with 
Saturday and Sunday day-only sessions limited to the 10,500 stadium capacity 
level. The 14,561 total compares well with early-week attendance draws for the 
U.S. Open, which are usually in the low 20,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 82 Skoff had to play through a qualifying tournament to get into the main 
draw here. But he also is a tour veteran, who once defeated Wilander in a 
6-hour 3-minute Davis Cup match in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Wilander probably would have been considered the underdog. He is 
ranked No. 231 in the world now. The five players ranked directly above him are 
Oliver Gross, Chris Pridham, Louis Gloria, Miguel Pastura and Simon Touzil. 
Last week, in a first-round match at Scottsdale, Ariz., the kind of tour stop 
that Wilander used to zip through, he lost to somebody named Grant Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilander's participation on the ATP Tour is not one of those pathetic 
tales of athlete-hangs-on-too-long. He has won seven Grand Slams, as many as 
Pete Sampras and Jim Courier combined. But his quest is not particularly for an 
eighth, nor for a return to the No. 1 spot that he held for much of 1988 and 
'89. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play now to play, not just to win," he said. "To be No. 1 or 2, you have to 
compete, to play to win. There's no other way you can do it, no other way you 
can feel about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it that Wilander is coming out occasionally on the tour, grabbing wild 
cards into tournaments and simply taking up space. He enjoys winning, enjoyed 
his victory over Skoff. But he also knows he has been there, didn't like it 
enough to keep fighting for it, and now looks upon his days of glamour and 
glory with perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 1988, I just didn't care anymore," he said. "I never really decided 
that I was going to quit playing forever. I just decided that it wasn't as 
important anymore. I've got a great family, and I know what I've done before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason I'm playing now is for the days when it feels good, when I 
can put the ball on the racket in just the right spot, and when I can hit the 
ball to within a square foot of exactly where I want it. I play for those days 
when it still feels perfect, when there is a sense of mastery and I'm able to 
control it nearly to 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilander acknowledged that he had less than 100% control against Skoff. 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking Skoff at 4-5 of the first set with a nice slice backhand 
approach and a crisp forehand volley, then running off to a 3-0 lead in the 
second set, Wilander tightened. Serving for the match at 5-3, he let Skoff 
attack too much and ended up losing his serve. But Skoff returned the favor 
with a less-than-sparkling service game of his own, flapping a loose forehand 
wide on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tightened when I was serving for the match," Wilander said. "It's not 
that often that I am in that situation these days. It doesn't matter how many 
years you've done it, if you are playing all the time, it is routine. If you 
aren't, it is not." 
</P>
<P>
 And if that means not winning, Wilander has a pet phrase for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life goes on," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Pioline of France, last year's runner-up to Pete Sampras in the U.S. 
Open and the ninth-seeded player here, went out unceremoniously in the first 
round. He lost to Jonathan Stark, the former Stanford star, 6-4, 6-3, and 
looked listless in doing so. The two had played once before in a tournament 
final in Bolzano, Italy, last year, and Stark won that one in straight sets, 
too -- his only tour title to date. Pioline, who has not played particularly 
well since his two-week run at Flushing Meadows, said there wasn't much he 
could do because Stark hit it as hard as he could every time and approached the 
net. Pioline countered with a slowball serve that Stark labeled "a lollipop."

PREP SOFTBALL '94 / SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Scott Weber (fouth year, 37-43). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 14-15, 6-4 in the Freeway League; lost to No. 2 Brea-Olinda, 1-0, in 
first round of the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Marianne Emigh, So., left fielder; Angie Fancuberta, So., 
pitcher; Deborah Hargrave, Jr., shortstop; Nadia Hoerner, Jr., first baseman; 
Annette Martinez, Sr., second baseman; Kiki McAulay, Jr., catcher; Amy Simpson, 
So., center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Alicia Feuchter, Fr., 3B; Valerie Miller, Jr., RF; Amy Scott, 
Jr., right fielder; Alissa Sorrell, So., third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: McAulay (.341, 16 runs, 18 stolen bases) and Hargrave (.337, 16 RBIs) 
head a young lineup that should make Fullerton even more dangerous with 
Fancuberta (14-12, 138 strikeouts, 0.62 ERA) another year older. Hoerner is the 
power source in the lineup. Though young, the Indians are experienced; they've 
made the playoffs the last three years and should play with the confidence 
they've lacked in the past. La Habra, the class of the league, graduated most 
of its team and will miss pitcher Dani Ortega, but has a solid defense and a 
lot of speed. Troy remained intact and Sunny Hills could challenge.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Jami Shannon (16th year, 223-130-2). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 24-4, 8-2 in the Empire League; lost to No. 1 Simi Valley, 1-0, in the 
Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Megan Barnes, So., third baseman; Sheri Bergeron, Sr., P/1B; 
Amanda Peterson, Jr., second baseman/center fielder; Michelle Schneider, Jr., 
shortstop; Carolyn Wilson, Sr., catcher; Debora Wilson, Sr., pitcher/first 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Jennifer Slaney, Jr., C/OF; Cindy Tredway, Fr., third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Los Alamitos had the winning run on base in the section championship 
game, which they reached with pitching and defense. Gone is pitcher Carrie 
Dolan (9-2, 0.16 ERA), but Debbie Wilson (10-0, 0.31) was a suitable 
replacement while Dolan recovered from an injury. Key to Griffins' fortunes may 
lay in their offense, where Carolyn Wilson and Schneider are expected to step 
up and provide clutch performances. Recent loss of second baseman Shelby 
Olmstead, who had knee surgery Feb. 3, doesn't help. Cypress, with a strong 
offense and defense, should challenge.

RELATIONSHIPS: HOW TO SURVIVE 'GAP KIDS'; WHEN CHILDREN ARE SEPARATED BY 
SEVERAL YEARS, 'IT'S ALMOST LIKE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT FAMILIES,' AN ORANGE 
PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS. BUT WITH UNDERSTANDING AND EFFORT, SUCH FAMILIES CAN STILL 
BE CLOSE-KNIT, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Lisa Harduvel was 10 and her parents told her that she would be getting a 
baby brother or sister, she thought they were joking. When she realized they 
weren't kidding, she wasn't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy being an only child and didn't want a brother or sister," says 
the 15-year-old from Huntington Beach, whose brother is now 5. "All my life I 
had spent time with people who were older than me, including my grandmother, 
with whom I'm very close. Until I started school, my best friends were women 
over 70; I still don't really like people younger than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harduvel's experience is not uncommon when there is a wide age difference 
between siblings, says psychologist David Juroe, who is with Yorba Park Medical 
Group in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "If children are separated by several years, it's almost like there are two 
different families," he says. "In cases where there are large gaps between 
children, the younger kids are perceived more as nieces and nephews or 
grandchildren by the rest of the family, rather than brothers or sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 A wide age difference makes it hard, but not impossible, for a family to be 
close-knit, Juroe says. 
</P>
<P>
 As more couples divorce and remarry, "gap kids" are becoming more common, says 
Juroe, who is divorced and remarried. Between them, he and his wife have five 
children in their 20s, 30s and 40s -- and a daughter they had together who is 
12. Between Juroe's 12-year-old and the next child there is a 10-year age 
difference. The youngest and oldest are 29 years apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce and remarriage aren't the only reason for gap kids. Some couples 
initially decide to just have one child and then change their minds. Other 
women find it difficult to get pregnant and take years to conceive again. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason for the large age difference, children in such situations 
face challenges, while their parents often find themselves caught in the middle 
between the younger and older children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard on the younger child, who often gets left out of family matters 
because of the age difference," Juroe says. "While everyone sits and talks 
about Europe over dessert, the youngest is likely to wander off alone and watch 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
 There are disadvantages for older children, as well. "In many cases, because 
finances are better when the younger child comes, he or she may get things that 
the parents couldn't afford when the older child was young, and this creates 
animosity," he says. "Because of their age, younger children also require more 
attention, and older kids often resent having to baby-sit their younger 
siblings." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are also some positives. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children often benefit from being able to ask for advice from older 
siblings, Juroe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 12-year-old daughter says that she's found it very helpful to be able to 
ask her older sisters for advice about school and relationships with friends," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Older children can also be a big help to overworked parents by caring for the 
younger kids at times. 
</P>
<P>
 When brother Johnny came into Lisa Harduvel's life just three days before her 
10th birthday, she admits to some jealousy at the abundance of attention he 
received -- and continues to get. They occasionally have a good time playing 
together, she says, adding that he's usually a pest because he does things such 
as sneak into her room and take her things or bother her when she has guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny's arrival has caused a number of life changes for Lisa, says her 
mother, Jean Harduvel, 43, who is an accountant in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Johnny came, my husband and I would often go to fancy restaurants and 
bring Lisa along because she fit right in and was very well behaved. We can no 
longer do that with my son, who is much more rambunctious. Now we go to 
family-style restaurants and do more 'family' things. Whereas we used to go out 
to lunch on Saturdays and to a show, now we do yard work and rent a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean is aware that her daughter is still not thrilled with her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because she was an only child for so long, it has been impossible for Lisa to 
cope with this," she says. "Her whole life was turned upside-down. She had a 
hard time understanding why, if life was so happy, would we want to ruin it 
with another child." 
</P>
<P>
 If she had had a choice, Jean said, she would have had her children closer in 
age, but she had difficulty getting pregnant. It took her three years to 
conceive Lisa; she tried for a second child when Lisa was younger, but she was 
unable to get pregnant. The second pregnancy was unplanned. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Jean says, Lisa dealt fairly well with the new addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a novelty -- a new little creature in the house who couldn't walk or 
talk or break toys," Jean says. "The hostility really began when he started 
walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Jean says Johnny and Lisa fight a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a typical boy and will tease her just to get a reaction out of her," 
Jean says. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Jean has done what she could to make things easier for 
Lisa, including giving her a larger room and decorating it with a canopy bed. 
Jean also goes with Lisa and Jean's mother-in-law to music and dance 
performances, as they used to in the "old days." And they shop together. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Jean says, Lisa and Johnny do get along, especially when Lisa is 
caring for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although she doesn't baby-sit him often, when Lisa does care for Johnny, she 
is very good with him, and he minds her when he knows she's in charge," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean says she hopes that as Lisa settles into high school the tension between 
the two will taper off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that as they both get older and she becomes more involved in school, 
things will get better," Jean says. 
</P>

 William and Lidia Pinedo consider themselves lucky when it comes to their gap 
children, Jonathan, 12, and Nathan, 3. So far their older son has welcomed the 
addition of a brother, despite the many years he spent as the only child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years Jonathan kept asking for a brother, so he was very 
interested when I became pregnant," says Lidia, 38, who is a radiation 
therapist in Orange. The second pregnancy was a surprise for Lidia, who had 
tried at one point to have another child, but was unable to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very happy with one child, and I was really worried about having 
another one," says Lidia, whose main concerns were who would care for the baby 
and whether she would be forced to pull her first son out of private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing well for her son was important to Lidia, because she came from a 
family of 12 children, and there was very little to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents did the best they could for us, but it was difficult with so many 
children," she says. "I was never able to experience new things -- there were 
just too many of us. I wanted to make sure my son would have the best, and with 
only one child that was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lidia and her husband decided that one child was enough, she says, they 
got a lot of pressure from family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of my family were very concerned. They kept asking me, 'What if 
something happens to him or you?' Some of my sisters, who are 10 to 15 years 
older than me, have more than four kids, and they used to pressure me. When I 
became pregnant again, they were very happy for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lidia says that she and her husband were pleasantly surprised at how nice it 
is to have a second child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to have more than one child, and I'm very happy I did it," she 
says, noting that she has been able to spend more time with her second son 
during these early years. "When I had my first baby, I was going to radiation 
therapy school and working, so I had less time than I do now. The additional 
time has been nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the birth, Lidia and her husband were concerned about their older son 
becoming jealous, so they tried to include him whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out I was pregnant, we immediately told Jonathan about it, and 
he wanted to know all about babies," Lidia says. "We explained things to him 
and even took him to childbirth preparation classes, where he learned about 
what it's like to give birth." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Jonathan went to just about every one of Lidia's doctor 
appointments with her and saw the ultrasounds. They also let him pick the name, 
Nathan, and help decorate the nursery. "Jonathan bought the baby's first bottle 
with his name on it. It was his idea, and he used his own money," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lidia also arranged for Jonathan to be in the birthing room with the 
understanding that he could leave at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although he was a little scared because of the pain I was going through 
during labor, when he saw the baby, he started laughing. It was a very precious 
moment for all of us," Lidia says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan immediately bonded with his brother and is protective of him today, 
Lidia says. "I don't ever have to tell Jonathan to watch out for his brother, 
because he is very responsible with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Their older son is also very helpful with his younger brother, says William 
Pinedo, 45, a diagnostic technologist in Orange. "Jonathan will change his 
brother's diapers and even fix him oatmeal; he's a great big brother," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jonathan is helpful, the Pinedos have made sure not to put too much 
responsibility on their oldest. "We try not to make the older one feel like his 
brother is his responsibility, because he isn't. Nathan is mine and Lidia's 
responsibility," William says. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers do quarrel, especially when Jonathan is trying to do his homework 
and his younger brother bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Jonathan tells Nathan to leave him alone, it makes Nathan feel rejected, 
because he doesn't understand the importance of what his older brother is 
doing," Lidia says. When Jonathan's friends come over, he also tends to get 
annoyed with Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Pinedos strive to keep their sons close by doing activities 
together. When William, who is an active bike rider, participates in 
fund-raising rides, he takes both boys with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Activities together like that make both kids feel involved," William says.

FITNESS / KATHLEEN DOHENY: PERSONAL HEALTH; LAST-MINUTE TIPS FOR L.A.'S 
MARATHONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If history repeats, at least 7,000 entrants in Sunday's City of Los Angeles 
Marathon will be first-timers. Since the race began in 1986, it has always 
attracted newcomers -- sometimes almost half the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the few days remaining, there's much novices can do to prepare, experts 
say, noting that some advice applies equally to veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, tips from four experts on how to make the most of remaining pre-race 
time, along with suggestions on how to make the course itself and recovery 
smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts are Rudy Hayek, a Tarzana fitness consultant and marathoner who 
heads Paragon Fitness; Anna Yanes, a marathoner and exercise physiologist at 
Centinela Hospital Fitness Institute in Culver City; Dr. Lee Woods, an 
orthopedic surgeon and director of the Foot Treatment Center at Orthopaedic 
Hospital; Dr. Sonny Cobble, medical director of the Sport Injury Clinic at 
Orthopaedic Hospital and medical commissioner of the marathon. Before the Race 
</P>
<P>
 * Even if nervousness takes away your appetite, try to eat regular, healthful 
meals before the marathon. Concentrate on carbohydrates. Drink plenty of 
fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stretch every day, several times a day. Be sure to target all the major 
muscle groups, both in the upper and lower body. 
</P>
<P>
 * You should have begun tapering down your training, with your exact workout 
schedule based on your abilities and fitness level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Concentrate on getting good rest, but don't get anxious if you're too jazzed 
to sleep the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preparation should not be all physical. Rehearse mentally to calm nerves and 
improve performance. Begin 48 hours or even 72 hours before race day. Picture 
yourself as a winner. "See yourself, nice and relaxed, at the start," Hayek 
suggests. "See yourself finishing the race." On the Course 
</P>
<P>
 * Once at the starting line, resist the temptation to take off like a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once you've set a comfortable pace, resist the tendency to run hunched over. 
Don't look at the pavement, but ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 * Along the route, take physical and emotional inventory. Give yourself a pep 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let your arms dangle every now and then to maintain relaxation. Pay 
particular attention to your hands. Clenched fists give away anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 * If blisters tend to be a problem, consider taking extra socks. Or simply 
take your socks off and put them back on; the switch will change pressure 
points and reduce the likelihood of blisters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay attention to your shoe lacing, being sure it's not too tight or too 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay hydrated as you run, but eat and drink only what you're used to. The 
course is not the place to experiment with a new sports drink or a new energy 
bar. Once Past the Finish 
</P>
<P>
 * Resist the urge to lift a glass of champagne in celebration right away. 
Alcohol is dehydrating, so it's better to concentrate on drinking plenty of 
nonalcoholic beverages. Stay away from alcohol at least for six or seven hours 
after finishing a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's vital to eat, stretch and walk around. Do all that before enjoying a 
massage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fatigue is the top complaint not just of first-timers but many veterans. 
Soreness of the quadriceps muscles is common as well. Walking will help, both 
immediately after the race and the next day, when you should walk for about 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * If blisters form despite good sock habits, keep the area clean. If they're 
uncomfortable, lance with a clean pin. But don't pick. "Let the (remaining) 
skin act as a physiologic dressing," Woods says. 
</P>
<P>
 If a hematoma forms under a nail and is blue, distended and uncomfortable, 
"take a hot needle and push it through the top of the nail to drain," Woods 
advises. ("If you've got the drive to run a marathon," he reasons, "you can 
handle this.") 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term rest is important. Marathoners should not run a long-distance race 
again for about 26 days -- allowing a day of rest for each mile run.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; SELLING OUT AT THE BOWERS; EXHIBIT IS LARGELY OF 
UNMEMORABLE WORKS -- THAT THE OWNER WANTS TO PEDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any art exhibition on a sweeping historical theme that is based entirely on 
one private collection is bound to be a disappointment. It inevitably has more 
to do with personal taste than historical breadth, and it cannot seriously 
compete with a show compiled by an art historian from the resources of major 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a museum show consists entirely of works that are for sale at one 
commercial gallery -- as is the case with the "Seven Decades: Modern Mexican 
Art From the Bernard Lewin Collection," at the Bowers Museum through April 25 
-- disappointment gives way to disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewin -- who also owns a massive personal collection of Mexican art -- 
decided to limit the scope of this show to the stuff he'd like to sell, the die 
was cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the museum's decision to turn curatorial duties over to Shifra M. 
Goldman, a research associate at the Latin American Study Center at UCLA and a 
professor of art history at Rancho Santiago College, can redeem such a colossal 
commercial- cum -vanity showcase.

 Lewin, a former furniture retailer who opened his first art gallery 26 years 
ago in Beverly Hills, was initially attracted to Mexican art by the paintings 
of Rufino Tamayo, a European-influenced artist whom the dealer has called "the 
most compelling force in my quest to promote the Mexican masters." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably won't come as a surprise that this is not a show about major works 
of Mexican modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 With some exceptions, the 74-piece show contains a raft of unmemorable 
paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture. It is the sort of work that is 
marketable to the American middle class because of its "universal" -- read 
soothingly traditional -- subject matter. Major artists are represented by 
minor work -- often made years after their major achievements -- and most of 
the minor artists seem very minor indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's approach to the impossible task of turning the idiosyncratic 
contents of a gallery into a meaningful exhibition was to organize aesthetic 
and social developments in Mexican art into four categories: pre-1920 
precursors of modernism; the era of public art and social realism 
(1920s-1940s); international styles adapted by artists active from the late 
1920s to the present; and a nebulous category Goldman calls "new images, new 
directions," which seems anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 This overview was a reasonable tactic, but it lets too many details get lost 
by the wayside, and viewers are frequently hard put to comprehend how the works 
they see fit within the context of Mexican political and cultural history, or 
even the artists' careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest intertwining strains in 20th-Century Mexican art -- a passion 
for digging up indigenous roots, social militancy and a penchant for the 
fantastic -- can be traced back to the earliest artists in the show, Gerardo 
Murillo (a.k.a. Dr. Atl) and Jose Guadalupe Posada. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major strain -- indebtedness to European modernism, particularly 
Surrealism and Neoclassicism -- all too often comes off as a flaccid, 
derivative enterprise, devoid of the conviction that animates the best social 
realist work. 
</P>
<P>
 Atl, whose labored colored drawings of volcanoes reflected his scientific 
interests, took his adopted surname from the Nahuatl language. He insisted that 
Mexican artists develop national themes instead of leaning on European 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Posada, a former farm laborer, protested social conditions and political 
crises in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with grotesque caricatures 
that reached a broad audience in cheap reproductions. (Unfortunately, the three 
small -- and unusually tame -- Posada prints in this show are presented without 
any discussion.) 
</P>
<P>
 Any museum show is obliged to underplay the strength of Mexico's great 
muralists, whose major works are not portable. But Diego Rivera gets truly 
short shrift here: a trio of unremarkable portraits of now-obscure sitters, 
including American artist Ralph Stackpole, whose relationships to the artist 
are not discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sampler of work by Jose Clemente Orozco is of greater interest. A 1935 
caricature of "Tourists and Aztecs" skewers broad-shouldered Ugly Americans 
averting their glances from a ragged group of diminutive, ailing Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Decadent images of sprawling, dancing prostitutes in an undated lithograph 
that owes a major stylistic debt to German Expressionism ("Women") would become 
compelling symbols of the decay of civilization in such Orozco murals as 
"Catharsis" at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City (reproduced in a 
photograph). 
</P>
<P>
 David Alfaro Siqueiros, the other member of the mural movement's " los tres 
grandes ," is represented by another potpourri: paintings from about 1930 and 
landscape studies from 1963. The best is "Mother and Child," in which the dead 
weight of a sleepy child contrasts with his mother's waltzing embrace in the 
confined space of a small room. 
</P>
<P>
 Other well-known figures in the show include the incisive printmaker Leopoldo 
Mendez, draftsman-illustrator Jose Luis Cuevas, and a trio of modernists -- 
Francisco Zuniga, Carlos Merida, and Tamayo -- who borrowed indigenous motifs, 
mostly from pre-Columbian art. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-founder in 1937 of the influential Taller de Grafica Popular (popular 
graphic art workshop), Mendez packed a few square inches of paper with a 
bristling rhythm of blacks and whites to evoke political and military 
brutality. In another mood, he cast a shrewd eye on the heavyweight artists of 
his time in "God the Father and the Four Evangelists." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuevas, whose delicate line inevitably describes the gnarliest of outcast 
types, is not seen at his best in this show, while the hackneyed, academic 
flavor of Zuniga's drawings and bulbous bronze unfortunately seem quite in 
character. Merida, a stylistic chameleon, is most appealing in a 1921 painting 
that evokes a ritualistic aura with tight geometric patterning and vivid 
coloring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tamayos are mostly very minor or very late. "Two Personages Attacked by 
Dogs" -- an oversized print of a mannequin-like couple fleeing two stylized 
curs -- dates from 1983, decades after leading artists elsewhere had moved away 
from such Existentialist Angst . 
</P>
<P>
 Images by other artists also indicate that dated styles have lingered overtime 
in Mexico. There is syrupy Neoclassicism, wispy Surrealism, vapid abstraction. 
Other than Francisco Toledo, who draws upon his Oaxacan Indian heritage for a 
fantastic, scribbled vocabulary of creatures and mechanical objects, fresh 
voices in this show are hard to find. A viewer has no way to gauge whether 
Lewin simply doesn't like -- or doesn't think he can sell -- more cutting-edge 
art, or whether Mexico isn't producing any. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say that this show is better than nothing, since we rarely get to 
see modern Mexican art in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been more focused had Goldman limited her selections to prints 
and drawings, which (as she writes in the brochure) have been "overlooked, or 
treated with indifference, by more pretentious exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unlikely that such a show -- hardly a major drawing card for general 
viewers -- would have stirred up the requisite hullabaloo. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the venerable Bowers seems to be in the throes of a "learning 
experience," perhaps exacerbated by the lack of an art curator on its large 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least the lesson is clear-cut: Put scholarship first and do not shackle 
yourself to the whims and pecuniary interests of a collector if you want to be 
taken seriously as a venue for art exhibitions. It's really not such a 
difficult concept, and it makes a world of difference.

MUSIC REVIEW; QUARTET KICKS OFF U.S. TOUR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the joys of hearing a great string quartet play is the discovering of 
four distinct personalities beneath the ensemble surface, personalities engaged 
by and conversing with the music at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians of the Maggini String Quartet, on the other hand, would seem not 
to have a single personality to share among themselves.Their concert Sunday 
afternoon at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, the first on their current 
North American tour, was a peculiarly faceless affair and thus made for bland 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the English ensemble -- David Juritz and David Angel, violins, Martin 
Outram, viola, and Michael Kaznowski, cello -- lacks most of the other 
attributes which go to make up a fine string quartet; individual accomplishment 
and ensemble precision were evident. These players just had nothing special to 
say with or about the music they brought along, it seemed. Beethoven's String 
Quartet, Opus 74, "The Harp," and Haydn's Quartet, Opus 77, No. 1, unfolded in 
solid, professional and uneventful run-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the program, however, the Maggini offered the West Coast 
premiere of a work dedicated to them, the String Quartet (1993) by 
Jamaican/English composer Eleanor Alberga. Jagged, dissonant and engagingly 
kinetic in its outer movements, faintly folksy, introspective and nocturnal at 
its Bartokian core, the work made for a bold and entertaining 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cheerfulness and exuberance of the Haydn emerged reserved, precision 
of rhythm and ensemble the most remarkable quality of the performance. The 
playing in the Beethoven, though detailed and dynamically varied, proved 
somewhat less seamless and lacked a sense of personal involvement by these 
musicians. TIMOTHY MANGAN

WITH OR WITHOUT PARENTS: PETUNIA AND PALS RETURN IN 'SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT'

 "Something to Crow About," a musical day on the farm, puppet style, has 
returned to the landmark Bob Baker Marionette Theatre for the first time in 
more than seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old show pioneered Bob Baker's signature in-the-round performances 
where puppeteers bring every conceivable variety of stringed creations into the 
audience to interact with children. 
</P>
<P>
 An old song on the show's soundtrack, "I'm a Lonely Little Petunia in the 
Onion Patch," inspired the creation of what Baker says is his most requested 
puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I tour, I'm always asked, 'Did you bring Petunia?' This has been going 
on for 35 years." 
</P>

 Earthquake Mosaic: Did the earthquake decimate your favorite set of china? 
Chip that old bud vase? 
</P>
<P>
 You can contribute those broken bits and pieces (no clear glass or stemware, 
please) to the Earthquake Memorial Project, an outdoor tile mosaic installation 
planned for Los Angeles Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based artists Paul M. Hershfield, Tracey Landworth and Anthony 
Fish have established collection centers at the museum, at Barnsdall Art Park 
in Hollywood, at the Westside Jewish Community Center Nursery School, at Hamlin 
Street Elementary School in West Hills and nine other locations. The artists 
request that broken items, such as plastics, small toys and especially 
ceramics, be delivered in bags weighing no more than five pounds each (again, 
no glass). 
</P>
<P>
 The installation is no joke. With its theme of things broken and then rebuilt, 
it is intended as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the recent 
disaster and as a healing gesture for those who suffered losses of all kinds.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GIRLS AGAINST BOYS AT JABBERJAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Girls Against Boys' sound is based in the dissonance of Sonic Youth and in the 
sharp, angular clamor of the Fall, but the New York band expands its 
trance-like music into fresh territory. The biggest risk the clean-cut quartet 
faced at Jabberjaw on Sunday was sounding too lethargic and droning, but thanks 
to an accessible marching beat, the sleepy songs came alive, and the tightly 
packed crowd swayed contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Scott McCloud delivered lyrics in spurts, like the Fall's 
Mark E. Smith, but instead of blurting them flatly he sang in drawling, almost 
sexy groans. He remained fairly stationery as keyboardist and occasional second 
bass-man Eli Janney bobbed his head furiously and bounced off the 
earthquake-damaged wall. Both Janney and McCloud conjured weird, 
synthesizer-like noises with their voices, and an eerie electric buzz, like the 
sound of a blown amp, backed the entire set. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls Against Boys isn't breaking any musical boundaries, but with its ability 
to balance obscure and accessible elements, the band has what it needs to keep 
its underground audience for as long as it wants to. LORRAINE ALI

 BRIGHT IDEA: The historic train depot in San Juan Capistrano wanted low light 
wattage for its new Metrolink platform for the serenity of nearby Los Rios 
residents. That didn't meet Amtrak's brightness standard, and threatened to 
hold up the Metrolink plan. . . . A few days ago the problem was solved: County 
transportation official John Catoe pointed out that trains first arrived at the 
depot in 1895 -- without a light in sight.The city gets to keep its low glow.

 IN THE WORKS: Three Orange County teams have advanced to the upcoming women's 
community college state basketball tournament: Cypress, Golden West and Orange 
Coast. The finals run Thursday through Saturday in Suisun City near Sacramento. 
Says Cypress freshman forward Sara Works: "I knew from the start our team could 
make it; we have so much talent." Averaging 20 points and nine rebounds a game, 
Works was the Most Valuable Player -- along with Orange Coast's LeAnn Kazmer --

. . Says UCI's Harry L. Norman, who will take part in the 12-day trip: "My

 SWEET RETURN: Sure, it boosted Valley morale to see Cal State Northridge back 
in business. But that was nothing compared to the best post-quake therapy of 
all: Girl Scout cookies are back! . . . On Saturday at Burbank Airport, the San 
Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council will kick off its annual cookie drive, 
postponed because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE TROUBLE: The news, however, isn't as encouraging for a group of much 
older women -- the Van Nuys Woman's Club. It, too, was hit hard by the quake, 
but so far, help hasn't come from FEMA or the banks. The club's treasury is 
nearly drained, and its spirits aren't any better. . . . "It's been a blow to 
all of us," one 85-year-old member said (B2).

<P>
 HIZZONER'S EARS: She calls herself "the eyes and the ears of the mayor." 
Georgia Mercer of Tarzana (in red) is Mayor Riordan's new West Valley liaison. 
Topping her priorities: Earthquake recovery and crime. "We won't want to live 
here unless we really get a handle on . . . crime," she says (B5).

 COMPUTER COMEBACK: Two years ago, Packard Bell had $93 million in debt and a 
negative net worth of $4 million. Its survival was certainly up in the air. . . 
. These days, the company, based in Westlake Village and Camarillo, is 
recording healthy profits. See Valley Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 LOSING MONEY: The quake has been hard on many Valley businesses. . . . Damage 
to their facilities and merchandise resulted in slower product shipments, 
turning possible quarterly profits into substantial losses. See Valley

 But see, it's like this: I just got back from vacation and deadline's coming 
and a couple of old letters have been waiting for a rainy day. Or a first day 
back from vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that guns aren't a worthy topic. To the contrary, it's just that, 
like aftershocks or car insurance, the topic gets tedious. Firearms have become 
just too familiar. And so does the debate over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 For guns to become newsworthy, we require something extraordinary. An 
accidental shooting or a drive-by won't do. In only the first two months of 
1994, the Los Angeles County coroner's office recorded 239 deaths by firearms. 
But to get our attention, we require something like the ambush murder of LAPD 
Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, gunned down by a disturbed teen-ager who had 
already killed his father and would ultimately turn the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to hear some good arguments, Tim Elliott suggests, try the 
National Rifle Assn. But we already know the argument: Guns don't kill people. 
People do. An AR-15, the civilian version of the military M-16 assault rifle, 
didn't kill Christy Hamilton, mother of two. A 17-year-old boy, Christopher 
Golly, did. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is true as far as it goes -- and that isn't very far at all. Who, or 
what, pulled the trigger that killed Christy Hamilton? Many of the factors are 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Golly household, it seems, the influence of drugs and the erosion of 
family life went hand-in-hand. Christopher's parents were in the process of 
divorcing in 1990 when his mother, Pam, died of a cocaine overdose. Christopher 
spiraled downward, faltering in school and developing a taste for crystal 
methamphetamine, commonly known as speed. His father, Steven, in a feckless and 
ultimately fatal effort to mend a stormy relationship with his troubled son, 
introduced him to his hobby: firearms. Christopher liked to show his dad's gun 
collection to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns don't kill people. People with guns do. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Tim Elliott notes, so do people who drive cars. Unlike the people with 
guns, they kill without even trying! 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's a comparison of apples and elephants. It's not like we drive 
our guns to work each day. (Columnist Molly Ivins has noted that Texas 
politicians are so concerned that deaths from guns would exceed those resulting 
from car crashes that they're thinking of raising the speed limit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the comparison is useful. Actually, for some years now, more people 
have been killed by firearms in Los Angeles County than die in car accidents. 
And the truth is, we regulate automobiles far more than we regulate firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 To legally drive a car, you must pass tests to acquire a driver's license. To 
legally own a car, it must be registered. But such routine, sensible safeguards 
don't apply to guns and the people who use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, this dichotomy is not lost on many gun enthusiasts who, contrary to 
the NRA, support stronger gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 James K. Mattis of Sunland writes: 
</P>
<P>
 In your column . . . you said that we gun freaks have itchy keyboard fingers. 
It's true . . . I too believe that we can use a strong gun control law or two. 
But we don't need a dumb gun control law or a dozen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A smart gun control law addresses the fact that there are some people out 
there who shouldn't be trusted with a gun, and not all of them are already 
crooks. Some of them are even nice people, but they can't follow the 
directions, and we may not want them driving a car either. A licensing 
requirement would be a smart law. If one passes the background check and a 
training requirement (designed for people of normal intelligence who are 
serious about taking on a serious responsibility, to make dumb, if not 
malicious, shootings unlikely), one would get a card that says one may keep and 
bear any gun short of machine guns and mortars, and ammunition. Without the 
license, one would . . . eventually be prohibited from buying so much as a box 
of .22 shells.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 In his letter and in a telephone conversation, Mattis emphasized that such a 
licensing requirement would discourage "casual" gun ownership and "keep a lot 
of irresponsible parties out of the gun stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattis, who rattles off the names and characteristics of guns the way Tommy 
Lasorda talks about Dodgers, is one self-described "gun freak" who objects to 
the NRA's stubborn resistance to even such modest gun-control measures as the 
Brady Bill, which finally went into effect nationally this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattis' proposal isn't all to my taste. He would ban relatively few firearms 
and impose no limit on the size of ammunition magazines. My law would impose 
substantial fees for licenses and registration. I doubt his would. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's encouraging to find gun owners who favor sensible regulation of 
such a dangerous endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody thinks a good law would eliminate reckless behavior. But maybe, just 
maybe, it would encourage parents to be responsible when they introduce their 
children to guns. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe they would think twice about owning an arsenal.

APPROVAL OF CAMARILLO OUTLET MALL IS APPEALED; DEVELOPMENT: THE CITY COUNCIL 
WILL BE FORCED TO VOTE ON THE MATTER. VENTURA COUNTY, SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A 
RESIDENT CITE CONCERNS ABOUT 22-ACRE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the second time in 14 months, the Camarillo City Council will consider 
approving a 22-acre factory outlet mall after appeals were filed challenging 
the Planning Commission's blessing of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent appeals, filed late last week by Ventura County, the Oxnard 
Union High School District and Camarillo resident John Johs, will force the 
City Council to decide at its March 9 meeting whether the 250,000-square-foot 
mall should be built, despite the commission's unanimous approval of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they appealed the commission's Feb. 15 decision because 
of concerns about how the project's traffic will impact local roads and the 
Ventura Freeway. The site is south of the Ventura Freeway between Las Posas 
Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't believe that the city is providing enough in terms of traffic 
impact fees," said W. Butch Britt, the county's deputy director of public 
works. "We filed the appeal if for no other reason than to preserve our rights 
in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said Las Posas and Pleasant Valley roads would be particularly hard hit 
by the new development. 
</P>
<P>
 In their appeal, Oxnard school officials argued that the proposal does not 
provide enough funding to the district to compensate for the number of families 
that would move into the area because of jobs created at the mall and whose 
children would attend district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we are against the factory outlet," said Richard Canady, the 
district's assistant business manager. "It's that we believe that Camarillo has 
not fully considered the costs that we will have to bear should the project be 
developed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johs based his appeal on concerns about traffic from the mall and the 
project's impact on local schools. He could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing of the appeals angered Camarillo officials, who said they can't 
understand why the project has been seemingly thwarted at every turn. The 
project could bring the city an estimated $400,000 in annual sales tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have jumped through every hoop there is to be jumped through," City 
Manager Bill Little said. "At this point, we're just baffled." 
</P>
<P>
 After the council first approved the mall in January, 1993, Oxnard developer 
Stephen Maulhardt and retired Camarillo businessman Richard Lundberg filed a 
Superior Court lawsuit charging that city officials had failed to assess the 
full impact of the project. As a result of the suit, a judge ordered a full 
environmental review and ruled that a proposed tax rebate to the developer, Los 
Angeles-based Koll Co., amounted to a gift of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the project has undergone a full environmental review and provides 
more than adequate funding to the county and school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the end of the project, we will pay more than $100,000 to the county 
in road improvements," he said. "It's seems like no matter what we do, they 
just want more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll officials said they are still optimistic that the project will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a part of the process," said Peter Tilton, a company spokesman. 
"This isn't insurmountable. We will carefully answer the charges and, after we 
are done, I'm sure that the council will come to the same conclusion that it 
did more than a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But as officials wait for the project to come before the council, construction 
on a similar-size factory outlet mall continues about five miles north in 
Oxnard. The facility, which broke ground in December, is south of the Ventura 
Freeway between Rose and Rice avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo council will consider the appeals at 5 p.m. March 9 at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

DECISION TO 'DEBARK' DOG IS OVERRULED; COURTS: OWNER ACCEPTS JUDGE'S 
COMPROMISE. THE NOISY CANINE WILL BE FITTED WITH COLLAR THAT ZAPS HER WITH AN 
ELECTRIC CHARGE WHEN SHE IS TOO BOISTEROUS.

<P>
 Missy, a 10-pound terrier who was ordered to undergo surgery to quiet her 
noisy bark, won a victory of sorts in a Ventura County court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane ruled that the order calling for Missy to 
be silenced through "debarking" was not valid. 
</P>
<P>
 A county animal regulation official issued the order without giving Missy's 
owner a hearing, Lane ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge then listened to arguments from attorneys on both sides of the issue 
and suggested a compromise. The attorney for Ann Perez, Missy's owner, agreed 
to have her client fit Missy with an electronic collar that an expert said 
would help quiet the canine. 
</P>
<P>
 The collar, which has to be ordered from Arizona, would zap the dog with small 
electrical charges whenever she became too boisterous. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane gave Perez, who didn't attend Monday's hearing, two weeks to get the 
collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Winslow, representing the dog, told the judge that Perez is prepared 
to spend the estimated $150 it costs to buy the collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the device arrives, Perez is also willing to abide by an order from the 
Ventura County Animal Regulation Department that allows Missy outdoors only if 
the dog is accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane ordered both sides back in court April 11, when the judge can determine 
whether the compromise worked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Perez filed a Superior Court lawsuit against Kathy Jenks, director 
of the Animal Regulation Department, and other officials in an attempt to have 
the debarking order blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 She also requested the hearing with Lane for a temporary restraining order 
against the debarking order, which was issued by Jenks. 
</P>
<P>
 Missy was formally declared a nuisance by Jenks in October during a hearing at 
which several neighbors testified about the dog's relentless barking. At that 
time, Perez was ordered to keep her canine inside and have the 11-month-old 
mixed-breed terrier evaluated by an animal expert. The expert suggested that 
Missy either get the collar or have the surgical procedure performed on her 
vocal cords. 
</P>
<P>
 After more complaints from neighbors, Jenks on Feb. 8 ordered the debarking 
without the benefit of another formal hearing for Missy, a decision that Lane 
said Monday violated Perez's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, attorney James F. Rupp Jr., representing the city of Oxnard, 
conceded that the hearing at which Jenks ordered the surgical procedure was 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane told the parties she would rather they mediate the dispute than litigate 
it. She said the case could wind up costing Perez $10,000 to litigate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rupp said he doubted that the collar would work. Winslow said that if it 
doesn't work, she believed that Perez would look for another home for Missy. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow and Rupp said they were satisfied with the judge's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want a noisy, barking dog disturbing neighbors," Rupp said.

CITY MAY ORDER REVIEW OF SMOKING LAW; OXNARD: THE COUNCIL WILL WEIGH TOUGHENING 
ITS ORDINANCE, IN THE WAKE OF OTHER MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE APPROVED STRICTER 
PROVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Following five other Ventura County cities that have passed tough new laws, 
the Oxnard City Council is expected today to order a review of the city's 
smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen an increasing concern about the danger of secondhand smoke," said 
Mayor Manuel Lopez, who said he will request the review. "I think it's time we 
take another look at the city's smoking ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 But business officials in the county's largest city expressed concern that 
tougher regulations could harm restaurants and other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to survey our members and find out how they would feel 
about a tough ordinance like Ojai's or Ventura's," said Don Facciano, executive 
director of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. Both of those cities prohibit 
smoking in restaurants, stores, workplaces and other public buildings, with the 
exception of bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Five cities in the county have approved tough new regulations since July, when 
Moorpark prohibited smoking in workplaces, restaurants and public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, the Camarillo City Council approved an ordinance that would bar 
smoking in all public areas except bars and some motel and hotel rooms. The 
council must approve the ordinance at a second reading before it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks also has a strict anti-smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's existing ordinance, approved in 1988, gives employers the right to 
decide whether to allow smoking in the workplace. It prohibits smoking in 
office restrooms, lounges and reception areas, but does not regulate smoking in 
restaurants, stores or other establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has interpreted the law to ban smoking in public areas within the 
Esplanade and Centerpoint malls, City Atty. Gary Gillig said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the ordinance does not regulate the city's restaurants, 
stores and private workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannie Vega, a community relations officer for Oxnard, said complaints from 
employees about smoky work environments have declined in recent years, as the 
city's largest employers adopted anti-smoking policies on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, workplaces in Oxnard are becoming smoke-free," Vega said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking advocates in Ventura County say the trend toward smoke-free 
workplaces is the inevitable result of medical research on the effects of 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become a public health issue," said Fred Bysshe, an attorney who 
heads the Smoking Action Coalition, an advocacy group formed by the county's 
medical and dental societies and the local chapters of the heart, lung and 
cancer societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bysshe said the anti-smoking advocates are lobbying the city of Port Hueneme 
to adopt tougher smoking regulations at the same time Oxnard does. That way, he 
said, restaurants and other retail businesses in one city will not lose smoking 
customers to businesses in the neighboring city. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition member Robert Towner, a dentist and president of the Port Hueneme 
Chamber of Commerce, said the chance that businesses will lose customers will 
lessen when all cities in the county have anti-smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition feels if we could get all cities to adopt the same ordinance, 
everybody would be on equal ground," Towner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker Merryman, vice president of the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, 
said a broad ban on workplace smoking would be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes sense for a voluntary health advocacy office may not make sense 
for a warehouse," Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, several Oxnard council members said they welcomed a second look at 
the city's smoking ordinance, but added that it is important to balance the 
different interests involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to view the ordinance in terms of the legitimate concern 
about secondhand smoke," Councilman Tom Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people are entitled in their workplace to a smoke-free 
environment," Councilman Andres Herrera said. "But we have to make sure that an 
ordinance offers businesses an opportunity for compliance without strangling 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Bense, manager of the Lobster Trap Restaurant at Channel Islands 
Harbor, expressed the conflicting views of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a business basis, I would say there's a fear of losing business," he said. 
"But on a personal basis, I think that what's best for all is the best."

CITY COUNCIL REPEALS LIMITS ON DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After concerns raised by the owner of a bar catering to lesbians, the Ventura 
City Council on Monday repealed a 26-year-old policy that had prohibited club 
owners from allowing people of the same sex to dance together. 
</P>
<P>
 With no debate or discussion, city leaders voted 6 to 0 to rescind the 1968 
resolution. Councilman Jim Monahan was not present for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has no interest in regulating that kind of behavior," Mayor Tom 
Buford said in an interview before the meeting. "I don't think that the city 
has a legitimate interest in going as far as that resolution went." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, adopted June 3, 1968, states that owners of clubs "shall not 
permit any person to dance with another person of the same sex" or hire 
entertainers "whose conduct encourages, promotes or condones the congregating 
of homosexuals, lesbians or persons pretending to be such." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Gaffaney, owner of the bar Lipstix, catering to lesbians, said he found 
out about the policy last month after requesting an entertainment permit. City 
officials had routinely sent him a copy of the resolution along with the permit 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffaney could not be reached for comment Monday, but in a previous interview, 
he said: "It's discriminatory in its language and in its intent." 
</P>
<P>
 After the resolution was brought to the attention of city officials, they 
reviewed the policy and decided that it should be stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the resolution, which is a city policy, not a law, has never 
been enforced. It also did not carry any penalties for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara Kam, who has been with the city since 1961, said Gaffaney 
has been the only person to protest the law. The resolution had been adopted as 
part of a larger package of rules and regulations for dance and entertainment 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never enforced it," Kam said. "It has never been an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page resolution also prohibited shows featuring female 
impersonators, unless a permit is obtained from the city manager. Entertainers 
were also forbidden from singing obscene words or from performing skits that 
would discredit religious groups or law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution did not prevent Gaffaney from obtaining his entertainment 
permit at Lipstix, 577 E. Main St., in the space of the former Bermuda Triangle 
Bar. Lipstix has a full-service bar and a dance floor. Gaffaney also owns 
Incognito, a nightclub on Thompson Boulevard that caters to gays. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the policy had not been repealed before because no one had 
challenged it. It is rescinded effective immediately, City Atty. Peter D. 
Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even know it existed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulens said state and federal laws that have since been adopted make the city 
policy invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the resolution is not enforceable," Bulens said. "I think most of 
it's unconstitutional. It has standards in there that are not acceptable under 
today's laws."

AT & T TO PAY $1.25 MILLION TO SETTLE COMPLAINT ON SALES; INQUIRY: COMPANY 
ADMITS THAT EMPLOYEES OF SEVERAL AUTHORIZED DEALERS USED HEAVY-HANDED TACTICS 
ON ELDERLY CUSTOMERS AND FALSELY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES.

<P>
 American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has agreed that several of its authorized 
dealers used unlawful tactics to sell products to the elderly and will pay 
$1.25 million to the Ventura County district attorney's office to settle a 
complaint, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said AT & T knowingly let its dealers who were authorized to sell 
home-security and medical-alert systems falsely identify themselves to 
customers as employees of the giant telecommunications company, Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Colleen Toy White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also said AT & T's largest West Coast dealer -- Ideal Systems Inc. 
of Glendale -- pressured many senior citizens into buying products at inflated 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County -- which led a 15-month, multi-agency investigation -- will 
pocket $831,000 for its efforts in the investigation and distribute the rest of 
the money to other agencies that assisted in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The next largest share of the settlement will go to the state attorney 
general's office. Authorities said part of the money will go to bolster 
consumer protection and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is the largest involving the Ventura County district attorney's 
office, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said more than 400 elderly customers throughout California, 
including about 75 in Ventura County, complained of being the victim of 
heavy-handed sales tactics by representatives from Ideal and other AT & 
T-authorized dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many customers purchased thousands of dollars in equipment under the false 
impression that they were buying directly from AT & T, a name they trusted, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David M. Fairweather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairweather, lead prosecutor in the investigation, said the average customer 
spent $5,000 on products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that AT & T could have prevented this situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also T was aware that Ideal and the other dealers were 
intentionally misleading elderly customers and using high-pressure tactics to 
sell products. But AT & T failed to take decisive action, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a benign neglect," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for AT & T said the company cooperated fully with the criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 AT & T has also terminated its contract with Ideal, said Steven Emery, of AT & 
T Consumer Products in Parsippany, N. J. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had in the past received complaints about the telemarketing and in-home 
sales of Ideal Systems," Emery said. "In hindsight, we could have, and should 
have, acted sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedva Zerilan, secretary-treasurer of Ideal Systems, denied that 
representatives of her company identified themselves as AT & T employees. She 
said company policy was to tell customers that Ideal was an authorized agent of 
AT & T. 
</P>
<P>
 And she said Ideal representatives found using high-pressure sales methods 
were terminated. She said Ideal was the largest AT & T dealer on the West 
Coast. The firm has been forced to slice its seven-office operation by more 
than half since AT & T terminated the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideal is now selling a new security system for ITI Security Systems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairweather said most of the customers have no complaints about the quality of 
the systems. He also said the investigation only centered around the charges of 
misrepresentation, and not overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation started with a complaint from an Ojai resident, he said. It 
broadened after prosecutors learned that the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs had also received a large number of complaints, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fairweather said prosecutors traveled the state tracking down victims and 
other information that showed that Ideal and other dealers were making a 
practice of misleading customers. In addition to Ventura County, Fairweather 
said, many victims came from Fresno, Kern and Monterey counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also had one of its investigative aides pose as 
a customer. The 75-year-old aide, who asked not to be identified because he 
does other investigative work, said he had three meetings with dealers, who 
tried to pressure him into buying AT & T equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my age, it's easy for me to get them to come and give me the 
pitch," said the aide, who wrote a check to one of the sales representatives 
but had it canceled before it was cashed.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; STUDENTS PITCH IN TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS

 She's been saving her allowance to buy a television set for her bedroom, but 
11-year-old Kelley Kaufman didn't think twice about dipping into her reserves 
for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mind giving it away," Kelley said."It was to help people." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley and her classmates at White Oak School in Westlake Village raised about 
$800 to help students and their families at San Cayetano School in Fillmore who 
were displaced by the Northridge quake. Karen Cooksey, principal of the 
800-student Fillmore elementary school, traveled to White Oak with student 
representatives Monday to receive the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore was pummeled more severely than any other city in Ventura County by 
the Jan. 17 quake, suffering an estimated $250 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey said San Cayetano suffered only cosmetic damage, but the quake left 
nearly 40 of the school's families homeless. She said the funds will be given 
directly to families who lost their houses or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort comes as more than 200 schools across the country are offering 
books, monetary donations and moral support to students in areas hard hit by 
the earthquake. Some schools sent letters or posters.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to ease the suffering of their counterparts in Fillmore, White Oak 
students turned over their piggy banks, withdrew money from their savings 
accounts and asked relatives to pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an incredible offering of caring and love," Cooksey said. "It's 
teaching our students how people come together -- that we are all one big 
family." SUSAN BYRNES

 Thousand Oaks residents will have a chance to see the latest products from 
dozens of local vendors at the semiannual Business Showcase, scheduled March 8 
at the Hyatt Westlake Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, the evening event will 
feature more than 40 local companies, offering everything from cosmetics to 
financial services to water-purification systems.Entrepreneurs will also 
provide fresh-baked cookies and exotic brewed coffees to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainly for people to network and see what we have available in the 
community," said Nancy Lynch, who coordinates special events for the chamber. 
"It's even amazing to me to see how much is available." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a decade, organizers will not charge admission to the 
showcase, which will run from 5 to 8 p.m. Lynch said she expects more than 200 
visitors to browse through the booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors participating in the showcase include banks, communications companies 
and travel agents. Westlake Medical Center and Conejo Valley Days will also 
staff informational tables. Renting space at the business showcase costs $75, 
and Lynch said a few tables are still available. 
</P>

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; STUDENTS GET NEW 
OUTLOOK FROM MENTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each week, two different worlds and generations meet over lunch, when Mark 
Gerin and his 15-year-old friend, Richard, sit down to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerin, 64, a retired businessman who holds a Ph.D., lives in Woodland Hills, 
three miles from Taft High School. Richard lives with his mother, brother and 
five sisters on 41st Street, miles from the San Fernando Valley school. He 
wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to meet his bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The two make an unlikely pair. And that's just the point. 
</P>
<P>
 They were introduced by the Each One-Reach One mentor program started last 
spring as a pilot project by the Los Angeles Unified School District. Mentors 
are paired with kindergarten through 12th-grade students at risk of dropping 
out of school or who just need someone to talk to, said Kathleen Kelly, the 
project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for them to have the consistency of seeing someone who's older and 
cares about them not because they're paid to care but are coming on their own 
time," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the program proved successful, Kelly said, the district is expanding 
it from six schools to 32, including eight in the Valley. The program, which 
now has 35 volunteers, needs 160. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentors are asked to meet students at their schools for an hour a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not expected to be a psychologist or a parent," Kelly said. "It's 
just these kids are looking to enhance their lives and ensure their futures and 
need support and inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 So when a suited Mark Gerin and soft-spoken Richard meet, there's something 
more than soup and salad on their plates. 
</P>
<P>
 In sometimes awkward discussions, the two learn about each other's lives and 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerin talks about growing up poor in Brooklyn. Richard talks of his mother's 
car being stolen repeatedly and a break-in at his old house. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's eyes light up when Gerin tells him of the ride he took in a police 
helicopter. Gerin listens as Richard says his family will visit his ailing 
grandmother in Guadalajara but that he has to stay to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the discussion centers on the pair's own relationship and 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at a pastel-colored cafe, with Richard spooning soup and Gerin 
eating scrambled egg whites with goat cheese, Gerin asked why Richard wasn't 
wearing clothes Gerin had bought. Richard wore an oversize shirt and baggy, 
black pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice and everything but I just think it's not me," he said. "I'm just 
used to wearing these kind of clothes."  
</P>
<P>
 Gerin persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do it, I'll do it," Richard said. Then he said softly: "It won't be me." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Richard talked about his lunches with Gerin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's cool. He's just like the big brother I never had or the father who never 
gave me advice," he said. Richard's real brother recently got out of juvenile 
detention hall, where he served time for graffiti tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows everything," Richard said of Gerin. "He's telling me what to do and 
what not to do and sometimes I don't listen. That's when I get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think it's helping him?" Gerin asked after his lunch. "I don't know. 
It's still in the embryonic stage. Maybe in 10 years we'll know if it helped 
him."  
</P>
<P>
 Gerin hopes that Richard will see that, though Gerin grew up poor, he carved 
out a good life for himself and that Richard can strive for the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being very poor, I could have gone in either direction. Many of my friends 
ended up in jail or dead. I chose not to go that direction," he said. "If I can 
get him to change his dress code, to me that's a step in a particular 
direction. I think Richard has a long way to go but I think he's capable of 
doing it. He's a good person." 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer as a mentor, call Kelly at (213) 625-6900.

<P>

 Volunteers age 60 and older are needed to facilitate reminiscence groups for 
seniors. Call Rose at (818) 845-7671.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES ON SANTA ROSA ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction on the 60-year-old Santa Rosa Road east of Camarillo continued 
Monday as crews began a six-month-long effort to relocate sewer, water and 
other utilities lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility lines are being relocated as part of an overall make-over for the 
thoroughfare, said W. Butch Britt, Ventura County deputy director of public 
works. The new design will smooth out and increase the overall safety of the 
two-lane road, Britt said. Construction work, which began in 1990, is now in 
the last of three phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said the finished road will offer drivers better vision and will have an 
eight-foot-wide paved shoulder on each side. Additionally, land for a possible 
expansion of the roadway to four lanes was purchased in anticipation of 
increased future use. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 motorists a day use the road that runs between Camarillo and 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Nye and Nelson Inc. is the general contractor for the second and 
third phase of the $5-million county project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting digging up some parts of the road," said Ruric Nye, a 
spokesman for the construction firm. "We were finding materials that were used 
on road construction during the Depression era." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the project is still on schedule with an expected completion date of 
June, 1995, work on one section located east of Camarillo was stopped late last 
year after grading work uncovered what archeological specialists believe is a 
Chumash Indian cremation urn. The urn contained one human tooth and other human 
bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said that negotiations between the county and Native American 
representatives from a state commission are continuing and no decision as to 
whether the construction design at the site will be altered has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Britt said that construction crews will continue to work on 
other areas of the roadway not believed to be archeologically sensitive. J.E.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MAYOR OPTS OUT OF SUPERVISORIAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After consulting with family, friends and supporters over the weekend, 
Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said Monday that he has decided not to seek Vicky 
Howard's seat on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am interested.But right at this time, it's not going to work for me for a 
variety of reasons," Lawrason said, ending speculation that he would become the 
fourth candidate in the race for the supervisorial seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the added stress and time commitment such a campaign would impose on 
his family and himself, Lawrason said he was concerned that he would be 
entering the field of candidates late and be forced to raise a substantial 
amount of money to run a viable campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason weeks ago announced his plans to seek another term as Moorpark mayor, 
and said Monday that he will keep those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Heartened by Lawrason's decision not to seek county office was council 
colleague Scott Montgomery, who last week announced his intention to run for 
Howard's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for Moorpark if we have just one candidate," Montgomery 
said. "I felt that if Paul ran, he and I would have split Moorpark and that 
would ensure that we would both lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley council members Barbara Williamson and Judy Mikels have also 
announced plans to compete for Howard's 4th District seat. Howard, who 
represents the areas in and around Simi Valley and Moorpark, said last week 
that she will not seek reelection. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; U.S. TO ACCEPT SYSTEM FOR TRACKING WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government is expected today to take possession of the 98-foot 
Doppler radar system recently built atop Sulphur Mountain near Ojai, National 
Weather Service officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with Unisys, the giant information services firm contracted 
to build more than 150 such towers across the country, the radar system is not 
completed until federal officials formally accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unisys officials Monday were concluding a 72-hour test run -- the final series 
of trials for the weather-tracking system, said Jerry McDuffie, area manager of 
the Oxnard office of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the test goes all right, we probably will have it by tomorrow," he said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service will begin conducting its own tests once it accepts the 
system as completed, McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be on all the time, once it's turned on and it's working," he said. 
"It will probably be functioning around the clock I would hope within the 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Oxnard office's 15 meteorologists and managers will have to be 
specially trained on the system's use, McDuffie added. Meanwhile, some Sulphur 
Mountain residents who lost a lawsuit asking that further studies be performed 
on the radar's long-term health effects said they still plan to appeal. JEFF

GTE WILL NO LONGER SPONSOR GOLF EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE announced Monday that it will cease its sponsorship of the annual GTE West 
Classic golf tournament at the Ojai Valley Inn after this week's contest. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Area President Larry Sparrow said the company is no longer willing to 
finance production and promotion of the weeklong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're facing unparalleled competition, which is forcing us to re-examine 
every aspect of our business -- including sports marketing," Sparrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at GTE declined Monday to specify how much it has spent on 
tournament sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying rounds began Monday for the Senior PGA tournament, which has drawn 
some of the most widely known names in professional golf since it began in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is a major boon to Ojai, filling motels, restaurants and shops for 
the duration of the contest. It runs through Sunday and will draw more than 
50,000 fans, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for business, no question about that, but there's many special 
events happening in Ojai," City Manager Andrew S. Belknap said. "While this is 
going to hurt, we still have a viable local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Westrom of the Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce said the tournament 
would be missed. "Anytime we take an event where everything is booked and next 
year it isn't, there's an impact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were confident that another sponsor will be found to replace GTE and 
keep the tournament alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are disappointed, we are looking for another sponsor or some 
other opportunity to keep the tournament here," said Alison Brainard, marketing 
director at the Ojai Valley Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wide variety of Fortune 500 companies that come here as clients," 
she said. "We're a Senior PGA-approved course, and that's very appealing." JEFF

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PRIEST'S DEFENSE SAYS PARISH MONEY INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the church embezzlement trial of Father David Dean Piroli resumed Monday, 
the defense gave evidence seeking to exonerate the priest in the alleged theft 
of $60,000 in collection money and to implicate Father James McKeon, his former 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense's expert witness, Michael G. Kaplan, a USC accounting professor, 
testified that he found no evidence that money was missing from either of 
Piroli's former parishes -- Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy or St. Peter Claver 
Church in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecution accountant testified two weeks ago that collections at both 
churches dropped sharply when Piroli worked there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaplan told jurors in Ventura County Superior Court that average weekly 
collections rose steadily at Sacred Heart during Piroli's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan also testified that cash deposits from St. Peter Claver dropped 
noticeably when church secretary Eileen Slavin resumed working there in 1991 
and rose dramatically after McKeon left for another church in the second half 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was assistant pastor there from July, 1990, until June 3, 1992, the day 
he fled after police in Hollywood found him in a church car with $10,000 in 
cash, collection envelopes and traces of cocaine. Piroli has already testified 
that he did not steal church funds or use cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Douglas Levinson showed jurors McKeon's private ledger 
reflecting collection cash the pastor had spent. When Levinson asked if the 
ledger fit the prosecution's description of "an amber warning signal" 
indicating fraud, Kaplan answered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exhibit H is not an amber warning," Kaplan testified. "It's really a red 
blinking light, a red warning with sirens and whistles." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan testified that McKeon's ledger -- which the pastor said reflected gifts 
to the poor, dinners with visiting priests and other church expenses -- showed 
that McKeon had spent $121,000 in collection money in about 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is scheduled to continue at 10:15 a.m. today. MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FORUMS WILL ADDRESS JUVENILE CRIME ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reduce the level -- and the violence -- of juvenile crime, the 
county's probation department will hold three forums around the county to take 
suggestions from professionals and the public on how best to handle youthful 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to give the public the opportunity to voice what their real 
concerns and priorities are," said Calvin Remington, chief deputy probation 
officer."Then we will take that information and use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum is scheduled from 4 to 7 p.m. today at the Simi Valley 
Courthouse, Corrections Services Agency, 3855-F Alamo St. The second meeting 
will be held from 4 to 7 p.m. Monday at the Wilson Senior Center, 350 N. C St., 
Oxnard. The final forum is scheduled from 4 to 7 p.m. March 10 in the lower 
plaza assembly room of the County Government Center, 800 S. Victoria Ave., 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Remington said the meetings are necessary to help the county find ways to 
fight juvenile crime with increased state funding anticipated in the next 
fiscal year. He added that juvenile crime is becoming more violent and 
frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing the violence at an earlier age," Remington said. "If we had a 
drive-by shooting involving a juvenile, that was very unusual five years ago. 
Unfortunately, now, it's routine." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

SIMI VALLEY WRAPS UP QUAKE-RELATED BUILDING INSPECTIONS; RECOVERY: DESPITE 
REQUESTS FOR FOLLOW-UPS, DAMAGE ESTIMATES REMAIN AT $350 MILLION AFTER MORE 
THAN 8,600 REVIEWS. CHECKS ON REPAIRS ARE TO COME. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After scouring more than 8,600 homes and businesses, Simi Valley building 
inspectors have almost completed their assessment of structures damaged in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city receives new inspection requests daily, city officials said 
the total cost of damage caused by the quake remains at about $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new requests are coming from homeowners who want their homes 
reviewed for additional damage caused by aftershocks, rain and wind, said Homer 
Croy, manager of the city's building and safety operations. The latest 
estimates show about 1,200 requests remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Once those reviews are completed, however, inspectors say they will still have 
much to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for permit inspections, which are required to repair everything from 
cracked foundations and toppled chimneys to leaky swimming pools, are just 
beginning to roll in. 
</P>
<P>
 These inspections are more meticulous than quake damage assessments. "An 
earthquake inspection is a rapid evaluation that lasts about 10 to 20 minutes," 
Croy said. "A regular inspection for a permit requires a much more thorough 
analysis to see if they are following plans and codes." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the pace, Jeff Turnbull, the city's inspection field 
supervisor, said he assigns his inspectors several more homes than he thinks 
that they will be able to cover in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps everybody on their toes," Turnbull said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of the post-quake inspections, 20 inspectors from Riverside, San 
Luis Obispo and Watsonville joined Turnbull and his staff of 10, working dawn 
to dusk to evaluate the safety of homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But now those inspectors are gone, leaving the task to Turnbull and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are still getting quake inspections and others are getting ready 
to start their repairs," Turnbull said. "We've got our work cut out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, upset about what they say is the city's lack of concern, homeowners 
on the city's east end are meeting tonight to discuss plans to ask the city for 
an extensive soil study of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Simi Valley Board of Realtors, 2080 
Winifred St. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the effort is C. Jill Clark, whose home on Sabina Circle was badly 
damaged when the ground cracked during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want real experts to tell us what the elements are under the soil," Clark 
said. "We don't want them in five years or two years, but now." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Clark's concerns, the City Council agreed Monday night to ask 
the state Department of Conservation's Division of Mines and Geology to conduct 
an in-depth study of the area around Clark's home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State geologists have visited the city twice since the quake, conducting 
cursory soil checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Davis, chief of the mines and geology division, said his department's 
ability to conduct a more thorough study depends on the amount of federal 
disaster funds received. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll review the request, but I can't say much more than that," Davis said. 
"It's all hypothetical right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who has spoken at two City Council meetings about her concerns over 
unstable soil, said she is not satisfied with the city's response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day late and a dollar short for the homeowners," she said. "Many 
people are already beginning to rebuild, and they have no idea what the 
problems with the soil might be." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake disaster relief center in Simi Valley is moving from the 
Sycamore Drive Community Center to the K mart shopping center at 59 Tierra 
Rejada Road. The center helps residents get financial assistance or information 
about housing repairs, small business loans and state grants to families. The 
new facility will open at 1 p.m. Wednesday and will close at 7 p.m. Starting 
Thursday, the center will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through 
Saturdays.

COST OF POLICING; PROPOSAL SEEKS TO CHARGE 5 CITIES MORE FOR SERVICES OF THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cities that contract with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department will have to 
pay more for law enforcement services under a proposal to be considered today 
by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials are asking the board to raise contract fees for Thousand 
Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo, Fillmore and Ojai by a total of $695,289, or an 
average of 4.15% per city, this fiscal year. The move would push the total 
amount that the five cities pay for services to $17 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersheriff Richard S. Bryce, who drafted the proposal, said the increase is 
needed to offset higher operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the cost of providing service," Bryce said. "Law enforcement is a 
pretty good bargain when you compare it with other issues. On the other hand, I 
wouldn't say it's cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Sheriff's Department's request is expected to win the board's 
approval, the proposed fee increase has come under criticism from some city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just able to balance our budget during this year," said Moorpark 
Mayor Paul Lawrason, whose city pays $2.1 million for law enforcement services. 
"Passing along something like this really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven criticized the increase because 
it would be retroactive for the 1993-94 fiscal year, which started July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have known these rates were going to be higher and they should 
have told us earlier," Craven said. "We often hear that local governments need 
to start acting more like businesses. . . . Well, businesses don't act this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bryce said the Sheriff's Department traditionally reviews its rates in 
February, adding that the annual contracts with the cities allow for midyear 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said he understands the cities' concerns, sheriff's officials have 
kept costs down as much as possible by reorganizing the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we are trying to provide services at the most economical 
rate possible," Bryce said. "I can understand the frustrations, especially when 
(city) revenues are decreasing at a rapid rate. We are doing the best we can 
and the price is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he believes that the cities are receiving a 
"sweetheart deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt the contracts needed to be a little stiffer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Craven and Lawrason criticized the proposal, Thousand Oaks City 
Councilman Frank Schillo said he supports the Sheriff's Department's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have a safe county," said Schillo, whose city pays $9 million 
annually for the services. "It's the price of public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, fees for a variety of services would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the annual cost of staffing a one-officer patrol car 
around-the-clock would increase from $446,325 annually to $468,922 in Thousand 
Oaks. In Moorpark, the cost of a one-officer car would increase from $446,325 
to $479,000. And in Camarillo, the cost would be set at $481,290, up from 
$444,457. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also calls for the county to start charging $100 per four hours 
when officers from other departments use the sheriff's pistol range, located at 
Camarillo Airport. That fee would become effective July 1. Presently, there is 
no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obligated to charge for full cost recovery," Bryce said. "We are 
watching after the county's interest."

VISION FOR DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does our downtown Ventura have a vision, or are we living in a bygone era? 
</P>
<P>
 The end of innocence for downtowns across the country came with the concurrent 
auto / baby boom following World War II.The first to recognize these changes 
was J. Levitt, who turned a Long Island potato farm into Levittown, setting off 
an explosion of tract housing that inures to our populace to this day. The 
advent of this explosion signaled the end of the central-core concept of city 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, and we have not. America's downtowns have become 
service-centered as opposed to commerce-centered entities. The future is now, 
if we are willing to accept as inevitable the permanence of change. Downtown 
Ventura, as it stands, cannot accommodate major department stores or discount 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The survival of our downtown is keyed to a recognition that tourism is but one 
of the essential elements in the mix. Another part is the development of 
housing that will encourage the development of transportation facilities, which 
will revitalize the support services that in turn attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 People are the vital link. They create the need for the marketplace to fill. 
Other peripheral benefits are to be found in the preservation and extension of 
whatever greenbelt is left. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the downtown associations laid end to end won't have the singular 
impact of a planned city center.

CITY ACCUSED OF CUTTING ITS OWN RED TAPE; THOUSAND OAKS: COUNCILWOMAN JAIME 
ZUKOWSKI SAYS PUBLIC PROJECTS ARE NOT HELD TO THE SAME RIGOROUS STANDARDS AS 
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City-sponsored developments slide through the permit process without adequate 
independent analysis, evading the lengthy reviews required for private 
projects, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most egregious example, Zukowski cited the billboard-size electronic 
marquee proposed for the Civic Arts Plaza. The council last month approved the 
marquee, in a 3-2 vote, based on an architect's sketch and partial model, 
without input from city staff or planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall dealers spent scores of hours meeting 
with the city's planning staff before even proposing an electronic sign along 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The car dealers spent $50,000 designing the sign, commissioning an 
environmental impact report and notifying neighbors of their plans. After three 
marathon public hearings, they received permission to build a greatly 
scaled-down sign, without the electronic message board. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much is required of the private sector," Zukowski said, "but our projects 
don't come under the same scrutiny. I don't think that's right. We need to 
treat all projects equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski's critique, which she will bring before the City Council tonight -- 
won immediate support from her longtime ally, Mayor Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 But her political foes, Councilmen Alex Fiore and Frank Schillo, scoffed at 
the implication that the city ramrods shoddy projects through the planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two gals -- I don't know where they're coming from," said Fiore, who 
has repeatedly accused Zukowski and Zeanah of tossing out red herrings to alarm 
the public. "They must have come from a lunar orbit or something. They're 
always trying to create doubt and suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the city's fast-track permit process for municipal projects is 
nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided years ago to take full responsibility for all public 
buildings, from the library to the teen center to the Civic Arts Plaza, 
according to Planning Director Phil Gatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lets the people who are spending the money make the decisions," Gatch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most private development proposals go first to review by the planning, public 
works, and building and safety departments. Then the five-member Planning 
Commission reviews the project to make sure that it complies with the city's 
hefty municipal code. The commission's decision stands unless an appeal sends 
the project for a public hearing before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Because public buildings are often one of a kind, some council members feel 
justified in waiving the restrictive standards applied to tract homes and strip 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, however, does not have the authority to deviate from 
those standards. Only the City Council can approve unique designs, unusual 
colors or extra height. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, if a majority of council members favor granting a public building 
special treatment, the Planning Commission hearing may be moot. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Civic Arts Plaza marquee, for example, "the Planning Commission would 
have said that it does not meet city standards and we would be back to square 
one," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "We might as well go right to the City 
Council, where the decision has to be made anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a policy nettles some local developers, who resent jumping so many 
hurdles while city projects sail through the first steps in the permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envy them; I wish I could do things like that," said Larry Janss, who owns 
the Conejo Village Bowl and Janss Village shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 But while he would like quicker approval of his ventures, Janss said he 
recognizes the benefits of submitting all projects, public and private, to 
rigorous scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There clearly has been a double standard," he said. "I believe the checks and 
balances of a well-oiled planning department and building and safety department 
(do benefit) the public at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Forrest Frields, however, said the council members have become 
expert at the "kinds of tweaking that the Planning Commission would normally 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff usually gives the council ample briefing on all issues, so 
regardless of whether the Planning Commission holds a public hearing, Frields 
said, "I think the end result is probably just as good."

RESOLVING CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me congratulate the Conejo Valley Unified School District on its 
recognition that we need to teach kids how to resolve their differences other 
than by violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to stop just doing what comes naturally. Violence comes naturally. 
We need to go beyond what's easy and teach nonviolent conflict resolution, 
including mediation. One text I recommend for use with teen-agers and adults is 
former President Jimmy Carter's "Talking Peace," which deals with nonviolent 
conflict resolution techniques between individuals and nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering violence with violence is ineffective. Offenders need justice. 
Pre-offenders need to be taught new ways of dealing with problems before they 
escalate to violent levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us be peacemakers, not just peacekeepers.

ELEVATED TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Feb. 19 article concerning gas leaks in the Red Line subway tunnels is 
the latest in reports about problems plaguing the system. Why does the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority insist on building subway tunnels under 
Los Angeles? The high costs, ever-present gas hazards and long construction 
time are just not worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the MTA should be planning and building aboveground aerial systems. 
An aerial system uses elevated tracks supported by steel reinforced concrete 
columns. In an aerial system, there is no danger of poisonous or explosive 
gases and no problems of thin tunnels and leaking stations. When compared to a 
subway, an aerial system is much safer, has fewer problems, costs about half as 
much and could be built in two-thirds the time or less.

GIVING UP ON GRAFFITI

<TEXT>
<P>
 I couldn't believe it when I read that the city of Oxnard would require its 
homeowners to keep graffiti off their property or be penalized.The so-called 
deterrent of going after the taggers who have driver's licenses nearly made me 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious the city has just given up trying to capture taggers and 
recouping monies from them to restore vandalized property. 
</P>
<P>
 If appearances count for anything, it looks like we need some real leaders to 
emerge. The ones at the city don't seem to be in control of the situation.

NOVEL CASINO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the past year, the approval of a card casino has been discussed, 
defeated and is not back again on the front burner. The differences between 
earlier proposals and this one are profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is a concept that is very innovative and responds to the dire 
need for a project that will put Oxnard on the map in a favorable way. This 
proposal includes class restaurants, a deli, top-notch entertainment, gift 
shops, banquet facilities for up to 1,500 people, art and style shows, 
supervised areas for parking, conventions, seminars and boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not anything in this county that is remotely close to this project. 
The individual who proposes all this is to be applauded and encouraged to bring 
it to fruition.

UNFAIR SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an independent candidate for the presidency in 1992, I did quite well at 
the personal level. People with whom I shared my ideas about how to 
dramatically improve America seemed quite impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But we do not have a manner by which unwealthy and / or boldly 
independent-minded people can share their views directly with the American 
people. Only persons with lots of money or persons backed by persons who have 
lots of money can get sufficient exposure via the various media for sale to 
achieve political viability. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this situation to be unfair to the American people, and it has 
proven absolutely disastrous for our nation. We are on the skids. Our 
government is breaking us. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, from now until July 4, 1996, I shall be preparing once again to 
campaign independently for the presidency of the United States and completing a 
book entitled "Why I Want the Presidency and What I Will Try to Accomplish 
Should I Get the Presidency." But I doubt that without publicly sponsored 
campaign exposure I will be able to snatch the presidency from Bill Clinton 
because Americans "just won't read like they used to" -- we have fallen so in 
love with our booby-toobys.

THE NHL / LISA DILLMAN; KING FANS VENT THEIR ANGER OVER TICKET PRICES, SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letters eventually reach their intended destination even if it takes an 
underground network of ushers and reporters. Voice mail at newspapers may not 
always be the cure -- perhaps a quick fix? -- for a fan who can't wait for the 
next postgame show or is unable to crack the heavy rotation of Alan from 
Torrance or Frank from Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 From a whisper to a scream. Some know it as an Elvis Costello song from the 
1980s. We know differently. It's the growing cry of King fans, perhaps the most 
passionate and disappointed disciples of any Los Angeles sports team. 
</P>
<P>
 What does a King fan look like these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot like the guy in the famous Norwegian painting, "The Scream," recently 
stolen from the National Art Museum in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 For King fans, the indignities are everywhere. Life in the standings behind 
the San Jose Sharks and the expansion Mighty Ducks. Increased playoff ticket 
prices. Too many mistakes by the front office, coaching staff and players. 
</P>
<P>
 They are growing desperate and need someone to listen. So, while the fans wait 
for a round-the-clock King crisis hotline, here's a recent sampling of their 
comments: 
</P>
<P>
 From Thousand Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
 (To the Kings:) By raising season seat prices in 1993-94 moderately, you sent 
the signal (that) to remain a competitive successful team, increased revenues 
were necessary. I understand this fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I have received my "Dear Season Seat Subscriber" letter regarding playoff 
tickets from the Kings. Let me first say I appreciate your contribution to the 
L.A. Kings. Obviously, without you, the recent success of the Kings would not 
have been possible.  
</P>
<P>
 The letter that came with the playoff price sheet explains that I have only to 
come up with 75% of the total by the end of February. You do not mention that 
the pricing has gone up 60% over last year! 
</P>
<P>
 What signal are you sending to the people who support the team when you raise 
the per-ticket price for a playoff game by 40% for Round 1, 50% for Round 2, 
60% for Round 3 and 91% for Round 4? This is compared to last year's pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 From Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 Since you cover the Kings, I have decided to write to you to present a problem 
that many fans see but is dismissed by the King radio broadcasters and others 
in the local media. The problem is the sad state of the Kings' goaltending 
situation. Particularly, it's the repeated assertion that Kelly Hrudey is not 
to blame for his poor goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 To support my argument that Kelly Hrudey is overrated at best, I have compiled 
some statistics that weaken the argument that says the reason Hrudey allows so 
many goals is because of the high number of shots he must face game after game. 
</P>
<P>
 As you can see, John Vanbiesbrouck and Curtis Joseph both face more shots per 
game, yet both have a better goals-against average than does Hrudey. It is my 
opinion that Kelly Hrudey has been overrated for some time now. 
</P>
<P>
 From Manhattan Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 As a Kings season seat-holder, I have just been informed payment is due by 
Feb. 25, 1994, for all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs. This request 
seems a little optimistic, but Bruce McNall has always been more than fair when 
it comes to spending money on top-quality players. So I'll gladly mail my check 
because I would hate to miss the final game in which the NHL record is broken 
for most shots on goal in one season taken by the visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
 From Torrance: 
</P>
<P>
 As season seat-holders for the past 22 years, my spouse and I have missed only 
five games. During this time, I have written the Kings many letters offering 
suggestions and articulating complaints. While this letter offers some praise, 
it also points out some issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday, I received my bill for the forthcoming playoffs. I was pleasantly 
surprised to find that we only have to pay 75% at this time. Except for last 
year, most of the playoff ticket purchases have been refunded.  
</P>
<P>
 I have attached some data I have collected over the years (I have it as far 
back as 1974). The charts show a rather dramatic increase in prices over the 
past few years. Certainly, we understand rising salary costs, but a 45% 
increase seems a little high. LOSE-I-PEG 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the season's final quarter, the Winnipeg Jets have dropped into 
oblivion and are easily one of the biggest disappointments this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets, who played the San Jose Sharks on Monday night, have tied a team 
record with 10 consecutive losses. They also lost 10 consecutive games in 
1980-81, their second season in the NHL, when they won a total of nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets are winless in their last 18 games, their most recent victory coming 
on Jan. 12 against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have too many guys who give up too easily, that's why we need to make big 
changes," said John Paddock, Winnipeg's coach and acting general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been minimal trade talk in Winnipeg recently, although the Sabres 
have been scouting the Jets and might end up trading goaltender Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
 Most symbolic of the Jets' problems is center Alexei Zhamnov. By Christmas, 
Zhamnov had played 34 games and had scored 17 goals and assisted on 34 more. At 
that point, he was tied for third place on the NHL scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Christmas, he has been sidelined for eight games because of a back 
injury and clearly has been less effective in the absence of his injured 
linemate, Teemu Selanne. Zhamnov has scored only 11 points in his last 19 
games, which include Friday's five-point performance against the Boston Bruins. 
DOUBLE TROUBLE 
</P>
<P>
 What are the odds of the same team having a player carried off on a stretcher 
in consecutive games? 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the Dallas Stars lost defenseman Mark Tinordi because of a 
season-ending broken left leg in Los Angeles, center Mike Modano suffered a 
concussion and was taken off on a stretcher in Dallas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Modano was knocked unconscious in a collision with center Mark Messier of the 
New York Rangers. Modano is expected to sit out about 10 days.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; ANTEATERS STILL NOT RESPONDING TO BAKER ON 
THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the final minutes of Cal State Fullerton's victory over UC Irvine 
Thursday night in the Bren Center, a Titan fan stood up and screamed, "Better 
update your resume, Rod." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker, in the third year of a four-year contract, isn't going 
anywhere for one reason: this is not an athletic department with the funds to 
pay for two coaches, even if Athletic Director Dan Guerrero were so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, this has been a season of discontent for the Anteaters. They 
embarked on the season buoyed by optimism, despite a 13-43 record in Baker's 
first two years. Experience and depth would carry them to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 They have managed one miracle a month -- an upset of Iowa in December, a 
victory at Utah State in January and Saturday night's defeat of then 
25th-ranked New Mexico State -- but there have been far too many periods of 
darkness between highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were the final year of Baker's contract, Irvine would be compelled to 
explore alternatives. The Anteaters (7-17 and 4-12 in the Big West) have the 
talent to beat most opponents. Baker believes it. His assistants believe it. 
Guerrero believes it. And Saturday night, during a 95-87 upset of New Mexico 
State, the Anteaters proved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing ingredients are consistency of effort, of concentration, of focus, 
of commitment. And all of those eventually come back to coaching. Why can't 
Baker get these student-athletes to compete at an optimum level game after 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 He wishes he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a motivational standpoint, I think I've pushed every button that can be 
pushed," Baker said. "I've gone back and forth, made changes in my approach, 
I've forced our assistants to make changes, I've forced players to make 
changes. We've given them rein, we've pulled it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when all is said and done, guys have got to step on the floor. It's 
extremely frustrating, sure, but so what? That's all retrospect. Just like 
Saturday night's win is over. It's the past. The fact is you better worry about 
the next one because the last one is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 That surely will be Baker's fate if he can't solve this mystery by next 
season, a grace period born of financial necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only control things I can control and if someone wants to have another 
basketball coach here, they're welcome to go ahead," Baker said. "I'm not 
trying to be smart. It's just that I can only deal with the things I can deal 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that what I do, straight across the board, is the right thing to do. 
Not only from a basketball standpoint, but from an academic standpoint, from a 
social standpoint, et cetera. If somebody else thinks that it's not, there's 
nothing I can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm going to continue to do what I think is right." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question Baker's players admire and respect him as a man, but they 
haven't responded on the court. Guerrero has no qualms about Baker's people 
skills, but he obviously has some major concerns about the direction of the 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of Rod's strengths, and what put him into the position to get a Division 
I coaching job, has been his ability to develop relationships with 
student-athletes," Guerrero said. "That's why he's such a successful recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a really caring attitude about his players. He's genuinely concerned 
about them, and he makes a concerted effort to make sure our kids are held 
accountable academically. And there's certainly a reciprocal admiration from 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, in the end, he's a basketball coach and what we do on the court is 
obviously first and foremost and extremely critical to any evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: A dozen victories in 1994-95 won't be enough to earn Baker a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Double-edged sword: The upset of New Mexico State should give the Anteaters 
some momentum going into the final week of the regular season and maybe even 
carry over into the Big West tournament, which begins March 10 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 It raises hope, but it also raises questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be going into the tournament knowing we can beat the team that will 
very likely be the No. 1 seed," Guerrero said. "So I think it's clear the 
tournament title is up for grabs. What we need to do is perform at a level that 
we've haven't shown we're capable of doing, and that's putting together three 
or four good solid efforts in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victory over New Mexico State is both very satisfying and very 
disappointing because we should be able to do that every night. It was the kind 
of effort we've been expecting all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker hopes his players feel similarly. After the game, he said he hoped they 
were angry because they hadn't been able to sustain that kind of effort all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great win Saturday, but there's some ying and yang to what you do 
with it," Baker said. "Do we say, 'Oh, this was wonderful,' and we're 
satisfied? Or do we say, 'OK, that was good and let's do it all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Junior guard Chris Brown, who scored 39 points in the victory over the Aggies, 
tried after the game to emphasize the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad that we beat the top team in the conference, it's good for our 
confidence, but we're still in last place," he said. "We think we're a much 
better team than our record shows. Now we have to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown, who scored 69 points in two games last week, was named Big West 
player of the week. Brown made 18 of 35 three-pointers, nine in each game. He's 
averaging 4.5 three-point field goals, which should make him No. 1 in the 
country when the NCAA rankings are released today. . . . Freshman Laura Monson 
posted lifetime bests to win the 3,000 meters and take second in the 1,500 in a 
track and field meet Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. Her time (nine minutes 
56.66 seconds) in the 3,000 was three seconds better than her previous best, 
set last week at Long Beach State when she bettered her lifetime best by 30 
seconds. . . . The Irvine athletic department has instituted a community 
outreach program that involves coaches, their staffs and student-athletes 
visiting schools and other youth groups. Coach Colleen Matsuhara and the 
women's basketball team recently participated in a practice scrimmage with two 
junior national teams.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON; CAR CRASH DOES NOT DETER UCLA'S WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan is not the only female athlete to overcome a traumatic injury 
in recent weeks and perform well in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Kristen Walls, a UCLA diver who won the Pacific 10 three-meter 
championship for the second consecutive year Thursday, then won the one-meter 
title for the third consecutive time Friday during the conference championships 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Walls was injured while driving home from diving practice in 
Pasadena. She suffered whiplash and a strained lower back when another car 
rear-ended hers, and could not practice for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to recovery was not only painful for Walls, a senior, but also 
difficult mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready (before the accident) to just glide through the year and have 
everything go well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls returned to practice one week before UCLA's Feb. 12 dual meet with USC, 
where she won the one-meter event and placed third in the three-meter board 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the accident, coupled with the pressure Walls felt to defend her titles in 
the Pac-10 meet, put her through an emotional wringer. She said UCLA Coach Tom 
Scotty helped her overcome her difficulties and gain mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt like, mentally, I was in control (after talking to Scotty) and 
it really felt good to compete and do well," Walls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at UCLA in 1989, Walls has dominated the collegiate diving 
scene. In dual meets last season, she finished first 14 times and second twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls has never won an NCAA title. Her best finish was in 1992 when she placed 
seventh on the one-meter board. This season, however, she has a good chance to 
finish among the top eight in both events at the NCAA Championships in 
Indianapolis March 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Walls, an honors student, expects to receive her degree in 
physiological science next fall and then devote her energy to training for the 
1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls qualified for the U.S. national team after finishing fourth on the 
one-meter board, which is not an Olympic event, during the U.S. indoor meet at 
Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1992. Her best national finish on the three-meter board, 
which is an Olympic event, was a third place in the U.S. outdoor meet at USC 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
 It is somewhat surprising that Walls has reached such a high level because she 
did not begin diving until she was 13, considered a late age for divers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former gymnast displayed an aptitude for diving right away, placing 
second on the one-meter board in the 1986 U.S. Junior Olympic Diving 
Championships at Orlando, Fla. -- after training for only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls attended Monte Vista High in San Diego but trained in Los Angeles on 
weekends and during the summers of her last two years in high school. This 
often meant missing out on a normal, teen-age social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved diving so much that it was worth it," Walls said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Al Scates, coach of the top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team, to 
tell it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fairly unstoppable," Scates said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. The defending NCAA champion Bruins (9-1) have made a key 
improvement, using Jeff Nygaard, a junior who started for the U.S. national 
team at middle blocker last summer, as opposite hitter this season, and he's 
hitting .438. Middle blocker Tim Kelly leads the Bruins, hitting .488. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many coaches, Scates is not afraid to voice confidence in his team. 
Asked if he thinks UCLA will continue to overwhelm opponents, Scates said: "I 
think we'll be doing that all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a statement considering the schedule the Bruins will play this week. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will face eighth-ranked San Diego State (9-5) tonight in Pauley Pavilion 
at 7:30, then play at 10th-ranked Cal State Northridge (6-4) Thursday at 7 
p.m., before returning home to take on seventh-ranked Indiana Purdue Ft. Wayne 
(7-3) Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Wooden Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest match of the season will be on March 18 when the UCLA meets 
second-ranked USC at 5 p.m. in Pauley Pavilion. That match will be televised 
live on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (10-0) remain the only undefeated men's volleyball team in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 USC led the nation in team hitting last week and is currently at .403. Eric 
Seiffert, a freshman middle blocker from Capistrano Valley High who leads the 
team at .446, was voted the American Volleyball Coaches Assn.'s player of the 
week Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 In its biggest test of the season, USC beat fifth-ranked Stanford (7-5), 
15-10, 13-15, 15-10, 15-12, Saturday at Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will play at sixth-ranked Pepperdine (5-4) tonight and at 14th-ranked 
Loyola Marymount (4-9) Friday night, both matches starting at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lion-Trojan match will pit brother against brother. Jim McLaughlin is in 
his fifth year as USC coach, and his younger brother Rick is in his second year 
as Loyola Marymount coach. It will be the second time they have faced one 
another as coaches of these teams. In their first meeting last season, USC won, 
three games to none. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked UCLA softball team (7-2), which finished third Sunday at the 
UNLV tournament, will play host to No. 11 Cal in a doubleheader Friday at 1 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven new members were inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame Saturday 
in the school's J.D. Morgan Center: basketball's Don Bragg, whose 751 rebounds 
in 1952-55 ranks him 11th on the school's list; Denise Curry, who set a 
collegiate record by scoring in double figures in each of the 130 games she 
played for the Bruins in 1978-81, and led the U.S. basketball team to a gold 
medal in the 1984 Olympics; John Richardson, defensive guard in 1963-1966, who 
went on to play seven years in the NFL; Larry Rundle, star of the Bruins' first 
national championship volleyball team in 1965; John Sciarra, quarterback in the 
Bruins' 1975 Rose Bowl victory over Ohio State; Kiki Vandeweghe, who led UCLA 
into the 1980 NCAA basketball championship game against Louisville, then played 
13 years in the NBA, and Peter Vidmar, two-time NCAA all-around champion in 
1982 and '83, who led the U.S. men's gymnastics team to the gold in 1984.

MUSIC REVIEW; L'ORCHESTRE NATIONAL: FROM PARIS WITH FINESSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, not that long ago, orchestras had faces. They didn't all 
sound more or less the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The differences had a lot to do with national proclivities of style and taste, 
not to mention uniformity of personnel, schools and techniques. Now, as the 
world shrinks, as people move and boundaries collapse, the language of music is 
becoming even more universal than we expected. 
</P>
<P>
 A Beethoven symphony in Moscow needn't be all that different, these days, from 
a Beethoven symphony in Minneapolis or Munich or Milan. And, significantly, it 
may be conducted by the same maestro in all four places. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some things change less than others. At least, some things change less 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for grateful example, the Orchestre National de France, which came into 
existence 60 years ago as L'Orchestre National de Radiodiffusion Francaise. We 
used to regard it as a typically French orchestra; that is, an orchestra more 
notable for finesse than force. 
</P>
<P>
 It never was a dazzling virtuoso instrument, and its special timbre -- 
transparent strings, nasal winds, lean brass -- wasn't always admired in the 
Germanic repertory. But, if one switched on the radio or played drop-the-needle 
guessing games, no one was likely to confuse this orchestra with the Chicago 
Symphony or the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam. When it first visited America in 
1948, the Orchestre de France played mostly French music. Now, returning for 
its ninth tour, the ensemble pays only token attention to its national origin 
in matters of repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-too-hackneyed agenda Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center began with something legitimately, delicately Gallic: Ravel's "Ma 
Mere l'Oye" suite, a.k.a. "Mother Goose." Then the focus turned to all-purpose 
sure-fire Russia, with Tchaikovsky's all-purpose sure-fire Violin Concerto 
followed by Mussorgsky's all-purpose sure-fire "Pictures at an Exhibition" (the 
latter presumably assuming a second-hand French accent through Ravel's 1922 
orchestration). 
</P>
<P>
 But -- and it is a big but -- the Orchestre National de France played 
everything on this occasion like a recognizably French orchestra. Under Charles 
Dutoit, the Lausanne native who succeeded Lorin Maazel as music-director in 
1991, the old-fashioned virtues of elegance and understatement overpowered any 
ominous threat of banality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations came at the outset. Ravel's wispy storybook evocations were 
delineated with a really idiomatic touch -- that is, with a very light touch. 
The strings shimmered sensuously. The narrative punctuation was applied with 
wit predicated on restraint. The charm was gentle, the scale always intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 A similarly modest view of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto proved 
illuminating, if somewhat startling. Dutoit and his attentive followers refused 
to wallow in the inherent emotional goo, and the bona-fide Russian soloist, 
Vladimir Spivakov, approached the heroic bravura as if it were so much chamber 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 We certainly have heard more rousing performances of the hum-along 
masterpiece, and we have heard more accurate ones. Some of the orchestral lines 
in mid-concerto got a bit tangled, and rhythmic definition turned out to be a 
bit flabby. For all his energetic hopping and climactic bobbing, Spivakov found 
the lyrical passages more congenial than the dramatic outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was rewarding to be reminded that Tchaikovsky can respond so nicely 
to a enlightened introspection. The French have always been good at deflating 
bombast. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the prevailing aesthetic circumstances, the mighty "Pictures at an 
Exhibition" emerged more like miniatures. Dutoit ignored the vast canvas to 
which we have become accustomed, for better or worse, and he refused to 
exaggerate either grotesquerie or comic nuance. At the end, the "Great Gate of 
Kiev" resembled a relatively modest doorway. Still, everything was set in its 
proper dynamic perspective, and the ultimate pealing cadences still managed to 
stimulate the usual push-button cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheers led to an encore that sustained the quasi-Russian ambience: the 
overture to Glinka's "Ruslan and Ludmila." Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The agenda originally announced for this occasion was completely different 
and more demanding, too. It would have contrasted Roussel's "Bacchus et Ariane" 
with Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps." Perhaps someone deemed it too 
forbidding for fragile Orange County sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The house program, a veritable festival of typographical and editorial 
errors, claimed that Dutoit has "been named principal guest-conductor of more 
than 150 orchestras." He must be a very busy man. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Philharmonic Society, which sponsors this stimulating 
series, has sent renewal notices for next season to its subscribers. The mailer 
lists the visiting artists and ensembles, but omits any mention of repertory. 
Perhaps someone assumed that local audiences only care about whom they hear, 
not what.

IT'S OFFICIAL: EL NINO'S DESTRUCTIVE ACT IS GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Nino -- the little kid who caused so much trouble -- is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Blamed for last year's unusually wet weather in Southern California, 
catastrophic floods in the Midwest and punishing droughts in Australia, the 
puzzling weather phenomenon named for an innocent child has finally come to an 
end, the National Weather Service says. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say that should mean a gradual return to normal weather conditions 
-- good news for the residents of Malibu who learned the hard way last month 
that unusually heavy rains on slopes stripped of vegetation during brush fires 
could mean an onslaught of destructive mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that El Nino has ended," Alan Basist, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center in Silver Springs, Md., said 
Monday. "It apparently happened in December." 
</P>
<P>
 What occurred then, he said, is that equatorial trade winds in the southern 
Pacific resumed their customary strong flow from east to west. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year -- and perhaps as long as three years -- these winds had 
been abnormally light, even flowing at times in the opposite direction, from 
west to east. Pushed by these unusual westerly winds, large bodies of warm 
water that normally circulate near Australia had drifted slowly east in what is 
called a Kelvin wave, pooling off the west coast of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 In times past, this wave was detected by the abnormally small fish catches off 
Peru, where the warm current would deprive the coastal waters of nutrients 
normally brought to the surface by cooler currents from below. Coastal 
residents called the phenomenon El Nino, naming it for the Christ child because 
the storms it spawned were first observed around Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Kelvin wave has shown up on radar sensors aboard a 
satellite monitored by NASA. Because the warm water of the Kelvin wave is less 
dense than the cooler water surrounding it, it forms a bulge about six inches 
high on the surface of the Pacific -- an altitude differential that the radar 
can detect. 
</P>
<P>
 Observations made as recently as November showed what the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration had suspected: The bulge was still 
there. Armed with this information, forecasters predicted another abnormally 
wet winter for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But December turned out to be unusually dry, as did January and February. 
Asked about this, the satellite folks checked their instruments and found out, 
sure enough: The bulge was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why El Nino shows up every so often, then disappears, usually for eight 
years or so, Basist chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of research on that, a whole lot of research," he said. "People 
aren't that sure yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a Wichita, Kan.-based 
firm that provides forecasts for The Times, said that with El Nino safely out 
of the way, it looks as though precipitation in Southern California should be 
about normal for March and April, with temperatures a little above normal. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted a high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center today of 79 
degrees.

RESTORING PATIENTS' PAPER TRAIL; HEALTH: HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL OFFICES HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO RESURRECT RECORDS DAMAGED IN THE QUAKE. CHANGEOVER TO COMPUTERS 
HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NOT COST-EFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal Miner, an administrator with Kaiser Permanente, remembers the Sylmar 
earthquake vividly, even though it was more than 20 years ago. What he cannot 
forget is that he was literally buried under an avalanche of medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working as a chart clerk in the basement," he recalled. Miner said he 
was knocked over when the quake hit, then buried under charts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Northridge earthquake, Miner, who is now in an 
administrative post where he is responsible for 300,000 patient records, once 
again has been confronted with massive piles of paper shaken loose by a 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner is part of a broader circle of medical industry record-keepers who have 
been struggling to sort out the damage to crucial paper records in the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals from Santa Monica to the Santa Clarita Valley were inundated when 
the earthquake spilled thousands of patient records from filing cabinets and 
storage shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the capabilities of electronic storage, the sight of physicians and 
others sorting through rubble for scraps of paper was in its own way as 
primeval as the post-quake impressions created by seeing quake victims eating 
at open-air fires.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the push to computerization and paperless offices elsewhere in the 
economy, hospitals and medical offices for the most part still handle patient 
records the old-fashioned way: by hand-packing them document by document into 
cardboard folders, then stuffing them into metal racks, bookcases or file 
cabinets. After a while, the older records are packed into boxes and carted off 
to a warehouse for permanent storage.  
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators and heads of medical offices say they continue the 
old-fashioned system because it works and is cost-effective. Given the 
potential for the wholesale loss of patient records, they say they came through 
the earthquake in reasonably good shape, with major damage only at a few sites. 
Water damage to the documents was widespread, but highly evolved freeze-drying 
methods allowed nearly all to be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties they faced in hanging on to their records may have been a 
warning call to move on from their traditional way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychiatrists lost crucial tapes of patient interviews, or notes they 
wrote up over years as they chronicled a patient's care. Dental records, often 
used to identify the dead, were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Spoltore, a health care specialist with Kenneth Leventhal and Co., a 
national accounting and consulting firm, said: "There are some records you just 
can't reconstruct. As a result, patients are at risk. . . . If a patient were 
to die, and it could be proved that not having access to the patient's record 
could have been critical to saving that patient's life, it could be a big 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica dentist Al Rosenblum said all his patient records were lost when 
the six-story Barrington Medical Building at Olympic Boulevard and Barrington 
Avenue was destroyed by a wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubble from the Barrington Building was taken to the dump. All that remained 
was a limited number of files that were put into several dumpsters. Dentists, 
psychiatrists and friends spent a recent weekend sorting through them looking 
for documents from their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the computer industry say technologies exist that could solve most 
of the problems caused by the quake. Many companies offer imaging systems that 
can scan a document and reproduce it inside a computer, acting like copiers. 
There are also electronic notebooks that can convert scribbled prescriptions 
and physician's notes into text that can be stored inside a computer. Companies 
also offer off-site or out-of-state computer storage systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Computers and computerized records are used in a limited way in the health 
industry. They provide the technology necessary for complex medical procedures 
and laboratory tests and are the backbone of mass billing systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, if computers can spit out bills or scan a heart, can't they also be used 
to maintain a patient's medical history? 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials universally cite cost as the biggest reason for not 
converting completely to computers. They also say that technologies are not 
developed enough to suit their medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tradition has a lot to do with it," said David Langness, a spokesman for the 
Hospital Council of Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 Many in the industry believe a possible solution lies in President Clinton's 
proposed health reform plan. Clinton wants a computerized national health 
system that will provide for permanent storage of patient records. 
</P>
<P>
 Langness said the earthquake may have been a wake-up call for the health 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is already a lot of work going on in this area," he said. "There are 
many people interested in getting hospitals into the 21st Century. Maybe what 
the earthquake has done is point up that we are going in the right direction 
but that maybe we are not going there fast enough."

PUBLIC OFFICIALS FACE LIABILITY IN POLICE CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Monday that public officials in 
nine western states -- including California -- can be sued individually when 
they vote to pay punitive damage awards for a police officer found liable for 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Los Angeles case, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3 to 0 that 
Los Angeles City Council members do not have "absolute immunity" from lawsuits 
when they decide to have taxpayers assume the officers' financial burden for 
punitive damages, as the city attorney's office had argued. The decision upheld 
a 1992 ruling by Los Angeles federal trial Judge J. Spencer Letts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who specialize in police misconduct cases and attorneys for the city 
said the ruling could have broad ramifications on police brutality suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important police brutality decision I've ever gotten because 
it has the most important consequence -- to make responsible for police 
misconduct the members of the government who have been hiding and disclaiming 
responsibility, like Councilmen Joel Wachs and Zev Yaroslavsky," said Stephen 
Yagman, who represented the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Annette Keller, who specializes in defending the Police 
Department, said she was stunned by the decision and may appeal to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said the ruling "really cuts the heart out of the California government 
code section that gives the council discretion" to pay a punitive damage award 
on behalf of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The groundbreaking decision stemmed from a case filed by Johanna Trevino, 
whose father was shot and killed by members of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Special Investigations Section after the February, 1990, robbery 
of a McDonald's in Sunland.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers watched outside as Javier Trevino and three other men robbed the 
business, the court decision noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the men left the restaurant and got into their getaway car, the police 
used their police vehicles to block the car's movement. Then the police opened 
fire. . . . One of the officers shot (Trevino) in the top of the head from a 
distance of two feet," the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three robbers were killed and one survived. The incident spawned a lawsuit on 
behalf of four family members who contended that the police used excessive 
force and fired on the robbers without provocation. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
was named as a defendant because the suit said he was ultimately responsible 
for the officers' actions and condoned the use of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-month trial in 1992, a federal jury returned a verdict in favor 
of the plaintiffs and awarded punitive damages of $44,042 against Gates and 
nine members of the special unit. Jurors said the damage award was purposely 
low because they believed that the chief and his officers should pay it out of 
their own pockets. Gates was to pay $20,505. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to pay the award on behalf of the officers, even though 
some council members expressed reservations.  
</P>
<P>
 Trevino's suit was filed by her guardian after the first verdict and the 
council's action. Yagman contended that council members showed "an established 
pattern and practice of routinely approving the payment of punitive damage 
awards against Los Angeles police officers." He said the practice encouraged 
police to use excessive force, and this led to the death of Trevino's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Keller contended that council members had absolute 
legislative immunity for their actions under a section of the California 
government code that permits governmental entities to pay punitive damages if 
three conditions are met: The public employee in question was acting in the 
scope of his or her employment; the employee acted in good faith, without 
actual malice, and payment of the judgment "would be in the best interests of 
the public entity." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 9th Circuit judges ruled that the payment of punitive damages is an 
administrative decision, not a legislative act, and not entitled to absolute 
immunity from suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said the ruling would put pressure on the City Council to settle cases. 
"It really makes it difficult for a City Council member to act objectively and 
attempt to do what's right in each case if they decide to indemnify officers."  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky agreed and said there would be other negative consequences. "It's 
open season on city councils, a bottomless pit, a Pandora's box." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hugh Manes, a police misconduct lawyer, said the decision would prompt 
government agencies to settle cases rapidly and curtail "sadistic" practices by 
police officers.

MUSEUM TO OFFER CLASSIC RADIO, TV SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York City-based Museum of Television and Radio announced plans Monday 
to open a sister museum in Beverly Hills in the fall of 1995 using digital 
recordings of its collection of more than 60,000 radio and TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's ever been a museum in two locations with exactly the 
same collection," said Robert M. Batscha, president of the museum, established 
by CBS founder William S. Paley in 1975 to collect and preserve television and 
radio programs, and to make those programs available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's Board of Trustees has hired Richard Meier, the architect of the 
$773-million Getty Center in Brentwood, to redesign a former bank building at 
469 N. Beverly Drive. The $8-million project is to include a theater, a 
broadcast studio, a computerized library, a gallery, educational facilities and 
scores of individual viewing consoles where the public can listen to and watch 
programs chosen for artistic, cultural and historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, satellite technology will enable seminars and events on one coast 
to be beamed to a theater audience at the museum on the other coast, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This will mark the first comprehensive public collection of TV and radio 
programming in Los Angeles. The North Hollywood-based Academy of Television 
Arts & Sciences maintains an archive of film and television programming with 
UCLA, but it is maintained primarily for researchers and industry 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Television and Radio begins its annual three-week Television 
Festival on Wednesday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Leo S. Bing 
Theater. There, the public can interact with the cast and creative teams of 
past and current TV programs, ranging from "Barney Miller" to "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of interest for a Los Angeles museum from the general 
public," Batscha said. "Whenever we do the festival each year, every session 
somebody says, 'When are you going to have a museum in Los Angeles like you do 
in New York?' Our L.A. board has wanted to have a museum here for a long time, 
but we wanted to first complete our facility in New York and get the building 
paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the museum moved into a lush facility on 52nd Street in Manhattan 
designed by architect Philip Johnson. The Los Angeles museum will share the 
same collection, digitally recorded on 8-millimeter videotapes and played back 
to the public by robotic machines. The New York staff of curators, researchers, 
administrators and technical support staff can largely be used to maintain both 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the board was so favorable about doing this is because 
there's a limited amount of staff duplication," said Frank A. Bennack Jr., 
chairman of the Board of Trustees for the museum. "Programs are researched and 
selected for the collection, and they have to be transferred and catalogued. We 
will not duplicate that staff in Los Angeles. The incremental cost is making 
one more copy of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual operating budget of the New York museum is $8 million, and Batscha 
expects it will only cost an additional $1 million a year to operate the Los 
Angeles museum. Both museums will be treated as a single institution run by one 
board. There are 140 staff members in New York, and there probably will be 
about 50 in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Drive building, leased from the Bank of America, is in the design 
phase. Renovations should begin this summer. So far, Bennack said he has lined 
up $4 million to transform and equip the building, and fund raising is under 
way to secure the other half of the money needed. 
</P>
<P>
 James Loper, executive director of the Television Academy of Arts & Sciences, 
said he does not consider the museum to be competition. Nor does the academy 
plan to provide easier access to its archives for the general public anytime 
soon. He explained that the UCLA archives cater to scholars and industry 
people. And the collection specializes in entire compilations of TV series, 
rather than selected episodes the way the museum does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the two crossing purposes, frankly," Loper said. "We have 
different missions."

TEACHER HELD IN THREATS TO COLLEAGUES; SCHOOLS: SUSPECT IS ARRESTED FOR SECOND 
TIME. HE WAS RELEASED EARLIER AFTER ALLEGEDLY HAVING A LOADED HANDGUN ON SOUTH 
GATE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A South Gate kindergarten teacher who police say took a loaded handgun on 
campus last week was being held Monday in lieu of $1-million bail for making 
threats against school employees, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Jett Jr., who was being held in Los Angeles County Jail, was first 
arrested Thursday when school district police were notified that he had a 
handgun in his car, parked on the grounds of Montara Street Elementary School. 
Jett posted $20,000 bail on firearm possession charges and was released 
Thursday afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rearrested Friday morning at a Los Angeles Unified School District 
office after police were told he had made threats to teachers and to the 
principal at Montara after his release. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's holding some people responsible for telling on him and he had threatened 
to do bodily harm," said Wes Mitchell, the district's police chief. "It's 
unusual -- there's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett's bail was raised from $150,000 to $1 million Friday after South Gate 
police argued to a Municipal Court commissioner that Jett, 36, posed a danger. 
A search Friday of the Torrance home where he lives with his parents turned up 
18 weapons, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that he was still a danger because of the threats," said Sgt. Martin 
VanLierop, of the South Gate Police Department. "We felt it was more beneficial 
to have him in custody than possibly posing a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Montara Principal Juliana Dawson declined to discuss the case other than to 
say that she did not believe she needed to tell parents about the arrests. The 
school district did not announce the arrests and they did not become public 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety of the children is my first concern," Dawson said. "There's no 
reason now to notify anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 School district and South Gate police say they do not know why Jett took the 
weapon to school Thursday. Dawson called school police Thursday after learning 
that the teacher had the weapon in his car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett agreed to the search that found the loaded handgun under the passenger 
seat in his car in the school lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a recent law, possession of a firearm on a school campus can be a 
felony. Jett, who is scheduled to be arraigned today in South Gate Municipal 
Court, probably will be charged with felony gun possession and making terrorist 
threats, also a possible felony. He faces a maximum of three years in prison if 
convicted of the gun possession charge and four years if found guilty of making 
the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest Thursday, Jett was told to show up for a meeting Friday 
morning at the district's administrative office in Gardena. When he arrived, 
school police were there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, who had been teaching the kindergarten class since July, has worked for 
the school district since 1986. He was a substitute from 1986 to 1993, when he 
became an intern teacher through a program at Cal State Dominguez Hills. He 
became a regular teacher last month at Montara, a year-round school with about 
1,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Chavez, director of the district's Region A office in Gardena, said she 
was told about the threats Friday morning about the time that Jett showed up. 
She agreed there was no cause to alert parents about the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my judgment, to tell parents that a teacher had a loaded gun would serve 
no purpose other than to scare them to death," Chavez said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Montara parent Mina Montejano, the school's Parent-Teacher Student Assn. 
president, said the parents should be told whenever an arrest is made -- 
particularly of a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should know we are sending our kids to a safe place," Montejano 
said.

FRAUD PROSECUTORS TO BE MOVED IN BUDGET FIGHT; GOVERNMENT: BLAMING A HIRING 
FREEZE, DIST. ATTY. GIL GARCETTI WILL TRANSFER SOME PERSONNEL TO CONCENTRATE ON 
STREET OFFENSES. BUSINESS COMMUNITY PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of his running budget battle with county officials, Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said beginning today he will transfer some prosecutors 
out of two special units -- workers' compensation and automobile insurance 
fraud -- so they can concentrate on street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county does not lift a strict hiring freeze on his office, Garcetti 
said, he will begin shutting down four other units later this month, including 
those that handle environmental and worker safety crimes, white-collar crimes 
involving more than $100,000, a unit that serves cities that don't have a city 
attorney and an appellate unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Street crime has to be the No. 1 priority," he said in an interview. "I have 
no choice but to stop prosecuting those crimes that are not as serious as 
violent crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said his decision was unavoidable because the Board of Supervisors is 
holding him to the hiring freeze. But Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed 
said the freeze was imposed because Garcetti consistently spends more than he 
is allocated, and he will get no relief until he finds ways to stay within his 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said the freeze and budget cuts have devastated his office. The only 
way he saved the jobs of scores of deputies, he said, was by putting them into 
special units, which, in many cases, are financed by the state or the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, he must bring them out of those units to fight violent crime. 
"We have no choice," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in seven months that Garcetti has threatened to stop 
prosecuting certain crimes if county officials don't meet his budget demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, after the board gave him $12 million less than he asked for in 
his budget proposal, he told community groups all over the county that he would 
stop prosecuting misdemeanors if his budget was cut along with other county 
departments. He backed off that threat, however, after business interests 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the business community raised similar protests to 
Garcetti's latest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford D. Sweet, a San Diego-based attorney who frequently represents 
insurance companies, said it would be "devastating" to the state's business 
climate to cut back workers' compensation fraud probes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has been the heart of organized workers' compensation fraud for 
years," Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. Benson, head of the special investigation unit for Zenith Insurance 
Co., one of the biggest workers' compensation insurers in California, also 
expressed dismay over Garcetti's plan, saying that the work of the fraud unit 
was a major reason for the decline in bogus workers' compensation claims over 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this mean to the person on the street that workers' compensation fraud 
is no longer an important issue? Is it open season on workers' compensation 
fraud again? If that's the case, employers in this state will be subjected to a 
lot of injustices that they've already been forced to endure before." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Schulz, a spokesman for California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 
said Garcetti's action also would deal a serious blow to the state's fight 
against auto insurance fraud. "Los Angeles is referred to as the automobile 
insurance capital of the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulz noted that $4 million of the $8.7 million distributed by the state to 
fight auto insurance fraud went to the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office. In light of Garcetti's plan to trim the unit, the insurance department 
might need to divert more of that money to other counties, but that such a 
shift "would be a shame" because "this is really where the fraud is occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to his staff last week and letters to the Board of Supervisors, 
Garcetti made it clear he is angry because the county will not let him use 
millions raised through grants and gifts to hire new employees. The federal and 
state government frequently fund special units, such as auto insurance fraud or 
child support collection.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COURT TO HEAR CHALLENGE TO USING DEPUTIES AS BAILIFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has agreed to hear a challenge to the use of deputy 
sheriffs as bailiffs in the court system, putting in jeopardy a recent move by 
Los Angeles County officials to consolidate all bailiff services with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of deputies as bailiffs had been challenged as unconstitutional by an 
association of Municipal Court judges and by a defendant in a criminal 
trial.The challengers argue that because deputies are often called as witnesses 
during trials, their use as bailiffs could prejudice a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Los Angeles-based 2nd District Court of Appeal agreed that 
the issue is "of general importance." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors voted last year to disband the marshal's office, which had 
provided bailiffs for municipal courts, in favor of the Sheriff's Department as 
a cost-cutting measure. The appellate hearing has been set for June 15.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DRUG 
CHARGES DISMISSED IN WOMAN'S 1991 CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles federal judge Monday dismissed drug charges against a woman 
convicted in 1991, upholding an appeals court's ruling that a prosecutor's 
misstatements to a jury denied her due process of law. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie was prompted by a 1993 
reversal by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which lambasted the 
prosecutor and the U.S. attorney's office for failing to properly supervise 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court gave Rafeedie the option of retrying the case or throwing 
out the charges. Rafeedie said he was bound by the appeals court's finding of 
flagrant misbehavior by Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey S. Sinek that resulted in 
substantial prejudice to defendant Chake G. Kojayan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojayan was arrested in Los Angeles in June, 1991, with $100,000 of heroin, 
according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojayan's lawyer, Ronald J. Nessim, tried to persuade jurors that because a 
key player in the drug deal, Krikor Nourian, had not testified, they could 
infer that his testimony would damage the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinek replied that jurors should make no such inference. He said that although 
Nourian had been arrested, he had a right to remain silent. That was untrue, 
the appeals court ruled.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; AIRPORT STANDS 
BY CHOICE OF CONVICTED CONCESSIONAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite objections from one of its commissioners, the Burbank Airport 
authority Monday decided not to reconsider a contract awarded to an 
Atlanta-based concessionaire convicted of felony mail fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion by Commissioner Chris Holden to review the issue was struck down by a 
5-1 vote after his colleagues concluded that federal convictions in January 
would not hinder The Paradies Shops' ability to operate four news and gift 
stores at Burbank.The authority granted the concession in December, when the 
company was under indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, who said he was never informed of the legal proceedings against the 
firm, nevertheless predicted that the company would prosper at Burbank. He said 
he was not prepared to reverse his stand in favor of the company without a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm and its owner, Daniel M. Paradies, were convicted Jan. 22 of 83 
counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy. An Atlanta jury found 
Paradies guilty for his role in a scheme to funnel more than $1 million in 
illegal payoffs to an official who later served on the Atlanta airport 
commission.

PARISHIONERS' PLEAS FOR MEETING

<P>
 Despite pleas from Latinos, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has no plans to meet with 
parishioners who are upset at a decision to turn the largely Latino St. Thomas 
Aquinas Church in Monterey Park into a center for Chinese American evangelism, 
officials of the Los Angeles archdiocese said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocesan officials defended their decision and chided the congregation for 
stirring up controversy, saying members should adjust to changes aimed at the 
common good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would seriously . . . question some of the underlying agendas at work here. 
I think it's possible there's xenophobia and bigotry," said Father Gregory 
Coiro, archdiocesan public affairs director. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Chinese American city councilman in Monterey Park charged the 
archdiocese with acting in a "high-handed and less than sensitive" manner that 
will drive a wedge between the Chinese American and Latino communities at a 
time when civic leaders are trying to unite them. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Sam Chiang said he asked the archdiocese Monday to postpone its 
plans until the community can meet to air concerns. Chiang said he was 
disappointed when auxiliary Bishop-Elect Thomas Curry, secretariat for Ethnic 
Ministry, refused such a meeting and said a Chinese-speaking pastor would be 
installed today. The archdiocese also plans to remove the only priest who 
speaks some Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang said Curry also accused him of meddling in religious affairs. But 
Chiang said the dispute is "not just a church matter. This is causing a 
community problem because you've got different ethnic groups upset at each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair to the Spanish-speaking community, but it is also unfair to the 
Chinese community, most of whom are not even Catholic," he said. "It makes the 
entire Chinese community into a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems began coalescing three weeks ago when the archdiocese unveiled plans 
to center its efforts to evangelize the San Gabriel Valley's Chinese American 
population at St. Thomas Aquinas, whose parish of 1,200 families has about 840 
Latino families and 20 Chinese American families. 
</P>
<P>
 The church plans to install three Chinese-speaking priests at the parish, open 
a Chinese language school on the premises and build a Chinese community center 
to provide outreach to potential converts. 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocese officials have assured the parish that no Spanish-language 
ministries will be curtailed and that a visiting priest will be brought in to 
say a Spanish language Mass each Sunday. But they have transferred the church's 
longtime pastor, Father Brian Cavanagh, who occasionally says Masses and gives 
sermons in Spanish, although he says he is far from fluent. 
</P>
<P>
 This has infuriated many longtime parishioners, including some Chinese 
Americans who say they plan to leave the church in protest when the new pastor 
arrives. Latinos view the changes as an indication that the church does not 
care about them. Although many of them speak English, they say they are 
traumatized by losing the one priest who, after many years of outreach, 
understood their language, culture and holy days. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners are also upset that they were not consulted about the changes. 
But church officials, who expect things to calm down once the new pastor is 
installed, say that is not their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church has never been democratic in that things are put up for a vote," 
Coiro said. "The church is a hierarchy." DENISE HAMILTON

ACTOR NICHOLSON CHARGED AFTER ATTACK ON CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson was charged Monday with misdemeanor 
vandalism and assault for allegedly smashing the windshield of a car with a 
golf club because he thought the other driver cut him off in traffic, the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Blank of Hollywood accused Nicholson of attacking Blank's 
Mercedes-Benz on Feb. 8 in North Hollywood, the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson stepped out of his car at a red light at the intersection of 
Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive and repeatedly struck the windshield and roof 
of Blank's car with a golf club, according to a statement by the city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank told investigators that he never got out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that after the attack Nicholson and a man who got out of the 
car with him returned to Nicholson's car and drove off, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, Blank, 
38, said he was hurt by flying glass from the windshield and that the attack 
made him fear for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaint filed against Nicholson, for more than 20 years a major 
box office draw, charges him with one count each of vandalism and assault, said 
Rick Schmidt of the city attorney's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 Two independent witnesses identified the weapon used in the incident as a golf 
club, and one identified the 57-year-old actor as the attacker, Schmidt said. 
One witness also remembered the license plate number of the vehicle, and the 
city attorney's office used that information to trace the car to Nicholson, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's lawyer, Santa Monica attorney Charles R. English, said he had not 
seen the complaint and could not comment. Blank's lawyer did not return several 
calls to his office.

CAST READIES FOR RETRIAL OF MENENDEZ BROTHERS ; COURTS: POTENT EMOTIONS ARE 
EVIDENT OUTSIDE HEARING AS DEFENSE LAWYER REFUSES TO SHAKE HANDS WITH JUROR WHO 
HAD VOTED FOR CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With seven TV cameras trained on her every move, Leslie Abramson arrived 
Monday morning at the Van Nuys courthouse to meet her public. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in a regal purple dress, she tossed out bon mots and good mornings to the 
TV crews -- who helped make her a national celebrity of sorts during the trial 
of Lyle and Erik Menendez. She nodded to the gaggle of groupies who would not 
dare miss a hearing involving the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the door to the fourth-floor courtroom, she saw Jude Nelson, his hand 
outstretched. She stiffened, recognizing him as one of the few jurors who had 
voted for a murder conviction in the trial of Lyle Menendez. She pulled her 
hand back. Her gaze froze straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she swept by him into the courtroom, not once acknowledging his 
existence -- a vivid reminder of the polarizing nature of the case of the 
brothers charged with murder in the 1989 shotgun slayings of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "She evidently doesn't like my point of view too much," said Nelson, 53, of 
Sylmar, who added that he was just trying to be friendly. "That's fine with me. 
I don't like hers, either." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since separate juries deadlocked four weeks ago, the cast 
of the Menendez trial was back in court Monday for a brief hearing in 
preparation for a retrial. It produced little of substance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the imagery and the potent emotions that have been the hallmark of the 
case were very much in evidence -- although there are changes in the cast of 
lawyers, with more possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, were back in court, the older 
brother wearing a familiar white sweater and the younger brother donning a 
natty matching shirt-and-tie combination. Lyle Menendez looked heavier than a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, the brothers testified that they had killed their parents, 
Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47, in fear and self-defense after years 
of sexual and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Their speaking roles Monday were limited. Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Stanley M. Weisberg, who had been due to set a new trial date, put that off 
until March 16 after Lyle Menendez and then Erik Menendez told him the 
postponement was acceptable. The brothers remain in jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 New prosecutors, who were assigned last week, reiterated Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti's vow to retry the brothers for murder and seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the horror of this crime causes many people in the community to feel 
the death penalty is appropriate," said the new lead prosecutor, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. David P. Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have asked to move the trial Downtown from the quake-damaged Van 
Nuys courthouse. Weisberg put a decision off until March 16 because it was 
unclear who the brothers' lawyers will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's chief defense attorney, made formal Monday what 
had been rumored last week: She and co-counsel Michael Burt want off the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing, who has a young daughter, said she did not want to devote herself to 
another lengthy trial. Burt, who works for the San Francisco public defender's 
office, has other courtroom commitments in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing said it was "very difficult" to decide to leave Lyle Menendez. "I had 
to choose between a client I care a great deal about and a family I love," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In line to take over Lyle Menendez's defense are two deputy public defenders: 
Bill Weiss, head deputy of the San Fernando branch of the public defender's 
office, and Terri Towery, an eight-year public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said he has not tried a case in six years -- but has extensive 
experience with death penalty trials. "I'm excited about this case," he said. 
"I'm enthusiastic about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A judge must give Lansing and Burt permission to leave the case. Superior 
Court Judge Cecil Mills, supervising judge of the county's criminal courts, 
will take up the issue at a hearing March 9, Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson has said repeatedly that she wants to reprise her leading role in the 
sequel, but that the Menendez estate, once valued at $14 million, is virtually 
depleted. To stay on, she must receive county funds and she said she wants to 
be paid "a modest rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg said Abramson can explain at the March 9 hearing why she -- and not 
the public defender's office -- should represent younger brother Erik Menendez 
at the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson said she wanted to begin a second trial in late May. But Weiss said 
he is unlikely to be ready by then, raising the notion that the brothers may be 
tried separately.

SCHOOL FARM WITHERS FROM INDIFFERENCE; EDUCATION: COSTA MESA HIGH PROGRAM LOSES 
ITS FUNDING BECAUSE FEW STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN AGRICULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marking the passage of an era, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District has 
decided to drop funding for the 20-acre farm at Costa Mesa High School next 
school year because of a lack of student interest.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess kids are not interested in farming anymore," said Jerilyn Kapus, the 
teacher who has nearly single-handedly run the farm, fed the animals and 
watered the crops. "We are an urbanized society now." 
</P>
<P>
 The farm has been a part of the Costa Mesa High campus since 1958, according 
to school board member Rod MacMillian, who can remember when the farm was 
originally located at Newport Harbor High School in the 1930s and 1940s.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when it was mostly chickens and rabbits," MacMillian said. "There 
were a lot of kids in the farm program back then. They grew crops, beans (and 
raised) chickens and rabbits." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a few head of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs can be seen from Fairview 
Avenue grazing in the field. But most of the stables and pens are empty and 
deteriorating.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the $110,000 in annual operating expenses and low student interest, 
the farm has been on the district's budgetary chopping block for the past 
several years but has managed to hold onto its funding. Two years ago, school 
officials decided that the farm could stay open through the end of this school 
year only if it was able to produce enough food and plant sales to meet about 
half of its annual expenses.  
</P>
<P>
 But during the 1992-93 school year, no money was returned to the district by 
the farm program, according to Robert Francy, director of student services. And 
this year there are only 14 students in the Introduction to Shop class, which 
emphasizes the skills of farming. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reasons, the district Board of Education last week voiced its 
intention to stop funding the farm.  
</P>
<P>
 "The prime interest in Newport-Mesa is not agriculture," said Francy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one parent or student attending the board meeting spoke in favor of 
keeping the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they can remember buying fruit and vegetables from the 
farm many years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a young staff member at Costa Mesa High School, I bought eggs and 
chickens from the farm," said Francy. "It was wonderful for my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest Werner, a school board member whose four children went to Costa Mesa 
High School, said that in the late 1960s the farm -- like the basketball court 
or the football field -- used to be "a hangout spot" for some students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They assumed the whole posture," Werner said of the agriculture students. 
"They wore bib overalls and boots and came to school dressed that way. After 
school they would go over to the farm." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, students purchased baby farm animals to be raised until the 
animals reached full size. As that happened, students would keep track of the 
time and expense of raising their animals before taking them to the county fair 
or selling them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave some kids something to attach themselves to," Werner said. "They took 
pride in the appearance of their animal. But that does not exist anymore. The 
idea of a farm and farm animals just doesn't appeal to kids anymore."

HEARING DUE MOTHER WHO SLEW CHILDREN; KILLINGS: JUDGE TO RULE IN 90 DAYS ON 
FUTURE OF LAGUNA NIGUEL WOMAN DECLARED INSANE AFTER SHOOTING TWO DAUGHTERS IN 
1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Laguna Niguel woman who was found insane after she shot and killed her two 
daughters in 1991 must remain in a state mental hospital for at least 90 days, 
a judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you'll need to stay at Patton forever," Orange County Superior 
Court Judge James A. Jackman told Kristine Marie Cushing, 41, whom he described 
as "a nice lady, an intelligent one," who requires more counseling to identify 
and treat her mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing was a Brownie troop leader and Sunday school teacher who by all 
accounts was devoted to her daughters, aged 4 and 8. She was seemingly a model 
mother -- until she used a .38-caliber handgun to shoot the girls before 
turning the gun on herself and causing a minor wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 After being found not guilty by reason of insanity in February, 1992, Cushing 
was sent to Patton State Hospital. Despite conflicting recommendations by 
doctors, she was released to an outpatient program in Ventura County last July, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Cushing became delusional and was sent back to Patton after 
authorities feared she could be a danger to herself or others. Cushing 
maintains that she is no longer delusional and is ready to begin the transition 
to normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackman ruled Monday that Cushing should remain at Patton for at least 90 more 
days, and said he will review her case in May. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the court must proceed carefully to move Cushing "back into the 
community in a productive way, because she and the community would benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Biggs said the case is a tragic one. He said the case 
underscores the difficult line the legal system must walk to ensure public 
safety while also trying to protect the rights of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a sad case all around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings shocked the community and revealed a side of Cushing that had 
been hidden from neighbors and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records revealed that Cushing was under stress because of a heart 
condition and pending divorce from her husband of 17 years, Marine Lt. Col John 
P. Cushing Jr., a Gulf War veteran and commander of an El-Toro-based fighter 
jet squadron. He was away on a fishing trip at the time of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also concerned about losing all health benefits after the divorce, and 
possibly even custody of her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her defense attorney said Cushing suffered from a "psychosis" and "living in 
another dimension," in which she believed her children faced torture and 
mutilation from a man she had imagined. She believed her children's death at 
her own hands preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Cushing called 911 and said: "I'm crazy, I shot my 
daughters, They're upstairs," and also told a nurse that she shot her 
daughters, Amy Elizabeth, 8 and Stephanie Marie, 4, because she was depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing's defense attorney expressed concern that the antidepressant drug 
Prozac might have contributed to her actions. The drug has been cited in 
numerous civil lawsuits involving murder and suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare move, prosecutors at the time agreed to accept an insanity plea from 
Cushing, saying it would be an "injustice" to send her to prison. Biggs said 
Monday that prosecutors must now ensure that Cushing remains in a state mental 
hospital until she is no longer a threat to herself or others.

INTENT IS TO RETRAIN JOBLESS DEFENSE EXPERTS; ENGINEERS: PROJECT AT CSUF WILL 
TEACH THEM HOW TO APPLY THEIR SKILLS TO ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 They are experts in defense and aerospace engineering, some working in the 
field for 25 to 30 years. One man's last job was running engine tests on DC-10s 
during the Persian Gulf War. Another worked with the Hubble Space Telescope 
just last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, they went back to college, attending an orientation at Cal State 
Fullerton for a federally funded training program they hope will give them an 
edge in the shrinking job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Project INTENT -- Integrated Environmental Training Program for Defense 
Industry Engineers, the $1.1-million program was launched by the Clinton 
Administration in October as part of its technology reinvestment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Project INTENT will retrain 90 local unemployed defense engineers, teaching 
them how to apply their skills with an environmental firm. The 33 engineers -- 
20 from Orange County -- who attended Monday's orientation have been chosen for 
the first year of the program.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today they will attend classes at Cal State Fullerton for six 
months, then take an internship with an environmental company for another six 
months. Project INTENT differs from other retraining programs, university 
officials said, because it offers on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program is successful, university officials believe it will become a 
model for the country. This is the only federally supported defense retraining 
program being run out of a university that combines classroom work with an 
internship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in defense manufacturing and aerospace industry have sensed a special loss 
of identity," program coordinator Dale Swanson, who is also a former defense 
engineer, told the participants. "Our situations are complicated by the fact 
that we're going through a weak economy . . . (Project INTENT) has the 
potential to provide you with a new beginning . . . and the opportunity to get 
back to the work forces." 
</P>
<P>
 For the out-of-work engineers, Swanson's words are the first good news they've 
heard in a long time. According to Cal State Fullerton's economists Robert 
Kleinhenz and Anil Puri, 27,000 defense-related jobs in Orange County were cut 
between 1987 and 1991. Between 11,600 and 17,500 additional defense-related 
jobs are expected to be scuttled by the end of 1995, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project INTENT cannot possibly make a dent in the statistics, but what it can 
do is retrain 90 engineers and help them secure internships in 
environmental-related companies that could result in permanent hires, Swanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 14 years in the aerospace industry, Bob Weinheimer of Costa Mesa has 
been laid off on three occasions. It's time that he and others moved on, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment is the next challenge for engineers, who are 
problem-solvers," Weinheimer said. "As engineers, we've done some things in the 
past that have hurt the environment so it's only natural that we fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although those who run Project INTENT emphasized that they make no promises 
that the displaced engineers will find permanent jobs, the participants said 
they are optimistic that the program will open doors for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect that I will find a decent, well-paying job after this," said Richard 
Stamberg, 50, of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Hamer, 47, of Buena Park, said she believes the program will achieve the 
"bottom line" -- get her a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we're here," she said. "We can make power statements about this 
field and that field, but the nitty-gritty is, we want a job."

LINCOLN CLUB SEEKS EL TORO AIRPORT BALLOT INITIATIVE; BASE CLOSURES: FACING A 
MARCH 11 DEADLINE FOR FILING, THE INFLUENTIAL GOP GROUP IS TURNING UP THE HEAT 
IN ITS CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Turning up the heat in their campaign for a commercial airport at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, leaders of the politically powerful Lincoln Club have 
prepared a ballot initiative on the issue and have urged the Board of 
Supervisors to place it on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, anticipating that the supervisors will not act quickly enough, 
leaders of the group of conservative Republicans plan to file the proposed 
"Orange County Economic Stimulus Initiative" with the county registrar of 
voters within the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial airport proponents must file the ballot initiative before March 
11 to preserve their right to gather petitions for a countywide vote on El 
Toro, if the supervisors refuse to place the measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. They 
would need 66,703 signatures by June 1 to get it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the campaign would not release a draft of the initiative, 
preferring that it be disclosed when it is filed with the registrar of voters. 
But those familiar with the proposal said Monday that it calls for an amendment 
to the county's General Plan that would designate about 2,000 acres of the 
4,700-acre Marine base for commercial aviation use. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also asks voters to allow commercial air cargo carriers to use 
El Toro on an interim basis while the Marine operations are phased out, sources 
said. The military use is scheduled to end by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Lincoln Club members -- President Doy Henley and developers George 
Argyros and Buck Johns -- met last week with Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and 
William G. Steiner and stated their preference that the supervisors place the 
initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also warned that they would meet the March 11 deadline to notify the 
registrar of voters of their intent to circulate petitions, according to some 
involved in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are of the opinion that the highest power in the whole political process 
is the voters," Johns said Monday. "We would like to take the question of 
whether or not El Toro should be a commercial airport to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 South County residents near the base strongly oppose an airport because they 
fear it will upset their quality of life, but Johns argued that an airport 
would "provide the jobs base as we go into the next century." The Lincoln Club 
includes some of the county's most influential business and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said that he wants the county counsel to review the legality of the 
proposed ballot initiative and give an opinion on the effect it would have on 
the work just begun by the county-sponsored El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be supportive of a parallel process of putting this (initiative) on 
the ballot as long as we do not abandon the work" of the planning agency, 
Steiner said. "I made it clear (to the Lincoln Club members) that's the only 
way I could support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and Steiner successfully negotiated the formation of the El Toro 
planning agency after months of failed attempts by Board Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez to reach consensus with the South County 
cities closest to the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member El Toro board is comprised of the five supervisors, three 
Irvine City Council members and one Lake Forest council member. Irvine and Lake 
Forest officials have promised to objectively consider an airport even though 
their cities are generally considered to be opposed to that option. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said a recent Lincoln Club-commissioned poll of 400 Orange County 
residents showed that "the voters have made a decision that the planning 
process is flawed." Johns argued that unless voters state their preference on 
the airport issue, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority will be swayed by 
"parochial interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said his choice would be for the county to be given enough time to 
study all development options -- including a commercial airport -- before 
letting the voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early stages of the El Toro debate, the supervisors strongly 
opposed a ballot initiative because it would appear to be an abdication of 
their power as the county's land-use authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, since disclosure of the Lincoln Club's proposal, most of 
the supervisors have indicated their willingness to hear out the arguments for 
a ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ballot measure now becoming more of a reality, Steiner predicted that 
the Board of Supervisors would proceed "cautiously, because (the initiative) is 
well-intended and it's motivated out of the economic development interests of 
the county. But we have found that it's been difficult to develop a consensus 
on El Toro, so don't expect (the ballot measure) to be an immediate quick fix." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who was recuperating from back surgery, was unavailable for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton did not respond to a request for an interview, although he said 
recently that the Lincoln Club's proposal "has some merit" but he wanted to 
review it before committing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez responded on Monday: "Not having seen it or not having had any 
discussions with anyone, I am not in a position to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was scheduled to meet today with the 
Lincoln Club members, said she had seen a draft of the initiative and had many 
questions, but shares the business community's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsibility of more than just the government. I think the people 
should have a say in this, I really do," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Defense Department official said an election on the future use of El Toro 
would be only the second time in the recent history of base closures that 
voters decided the base conversion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave McKinnon, a senior project manager with the Defense Department's Office 
of Economic Adjustment, said the first was last year in Austin, Tex., when 
voters decided to develop a commercial airport at Bergstrom Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McKinnon cautioned that it would be best if all base conversion 
options were studied before an election is held. Otherwise, he said, voters 
might base their decisions "on hype and fear and emotional things rather than 
solid analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said that while the entire 
planning process cannot be completed before November, the county would have 
preliminary information on the economic and technical viability of a commercial 
airport at El Toro. That study is being funded through a grant from the Federal 
Aviation Administration.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SILVERADO CANYON; 2 LOST BIKERS FOUND BY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two bikers who got lost on separate cycling trips Sunday afternoon spent much 
of the night together before being found by an Orange County sheriff's deputy 
early Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lost cyclers -- Mike Landers, 22, of Irvine and Jeffrey Mark Sada, 30, 
of Long Beach -- encountered each other deep in Silverado Canyon late Sunday, 
and made it to within a mile of the canyon's road Monday morning when they were 
found by the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bikers suffered cuts and bruises but neither required medical treatment, 
said officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Landers, a student on academic hiatus who now works for the city of Irvine, 
had taken a solo bike trip into the canyon Sunday afternoon when he got lost, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, Sada left a group of friends with whom he was biking, 
telling them he wanted to reach the peak of Maple Springs Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 When he didn't return to the rendezvous spot later that afternoon, his friends 
called for help. Soon bloodhounds, helicopters and patrol cars were combing the 
Silverado and Modjeska canyon areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside police, the California Highway Patrol and the Forestry Service were 
also on alert, said Sgt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
No one had reported Landers missing. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1 a.m., searchers had not found Sada and most gave up the search for the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sada, carrying his mountain bike, which had gotten two flat tires, 
had encountered Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy found the pair about 3:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sada met up with his wife at the Silverado fire station shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Landers got home at about 4:30 a.m, according to his mother, Sandy Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's OK," she said, adding that her son wasn't upset about having gotten lost 
but was glad to have been able to provide comfort and support to Sada. ELAINE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY FOR CITY WORKER RETIREMENT TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A residents group is working to abolish a special tax that costs property 
owners about $6.3 million a year to pay retirement benefits of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees now pay nothing toward their retirement benefits. Instead, the 
city pays 14% of each employee's salary amount into the retirement fund, and 
much of that money comes from the special property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are outraged about the extravagant retirement benefits paid entirely by 
taxpayers," said Jim L. Banks, 41, an attorney who is heading the petition 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "While people are losing their jobs or having their pay and benefits severely 
cut, there have been no pay or benefit cuts for Huntington Beach city 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition by Citizens Against Retirement Tax, which consists of about 20 
residents, would require most employees to pay 7% of their current pay for 
retirement benefits, with the city contributing 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, firefighters and lifeguards would pay 9% of their salaries, with the 
city paying 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks two weeks ago asked the City Council to vote to put the retirement tax 
on the ballot. They have not responded, Banks said, but Councilman David 
Sullivan said he is studying the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, of course, greatly concerned that Huntington Beach is the only city in 
Orange County that has a retirement tax," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate for the tax is about $50 per $100,000 assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Bob Franz said Huntington Beach is one of 43 cities 
in California with the retirement tax. But Huntington Beach has no property 
taxes for sewers, lighting, landscaping and libraries, which some cities have, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz said that until the 1970s, employees paid half of their retirement 
costs. But one year the city agreed to pay full retirement costs if employees 
would forgo a pay raise that year. The arrangement has continued ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees have treated it "as a God-given right and refused to settle 
contracts for anything less," Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and other volunteers are attempting to collect about 16,000 signatures 
to force a citywide vote on the retirement tax in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to people living in Huntington Beach 20 to 30 years, and 99% of 
them don't know about it," Banks said. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; VICTIM IN FATAL STABBING IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Monday identified a man stabbed to death in his apartment Sunday as 
Nghia To Phan, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Paul Koudssi, 27, who was arrested after reportedly fleeing Phan's 
apartment, will be arraigned today in Municipal Court in Westminster, 
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Charles Poe said.Koudssi will be charged with 
murder and possibly breaking and entering, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responding to a 9:34 a.m. call of an attempted break-in at the Woodlake 
Apartments, 6100 Edinger St., found Phan lying face down in his ground-floor 
apartment, where he lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Koudssi allegedly fled through a window as police entered Phan's apartment. 
Koudssi was later apprehended at an apartment complex around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said investigators are still seeking a motive for the killing, but believe 
Koudssi and Phan may have known each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Koudssi is being held without bond at Huntington Beach Jail.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY TO CONSIDER MOBILE HOME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A request for $97,500 from mobile home owners looking to buy the lease on 
their trailer park will be considered by the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have had a month to consider the latest proposal from Kimberly 
Gardens Mobile Home Park residents, who say the money would cover initial costs 
for procuring a $6-million property loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had been surprised by the request, made Feb. 1, because Kimberly 
Gardens residents had previously asked the council to be co-signers on the loan 
to purchase the park lease. 
</P>
<P>
 However, representatives of the mobile home group said the new proposal would 
be a lighter financial load on the city. Instead of guaranteeing a $6-million 
loan, the city would put out $97,000, much of it refundable, according to group 
spokesman David Mounier. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding would pay for loan processing costs such as land assessment, 
engineering and escrow fees, Mounier said. Some of these costs are refundable, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens residents want to purchase a 30-year lease on the property. 
Their long-range goal is to buy the park outright for about $8 million after 
first paying $6 million for the long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home owners say that excessive space rent increases gave them the 
incentive to pursue acquiring the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens is one of four mobile home parks in the city that is pushing 
for rent control in Lake Forest. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SYMPHONY'S RETURN IS GLAD EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced to the sidelines for a year and unable to perform because of mounting 
debts, the Orange County Symphony of Garden Grove made an upbeat return last 
week, performing in a free Children's Concert at Don Wash Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 children attended the program, sang with the orchestra and gave a 
standing ovation to two young classmates who were featured violinists in a Bach 
concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the performance possible, nearly 50 musicians played without pay. 
Guest conductor David Warble also donated his services. Radio and television 
personality Rich Capparela narrated "Peter and the Wolf" without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 And members of the group's board of directors used their own money to help pay 
some outstanding debts after the City Council earlier this year refused, on a 
3-2 vote, to give money for performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate grants totaling $13,000 from Target and Pacific Bell also helped 
make the Children's Concert possible by paying back wages owed to musicians for 
previous performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is incredibly important, especially to youngsters in a fast-moving 
society filled with great stress," said Martha Alves, president of the board of 
directors. "It gives you joy and raises your spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Alves, a former music teacher and supervisor in the Garden Grove Unified 
School District, said she hopes to use the children's performance as a catalyst 
for more citywide concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to ask the council this month for money to put on a summer concert 
in one of the vacant city theaters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much is spent on ugliness and violence and crime," she said. "For a 
wholesome community, there should be activities that focus on the beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Hain, one of four symphony directors, said debts at one time piled up to 
about $140,000 but have been cut to about $15,000 by grants and donations. Some 
loans were forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 Hain termed the Children's Concert a rebirth that will give impetus for more 
concerts because it establishes credibility and increases chances for grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Two musical luminaries for the program were Garden Grove pupils Howard 
Konishi, 12, and Lougene Meers, 11, who were featured performers in Johann 
Sebastian Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they each have played violin for only about 2 1/2 years, they dazzled 
the audience and orchestra members and received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty fun to play the violin," Howard said before the performance. 
"It's a challenge to see how good you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Alves said the organization still needs financial help and that no donation is 
too small. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization rents a building from the city for $1 a year and uses it for 
an office. It has no telephone because it has been unable to pay off previous 
bills. Recently, thieves forced open a rear window and stole the group's only 
computer and typewriter, Alves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alves said the Orange County Symphony of Garden Grove can be contacted at P.O. 
Box 1810A, Garden Grove 92642.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SADDLEBACK STUDENTS GET EPA RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Saddleback High School have received a commendation from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency for their continuing efforts to promote 
community awareness of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, members of the school's Students for Social Responsibility club 
received a plaque that recognized their activities in 1993 to educate the 
community about the dangers of common household items. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11 student groups in California, Arizona and Hawaii were chosen for 
recognition, said Santa Ana Unified School District spokeswoman Rosemary 
Gladden. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, the youngsters set up informational displays during 
Earth Week and handed out pamphlets offering environmentally safe alternatives, 
such as baking soda and lime juice, to common household detergents and 
cleansers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladden also said the students performed skits about the proper disposal of 
motor oil and encouraged classmates and parents to purchase only items whose 
packaging uses a minimum of plastic and paper wrapping. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SENIORS CLASS WRITES FROM EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara French's creative writing class sat attentively as she picked up two 
tulips and asked the students to contemplate the petals, stems and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you describe them?" French asked, slowly turning the flowers so all 
their sides were visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind the dictionaries, thesauruses and copies of "Writers Market" on 
their desks, the students stared intently, framing the words. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if you've been looking at flowers for only 55 years or so, maybe 
there is something you missed. 
</P>
<P>
 For three hours every Wednesday afternoon, about 25 senior citizens of ages 55 
to 91 go the West Anaheim Senior Center for French's creative-writing class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the North Orange County Community College District, the class 
allows seniors to hone their skills and write their life stories, and in some 
cases helps them fulfill a lifelong dream of being published. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides flowers, French uses sleigh bells, toy clowns, teddy bears, antique 
spoons, even a bag of hats to inspire creative thoughts in her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many seniors are young and vital," said French, an Anaheim resident who has 
been teaching the class for 18 months. "They have a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 French, a writer and retired radio actress, began listing renowned authors who 
weren't published until their later years. 
</P>
<P>
 "P.M. Roget didn't publish his thesaurus until he was 75, and then he spent 
the next 10 years revising it," French said. "Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't write 
'Little House on the Prairie' until she was 65. Many people just aren't aware 
of what senior writers can do." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday, French gave a quick lecture on plot development -- 
probably the biggest weakness of most aspiring fiction writers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then time for the students to read something they had written. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I come for," said Dave Baughman, 71, a retired mechanical 
designer from Placentia and an aspiring children's author. "We get an 
interesting variety of people, and I enjoy listening to their stories. We had 
one man who had been a miner in Alaska, and I could have listened to his 
stories all day." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Yorba Linda resident Florence Bush, 91, read an essay she wrote 
in 1920 as a 17-year-old newlywed who was about to leave her New Jersey home 
for the Southern residence of her soldier husband. She spoke of how youth is 
blessed with the "bubble of ignorance" -- anything and everything is possible 
and fear is remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa resident A Stephens Lowrie, 77, read a humorous tale about her 
childhood when "on matters sexual, I must have been the dumbest kid in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The retired social worker recalled that when she was 9, her mother joked to a 
pregnant friend they encountered: "What did you do? Swallow a watermelon seed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Aha! thought I," Lowrie read. "So that's how it happens." 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL TO AIR PLAN FOR BUS BENCH BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weeks after the city threatened to ban privately owned bus benches, the City 
Council tonight will consider a plan that will allow one bench company to keep 
its seats on city sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, bench companies would submit bids for the right to keep 
their advertising-laden seats in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that agreed to pay the city the most money and keep its benches 
the cleanest would be allowed to stay put. Companies not chosen would have to 
remove their benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bench companies currently operate in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Works Department has complained that many of the benches are 
unlicensed, broken and covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlan Renfro, president of Coast United Advertising, which owns 92% of the 
benches in the city, said he is willing to go along with the proposal only 
because he does not want to see benches banned entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city had been saying, 'Let's get rid of everything,' but now they have 
moved to a more systematic approach," Renfro said. "As a businessman, I would 
rather take my chances with the bidding process" than see benches banned 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the companies pay the city a minimum annual fee of $6 per bench. 
They charge advertisers $360 to $600 a year per bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works officials originally estimated that there were about 2,000 
benches on city sidewalks -- 497 licensed and about 1,500 unlicensed. But an 
actual count done by the city in recent weeks shows there are 556 benches -- 
497 licensed and 59 unlicensed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city says 64 of the benches have been vandalized by graffiti, 18 are at 
sites where there is no bus stop and about 300 contain no advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's original plan, privately owned bus benches would have been 
banned within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have been replaced by 500 advertising-free, city-owned benches that 
would have been donated by Gannett Co. Inc., which owns the city's 120 bus 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannett sells advertising on the shelters for $3,600 to $6,000 a year. It pays 
the city a minimum annual fee of $768 per shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan being considered by the council, Gannett would still have its 
bus-shelter advertising kiosks but would not provide the advertising-free 
benches. 
</P>
<P>
 The bench companies and some council members said that eliminating the 
privately owned benches would allow Gannett to monopolize curbside advertising 
within the city, and the council ordered city officials to re-examine the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannett said it was not trying to eliminate its competition but was simply 
reacting to a request by the city to donate the benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will start at 5 at City Hall, 200 S. Anaheim Blvd. TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY STAYS NEUTRAL ON COMPOSTING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to remain neutral on a bill in the state 
Legislature that would give the Irvine Ranch Water District the right to 
operate a green-waste composting facility in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said taking a position on SB 1191 might indicate that the city 
supports the construction of a composting facility before a site was selected 
or an environmental review was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision comes after months of talks between the city and the 
water district. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the bill would have amended the California Water District Act to 
allow the IRWD to operate both a composting plant and a waste water recycling 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials raised concerns about the waste water project, saying it 
could pose environmental risks if built on IRWD property near the San Joaquin 
Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to these concerns, the IRWD decided recently to drop mention of a 
recycling facility from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill is approved, the composting facility would be required to go 
through the city's planning process and get approval from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The composting plant would recycle "green waste" such as grass, leaves and 
branches.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GRAFFITI VANDALISM DOWN, REPORTS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will be presented today with reports from agencies 
throughout the county indicating that costly graffiti vandalism is on the 
decrease in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers, I think, confirmed that the many different plans put into effect 
are bearing good fruit," said county graffiti abatement coordinator Chaz 
Ferguson. "But they also confirmed that we're not out of the woods yet. There's 
a lot of work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The package of data -- which includes statistics, reports and surveys -- shows 
a generally downward trend in the year-old battle against tagging, the fad that 
exploded in popularity in late 1992 and early 1993 and costs local agencies 
more than $4 million to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of the results: 
</P>
<P>
 * The most dramatic numbers came from the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, which reports a 68% decline in graffiti incidents on buses from 
February, 1993, through January, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a survey of police agencies countywide, 11 noted a decrease in graffiti, 
while three said the vandalism was on the rise. Seven observed no change or 
mixed results, while one agency reported it had no records to support any 
conclusion. The report did not specify which agencies made which responses. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county Environmental Management Agency reports that cleanup efforts have 
been broadened and accelerated. The backlog of graffiti in July, 1993, was 
about 327,000 square feet, a total that shrunk to 133,000 square feet by 
January, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 EMA officials said they hope to have a 24- to 48-hour response time for 
cleanup crews when the backlog has been wiped out. "The program has clearly 
been a success to date," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 * District attorney's office statistics showed that last April was the busiest 
month for graffiti prosecutions, with 232 cases filed, reflecting the surge in 
tagging at the beginning of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of cases has fluctuated since that peak, but in six of nine monthly 
reports, the totals have gone down from the previous month. A jump in cases in 
January is attributed to a slight increase in tagging activities that officials 
attribute to the new school year reuniting tagging crew members with their 
cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the period from March, 1993, through January, 1994, prosecutors filed 
1,237 graffiti cases, only 67 requiring a trial, the rest ending in guilty 
pleas. Of those that went to trial, 75% ended with a guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the numbers that will be presented to the supervisors are hardly 
scientific, Ferguson conceded, but rather are based on impressions and 
anecdotes of assorted agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, they are evidence that taggers are being deterred by 
stepped-up enforcement efforts, tougher penalties and quicker cleanup 
campaigns.GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA LA HABRA; TEST TOO SUBJECTIVE, BOARD MEMBERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Habra City School Board members last week criticized the new statewide 
performance assessment test, CLAS (California Learning Assessment System), 
calling it too subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Nancy S. Zinberg said the test asks for thoughts and ideas 
rather than posing direct questions that can be answered with one correct 
response. The CLAS test is "grossly unfair," she said. "I really object to 
participating in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zinberg added that teachers need years to prepare their students in order to 
know how to take the time-consuming test. "I think (CLAS) is outrageous," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Antonio Valle Jr. directed district employees to find out what 
other districts think about CLAS and "take a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test, board members agreed, is too different from the traditional CAP 
(California Assessment Program) test, which was last administered in 1990. Both 
tests are part of statewide testing programs run by the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The CAP test was electronically scored, while the CLAS test asks students to 
work out problems either individually or in groups and provide most answers in 
essays. It is scored by individual graders. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test was administered for the first time last year to fourth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders, and results are expected to be released in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 It encourages group work, critical thinking, problem-solving and 
decision-making and places a high priority on writing, said Julie Chan, the 
county Department of Education's English-language arts coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no objection to getting children to think and to write," Zinberg said. 
"But I think (the CLAS test scoring procedure) is so subjective." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said the CLAS test is not "purely subjective" because one or two trained 
teachers will score each test. 
</P>
<P>
 And the results, Chan said, will help teachers teach more effectively because 
their students' scores will reflect what they know and what they need to work 
on. Districts are given scores by school and grade, not for each student. 
</P>
<P>
 The results can be used to compare the effectiveness of teaching across the 
state, and between districts and particular schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound," Chan 
said. "By the same token, we know the standards set for this test are high and, 
given time, students will be working at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, school districts throughout the county are concerned that the 
first CLAS test scores will be so low that people will blame public education. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting earlier this month, trustees of the Brea-Olinda Unified School 
District said they agreed with the concept but raised questions about the 
test's objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a disaster," board member Frank Davies said. "It's really 
rotten. I'm amazed that the state has done this." 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Todd Spitzer said students will benefit from the new test. "I 
don't care whether or not the scores are high," he said. "The good thing about 
(CLAS) is that you can't teach the right answer."MIMI KO

FUND SHIFT TO SANTA ANA FREEWAY GETS OK; TRANSPORTATION: OCTA ALSO AGREES TO 
LOAN MONEY TOWARD SANTA ANA RIVER VIADUCT EXPRESSWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation officials agreed Monday to divert Measure M funds to the ailing 
Santa Ana Freeway widening effort and loan one of billionaire Ross Perot's 
firms $12.5 million for a proposed expressway-on-stilts project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a projected $3-billion shortfall in state transportation funding, 
the transfer of more than $200 million in Measure M funds from Riverside and 
Costa Mesa freeway improvements to the Santa Ana Freeway widening effort was 
the most pressing issue for members of the Orange County Transportation 
Authority Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure M is the half-cent sales tax for traffic improvements approved by 
Orange County voters in 1990. Expected to raise more than $3 billion over 20 
years, the measure earmarked money for specific projects. While savings 
experienced on some freeway improvements have been redistributed, never before 
has OCTA taken money away from one pending Measure M project in order to save 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's budget woes, due in part to recession-related reductions in tax 
revenue, are expected to cut future state allocations to the $1.6-billion Santa 
Ana Freeway project. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, OCTA is trying to swap use of Measure M dollars on the Santa Ana 
Freeway now for future state highway funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: a delay of two to four years, or until future state money shows 
up, in projects on the Riverside and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody opposed the swap during OCTA's board meeting Monday. Now the OCTA staff 
will draw up an amendment to Measure M to accomplish the transfer. To take 
effect, the amendment must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Measure 
M Citizens' Oversight Committee and the OCTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 A provision of Measure M created the oversight panel to ensure that revenue is 
spent in accordance with the plan approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides freeway improvements, Measure M earmarked $340 million for an urban 
rail line that would have stations spaced more closely together than 
intercounty, Metrolink commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 In another high-profile action, the OCTA board tentatively agreed to loan 
$12.5 million to Perot's National Transportation Authority firm. The money will 
be used for environmental and engineering work on Perot's proposed Santa Ana 
River Viaduct Expressway, a private toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed expressway-on-stilts would follow the center of the Santa Ana 
River from the Orange Freeway near Anaheim Stadium to the San Diego Freeway, 
then continue on a deck above the San Diego Freeway to the Corona del Mar 
Freeway near John Wayne Airport. The project has been delayed for several years 
because of Perot's inability to raise the necessary construction capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some OCTA officials see the potential for using revenue from Perot's proposed 
toll road to help pay future rail costs. But a financial link between the two 
projects is only conceptual, OCTA officials cautioned. It has never been 
pursued in discussions with Perot's company. 
</P>
<P>
 What needs further negotiating immediately, warned County Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, a member of the OCTA board, is the proposed $12.5-million loan to the 
Perot firm. Stanton worried that a staff report was contradictory in stating 
the money would be repaid with interest while hinting it may never come back to 
OCTA at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton also questioned the timing of the loan, citing failure of Perot's NTA 
firm to reach agreements with the county so far on rights of way and other 
issues, even though the state awarded the company an exclusive franchise for 
the toll road more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton joined in the board's unanimous vote to move forward, but only after 
receiving assurances from staffers that a final loan contract will be submitted 
to the OCTA board for final approval in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board also received an already publicized recommendation from the 
agency's staff to include a 28-mile, Fullerton-Irvine rail route while 
soliciting public comments at a March 14 public hearing. A public opinion 
survey is also in the works. Survey results will be released prior to the OCTA 
board's final route selection April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA board member Gary L. Hausdorfer, a San Juan Capistrano councilman, said 
he supports the proposed rail line but believes not all the evidence needed to 
make a final decision is in. He wants more evidence of both the public's 
support for rail and of future revenue sources needed to pay the $2-billion 
construction bill as well as rail's future operating costs.

DELTA PLAN CALLED A THREAT TO SOUTHLAND'S WATER; RESOURCES: EXPORT RESTRICTIONS 
WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR ORANGE COUNTY, EPA AND WILDLIFE OFFICIALS ARE TOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California mayors, business leaders and water officials said Monday 
that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's plan to restore the vital 
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta threatens water shortages and economic 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly told EPA and U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials who held 
a hearing in Irvine, "The export restrictions on Delta water that you are 
proposing are tantamount to permanent water shortages to us in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is home to the California Angels baseball team, the Rams football 
team and the Ducks hockey team -- all of which provide revenue for the city and 
Orange County that could be jeopardized by severe water shortages, he 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already suffered economic disasters in the past year, such as 
firestorms, earthquakes and floods," Daly said. "This will be another 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA must tentatively decide by April 6 how to divvy up water from the 
Delta, an environmentally delicate system of sloughs and islands that is a key 
link in the state's water distribution system and a vital nursery for fish and 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reduce the excessive salt levels in the Delta by keeping enough 
fresh water there to restore the populations of spawning fish and wildlife to 
levels of two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new water quality standards call for listing the Sacramento 
splittail on the endangered list. The EPA's plan also declares that the 
winter-run chinook salmon on the Sacramento River have declined from threatened 
status to endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the traditional controversy centers on how much fresh water is needed to 
preserve the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirsty Southern California has demanded its share of the water while Northern 
California environmentalists and other groups fear that too much water is being 
diverted to Central Valley agriculture and the growing south, thus threatening 
the fragile Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has held hearings in San Francisco, Sacramento and Fresno, but in 
holding the final hearing in Irvine on Monday, the federal agency heard from 
representatives and leaders of the richest, most populous and water-needy areas 
of the state.  
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has criticized the Clinton Administration for proposing 
protections of the Delta area, but also directed state officials to collaborate 
with federal authorities on a final regulatory plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, 1.7 million residents are served by the Municipal Water 
District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County imports more than half its water supply and even without any 
further growth we'll always have a need for a reliable source of water," said 
Robert J. Huntley, president of the MWD of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that federal regulations have undermined the reliability of future 
water supplies to the point where the next endangered species may be the 
"Orange County resident and business owner." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said the county had taken steps to 
restrict its water use during the six-year drought. However, the supervisor 
admonished the federal government for "inflexible regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Wodraska, general manager of the vast Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, said "at stake" in any Delta plan "is preserving our 
drinking water" for MWD's 16 million customers from Ventura to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care about the environment in Northern California," Wodraska said, "and I 
think that represents a change from our historic, North-South battles." 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, state officials have struggled with the problem of restoring the 
Delta, which stretches from San Francisco Bay nearly to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state refused to act and the federal government, facing a lawsuit by 
16 environmental groups, stepped in last year to propose water quality 
standards that would change the allocation for growers, cities and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the proposed federal standards, the state would need to restore to the 
Bay-Delta estuary an average of 540,000 acre feet of water per year, which is a 
significant portion of the amount used by Southern California cities, Central 
Valley farmers and some Bay Area residents.

 Chapman University notified 12 employees Monday that their jobs will be 
eliminated in the first layoffs there in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will save more than $500,000 in the fiscal year starting June 1, 
President James L. Doti said Monday.All 12 jobs are administrative or staff 
positions; no teachers will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings from the cuts will allow the university to spend more money for 
its library and to double its repair and maintenance budget, which includes 
projects to make campus buildings more accessible to the handicapped, Doti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs address future needs rather than any present budget crisis, Doti 
said. The 2,900-student campus is actually expecting a budget surplus this 
year, and enrollment has increased 32% in the last two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about future years and trying to run as efficiently as 
possible," Doti said. "I would rather do this now in a position of strength, 
rather than a position of weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the decision to eliminate the positions was difficult, Doti said. 
Announcement of the cuts will made to the larger campus community today.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something we're used to doing," Doti said. "It's not easy. But 
sometimes you have to make tough decisions for the long-run health and 
viability of the institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The positions being eliminated include senior directors and secretaries and 
are spread throughout the university, Doti said. The university, with an annual 
budget of about $60 million, includes about 470 full-time faculty, staff and 
administrative positions.

MURDERER CALLED 'PREDATOR AND BOTTOM FEEDER'; SENTENCING: PROSECUTOR TELLS JURY 
THE CONVICTED KILLER OF A FOUNTAIN VALLEY WOMAN DESERVES TO BE EXECUTED. 
</P>

<P>
 A convicted murderer with a long history of violence and sexual assaults was 
described by a prosecutor Monday as a "predator and bottom feeder" who deserves 
to die for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy DePriest, 33, who is already serving a life sentence in another state, 
showed little emotion during closing arguments in Orange County Superior Court. 
Jurors must recommend whether he should serve a life sentence or be put to 
death for the December, 1989, robbery, attempted rape and murder of a Fountain 
Valley mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Lewis W. Clapp asked jurors to spare the life of his 
client, who suffered an abusive upbringing, mental problems and personality 
disorders. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told jurors that 
DePriest never showed his victims any mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Thi Nguyen, 26, who worked as a seamstress at a Garden Grove bridal shop, 
was "beaten like a rag doll" before DePriest shot her in the head and dumped 
her naked body alongside a trash bin behind a pharmacy, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest was convicted of those crimes on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans told jurors that Nguyen risked her life to escape Communist rule in 
Vietnam and worked hard to seek a better life for her family, only to fall 
victim to senseless crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a predator and bottom feeder," Evans said, telling jurors that DePriest 
has "earned" the death penalty. "He enjoys the crimes that he does, he does it 
over and over for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 During his closing argument, Clapp criticized Evans' descriptions of DePriest 
as unfair name calling used to dehumanize DePriest so jurors could more easily 
condemn him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clapp asked jurors to look into their "hearts of hearts" while recalling 
DePriest's abusive upbringing and psychiatric reports about his mental defects, 
as well as the defendant's mother, who abandoned her son as a youngster and 
later used drugs with him as he became older. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choice belongs to you," Clapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Nguyen's murder, DePriest was on parole in California for an 
earlier rape. He stole Nguyen's car after killing her, skipped parole and went 
to Missouri. There, DePriest sexually assaulted a woman and shot and wounded a 
police officer who tried to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced in Missouri to life in prison plus 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While jurors will make a sentencing recommendation, the final decision will be 
made by Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 If DePriest is sentenced to life in prison, it is unclear in which state he 
would serve his sentence first. If sentenced to death, DePriest will join other 
inmates on death row in California.

Jim Carrey family farce beat out another Warner Bros. release, the Steven 
Seagal action film "On Deadly Ground," which had been in first a weekend

FEMA OPENS 3 SERVICE CENTERS; AFTERMATH: AGENCY CLOSES 6 DISASTER RELIEF 
FACILITIES AS IT SHIFTS FOCUS FROM REGISTERING QUAKE VICTIMS TO PROCESSING 
APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As earthquake relief efforts shift from registering victims to processing 
applications, officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency Monday 
closed six more disaster relief centers and replaced them with three new 
Earthquake Service Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of people who received temporary rental-assistance 
certificates following the Northridge quake -- but have not yet found new 
housing -- face losing those vouchers if their original apartments have been 
repaired and are now habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal Housing and Urban Development officials, 17,622 housing 
certificates had been issued as of Monday morning. Of those, only 3,792 have 
contracts approved, with another 4,757 awaiting approval. That means that 9,073 
certificates, more than half those issued, are in the hands of people who have 
yet to find new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials do not know how many of those outstanding certificates are held 
by people whose homes may now be habitable, but in Santa Monica about 400 
certificates have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, which initially reported giving preliminary approval for use of 
1,220 certificates, now says about 400 recipients either have not appeared for 
follow-up interviews or were tenants in buildings that have been declared 
habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone with a certificate has not yet made a commitment for a new unit 
and their old building is now green-tagged, their certificate will likely be 
canceled," said Steve Wagner, Section 8 coordinator for Santa Monica's Housing 
Authority. "We are trying to help people, but we want to make sure we spend 
taxpayers' money properly." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wagner noted that Santa Monica may be unusual because many people may 
prefer to give up certificates to return to their old buildings to remain in 
Santa Monica, which because of rent control affords many people low-cost 
housing near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said that he expects about 100 of 725 people with certificates to find 
housing in Santa Monica due to the lack of rental units. The others will have 
to seek apartments outside the city. He said he also expects about 100 more 
certificates to be canceled, both because the holders do not complete follow-up 
procedures or because their original housing will become habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials are gradually closing Disaster Assistance Centers as the number 
of people registering for help continues to dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, FEMA closed assistance centers in Winnetka, Northridge, Pacoima, San 
Fernando, Sylmar and Fillmore. Monday afternoon, FEMA opened service centers at 
20525 Nordhoff St. in Chatsworth, 13750 Foothill Blvd. in Sylmar and 1058 
Ventura St. in Fillmore. On Feb. 19, FEMA opened its first two service centers 
in Valencia and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency plans to open service centers on Wednesday at Cal State Northridge 
and in Simi Valley. Additional centers are planned for Sherman Oaks, Reseda/Van 
Nuys, South-Central Los Angeles and Mid-Wilshire. They are expected to open 
within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers, which will be open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., 
will continue to register applicants for disaster assistance and provide 
follow-up services to those who already have registered at an assistance center 
or by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually all of the assistance centers will be closed and their functions 
moved to earthquake service centers, which provide long-term disaster recovery 
aid and information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday morning, 392,992 people had registered by phone or in person at 
one of the one-stop centers that allow quake victims to fill out applications 
with various federal, state and local agencies. Nearly $455 million has been 
awarded in grants and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 291,000 people have applied for emergency housing assistance, but as 
of Monday only 124,848 had been found eligible. Grants totaling more than $297 
million have been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration, which provides low-interest loans to 
homeowners and businesses, has sent out 225,456 applications to homeowners. 
More than 51,000 have been returned, with 4,786 of those approved for loans 
totaling more than $141 million. More than 73,000 applications have been sent 
to business owners and 8,668 returned. SBA has approved 326 applications and 
disbursed nearly $16 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 124,000 people have been referred to the Individual and Family Grant 
Program, a last-resort agency for victims who do not qualify for other 
assistance. Because it deals with victims who must exhaust other assistance, 
the program has only begun processing 19,936 applications and had approved only 
2,042 as of Monday morning. That represents a commitment of more than $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Shawn Ortiz, deputy administrator for southern operations for the IFGP, 
said it may be a year before all applications are processed. 
</P>
<P>
 "IFGP was never designed as an immediate-needs program," Ortiz said. "We beg 
the people to grant us some patience." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the American Red Cross moved its "Super" service 
center from the parking lot of the Northridge Fashion Center to the Winnetka 
Recreation Center, utilizing the space vacated by FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross -- which is helping victims replace personal property such as 
occupational tools, clothing and furniture -- has processed 29,432 cases and 
awarded vouchers worth $14.3 million. The Red Cross expects its total quake 
relief effort, including shelters, to exceed $36 million.

MAYOR'S PANEL ADVISES KEEPING WINTER WATER RATES; UTILITIES: COMMITTEE VOTES TO 
EXTEND CONTROVERSIAL LOWER PRICE STRUCTURE, WHICH COULD BE A BOON FOR VALLEY 
HOMEOWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By and JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A blue-ribbon panel has recommended that the city not re-implement a 
controversial water-rate system that sparked complaints by San Fernando Valley 
homeowners who last summer were hit with unexpectedly large water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee on Water Rates voted last week to 
keep in place a lower winter-rates structure through the summer, or at least 
until a more equitable rate system can be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although keeping the lower winter rates in place could mean up to $3 million 
in lost revenue for the city's Department of Water and Power, Mayor Richard 
Riordan apparently supports his panel's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be a cost to this but it's an interim measure designed to 
balance the needs of fairness and conservation," said spokesman David Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan reconvened the advisory committee in September following a slew of 
complaints from Valley homeowners, whose bimonthly summer DWP bills ranged as 
high as $500 to $900. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jerry Gewe, the DWP's liaison to the committee, said the panel is 
proposing the extension of winter rates because it missed its self-imposed 
February deadline to draft a new rate system. He said the committee now plans 
to propose a new rate system by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the panel is looking for a long-term solution that will create 
more equity and still further our conservation message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gewe said the recommendation approved by the panel Thursday actually will 
reduce DWP revenues by about $7 million this year. But the utility will only 
suffer a $3-million shortfall because it has nearly $4 million in surplus 
revenue from fees collected last year, after the new rate system was adopted, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rate system adopted in November, 1992, and enacted in January, 1993, 
the highest summer rates were 28% higher than the highest winter rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate system had two tiers for residential users: a high rate for customers 
who used more than twice the median amount of water and a lower rate for 
smaller users. That two-tier system was supposed to encourage water 
conservation by penalizing the big users. 
</P>
<P>
 But the system ended up creating huge water bills for those residents who have 
bigger lawns and live in the city's hottest regions -- such as Valley dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation to keep the winter rates in place will be considered March 
15 by the DWP's Board of Commissioners, then it will go before the City Council 
by April, where it is expected to face a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Valley council members criticized the rates and demanded a 
review of the system, several other council members argued that the new rate 
system freed DWP customers outside the Valley from having to subsidize Valley 
homeowners' water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Oschin, an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson, said she does not expect 
the winter rates recommendation to win majority support from the council 
because of opposition from council members who supported the new rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to the City Council, there are not going to be eight votes to 
keep the winter rates in place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oschin said Bernson, who represents the northwest portion of the Valley, 
opposes the new summer rates because they impose "punitive measures" on Valley 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the northeast part of the Valley, 
said she has also pushed for fair utility rates for Valley residents and backs 
the committee's recommendation to temporarily keep the winter rates in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick also said she still has many unanswered questions about the rate 
structure, particularly regarding the surplus revenue that has been collected.

AUTHORITY WILL HONOR AIRPORT CONTRACT WITH PARADIES SHOPS; BURBANK: NEWS AND 
GIFT CONCESSIONAIRE'S OWNER WAS CONVICTED OF FELONY MAIL FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY 
IN JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite objections from at least one of its commissioners, the Burbank Airport 
authority Monday decided against reconsidering a contract awarded to an 
Atlanta-based concessionaire that has been convicted of felony mail fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion by Commissioner Chris Holden to review the issue was struck down by a 
5-1 vote after his colleagues concluded that federal convictions in January 
would not hinder the Paradies Shops' ability to operate four news and gift 
stores at Burbank. The authority granted the concession last December, when the 
company was already under indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did vote at the time with the knowledge that a legal action was put in 
progress. But this firm . . . bid under the same rules and guidelines as the 
others," said Commissioner Brian Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the company would prosper at Burbank in spite of its 
convictions and said he was not prepared to reverse his stand in favor of the 
Paradies Shops, due to start business at Burbank on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Holden insisted he had not been informed of any legal proceedings 
against the firm and its owner, Daniel M. Paradies, who was convicted Jan. 22 
of 83 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy. In a politically 
explosive trial in Atlanta, a jury found Paradies guilty for his role in a 
scheme to funnel more than $1 million in illegal payoffs to a prominent Atlanta 
official who later served on the city airport commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not my understanding that those indictments were pending. . . . For me 
personally, that would impact on my vote," said Holden, who is also a member of 
the Pasadena City Council. "It's very important that the integrity of 
everything . . . be held high and above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the second-place bidder, the British concern W. H. Smith, had 
submitted a comparable offer to the Paradies Shops that could have served as a 
good alternative. Both vendors guaranteed the airport at least $2.4 million in 
rent over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Paparian, a fellow commissioner and Pasadena councilman who was not 
present at Monday's meeting, also took exception to the authority's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are fair questions that should be addressed," said Paparian, adding 
that he, too, had not been briefed by airport staff on any litigation against 
Paradies during the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tears at the whole fabric of the integrity of governance. It's not an 
indictment anymore; it's a conviction. . . . Can a zebra change its stripes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paparian called on the authority to revive the issue because the substance of 
Paradies' convictions -- that he conspired to bribe Atlanta officials who voted 
on airport matters -- could cast a shadow on how the vendor selection process 
at Burbank was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 But some authority members pointed out that the contract had already been 
signed by both parties. "You can't turn back the clock," Commissioner John 
Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to airport staff, the agreement with the Paradies Shops -- one of 
the nation's largest airport news and gift concession agents -- does not allow 
the authority to sever ties solely on grounds of criminal convictions. Company 
executives say they anticipate no difficulty in meeting their obligations at 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to some of its own members, the authority has been pressured by 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to end its relationship with the 
Paradies Shops, as Denver International Airport is doing. In a letter prompted 
by a complaint from one of Paradies' rival bidders for the Burbank concession, 
Polanco said canceling the contract would be "a prudent public-interest 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But authority President Robert W. Garcin wrote back: "(T)here does not appear 
to be a compelling reason for the authority to take the actions you suggest. . 
. . In my opinion it would not be prudent to expose the authority to 
significant damages by breaking the contract without sufficient cause." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action relating to the Paradies Shops agreement, commissioners asked 
staff to review efforts aimed at awarding more contracts to local minority and 
women-owned businesses to comply with federal law. The authority has received 
complaints over Paradies' plans to bring in a minority firm from Indiana to 
fulfill its requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, airport engineer Dan Feger outlined the extent of damage suffered 
by the airport in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the airport has spent $192,000 so far in repairs, including replacing 
broken glass and ceiling tiles in the facility's two terminals and shoring up 
its parking structure. Feger estimated that an additional $80,000 would be 
necessary to bring the parking structure back up to pre-earthquake strength. 
The runways and taxiways suffered virtually no damage, he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN SLAYING AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are looking for a gunman who fatally shot a Glendale man and wounded 
two others as they were watching a soccer game in a North Hollywood park over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Garzon, 36, of Glendale was taken to North Hollywood Medical Center 
where he died less than an hour after Sunday's 4:20 p.m. shooting near Tujunga 
Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron LaRue of the 
North Hollywood station's homicide division. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue said Garzon was shot once in the chest as he sat watching a soccer 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men believed to be Garzon's friends, both of Los Angeles, were 
treated for minor gunshot wounds at an undisclosed hospital, said LaRue. 
Authorities declined to name the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a motive and we don't have any suspects," LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call 989-8831.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROPOSAL TARGETS CHARITY BINGO PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An amendment to the city's bingo ordinance allowing the city to fine charities 
up to $10,000 if anyone other than the sponsoring organization profits from a 
bingo game held on its premises will be considered today by the Glendale City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment is being proposed to keep the city's bingo regulations in line 
with state law, said Scott Howard, city attorney.The council will meet at 2 
p.m. in council chambers, 613 E. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will review several other amendments to the city's bingo 
ordinance, including allowing up to $2,000 per month in profits to be used for 
property rental or overhead costs, and approving a call by charities for 
pull-tab bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull-tab bingo, featuring lottery-size cards that, when pulled open, show a 
winning dollar amount, or three lemons for a losing card, are not allowed in 
Glendale under the city's current ordinance, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five charitable organizations now permitted to hold bingo games in 
the city. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; WOMAN'S CLUB SEEKS QUAKE REPAIR HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than 80 years of helping others in their community, members of the 
Van Nuys Woman's Club have found no one to help their clubhouse recover from 
the Northridge earthquake, forcing the group to consider selling the historic 
cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group's treasury is nearly drained after paying $21,000 toward 
the $30,050 in earthquake repair costs for their clubhouse on Sylvan Street. 
But club leaders have yet to hear from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
and local banks have spurned the club's requests for loans, which are needed to 
make up the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This club has been a charitable organization and donated so many funds in the 
area," said 71-year-old club President Neva Hines. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now that we need help, I can't seem to find any." 
</P>
<P>
 The clubhouse, which suffered quake damage to the fireplace and its interior 
walls, has been yellow-tagged since the earthquake. It was declared a city of 
Los Angeles historical-cultural monument in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 56 club members, many of whom are over the age of 70, are unable to 
raise the funds from their own bank accounts, Hines said this piece of Los 
Angeles history might never reopen its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've considered the sale of the property," said Hines. "We're practically 
broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Sale of the property could mean a loss for club members and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was constructed as a meeting spot for club members in 1917, the 
location has also provided the setting for hundreds of garden parties, card 
games, Bible readings and public hearings. But the group has only held one of 
three planned meetings since the quake. And that was in a local eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubhouse has also been a focal point of fund-raisers for more than 19 
charities, including the American Red Cross and Children of the Night. Since 
1986, Hines said, the group has raised more than $18,000 in charity donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the quake, the city of Los Angeles' Planning Department had also been 
paying $750 monthly to conduct its public hearings in the clubhouse auditorium. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, however, the city moved its hearings to the Sherman Oaks 
Woman's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 With prospects dim for the city's return, Hines said she is counting on a 
miracle to save the clubhouse from sale. And although the club will continue 
regardless, members said meeting somewhere else will not be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a blow to all of us, " said 85-year-old member Dorothea M. Neel, a 
past president of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubhouse is like our second home." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PIPELINE OUTSIDE CITY'S AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has no authority to prevent crude oil from 
flowing again through the controversial Four Corners Pipeline, which ruptured 
during the Northridge earthquake, the state fire marshal's office has said. 
</P>
<P>
 That declaration, in a letter received by city officials Monday, effectively 
limits city action regarding the pipeline, which runs through San Fernando, 
including beneath the playground of O'Melveny Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about a mile of the 130-mile line, which connects Kern County oil fields 
with South Bay refineries, passes through San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 A quake-related rupture beside the playground, just outside the city 
boundaries, fueled a fire that seriously burned a man and charred 17 cars and a 
house on Wolfskill Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The line also ruptured on a portion that passes through San Fernando itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The council resolved earlier this month to tell Four Corners to stop operating 
the line until the city had a full report on the incident, and not to resume 
pumping until the company participated in a public hearing. But neither action 
appears to be within the panel's legal powers, according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this letter is not to provide you with a lengthy lecture on 
why the City of San Fernando cannot regulate the safety of Line 1" of the Four 
Corners Pipeline Co., wrote Nancy Wolfe, chief of the state Fire Marshal's 
Pipeline Safety Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent, she wrote, is to assure that her office "is sincerely interested 
in the physical safety and mental well-being of the residents and will not 
permit (Four Corners Pipeline Co.) to begin pumping on Line 1 unless we are 
assured that the line will be safely operated." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando City Administrator Mary Strenn said Monday that she was not 
surprised at the content of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had a concern as far as jurisdiction, that there would be a body 
higher than us," said Strenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pipeline runs entirely within the state of California, federal 
law and court cases have determined that the transport of oil affects 
interstate commerce, and therefore is constitutionally protected against 
interference by local authorities, Wolfe said. Federal law further says that a 
state can take over federal jurisdiction if it adopts laws as strict as federal 
regulations, as California has. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts the state fire marshal in position as sole authority over the line, 
Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Four Corners officials say they are willing to relocate the 
pipeline, provided they can find a place for it and get the necessary permits 
and agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the San Fernando City Council, nor Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon, whose district surrounds the city, thus far have expressed a 
willingness to accept the part of the line now beneath the schoolyard. GEOFFREY 
MOHAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ZARIAN WON'T SEEK SEAT IN ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian said Monday that he will not run for the state 
Assembly seat vacated by Pat Nolan, the Republican legislator who resigned 
after pleading guilty to a racketeering charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian said at a news conference that he did not want to give up considerable 
local clout to be another rookie in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to be a leader," he said. "I need to be a spokesperson and I need to 
make an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian would have had to resign his seat on the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, where he is second vice chairman, in order to take Nolan's post. But 
he said he would rather maintain Glendale's representation on the board and 
work for a light-rail corridor through Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian said he would also have to give up his membership in the state Regional 
Water Quality Control Board and the Los Angeles County Economic Development 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to finish what I feel needs to be finished," said Zarian, 56, who 
has been mayor in Glendale for three years and on the City Council for 11. He 
said that in the past 12 days many Glendale residents have been encouraging him 
to run, while council members in Glendale and Burbank have been inquiring about 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "One important personal reason is my 84-year-old mother," who lives in 
Glendale, Zarian said. "I am her sole support."  
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's replacement should fight over-regulation of business as well as a be a 
strong supporter of law enforcement, Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the toughest election the Republicans are going to have," he 
said. "We must keep this district Republican. I've worked too hard to sit back 
and watch the Democrats win." ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: COURT EVACUATED AFTER BOMB THREATS

<P>
 About 100 people were evacuated from the Glendale County Courthouse on Monday 
after officials received several telephone calls that a bomb was set to go off 
in the building at 9:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barbara Burke ordered the courthouse evacuated about 9 a.m. after a 
sheriff's deputy and a Superior Court clerk received warnings that there was an 
explosive device in the building, said Sgt. Bill Elton, commander of a Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department squad assigned to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 After searching the grounds several times, deputies allowed everyone back 
inside about 30 minutes later, Elton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elton said that phony bomb threats are not unusual at courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the false alarm left some frazzled, it failed to jumble the court's 
full schedule, he said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CLASH RESUMES OVER CHILD CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A battle over a proposal to open a Northridge child-care center will resume 
today as the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals considers whether to allow the 
center in a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is opposed by a group of neighbors who fear it will lower 
their property values, was the last thing on anyone's mind in the weeks after 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. The Board of Zoning Appeals was scheduled to hear the 
case Jan. 25 but postponed the hearing in light of earthquake damage to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the homeowners have resumed the fight, a sign that life is returning to 
normal in suburban Northridge, a place where "normal" has often meant 
homeowners packing planning hearings to oppose commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed child-care center has received tentative approval from the city. 
The applicant is Sherri Segre, who wants to move her existing day-care center 
in the vicinity into a single-family home on Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre has received permission to care for up to 36 children in the home, 
provided that she abide by a list of conditions. Most are aimed at warding off 
potential traffic hazards as parents drop off and pick up their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre has agreed to the conditions, and in past interviews has maintained that 
the center will not be as disruptive as neighbors imagine, and will provide a 
needed service in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Rothenberg, past president of the North Valley Homeowners Federation, 
which has filed an appeal to block Segre's permit, said that the child-care 
center would affect more than 100 homes in the area. For years, she said, 
neighbors along once-residential Devonshire Street have watched what she termed 
"creeping commercialism" overtake their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the child-care center would create a precedent for more businesses 
to move in, Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is at 11 a.m. today in City Hall, 200 N. Spring St., Los Angeles.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PANEL TO WEIGH USE OF PRIVATE AMBULANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Board of Fire Commissioners is scheduled today to consider a proposal 
to use private ambulance firms to handle non-emergency calls. Supporters say 
the program -- which if approved would be citywide -- would free up paramedics 
to more quickly respond to urgent medical calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of using ambulance firms was tested during a 1991 pilot program in 
the San Fernando Valley after a management audit found that most 911 emergency 
medical calls do not require the services of trained paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program works on a citywide basis, it can divert about 40,000 of the 
city's 230,000 annual emergency paramedic calls to private firms, which would 
be required to collect fees from residents who use the services. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department Chief Roger Gillis said previous estimates projected that the 
program could save the city up to $6 million annually. But after closer study, 
he said the program may only break even because the city would lose on the 
revenue that it could collect for paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said, the program can improve the Fire Department's response 
time to real medical emergencies.  
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board, the program will be considered by the City Council 
and the mayor.HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MAN GETS PRISON IN SLAYING OF PARTNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fountain Valley man was sentenced Monday to 16 years to life in prison for 
his role in the execution-style slaying of his business partner at a Tarzana 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 David Thayne Smith, 35, was convicted last fall of second-degree murder in the 
shooting of Stefan Sweetser, 23, who was gunned down Oct. 16, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith admitted that he was at the remote Reseda Boulevard location where 
Sweetser was shot five times, but he maintained that he had no idea that a 
killing was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who authorities believe fired the actual shots, 47-year-old Daniel 
Joseph Miller, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole after a jury in another trial convicted him of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Miller, Smith and Sweetser robbed construction sites throughout the 
San Fernando Valley and sold the spoils at Visions Door & Windows in Burbank, 
authorities said. Smith and Sweetser were co-owners of the business. During her 
prosecution of Smith and Miller, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Maria Mas portrayed 
the men as greedy robbers who planned Sweetser's murder so that they would not 
have to share loot the trio had stolen in a series of burglaries. THOM MROZEK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LOCKHEED GIFT WILL EXPAND JAPANESE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Japanese American Community Center plans to expand its 
facilities by two-thirds this summer, thanks to the donation of a building by 
Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, which has moved many of its operations out of its longtime Burbank 
plant, has offered the 7,700-square-foot building to the center. For its part, 
the community center will pay to have the building cut into four parts and 
moved to its facility in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous gift," said Michael Motoyasu, the center's second vice 
president who is coordinating the project. "It allows us to better serve the 
community, because we will have more of a facility to do our activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles will soon be sending out notices to 800 Pacoima 
residents to inform them that the center will be adding the Lockheed building 
to its Branford Street facility. The Lockheed building will increase the 
center's total space to 20,000 square feet. It will be used for additional 
dining, meeting and multipurpose space, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motoyasu said he doubts that the project would create parking problems for 
neighbors because the center has a large car lot, but said it is possible that 
the expansion could cause increased traffic. The notices to neighbors -- which 
the center is paying for -- and a hearing to air community reactions, are 
required for the center to get a permit from the city that would allow the 
expansion to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will spend about $300,000 to move the building in four pieces and 
reconstruct it at the center's Pacoima site. The price tag is a good deal 
because it would have cost $500,000 to $550,000 to construct the building, 
Motoyasu said.

<P>
 He said the idea for the building's transfer came in March, 1993, when Gene 
Matsushita, a friend who works for Lockheed Advanced Development Co., a 
division of Lockheed Corp., asked Motoyasu whether the community center might 
have some use for the building, an employee cafeteria scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 After considering the costs of the acquisition, the center's board of 
directors decided to accept the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the center selected Uchida Construction Co. of Palmdale as the 
contractor and Master House Movers of Encino as the mover for the project. 
Attorneys for the community center and Lockheed are now negotiating details of 
the transfer contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also is in the process of applying for a bank loan for the 
$300,000, which Motoyasu said he expects to get, using the center as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was established in 1951 and is open to anyone who is interested in 
pursuing Japanese culture, Motoyasu said. Facilities and programs include a 
Japanese school, martial arts studio, youth basketball program and senior 
citizens programs. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; LEAKING WATER TANK DECLARED UNUSABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An estimated 800,000 gallons of water has leaked from a 4-million-gallon water 
tank in the hills of Tarzana since Thursday, forcing the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power to declare it unusable, DWP officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although inspectors did not find structural cracks in the Corbin water tank 
near Mulholland and Greenbriar drives after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
officials now speculate that the temblor or an aftershock damaged a drainage 
valve. 
</P>
<P>
 Water "has been seeping out for a while," said Joey Castruita, a DWP 
supervisor. About 20% of the tank's capacity, or 800,000 gallons, has leaked 
since the damage was discovered, he said. But he said an unknown amount of 
water may have leaked before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of surprising," said Scott Munson, a DWP waterworks engineer. "But 
lots of little, weird things happened during the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Munson said the steel tank, which is 156 feet in diameter and 30 feet tall, 
was "one of our better, newer tanks." It was built in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the leak was discovered, he said, no water was pumped into the tank, and 
most of the remaining water flowed into the city's water system as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The underground location of the tank hindered workers from immediately 
stopping the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to drain the water or stop the leak without extensive 
excavation to the hillside," Castruita said. "We would have had to dig too 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
 The tank is now empty and will be repaired next week. It served the area of 
Mulholland Drive to the north, Wells Drive on the south, Winnetka Avenue to the 
west and Alonzo Drive to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are now being served by the Nogales Pump Station in Tarzana, and 
Castruita said there should no change in service. The tank is designed to drain 
into a natural waterway along a canyon, Castruita said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

ROBERTI RAISES $200,000 IN HIS BATTLE AGAINST RECALL CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With six weeks remaining before a recall election, state Sen. David A. Roberti 
reported Monday that he has raised nearly $200,000 in campaign funds in an 
effort to hold onto his Van Nuys district seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of that sum, however, came from Roberti himself, who loaned his Beat 
the Recall treasury $125,000 from one of his senatorial campaign committees, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how much money has been raised so far by the three groups 
trying to remove the Democratic state senator from his 20th District seat. 
Spokesmen for the organizations said they have not yet filed campaign 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 When the filing period ended Feb. 26, Roberti's anti-recall committee had 
about $35,000 on hand after raising $194,000 since Jan. 1, according to his 
campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money came from Roberti's traditional allies in labor and law 
enforcement as well as individuals who donated money because they support the 
senator's gun-control legislation, said Staci Walters, Roberti's campaign 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand that this is not an ordinary election but is about assault 
weapons," Walters said, referring to gun enthusiasts' support of the recall. 
"And people are starting to rally around the senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have the backing of gun-rights advocates, Roberti's opponents 
maintain that the lawmaker -- who angered many gun owners by authoring an 
assault-weapons ban -- is using the issue as a smoke screen. 
</P>
<P>
 They charge that Roberti deserves to be recalled because he does not reside in 
the district, is soft on crime and as the ranking officer of the state Senate, 
he should shoulders some of the blame for California's fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the San Fernando Valley, assault weapons are not the only issue," said 
Russ Howard, spokesman for Californians Against Corruption, one of the groups 
backing the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he did not know how much money recall proponents have on hand, but 
he predicted that fund-raising efforts now underway will be fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteers are bringing in over $5,000 a day," Howard said. "Nothing breeds 
success like success. We just sent out a fund-raising letter a week ago, and 
it's all coming in like a slot machine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Roberti camp, Walters said the senator held three fund-raising events 
last weekend, including one in South-Central Los Angeles and another in Simi 
Valley. Attorney Mike Curls said he staged a reception for Roberti at his law 
firm's South-Central offices because he supports the senator's gun-control 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Constituents, Curls said, "are mad to the gills about the unbridled use of 
guns on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The key fund-raiser planned for Roberti will be a $250-a-plate dinner in Los 
Angeles next week featuring gun-control activist Sarah Brady, Walters said. 
Brady is the wife of former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was 
shot during an assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the campaign's expenditures so far have included phone banks, 
door-to-door precinct walking and mass mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti opponent Howard predicted the state senator will have to spend in 
excess of $1 million to hold onto his seat until December, when term limits 
will automatically oust him from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti has until March 11 to decide his political ambitions. By 
that date, he must tell the secretary of state's office if he plans to run for 
either state treasurer or a seat on the Board of Equalization. He has filed 
statements expressing his interest in both offices.

CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL SAYS ROBERTI FOES THREATENED HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several men dumped dozens of campaign signs Sunday at the home of State Sen. 
David Roberti's campaign treasurer, then allegedly made threatening remarks and 
nearly struck her husband with their car as they sped away, according to a Los 
Angeles police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Wechsler, a professional political treasurer, said in an interview 
Monday that the incident scared her and was followed by two anonymous phone 
calls complaining about the signs being on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm frightened because I think these people are capable of violence," said 
Wechsler. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Roberti's press secretary, Staci Walters, believe that the incident 
was the work of political opponents seeking to oust Roberti in an April 12 
recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler said one of the men warned her husband "to stay away from the 
window," which the couple interpreted as a threat of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall campaign has been largely organized and underwritten by Second 
Amendment enthusiasts who are angry about Roberti's support of gun-control 
laws. Recall campaign representatives deny involvement in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was officially sanctioned by them, but the members of the 
recall have used intimidation before -- just read their literature," Walters 
said, referring to a confidential campaign document that was leaked to the 
media last year. The document said the political tactic of one of the groups 
involved in the recall was to mail its political enemies a picture of a horse's 
head, to warn them that they were being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has also claimed that he has received numerous death threats from 
people opposed to his gun-control work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm even afraid to let my dogs go outside now," Wechsler said in an 
interview. "These people are hunters, and if they'd shoot a deer, they'd shoot 
a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Len Hundshamer, watch commander at the North Hollywood Division station, 
said police are investigating a complaint of assault with a vehicle filed by 
Wechsler's spouse, 63-year-old Arthur Forcier, a political science professor. 
Forcier told police that he had to jump backward to avoid being hit when the 
car driven by the men pulled out of his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dominguez, leader of the groups seeking Roberti's ouster, denied that 
his group was involved in the incident. "We don't have to intimidate anybody, 
including Roberti," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez said he does not condone such "distasteful behavior" and speculated 
that the incident was fabricated by the Roberti camp to further its efforts to 
portray his political foes as thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to create an image of us being a bunch of gun-crazy 
extremists," said Dominguez, who several weeks ago reported to police the theft 
of 15 guns from his Van Nuys apartment. "I wouldn't put it past Roberti to 
stage some kind of thing like this to help him with his image-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said campaign workers Monday began removing pro-Roberti campaign 
posters placed in public places, and used fingernail polish remover to erase 
Wechsler's name and home address, printed in a small print disclaimer at the 
bottom of the literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler said she demanded Roberti's permission to have the information 
removed as a protection against further harassment.

NICHOLSON ACCUSED OF ATTACK WITH GOLF CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson was charged Monday with misdemeanor 
vandalism and assault for allegedly smashing the windshield of a car with a 
golf club because he believed the driver cut him off in traffic, the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Blank of Hollywood accused Nicholson of attacking Blank's 
Mercedes-Benz on Feb. 8 in North Hollywood, the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson stepped out of his car at a red light at the intersection of 
Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive and repeatedly struck the windshield and roof 
of Blank's car with a golf club, according to a statement by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank told investigators that he never got out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that after the attack, Nicholson and a man who got out of the 
car with him returned to Nicholson's car and drove off, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate civil suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, Blank, 
38, said he was hurt by flying glass from the windshield and that the attack 
made him fear for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaint filed against Nicholson, who has been a major 
box-office draw for more than 20 years, charges him with one count each of 
vandalism and assault, said Rick Schmidt of the city attorney's Van Nuys 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Two independent witnesses identified the weapon as a golf club and one 
identified the 57-year-old actor as the attacker, Schmidt said. One witness 
also remembered the license plate number of the vehicle, and the city 
attorney's office used the information to trace the car to Nicholson, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's lawyer, Santa Monica attorney Charles English, said he had not 
seen the complaint and could not comment until he had reviewed it. Blank's 
lawyer did not return calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Nicholson's film credits include "A Few Good Men," "Prizzi's Honor," 
"The Shining" and "Five Easy Pieces." He won an Oscar for best actor in 1975 
for his performance as a mental patient in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN HATCHET SLAYING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendale man believed to be interested in satanism pleaded not guilty Monday 
to the hatchet slaying of an elderly woman and an attack on her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 David Condry, who appeared unshaven and disheveled during the hearing in 
Glendale Superior Court, is charged with one count of murder and one count of 
attempted murder in the Feb. 8 death of Josephine Adinolfi, 89, and a 
subsequent attack on her grandson, Augie Pisano, 44.Both Condry and Pisano were 
living with Adinolfi in her home at 703 W. Salem St. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Condry seemed "not normal" to him during the seven years that he 
lived in Adinolfi's guest house, Pisano said he started to worry for his 
grandmother's safety about a year and a half ago when she found a book with the 
word "Satan" inscribed on its cover in Condry's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Adinolfi, who allowed Condry to live with her in exchange for his help with 
gardening and housework, subsequently found more than 100 books on satanic 
practices in the guest house. The books were later burned in the family 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, police found a pentagram -- a five-pointed star associated 
with satanic rituals -- hanging on a chain around Condry's neck and a magazine 
photograph in his possession depicting a demonic face with the words "Human 
Sacrifice Would Open Up The Gates of Hell." Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Werner 
said Condry could face 26 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering 
Adinolfi and up to a life sentence for the attempted murder of Pisano. 
</P>
<P>
 Condry has been ordered to appear in Division 2 of Glendale Superior Court for 
a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. March 15.

JUDGE TRIMS 2 YEARS FROM CHILD MOLESTER'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing that an admitted child molester had a "maternal instinct" and 
cared for his teen-age victims, a judge Monday reduced the man's sentence by 
two years, leaving him with a 16-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Leon Kaplan gave the revised sentence to Russell 
A. Kraus, the 29-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes man who pleaded guilty two years 
ago to 40 counts of child molestation and 32 felony counts of providing drugs 
to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a travesty," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch. "I think the 
sentence he was originally given was too low." 
</P>
<P>
 When he originally sentenced Kraus in January, 1993, Kaplan could have sent 
him to prison for 92 years, but he handed down an 18-year sentence over Fisch's 
objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan then recalled Kraus' sentence about one year ago. "This is only the 
second time during my 14 years as a judge that I have had second thoughts about 
a (prison) commitment," Kaplan said at a hearing last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul Niedorf, a Los Angeles psychiatrist appointed to the case after attorneys 
on both sides agreed, testified Monday that Kraus was involved in "mutual 
exploitation" with most of his 14 victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boys . . . had their own interests and desires," Niedorf said, 
explaining that some needed a place to stay and most were probably interested 
in experimenting with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Niedorf said Kraus displayed a mother-like concern for the young boys by 
giving them a place to stay and expressing concern for their health and grades 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch disagreed strongly and compared Kraus to a trench-coat-wearing man who 
lured children with candy. "Instead of candy, Mr. Kraus used video games and 
drugs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Niedorf said Kraus was "ideally suited for a treatment program," 
Kaplan denied Kraus' request for a drastically reduced sentence and in-patient 
psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant will get treatment, but only after he is away for a substantial 
period of time," Kaplan said Monday.

QUAKE-DELAYED EVENT TO HONOR KING IS HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former 
slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at 
the table of brotherhood."  
</P>
<P>
 It's been more than 30 years since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the 
white marble steps of the Lincoln Memorial and spoke those words, hoping they 
would reach the soul of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have reached the heart of a community trying to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a month after they had first planned to come together, about 200 
people -- white, black, Asian, Latino, Gentile, Jew, Muslim -- gathered to 
celebrate King's birthday at a ceremony planned by the San Fernando Valley 
Interfaith Council at Temple Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills. The ceremony 
originally was to have been held Jan. 17, the day of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as residents begin to rebuild, the unity of which King spoke is more 
important than ever, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at this as a time to celebrate healing and the uniting of 
different people in the Valley," said council spokeswoman Arlene C. Landon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jan. 17 I wanted to welcome you as brothers and sisters in joy, and in just 
six weeks our lives changed drastically. Martin spoke to us that morning and he 
speaks to us again tonight," said Rabbi Steven B. Jacobs of congregation Kol 
Tikvah. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude of the earthquake we can withstand, but not the magnitude of 
violence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state 
sweltering with the heat of injustice . . . will be transformed into an oasis 
of freedom and justice.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was Martin who said the choice is no longer between nonviolence and 
violence, but nonviolence and nonexistence," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice still must be made, said the Rev. Zedar Broadous, president of the 
San Fernando Valley chapter of the NAACP. "We must begin to re-embrace each 
other. If we don't work together, those who seek to destroy us will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When King wrote his famed letter from a Birmingham jail, he wrote not of the 
Klu Klux Klan or of violent segregationists, but said instead the problem he 
faced was moderate whites "more devoted to order than justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time we begin to suffer a little more for what we believe -- as King 
did," said the Rev. Timothy Safford, of All Saints Episcopal Church in 
Pasadena, who read from the Birmingham letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to choose justice and turn our back on violence," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Jerrold Goldstein, who traveled to Florida with 15 other rabbis in 1964 
at King's request, said he remembered that King "guided and sustained and 
strengthened us in a way we could not have managed on our own. His spirit 
surely lives on in this room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy to know what to do when he was alive -- it's harder now," he 
said. Reginald Gillens, of the Church of the Way in Van Nuys, read from King's 
speech in a big voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation 
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of 
their character. I have a dream today!"

SHOTS FROM CAR MAY HAVE KILLED 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men whose bodies were found inside a car on the southbound side of the 
Golden State Freeway may have been killed by shots fired from another car, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know for certain, but all indications are that (the shots were) from 
a motorist traveling in the same direction," said Deputy Benita Hinojos, a Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified Monday as Marco Antonio Trejo, 35, of Los Angeles, 
who was driving the car, and Manuel Salvador, 37, of Glendale. Police have no 
additional information about the victims, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other drivers saw the victims' car, a 1991 black Cadillac, swerving Sunday 
about 7:40 p.m. before it crashed into a guardrail on the southbound side of 
the Golden State Freeway, south of the Hungry Valley Road exit, Hinojos said.

2 SPECIAL CRIME UNITS WILL LOSE PROSECUTORS; BUDGET: DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL 
MOVE SOME PERSONNEL TO FOCUS ON STREET OFFENSES. BUSINESS COMMUNITY PROTESTS. 
</P>

 As part of his running budget battle with county officials, Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said beginning today he will transfer some prosecutors 
out of two special units -- workers' compensation and automobile insurance 
fraud -- so they can concentrate on street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county does not lift a strict hiring freeze on his office, Garcetti 
said, he will begin shutting down four other units later this month, including 
those that handle environmental and worker safety crimes, white-collar crimes 
involving more than $100,000, a unit that serves cities that don't have a city 
attorney and an appellate unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Street crime has to be the No. 1 priority," he said in an interview. "I have 
no choice but to stop prosecuting those crimes that are not as serious as 
violent crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said his decision was unavoidable because the Board of Supervisors is 
holding him to the hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said the freeze was imposed 
because Garcetti consistently spends more than he is allocated, and he will get 
no relief until he finds ways to stay within his annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said the freeze and budget cuts have devastated his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way he saved the jobs of scores of deputies, he said, was by putting 
them into special units, which, in many cases, are financed by the state or the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, he must bring them out of those units to fight violent crime. 
"We have no choice," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in seven months that Garcetti has threatened to stop 
prosecuting certain crimes if county officials don't meet his budget demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, after the board gave him $12 million less than he asked for in 
his budget proposal, he told community groups all over the county that he would 
stop prosecuting misdemeanors if his budget was cut along with other county 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 He backed off that threat, however, after business interests protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the business community raised similar protests to 
Garcetti's latest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford D. Sweet, a San Diego-based attorney who frequently represents 
insurance companies, said it would be "devastating" to the state's business 
climate to cut back workers' compensation fraud probes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has been the heart of organized workers' compensation fraud for 
years," Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. Benson, head of the special investigation unit for Zenith Insurance 
Co., one of the biggest workers' compensation insurers in California, also 
expressed dismay over Garcetti's plan, saying that the work of the fraud unit 
was a major reason for the decline in bogus workers' compensation claims over 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this mean to the person on the street that workers' compensation fraud 
is no longer an important issue? Is it open season on workers' compensation 
fraud again? If that's the case, employers in this state will be subjected to a 
lot of injustices that they've already been forced to endure before." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Schulz, a spokesman for California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 
said Garcetti's action also would deal a serious blow to the state's fight 
against auto insurance fraud. "Los Angeles is referred to as the automobile 
insurance capital of the country," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COWBOY FESTIVAL MOVES TO MELODY RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even an earthquake could not hamper the frontier spirit of the cowboy 
festival, which city officials announced Monday would move to the historic 
Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film Festival, which begins March 25, 
originally was to be held in the Hart High School auditorium, which was 
severely damaged in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay $15,000 to rent the ranch studio, which was owned by singing 
cowboy actor Gene Autry until 1990 and has been the set of hundreds of 
Westerns, including films starring Gary Cooper, Roy Rogers and John Wayne. The 
set burned down when fire swept through Placerita Canyon in 1962, but has since 
been restored by brothers Renaud and Andre Veluzat, who purchased the ranch 
from Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of a new festival site came as a relief to Cecilia Burda, the 
city's special projects manager, who had faced the difficult chore of promoting 
an event without a location. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new venue actually will add an air of authenticity to Santa 
Clarita's first-ever regional event. "This is perfect because it gives us the 
chance to show off the Old West through the sets of the TV shows and movies 
that really brought the cowboy to the American home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the $15,000 cost of renting the studio is considerably more than the 
$2,000 that the city would have paid for the high school auditorium, the total 
cost of the event still should not exceed its $83,000 budget, said city 
spokeswoman Gail Foy. She noted that corporate sponsorships and ticket and 
merchandise sales would greatly offset the cost to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the three-day festival of Western poetry, music and films range 
from $10 for a poetry pass to $50 for a special weekend package.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN TO RETIRE 
TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief law enforcement officer for the Santa Clarita area, Sheriff's Capt. 
Jerry Conklin, retires today after a 30-year career including two as head of 
the rapidly growing Santa Clarita area. 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin, 55, will be succeeded by Capt. Michael Quinn, who has served in the 
same capacity at the Crescenta Valley station for about four years. Quinn, 53, 
met with Conklin Monday for some last-minute discussions about Santa Clarita 
and is expected to tour the city for the first time today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to be quite people-oriented," Quinn said of his leadership style. "I 
think the deputies and civilian employees are responsible to the citizens. 
That's a two-edged sword. I want the public to understand what the deputies are 
facing as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn has previously worked in the department's search-and-rescue unit, 
information bureau and Special Weapons and Tactics team. He has a bachelor's 
degree in police science from Cal State Los Angeles, and a master's degree in 
communications from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn believes that the main differences in the Crescenta and Santa Clarita 
valleys are their populations. Crescenta Valley has a consistent population of 
less than 100,000, including La Canada Flintridge, La Crescenta and Altadena. 
The Santa Clarita Valley includes about 160,000 people and is steadily growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenges of the Santa Clarita Valley are not different from the station 
I come from, except they're magnified," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada Flintridge and Santa Clarita each contract for sheriff's services 
from Los Angeles County. Leaders in both areas are trying to hold the line 
against graffiti and other gang-related activities creeping into their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials agree that a new captain can mean a changed 
relationship between the city and the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson, who knows both Conklin and Quinn from his own 31-year 
career in law enforcement that includes eight years in the Santa Clarita Valley 
station, said the two have very different styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mike Quinn will bring a vitality to the department. It will put a 
positive spin on a very successful program," said Pederson. "Jerry left him a 
good law enforcement program here."

O.C. SCANDAL PROMPTS BILL TO LIMIT GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by revelations of excessive spending and gift-taking at an Orange 
County water district, the state Senate on Monday approved a bill that would 
impose stringent limits on gifts and other perks that could be accepted by 
local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate sent the measure by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to the 
governor's desk on a 35-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson must decide the measure's fate within two weeks, and Umberg 
said he is confident Wilson will sign it. Jan Dana, a Wilson spokeswoman, said 
the governor would have no comment on the legislation until it reaches his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said he decided to push the measure after reading accounts in The Times 
about gifts, trips and extravagant business expenses rung up by top officials 
and several employees at the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame we didn't have this legislation in place two years ago," Umberg 
said after the Senate vote. Had that been the case, "perhaps we could have 
avoided the scandal that occurred at the Santa Margarita Water District," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, the district's general manager, and Michael P. Lord, 
his assistant, elected to take early retirement after The Times disclosed 
numerous examples of the two managers spending lavishly from district funds and 
accepting gifts totaling more than $60,000 from consultants and contractors to 
which the men steered lucrative contracts without any competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Board chairman Don B. Schone, a director for 16 years, resigned after The 
Times reported that he took two trips to Cabo San Lucas paid by the district's 
chief engineering contractor. Schone did not disclose the gifts until the news 
accounts surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed Monday would ban gifts or honorariums in excess of $250 each 
year from any single donor to an elected official or employee at a special 
district or local government such as a city, county or school district. 
Currently, there is a $1,000 restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some governmental agencies, such as the Orange County Board of Supervisors and 
the Santa Margarita Water District board, enacted a virtual ban on all gifts to 
their officials and employees last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's measure also would add tough disclosure requirements for special 
districts, which would be required to disclose if an employee or elected 
director were reimbursed with taxpayer dollars totaling more than $100 for 
meals, lodging, travel expenses or other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts also would be required to publish a tally of all reimbursements 
to employees exceeding $100 in a document published at least annually. Umberg 
said the disclosure statements, which could be inspected by the public and 
press, will "curtail the abuses as much as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Special districts typically handle water, sewer or waste disposal duties, 
often in unincorporated areas. The bill would also apply to air pollution 
control districts, maintenance districts and redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is the second legislative proposal offered by an Orange County 
lawmaker to contend with problems at the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) pushed through a new law that 
changed the way the district's directors were elected, making them more 
accountable to the general public instead of to large landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old voting system that Conroy's bill overturned, votes for board 
members were awarded exclusively to the district's landowners on the basis of 
one vote for each dollar their land was worth on county property tax rolls. 
Under the new law that takes effect this year, however, voting in the district 
will for the first time be open to all voters registered in the district on a 
"one person, one vote" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal investigation into activities at the Santa Margarita Water District 
is continuing and "preliminary determinations" are expected by the end of the 
month, according to Wallace J. Wade, assistant district attorney in charge of 
special operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office and the FBI are looking at possible 
conflict-of-interest violations stemming from contracts that Knitz and Lord 
helped steer to companies that provided them with thousands of dollars in gifts 
and meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of the Orange County Grand Jury are scheduled to meet today 
with Santa Margarita Water District officials as part of a grand jury study 
into whether the district should be merged with four other South County 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's administrative agencies committee is studying the possible 
consolidation of the Santa Margarita, Irvine Ranch, El Toro, Los Alisos and 
Moulton Niguel water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Santa Margarita district, the four others were originally established 
as "landowner districts," although the Irvine Ranch, El Toro and Moulton Niguel 
districts were converted to one-person, one-vote voting systems years ago, 
leaving only the Santa Margarita and Los Alisos districts under the old system 
that Conroy's bill eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are visiting all five districts and have asked administrators there to 
compile information on each district's finances, board members, consultants, 
ethics statements and other records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Jury is also studying the possible merger of five other agencies 
that are intermediaries or wholesalers in the county water distribution system. 
The jury has hired the accounting firm of Ernst & Young to help with the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidation of special districts is a subject that has been on the 
negotiating table for the past 12 months at the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission, a five-member panel charged with ruling on government annexations 
and boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, LAFCO is studying the possibility of merging six water-related 
government agencies into a single district. In Garden Grove, the city has begun 
a move to take over the sewer services from the Midway City Sanitary District. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Alamitos is also considering taking over sewer services from 
the Los Alamitos County Water District, but no paperwork has been filed yet.

COURT SAYS O.C. SCOUTS CAN'T BAR BOYS FOR BELIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rebuke to the Boys Scouts of America, a state appeals court ruled Monday 
that twin Anaheim Hills brothers cannot be excluded from Scouting because they 
don't believe in God. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled 2 to 1 that the Orange County Council 
of the Scouts is a business as defined by state law and therefore cannot 
discriminate on the basis of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council could have no compelling justification for discriminating against 
children because of their current notions concerning the subject of God," the 
justices wrote. "Indeed, such discrimination would appear to contradict a 
variety of the principles of the congressionally chartered Boy Scouts of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sharply worded 12-page dissent, Justice David G. Sills accused his 
colleagues of undermining Scouting's values and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "To read the majority opinion, one would think we are writing about a pizza 
parlor where the proprietor requires prayers before serving a medium pepperoni 
with anchovies," Sills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may come as a surprise to my colleagues, but there are those who still 
seek membership in an organization which teaches duty to God and country and 
the virtues of order and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority opinion upholds a ruling by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Richard O. Frazee Sr. in 1992 that allowed William and Michael Randall, now 12, 
to remain in Scouting despite their position on the existence of God. 
</P>
<P>
 The Randalls' lawsuit was filed in early 1991, shortly after the twins were 
ousted from an Anaheim Hills Cub Scout pack for refusing to swear an oath to 
God. The boys argued that their First Amendment religious rights were being 
violated by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouting officials, however, contended that their constitutional rights of 
freedom of association were being denied. They said allowing atheists in 
Scouting would undermine the founding principles of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The case hinged on whether Scouting was defined as a private organization, 
with the right to pick and choose its members, or as a business and therefore 
bound by the state Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibits businesses from 
discriminating on the basis of religion or race. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority opinion, written by Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. with Justice 
Sheila Prell Sonenshine concurring, said the nonprofit Boy Scouts are a 
business. The justices noted that the organization has retail stores, three 
large recreational centers, $9 million in assets and an annual budget of $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county council is a business, a fairly big business," the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills disagreed, saying that even if the organization is a business, state law 
does not prohibit it from excluding "those who refuse to take their oath as 
long as the exclusion is not arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically," Sills concluded, "today's decision effectively tramples on the 
rights of atheists as well as believers. Times change. Fashions in ideas 
change. If the First Amendment will not stop the government from effectively 
dictating the content of the Boy Scout's oath today, it will not stop the 
government from requiring prayer tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scout officials said Monday that they will appeal the decision to the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're very disappointed," said Devon Dougherty, spokesman for the 
Orange County Council of Scouts. "We hope (the decision) is overturned. . . . 
This shows that private organizations have to stand up and fight to preserve 
the integrity of their principles." 
</P>
<P>
 George A. Davidson, the Scouts' attorney, said he thinks the state Supreme 
Court will side with Sills on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a pizza parlor," Davidson said. "I think the (court) majority 
failed to come to grips of the constitutional issues of the case. . . . We're 
an organization designed to promote particular values, including a duty to 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James G. Randall, who represented his sons at trial, said he and they 
were "extremely pleased by the court's ruling. . . . All they want to do is 
continue in Scouting." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the twins participate in a Tustin Boy Scout troop. "They really 
enjoy it," he said. "They wish that this could be put behind them, but it 
appears it will not end even with this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall added that his sons do not want to harm the organization or disrupt it 
with their religious views. He said Scouting officials are overreacting about 
the impact of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU attorney Jon W. Davidson, who assisted Randall in the case, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing these boys in Scouting is hardly going to take down the 
organization," he said. "I don't think admitting children who don't believe in 
God is going to prevent the Boy Scouts of America from teaching whatever they 
want about God." 
</P>
<P>
 The Randall case is one of several legal challenges that Scouting has faced 
over the past several years. Scouting values and traditions have come under 
attack nationwide from women and homosexuals who have been excluded from 
leadership positions and from a girl who was denied membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to require the Boy Scouts of 
America to admit youngsters who refused to acknowledge a "duty to God." That 
case, however, applied only to federal discrimination laws, which are not as 
restrictive as California's Unruh Act.

OZONE HOLE BLAMED FOR FROG DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENT WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In research that for the first time suggests that the thinning of the Earth's 
ozone layer directly harms wild animals, scientists reported Monday that frog 
eggs are being killed by ultraviolet radiation in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State University's study of frogs in the Cascade Mountains could help 
solve the mystery of why many of the world's frogs and toads seem to be 
vanishing, especially at high altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most alarming aspect of the research, some scientists say, is that it 
indicates UV radiation is damaging wildlife in heavily populated North America, 
where until recently it was believed that the protective ozone shield was 
relatively intact compared with that of remote polar regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications are much broader than just frogs," said Oregon State 
zoologist Andrew R. Blaustein, the lead researcher in the four-year study. "We 
are looking at natural levels of UV and it's killing these eggs. If it's 
killing frog eggs, it is probably also having an effect on the plants and 
invertebrates and fish. The implications are pretty broad to other organisms, 
including humans." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, wildlife researchers throughout the world have wrestled 
with the startling disappearances of a large number of amphibian species. The 
trend has been especially puzzling because many of the declining species live 
in national parks and other fairly undisturbed, high elevations not prone to 
the usual culprits -- pollution and destruction of habitat -- that harm 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences, shows that the hatching success of frog eggs in the mountains 
correlated strongly with their exposure to natural amounts of UV-B radiation. 
The species of frogs that had the worst hatch rates are the same ones that 
previous research had shown are suffering severe population declines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon State researchers, who began their work in 1990, monitored more 
than 1,000 frog eggs in the central Cascade Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphibian species that are most susceptible lay their eggs out in the open 
in shallow waters that receive strong sunlight, while those that lay their eggs 
under tree canopies or in deep water seem to fare better, according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a general warning," said David Wake, a biologist who is director of 
the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley. "I think what we see with the 
frogs is a group of organisms laying their eggs in the full sunlight and they 
are right in the front lines of what is happening (to the ozone layer)." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings raise a disturbing question concerning human health: If the 
relatively weak wintertime UV rays in the Pacific Northwest were severe enough 
to harm frogs, are they also bad enough to cause skin cancer and cataracts? 
Biologists have long linked UV radiation to those human health problems, but 
the level of exposure that causes damage is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have long known from lab tests that UV radiation alters DNA and 
tissue of animals and humans, and they recently reported that it is harming 
phytoplankton, a vital part of the food chain, in the waters of the Antarctic, 
where the ozone layer is the thinnest. But this study is believed to be the 
first scientific evidence of natural radiation injuring animals in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a great deal of research being done on the biological effects of 
UV light, and I think that is crazy," said Ralph Cicerone, a UC Irvine 
atmospheric chemist who has done world-renowned research on the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Oregon State study, "the only experiments we've seen have been 
reasonably crude. They were done by subjecting the plant or animal to really 
gross amounts of UV-B and generally under controlled lab conditions, not in the 
field. This experiment sounds more realistic to me, since it uses natural UV 
light," Cicerone said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, eggs laid by the wild frogs were placed into 72 cages, some with 
filters that let all sunlight inside except the harmful UV-B radiation. The 
cages were then placed in the same spot where the frogs laid the eggs. From 20% 
to 25% more eggs under the filters hatched successfully than those that were 
unshielded, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Three species were studied, the Pacific tree frog, whose population appears to 
be fairly stable, and the Western toad and the Cascades frog, two species that 
have suffered severe declines. All three inhabit California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the researchers conducted molecular work on 10 species. Frogs 
with low levels of a natural enzyme, called photolyase, that helps repair DNA 
damage caused by UV radiation had the worst rate of egg hatchings. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, many scientists have wondered if ultraviolet light might be a 
leading cause of the frog disappearances. But they were skeptical because they 
did not believe thinning of the ozone layer over the western United States was 
severe enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in November, Canadian scientists reported that a decade of measurements 
has shown that the amount of harmful UV radiation that reaches the ground in 
Toronto during winter has increased at a rate of 5% per year. Cicerone said 
ozone depletion reached a record high in North America in the winter and spring 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the information we have is from the polar regions," Blaustein said. 
"That's the scary part. We're now at the highly populated areas. . . . I think 
we should definitely study the impact of UV on other organisms." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaustein said when he began his work four years ago, he thought he would find 
no UV problem in Oregon. "We were shocked at the results. Every single 
experiment was replicated several times at several different sites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ozone layer is believed to be thinning from use of chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs, industrial solvents and coolants that are gradually being phased out 
worldwide. In the sun's intense rays of the upper atmosphere, CFCs release 
chlorine atoms that destroy the ozone shield. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom McElroy, a Canadian government physicist who co-authored the Toronto 
radiation research, said the frogs may be vulnerable because they lay their 
eggs at the same time of year -- winter and early spring -- that UV radiation 
was increasing the most in North America, according to his study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon State researchers suspect amphibians may be more vulnerable to the 
damage than mammals because of their unique physical attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their skin is not protected by hair or feathers; their eggs lack hard outer 
shells, thus exposing them to the environment," the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake, who reviewed the Oregon State research for the National Academy of 
Sciences, called the work "quite careful" and said it could explain why some 
frogs living in the same areas are disappearing while others -- less 
susceptible to UV rays -- are maintaining healthy populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences in UV rays might also explain why some regions, especially the 
Southeast portion of the United States, seem unaffected, Wake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have suspected a whole host of culprits in the frog problem: acid 
rain, pesticides, stocking of exotic fish and changes in water temperature. 
Some researchers say the declines may just be a natural cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "UV is high on my culprit list," Wake said, "but it is not alone."

COSTS TO SOAR UNDER '3 STRIKES' PLAN, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California would have to build 20 additional prisons by the turn of the 
century and spend $2 billion a year to operate them if the proposed "three 
strikes and you're out" initiative becomes law, the Department of Corrections 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first detailed analysis on the impact of the proposed initiative that 
would imprison habitual felons for life, the department said California's 
prison population, already the nation's largest, would mushroom by 109,000 
inmates by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating cost would increase each year for about 30 years, when the 
additional cost of running the new institutions would be $5.7 billion annually. 
At that time, as many as 275,000 additional prisoners could be serving long 
sentences under the initiative, the analysis said. Over that 30-year period, 
the state would spend $21 billion on prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelled by election year politics and public revulsion with crime, the 
"three-strikes" measure is regarded as a virtual certainty to become law this 
year. The estimates released Monday suggest that California will continue to 
face years of agonizing financial choices as the cost of prisons consumes an 
increasing portion of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections now consumes 7% of the state's $40-billion 
general fund budget, which faces a multibillion-dollar deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these additional costs have to be absorbed, I guess we'll have to reduce 
other services," said Steve Olsen, deputy director of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
Department of Finance. "We'll have to change our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said higher education would be vulnerable if the initiative becomes law, 
as would state personnel in various departments. Funding for most of the rest 
of the budget, including primary education and welfare, is mandated by state 
and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee, made an unusual appearance Monday before a Senate 
committee preparing to vote on a legislative version of the initiative. He said 
the measure would head the state toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're committing the state for 30 years or forever until somebody has the 
courage to say, 'We can't afford that. There is no state of California left, 
except for the police and prison state,' " Vasconcellos told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson continues to strongly support the "three-strikes" initiative, his aides 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor has stated from the beginning that public safety is government's 
No. 1 priority," said Craig Brown, undersecretary for Youth and Adult 
Corrections. "He intends to see us carry that out, and therefore he will make 
funding these costs a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the funding mechanism is yet to be determined but expected most 
prison construction to be paid for by bonds, some of which would need voter 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown released the analysis at a briefing attended by Department of Finance 
officials, Department of Corrections Director James Gomez and four 
spokespersons for the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's nine-page analysis did little to slow lawmakers, who 
continued their rush to approve legislation by Assemblymen Bill Jones 
(R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Fresno) that mimics the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Jones-Costa measure Monday, 
along with four other pieces of legislation that seek to imprison repeat felons 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to respect the right of the people who are signing the initiative," 
said Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three-strikes" bill could go to the Senate floor Thursday. The Assembly 
overwhelmingly approved it last month. Mike Reynolds, proponent of the 
initiative, said he will drop his ballot proposition only if the Jones-Costa 
bill is signed into law by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative and the Jones-Costa bill would impose mandatory sentences of 
life in prison for any third-time felon who has committed two prior violent or 
serious felonies. There are 29 crimes defined as violent or serious felonies. 
They range from murder and rape to residential burglary and furnishing hard 
drugs to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative and the Jones-Costa bill seek to double the sentences for 
second-time offenders, limit plea bargains and require that violent offenders 
serve 80% of their sentences. Most felons now serve only half their terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said there are 277,000 Californians in and out of prison with one or 
more strikes. Of those, as many as 40,000 have two prior serious or violent 
felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has 28 prisons that house 120,000 inmates. With or without the 
initiative, the state plans to build 12 prisons by the turn of the century to 
house an expected 170,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative becomes law, the state will build those 12 prisons plus 20 
more to accommodate additional prisoners who would be sentenced as a result of 
the "three-strikes" initiative, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the analysis said, the state may have to build as many as 70 
prisons by the time the initiative has its full impact 30 years from now. The 
analysis assumes that people sentenced to life in prison will serve three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections based its estimate on an analysis of felonies 
committed over the past 20 years, looked at the criminal histories of all 
felons sentenced in 1991, and extrapolated what their sentences would have been 
if the "three strikes" initiative had been law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections analysis does not include additional costs to 
counties and the state for defendants who are unlikely to accept plea bargains 
and who will demand trials if they are looking at mandatory sentences of life 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Placer County Superior Court Judge Richard Couzens, speaking on behalf of 
the state Judicial Council, predicted that there would be 17,000 additional 
jury trials a year, requiring 322 more judges at a cost of $276 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 More costs will come from additional fees paid to jurors, court bailiffs and 
others. Couzens warned that the court system may not be able to meet the 
demands and that some lower-level felons may have their cases dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In its analysis, the Department of Corrections acknowledged that there are 
many unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not view this estimate as destiny," Brown said. "It is a trend 
analysis. It is not destiny. It doesn't have to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that the analysis may underestimate the cost because it did not 
include offenses committed by juveniles. The initiative counts crimes committed 
by juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis also did not calculate the added costs of medical treatment for 
what likely would be an aging prison population. The analysis said prison 
construction costs may be higher because felons sentenced to life behind bars 
generally are housed in high-security prisons, which cost more to build than 
lower-security facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, the analysis said, the state could save money because 
criminals might be deterred from committing crimes if they know they will be 
spending years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly there are some people who are going to be deterred," Brown said. 
"It's logical." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Greenwood, a criminal justice expert from RAND in Santa Monica, 
testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee that he sees little 
evidence that tougher laws have much deterrent effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasconcellos issued an analysis showing that the biggest cost of the 
initiative is due to the inclusion of residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 If burglars are excluded, the cost of the initiative would be cut by 
two-thirds, from more than $1 billion in 1999 if burglaries are counted, to 
$313 million that year if burglaries are not included.

U.S. JETS DOWN 4 BOSNIAN SERB PLANES TO ENFORCE 'NO-FLY' ZONE; BALKANS: THE 
INTRUDING AIRCRAFT HAD REPORTEDLY BOMBED MUSLIM TARGETS. THE CONFRONTATION IS 
THE FIRST USE OF WESTERN FORCE IN THE CONFLICT AND NATO'S FIRST OFFENSIVE 
ACTION EVER.

<P>
 Adding a new dimension to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Air Force planes 
early Monday attacked six Bosnian Serb aircraft, shooting down four of them 
after they had reportedly bombed targets in government-controlled areas of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials at NATO headquarters here, the attack was carried out 
by two U.S. F-16 planes enforcing a U.N.-imposed "no-fly" zone, which has been 
in effect over Bosnia since October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilots issued, in accordance with their rules of engagement, two 'land or 
be engaged' orders to the aircraft which ignored them," declared a North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization statement. "The NATO (F-16s) engaged the planes, 
shooting down four of them." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference later in the day at NATO's Southern European headquarters 
in Naples, Italy, U.S. Adm. Jeremy Boorda cited unconfirmed reports that just 
prior to the F-16s' attack, the Serbian planes had dropped as many as eight 
bombs, hitting a hospital and a storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO attack marks a series of important firsts: 
</P>
<P>
 * After seemingly endless diplomatic activity to end the messy Balkans war, 
Monday's attack has for the first time brought Western military power to bear 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 * After more than 1,000 previous Serbian violations of the "no-fly" zone, NATO 
aircraft used force for the first time to enforce the 16-month-old U.N. ban. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the first time in its 44-year history, NATO forces were engaged in 
offensive military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make clear that NATO has a new task of ensuring stability and 
peacekeeping within the United Nations framework," NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner said Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident reportedly occurred over Bosnian government-controlled areas in 
the center of the republic, after the Bosnian Serb craft took off from the city 
of Banja Luka, about 80 miles northwest of Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance spokesman said the F-16s returned safely to their base at Aviano, 
Italy, but the fate of the Serbian aircraft crews was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters as he departed the White House for a trip to Chicago and 
Pittsburgh, President Clinton stressed that Serbian planes had been warned 
before the attack. "Every attempt was made, to the best of my information, to 
avoid this encounter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major, in the United States for talks with 
Clinton, was more forceful: "There was no reason for these planes to be there. 
They were there for hostile intent." 
</P>
<P>
 While Monday's attack has certainly altered the military equation of the 
Balkans war, it was not immediately clear exactly how it will affect efforts to 
end the conflict. Bosnian Serb forces were reported to have launched a fierce 
assault on the northern city of Tuzla after word spread that four of their 
aircraft had been downed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Western news agencies in Tuzla reported heavy shelling late Monday 
morning, it remained unclear whether the NATO action would prompt a wide-scale 
intensification of assaults around the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts expect NATO's action to have a deterrent effect on Bosnian Serb 
forces, who have been allowed to violate numerous U.N. Security Council 
resolutions with impunity, which has emboldened them to press on with their 
offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on German television Monday evening, Woerner supported this view. 
The incident involving the NATO attack "will not lead to an escalation but just 
the opposite," he said. "People will learn to respect NATO." 
</P>
<P>
 The downed planes were identified by NATO officials here as Soko G-4 Galeb 
attack aircraft and were believed to be part of the Bosnian Serb air force. The 
Super Galeb was designed as a trainer by the former Yugoslav government. But 
since the breakup of Yugoslavia began nearly three years ago, it has been used 
by Serbian forces in Slovenia in 1991 and in the bombardment of the Croatian 
port of Dubrovnik the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Institute of Strategic Studies in London reports that 
Bosnian Serb forces have about 20 such aircraft. "They haven't been flying a 
great deal, and of course that reduces the performance of their pilots," noted 
Ken Petri, an air warfare specialist at the institute. "They were certainly no 
match for the F-16s." 
</P>
<P>
 Start to finish, NATO's first-ever attack lasted a total of 20 cold minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian jets had barely gotten off the ground from Banja Luka when they 
were sighted and pursued, according to Boorda, who, as commander of Operation 
Deny Flight, has overall responsibility for enforcing the "no-fly" zone. Boorda 
told a news conference at his headquarters in Naples that the American jets 
were not fired upon. The American pilots did not see any of the pilots of the 
four destroyed planes eject, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 American military officials and diplomats, unable to fully explain why the 
Serbs launched an aerial raid in violation of NATO's "no-fly" zone, surmised 
that it may have been part of a concerted effort to test NATO's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb planes that set out to bomb a Muslim-run munitions factory -- 
their first fixed-wing aircraft to break the "no-fly" zone since it was set up 
16 months ago -- were antiquated, conspicuous and incapable of defending 
themselves against the NATO fighters patrolling the zone, U.S. military 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials speculated that the mission could have been merely a foolish move by 
a sometimes disorganized Serbian force. Or, more seriously, it might have been 
an calculated effort to see whether NATO would look the other way rather than 
fire in anger for the first time in the organization's 44-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said that the speculation among 
Administration officials "ranges from clear stupidity to some effort to test" 
NATO's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was a test," said Boorda, "I think we passed a quiz. I hope that there 
is also a lesson learned. When you take a test, you get a critique at the end. 
And the critique here is that you really ought not to violate the 'no-fly' 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering in Moscow gave a complete 
briefing to the Russian Foreign Ministry on details of the combat. Although 
Russia generally sympathizes with Serbia, McCurry said the Russians did not 
criticize enforcement of the "no-fly" zone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Balkans mediator Charles Redman telephoned Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaly S. Churkin to provide a status report on peace talks being held 
in Washington among the Muslim-led Bosnian government, Bosnian Croats and the 
Croatian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Clinton Administration, realizing that Russia is extremely 
sensitive about the Bosnian conflict, is determined to keep Moscow fully 
informed about U.S. and NATO action in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to use armed force against Bosnian combatants for the first time 
in the 23-month-old conflict seems to have caught all factions on the ground by 
surprise. International aid agencies had just within the past few days sent 
back the dozens of Bosnian field workers evacuated as a safety precaution 
before a Feb. 21 NATO deadline for withdrawal of Bosnian Serb artillery from 
around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO had threatened to launch air strikes against any heavy guns left within 
the 12-mile exclusion zone, and senior Bosnian Serb military officers had 
warned that they might retaliate by taking aid workers or foreign journalists 
hostage in the event their weapons were hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody had advance notice this was going to happen," Ron 
Redmond, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
office in Geneva, replied when asked if relief agencies had been warned that 
NATO planned to finally enforce the "no-fly" order. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee agency, which delivers humanitarian aid on which virtually all of 
the surviving population of Bosnia depends, immediately suspended its airlift 
of food into Sarajevo and all road convoys that would have passed through 
Serb-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 violations of the "no-fly" zone have been recorded by NATO 
warplanes since they began four-times-daily patrols over Bosnia last April in a 
symbolic show of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The air-exclusion zone over Bosnia actually dates to October, 1992, when the 
Security Council imposed the "no-fly" order to express international 
condemnation of Serbian aggression. Only Bosnian Serb forces had combat 
aircraft at that time, although Bosnian Croats have since acquired helicopter 
gunships from their patrons in neighboring Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross also received no advance warning 
that NATO planned to target violators of the "no-fly" zone. It canceled all aid 
convoys and ordered its 25 field workers in the Banja Luka area to stay in the 
office, said Jetta Sorensen, public affairs officer for the Red Cross in the 
Croatian capital, Zagreb. She expressed concern for relief workers' safety in 
the wake of the NATO attack in one of the Serb-held regions most hostile to 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Banja Luka is the most ardently nationalist stronghold in Bosnian Serb-held 
territory, which now spans 70% of the former Yugoslav republic. It has been the 
launch pad for some of the most vicious applications of "ethnic cleansing," 
including mass incarcerations of Muslim males and organized rape campaigns 
against Muslim women. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters of the U.N. Protection Force for the Balkans, in Zagreb, was 
thrown into disarray by NATO's sudden action, sources at the sprawling compound 
said. One senior officer confirmed that the U.N. mission was not consulted 
prior to the NATO decision to shoot at the Bosnian Serb aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned about it as it happened," the officer said of mission headquarters 
in Zagreb. "It all came down in a couple of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 But after months of daily flouting of the U.N. "no-fly" order, suspicion 
surfaced that NATO's belated move to enforce the ban on combatant air 
operations was exercised at least in part out of frustration with the thwarted 
alliance effort to lift the artillery cordon strangling Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Feb. 21 deadline expired a week ago without full compliance, mortars 
have been fired within the allegedly demilitarized zone and new discoveries of 
Serbian rebel weapons caches have been made by the dozens each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Such motives were hotly denied by a senior NATO official here, who claimed 
that on previous violations, it was unclear what the Serbian aircraft were 
doing and that on all previous occasions they immediately obeyed warnings to 
land. "Today was different," the official said. "NATO pilots clearly saw these 
aircraft were bombing, and then they disregarded the warnings to land." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda also noted that the incident marked the first time there had been any 
long sorties by warring factions since the U.N.-ordered air embargo of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina began. "We hope this will be the final such incident of this 
tragic war," Boorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Security Council Resolution 816 clearly authorized NATO to fire on 
aircraft violating the "no-fly" zone, NATO officials had in practice deeded the 
final decision on whether to use force to the commander of the U.N. Protection 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior source at mission headquarters in Zagreb said NATO had at least twice 
sought permission to shoot down aircraft in clear violation of the "no-fly" 
order but that the move had been vetoed by the U.N. force commander because the 
use of force against any one side could endanger some of the 12,000 U.N. troops 
on the ground in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops are charged now only with escorting humanitarian aid in Bosnia and 
have no peacekeeping or peacemaking responsibilities. Because they are deployed 
with a mandate to remain neutral, any move by NATO or a U.N. member state to 
take action against any particular faction raises concern that the lightly 
armed troops could become targets for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall reported from Brussels and Williams from Vienna. Times staff writers 
William D. Montalbano in Rome and Richard Serrano in Washington contributed to 
this report. Showdown in the sky 
</P>
<P>
 The five-minute attack was the first use of military force by NATO in its 
44-year history. It began at 9:45 p.m. Pacific time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW: Bosnian Serb attack aircraft were intercepted by U.S. F-16s and shot down 
after two warnings, U.S. and NASTO officials said. One U.S. F-16 shot down 
three Serb planes with air-to-air missiles and a second F-16 destroyed a 
fourth. Two other Serb planes escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: The incident took place in central Bosnia and involved Serbian planes 
from Banja Luka. The U.S. planes are based at Aviano Air Base in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 WHY: Sources said the Serb planes had tried to attack a munitions factory. The 
incident came in the U.N.-sanctioned "no-fly" zone, which covers all of Bosnia. 
The 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed last April to enforce 
the zone to keep the skies over Bosnia clear of all non-authorized flights.

 In Russia's first diplomatic tiff with Washington since the Cold War's end, 
Moscow expelled a senior American diplomat Monday in retaliation for last 
week's ouster of a Russian envoy from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Foreign Ministry identified diplomat James L. Morris, listed as a 
counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, as the CIA station chief here. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin expressed regret over the incident 
but said Moscow was "forced" to respond to the "unjust" expulsion Friday of 
Alexander I. Lysenko, the suspected Russian intelligence chief in Washington, 
in connection with the Ames espionage affair. CIA official Aldrich H. Ames and 
his wife have been arrested on charges of spying for Moscow since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris is the first American to be declared persona non grata since Lt. Col. 
Daniel Francis Van Gundy III, an assistant military attache, was accused of 
espionage on March 15, 1989, and given 48 hours to leave the Soviet Union. The 
United States retaliated by expelling Sergei Malinin, a Soviet trade 
representative in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar tit for tat, Morris will be given seven days to leave the 
country, the same grace period the Clinton Administration extended to Lysenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lysenko arrived in Washington only last summer, the United States 
decided to expel him because "he was in a position to be responsible for the 
activities associated with the Ames case," State Department spokesman Mike 
McCurry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vague linkage irritated Russian officials, who suggested again that 
Washington has overreacted to the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 "To expel an officer who was officially recognized and not a covert agent goes 
beyond the boundaries and really calls for countermeasures," Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev said in a television interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed briefing for Russian reporters, Yevgeny M. Primakov, head of the 
Federal Intelligence Service, the agency that conducts foreign espionage, said 
he is baffled by the fuss Washington has made over the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 Primakov suggested that the Administration was using the Ames arrest to score 
domestic political points, to punish Russia for its independent stance on the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to provide a convenient excuse for cutting 
American aid to Russia, according to journalists who attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The spy chief also reportedly found it peculiar that while Thomas R. 
Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, officially protested the Ames case, 
Pickering has not inquired about the fate of 10 agents for the CIA who were 
supposedly exposed by Ames, then arrested and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings between Russian intelligence officials and a CIA team sent here 
to assess the damage done by Ames were unsatisfactory to both sides, Primakov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Primakov and other officials said that the expulsions should not damage 
U.S.-Russian relations and that he remains willing to cooperate with America to 
fight terrorism, drug trafficking and other mutual threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, McCurry said Monday that the Administration protested the 
expulsion of the American diplomat, but he said Washington has no plans to kick 
out another Russian as a counter-retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin struck a conciliatory 
tone, saying that conflict between Russia and the West is inevitable but can be 
resolved if problems are not overdramatized. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Foreign Ministry tried to put the espionage case to rest, rumors 
swept the intelligence community that Ames was unmasked not by an FBI 
investigation triggered by the couple's lavish spending but by an American mole 
in the former KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 These rumors were fueled by President Boris N. Yeltsin's dismissal Monday of 
Nikolai M. Golushko, head of the other KGB successor agency, the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, which is charged with rooting out foreign spies in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources said Golushko was fired after the Kremlin realized Russian 
intelligence had been compromised by a well-placed turncoat. The official 
reason for Golushko's dismissal was given as "family illness, " as his wife is 
reported to be seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no shortage of other theories about Golushko's dismissal. The 
Itar-Tass news agency suggested that he may have been ousted for perceived 
disloyalty after allowing Yeltsin's political foes to be released from 
Lefortovo Prison on Saturday.

SPORTS MOGUL MCNALL'S GOLDEN TOUCH LOSES LUSTER; BUSINESS: HE TURNED L.A. ON TO 
HOCKEY. BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE HIT HIS LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From an Arcadia high school student who made money trading Roman coins to a 
sports mogul whose Los Angeles Kings nearly won professional hockey's Stanley 
Cup last year, Bruce P. McNall has projected an image of glittery success. 
</P>
<P>
 With his open checkbook McNall spent millions to lure such star athletes as 
Wayne Gretzky to his Kings and former Notre Dame star Raghib (Rocket) Ismail to 
his Canadian football team, the Toronto Argonauts. McNall brought Hollywood to 
hockey, schmoozing at games with the likes of actress Goldie Hawn, actor James 
Woods and former President Ronald Reagan. Along the way, the beefy, 
wisecracking, personable McNall was lauded as a wildly successful sports 
entrepreneur whose popularity and spending knew no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent developments suggest that McNall may have hit some limits. In 
December, he announced a deal involving new investors to whom he will sell a 
majority interest in his treasured Kings -- a move once considered unthinkable 
-- largely to pay off a bank loan. The exact percentage has not been disclosed 
publicly, but sources with knowledge of the deal told The Times that McNall is 
selling 65% of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending sale of part of the Kings has stirred interest in McNall's 
financial well-being. McNall, 43, said "there are no problems" with his 
finances and that he is eagerly looking forward to building an arena for the 
Kings that may be shared with the Lakers. He said he is the victim of negative 
rumors orchestrated by unidentified parties who would like to see the Kings 
deal fall apart "for their own benefit and profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Separating the fact from rumor, it is easy to see that McNall has had a rather 
challenging year. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * He helped engineer a deal that brought a National Hockey League team to 
Orange County this season. He will receive $25 million over several years for 
giving up exclusivity in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creditors sued him after he allegedly defaulted on a bank loan and failed to 
pay a Hollywood studio that alleged he owed money. 
</P>
<P>
 * A business partner filed a lawsuit charging that McNall improperly used 
company money for other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 * His dream of bringing championship hockey to Los Angeles was realized when 
the Kings played in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 * His rare coin business, which does well in inflationary and boom times, has 
fallen prey to the soft national economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to all this the money-losing Canadian football team, a steep debt level 
and a Forum lease that limits McNall's ability to profit from the Kings' 
popularity and you have an atmosphere worthy of closer examination. Selling the 
Kings 
</P>
<P>
 McNall and his lawyers are working hard to close the $60-million agreement to 
sell the controlling interest in the Kings. The buyers are Los Angeles 
telecommunications entrepreneur Jeffrey Sudikoff and his associate, Joseph 
Cohen. McNall chose Sudikoff, chief executive of IDB Communications, over an 
affiliate of Sony Corp. Sony only wanted to buy a minority interest in the 
Kings, as well as a piece of the Lakers basketball team from owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative deal says a lot about the changing fortunes of someone who was 
lecturing audiences three years ago for $48 a head on "Turning Your Passions 
Into Profits." He will soon be left with a much smaller piece of his most 
passionate investment, the Kings. As recently as last season, McNall said he 
would not consider selling them. Under a clause in the complex deal, sources 
said, McNall conceivably could buy back up to 80% of the Kings on favorable 
terms if an arena is ever built, although Sudikoff and his partner would own 
most of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that McNall may be unable to continue calling all the shots 
for the Kings as he does now. Both McNall and Sudikoff said McNall will 
continue to run the team as something of a managing partner even after the deal 
is completed. But Sudikoff said in an interview he won't be a passive partner. 
"I'm definitely an interested investor. I'm not just a financial investor. I'm 
not doing this because I think it's fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said the partial sale is necessary to help him achieve a longtime goal 
of building a $150-million state-of-the-art arena in the Los Angeles area that 
gives the Kings more revenue opportunities than they have at the 27-year-old 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale also would give McNall financial breathing room. The heart of the 
sale involves helping McNall shed his biggest creditor, Bank of America, which 
had agreed to extend up to $90 million in loans and credit to McNall's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking sources, creditors and people close to McNall confirm that McNall's 
business predicaments prompted Bank of America executives recently to move his 
loan to an internal special assets unit, which specializes in handling loans 
that are of special concern to the bank. Banking sources say such a move is no 
small matter and indicates that B of A executives are concerned about the 
prospects of the loan being repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is expected to receive most, if not all, of the $60 million that 
Sudikoff is paying and possibly a part ownership in the new arena, if it is 
built. A McNall lawyer said that when the Kings' deal is completed, McNall will 
be free of the Bank of America loan. McNall and his aides said they have an 
"excellent relationship" with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A McNall spokesman said that McNall officials have received no notice "of any 
change in the status of our account" and "want to make it clear that we are not 
in default." A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment, citing company 
policy about discussing specific customers. The Lawsuits 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has a variety of other business and creditor problems, including these 
recent predicaments detailed in public records: 
</P>
<P>
 * McNall, who in the past has represented his net worth at as much as $200 
million, was sued last October by Torrance-based Republic Bank for defaulting 
on a loan requiring him to pay $1.875 million last May. In a sworn statement, 
Republic Vice President Lee Marzahl refers to McNall's "apparent illiquidity," 
or the inability to convert assets quickly into cash. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he was not aware of the Republic loan default until The Times 
asked him about it. He sees it as a minor amount of money for him -- roughly 
the same as recently reacquired Kings' defenseman Marty McSorley makes in a 
season -- and denies that he is experiencing liquidity problems. A settlement 
is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox has obtained a court order attaching a 
lien on McNall's assets, alleging that McNall is 17 months late in paying $4.5 
million the studio said he owes. The money in question stems from the failure 
of "Mannequin II," a movie that Fox released for Gladden Entertainment, a 
production company McNall owns with former Columbia Pictures studio chief David 
Begelman that has produced such films as "The Fabulous Baker Boys" and 
"WarGames." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzan A. Waks, McNall's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said McNall 
is suing Fox as well for allegedly mishandling the film's release. She called 
Fox's court order "a negotiating ploy with Bruce" and said that McNall "has a 
very good relationship with the people at Fox despite the fact they've been 
arguing back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 * A coin partnership organized through Merrill Lynch by McNall called Athena 
II is also faltering. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the 
fund lost $9.2 million in the first nine months of last year as the value of 
the fund's coins plunged. SEC documents list the equity of limited partners in 
the venture as tumbling from $17.5 million at the start of last year to $8.5 
million Sept. 30, a drop of more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall acknowledges that the coin market has been slow, but said it is 
improving. He said Athena made money for investors early on, adding that he 
chose to liquidate it so investors' money would not be eaten away by overhead 
costs to run the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * McNall was named in a lawsuit filed last month by his partners at Superior 
Stamp & Coin in Beverly Hills, one of the nation's top auction houses and 
traders in rare coins, stamps, antiques and memorabilia. Co-Presidents Ira and 
Lawrence Goldberg alleged in a recently settled lawsuit that McNall used $4.6 
million from a bank credit line because he "desperately needed funds to 
maintain his other ventures and his extraordinary life style." 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Goldberg alleged in a sworn statement that McNall "falsified Superior's 
1993 year-end inventory statement with the intent to mislead Superior's 
auditors and the Bank of California" by listing as Superior inventory -- and 
therefore as collateral -- coins that Goldberg said belonged to a 
McNall-organized coin fund. It was also alleged in the lawsuit that McNall 
overvalued a personal stamp collection that served as collateral for a bank 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither McNall nor the Goldbergs are allowed to discuss the terms of their 
settlement, although it is believed that McNall and the Goldbergs are severing 
their business ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the lawsuit was settled, McNall called it "a desperate move on their 
part to save a failing business" the Goldbergs were running, further alleging 
that they resisted such moves as cutting their salaries. As to Ira Goldberg's 
accusations, McNall lawyer Kenneth N. Klee said that the Goldbergs' lawsuit was 
filled with "inflammatory statements capable of being misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Goldbergs sent a letter to The Times saying that their 
allegations "should not be regarded as proven facts." They added that they 
"have both personal affection and great respect" for McNall and do not want to 
see him harmed by the allegations they have made. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall believes that talk about possible business difficulties may have been 
sparked by a decision to hire Klee, one of the nation's top bankruptcy lawyers 
at Stutman, Treister & Glatt in Los Angeles. McNall and Klee said there are no 
plans in the works calling for McNall to seek protection in bankruptcy court. 
McNall added that he hired Klee not for his bankruptcy expertise, but because 
"he's the best negotiator I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Klee clearly strengthens McNall's hand at the bargaining table, according to 
people who have been dealing with him. Klee has played important roles in some 
of the nation's biggest bankruptcy cases, such as Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 Klee's mere presence implies that McNall has the ability to file for 
bankruptcy court protection. Court records in the Superior Stamp & Coin case 
show that an order was entered barring McNall from forcing Superior into 
bankruptcy. The Image 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has clearly revived the Kings, which he bought into in 1986 and took 
control of two years later from former owner Buss. Before the Kings, McNall was 
a little-known Beverly Hills coin collector and racehorse owner, where he 
enjoyed some success in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely through the 1988 acquisition of superstar Gretzky, McNall turned an 
indifferent Los Angeles on to the sport. McNall built the Kings from a team 
losing an estimated $5 million annually before he bought it to one that last 
year netted an estimated $2 million, aided by playoff revenue. Once lucky to 
sell out the Forum, the Kings this season are selling about 95% of the seats at 
home games, more often than not selling all 16,005 seats even with their 
playoff hopes fading. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Kings' popularity increased, the gregarious McNall has become something 
of a celebrity, in contrast to other Los Angeles sports team owners who often 
shun the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 In near 90-degree heat last summer, McNall, dressed as usual in a dark suit, 
appeared at Magic Mountain in Valencia at an event honoring the Kings. He stood 
for the brief presentation and signed autographs for the better part of half an 
hour in the sweltering sun. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also marketed the team in a way that substantially boosted sales of 
such items as Kings shirts and caps, changing the colors from a garish purple 
and gold to a trendier silver and black. All told, the team, which McNall spent 
about $20 million to acquire, would have an indicated value of about $100 
million based on the pending transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also climbed meteorically within hockey circles, and was elected in 
1992 to the powerful post of chairman of the National Hockey League's board of 
governors. In that post, he helped the NHL shed its blue-collar image by wooing 
to the league such prominent executives as Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner of Anaheim's Mighty Ducks and Blockbuster Video tycoon H. Wayne Huizenga 
of the Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also became popular with the press, which enjoyed his playfulness, 
quips and spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 After buying the Kings, McNall suggested that someone shoot him if he ever 
started acting like notoriously autocratic New York Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner. After a Kings' victory in the playoffs last spring, McNall 
grabbed a reporter's note pad and pen and yelled from the back of the room at 
head coach Barry Melrose: "Coach! You earned your salary tonight, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even while feeling the pressure of business difficulties, he has maintained a 
sense of humor. Last month, McNall abruptly began walking up and down the 
aisle, soliciting dollar bills from reporters in the middle of a news 
conference marking McSorley's return, joking that he needed the money. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Kings prospered, however, McNall has grown more restless. He is locked 
into a long-term lease with the Forum and Lakers owner Buss that gives Buss a 
lucrative chunk of concession sales, parking fees and "Senate" seat packages 
often bought by businesses. McNall's limited potential to make money off the 
Kings is driving his desire for a new arena. Sources familiar with the Kings 
estimate that McNall spends about $100,000 a game paying Buss a percentage of 
ticket sales, rent and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall believed that he could turn around the Toronto Argonauts in the 
Canadian Football League in much the same way he did the Kings. He and his 
partners -- Gretzky and actor John Candy -- have sunk about $22.5 million into 
the Toronto team since 1991. McNall, in a four-year, $18.2-million personal 
services contract, signed Ismail, who now plays for the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Such moves generated plenty of publicity, but no profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts, through the fall and most of the winter, were in default for 
rent to the Toronto SkyDome, where it plays. The team made good last month on 
about $300,000 in back rent. SkyDome President Richard Peddie said the payments 
came only after considerable pressure was applied. One player, who was 
eventually paid as promised the $25,000 he was owed, was so concerned about the 
rumors of team problems said that he camped out for a week in January in the 
Argonauts' lobby, serving doughnuts to the team staff while waiting for his 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he would entertain offers for the football team, but denies that 
the team has been on the market and insists that he wants to retain a piece of 
the team no matter what happens. Sources close to his other partners, however, 
say the entire team has been openly shopped around for as much as $8 million. 
Whatever the sale price, McNall and his partners still must settle up with the 
team's previous owner, Hollywood Park Vice Chairman Harry Ornest, who holds a 
note of about $2.5 million stemming from the 1991 transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowness in payments is not necessarily a sign of trouble for a company. Even 
some robust business owners are slow in paying bills as part of a hardball 
strategy in managing cash. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has seemingly tested the patience of some creditors, the SkyDome being 
one. The Kings have even been late in paying one of its hockey stick suppliers, 
the Canadian manufacturer Sherwood, which is known to have twice put a hold on 
shipments to the Kings before Sherwood was paid about $30,000. Asked about 
Sherwood, McNall said that there is "nothing that is extraordinarily late" in 
terms of unpaid bills for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's problems might reflect a typical high-flying 1980s entrepreneur 
encountering tougher times in the 1990s, if it were not for a carefully 
cultivated image that has portrayed him as an overachieving Midas. The son of a 
USC biochemistry professor and a laboratory technician, McNall grew up in 
Arcadia, later saying he developed a fascination with rare coins in grade 
school. The 1966 Arcadia High School yearbook pictures him as president of the 
school's coin club. 
</P>
<P>
 It is after high school that McNall's story gets cloudy, and records suggest 
that McNall and his staff are guilty of a good amount of hyperbole over the 
years. His official Kings biography said that he zoomed through UCLA in three 
years starting at 16, graduating with his bachelor's degree at a remarkably 
early age of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA spokesman said school records list him as graduating in 1972 at age 22. 
Asked about the discrepancy between his UCLA claims and school records, McNall 
said: "I went through UCLA quickly. I ended up being a (teaching assistant) 
prior to graduating and got a Regents Fellowship and the next step was going on 
to a doctorate. I honestly can't remember the precise date of all that." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I don't sit there and look at the Kings' bio records. I probably 
should, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall called this and other past challenges to his biography technical 
differences misinterpreted by reporters. Other challenges have came from Forbes 
magazine, which in 1991 disputed McNall's Oxford studies claim as well as some 
other key business boasts. "These legends just get greater and greater. They're 
just not correct," Forbes quoted McNall as saying when asked about the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's net worth also has been a source of considerable controversy. McNall 
has said he is worth "$150 million to $200 million," as he was quoted by The 
Times in 1989, to "hundreds of millions" of dollars, as he was quoted as saying 
to Business Week in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Stamp & Coin lawsuit alleges that in 1989 McNall stated his 
assets at a considerably lower amount when he bought a 51% stake in the 
business. The papers said McNall said his assets "exceeded $40 million and that 
his current assets exceeded current liabilities by $20 million." Forbes once 
concluded that McNall was worth only a fraction of what he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he still is worth a substantial amount of money, but will not say 
how much. Explaining why his net worth was always reported high, McNall said: 
"Probably what happened was that the reporter said to me, 'All right, is it 
true you are worth $100 or $150 or $200 million?' I've always said I have no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also acknowledged that he is very much a salesman and sometimes gets 
carried away in telling stories. Besides, he said, it is not so bad in the 
collectibles and horse racing business if people think you have more money than 
you really do because people offer you more deals. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall and his advisers admit that he is a soft touch. McNall has one business 
tendency his advisers are trying to cure him of him, that of routinely 
guaranteeing loans and payments personally when it may not be necessary. That 
puts McNall on the hook personally if the person or company cannot pay it back. 
McNall calls it "a character flaw." Vice Chairman Waks said she "took his pen 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said: "I've had various partners and I've put a lot of faith in them. 
When they ask me to do something, all too often I guess I've said yes. My 
advisers over the many years said, 'You shouldn't be doing that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McNall traces some of his current problems to an image that he said was too 
inflated to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world always builds you up and then it's more fun to try to tear it 
down," McNall said. "In a way, in my eyes, I was never as successful as the 
public made me to be. And certainly today, not nearly in the position as 
possibly others made me to be. It's the nature of the beast, in a way."

THOUSANDS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN OFFICER'S COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of police and friends gathered Monday at a funeral for rookie Police 
Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton -- less to mourn her death at the hands of a 
teen-age assassin than to celebrate her as a woman whose refusal to let go of 
her dream inspired them. 
</P>
<P>
 They faced without flinching the fact that Hamilton's dream -- of becoming a 
Los Angeles police officer just like her father -- but at the age of 45 -- cost 
her her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton became the second female Los Angeles police officer to die in the 
line of duty when she was shot last Tuesday after four weeks on the force. She 
had graduated from the Police Academy just four days before she died with an 
award as the most inspirational cadet in her class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of you are experiencing guilt for what happened to Christy," said Sgt. 
Ron Moen, a Los Angeles Police Department chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was her lifelong dream, and nothing any of you could have done would 
have discouraged her from pursuing that dream. . . . Christy would have wanted 
to die doing what she loved most -- being a police officer in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 As family members and colleagues praised Hamilton's pluck and her courage to 
start such a demanding career comparatively late in life, her younger 
classmates sat behind her flag-draped coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others in the audience, they smiled at speakers' tales of her 
foibles, her sense of humor and her passion for the job, and brushed away tears 
at reminders of her lost potential and her sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends offered their condolences after the memorial service and a 21-gun 
salute. Kenneth Brondell said his daughter's first career as a mother of two 
children, now grown, would have made her a cop with a sense of compassion 
unlike most others. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have worn it (a badge) without arrogance. She didn't want a badge 
to have authority; she wanted to go out and help people," Brondell said. "It's 
just too bad it got cut short." 
</P>
<P>
 Moen also praised Hamilton's maternal instincts and compassion, saying she 
once spent a few hours with two toddlers left homeless after she arrested their 
parents on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside of her was a heart so big I'm surprised her body was able to keep it 
all," the chaplain told the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams, Gov. Pete Wilson and more than 3,500 police officers 
from as far away as Oklahoma City attended the emotional farewell to Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 In services at the Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, and later at Forest 
Lawn Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills, friends and colleagues paid one 
tribute after another to Hamilton, the fourth Southern California police 
officer to die in the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a tragedy that we're here," Williams, who was visibly touched by 
the ceremonies, said at the hillside grave site. "It's the fifth officer killed 
in the line of duty in the 20 months I've been here. It's just a tragedy. And 
it's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was killed early last Tuesday when she was struck by a bullet fired 
by Christopher Golly, a 17-year-old Northridge youth who killed his father, 
then lay in wait to ambush arriving police officers. Hamilton was hit by one 
bullet through the armhole of her bullet-resistant vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was described Monday as a fighter, who refused to let her age keep 
her from completing the rigorous Police Academy training. When she realized she 
would have to prove she could scale a six-foot wall to graduate, she built one 
herself in the back yard of her Thousand Oaks home, and went through one 
bruising practice run after another until she made it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your maturity and desire were unspoken inspirations -- it was a determination 
that we drew from as a class," Linda Thompson, drill instructor for Hamilton's 
class at the academy, said at the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 "You taught us all to keep our dreams alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley Steven, 24, Hamilton's daughter, recalled in a eulogy that when 
Hamilton first said she wanted to become a police officer after the LAPD's age 
ceiling was lifted last year, Steven thought her mother was going through a 
midlife crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me if she was crazy to become a police officer," Steven said, 
stopping often to compose herself. "I thought she didn't have a chance. But you 
can never tell my mom she's incapable of anything. She will prove you wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, crying openly, Steven -- the last from her family to speak -- told 
mourners to "conquer your hardships with (Hamilton's) determination . . . laugh 
at yourselves with her sense of humor . . . and face every day with her 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, you lived and died a hero," she said. "I love you. We all love you. And 
we will miss you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton is also survived by a son, William Steven, 20, and her husband, Steve 
Hamilton, a Los Angeles firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since her death, Hamilton's slaying has become a national symbol 
of violent crime. President Clinton has mentioned her death several times in 
public speeches, and on Monday had a hand-written letter delivered to her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, becoming a policewoman was the beginning 
of a new life and the fulfillment of a dream -- one she put off until after she 
raised her two children," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying also has prompted calls for tighter controls on military-appearing 
semiautomatic rifles like the one Golly used to kill his father and then 
Hamilton before he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly and his 49-year-old father, Steven, are to be buried side by side today 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, family, friends and colleagues filed past Hamilton's gold-hued 
casket, where she lay in her blue dress uniform, a single rose resting atop 
clasped hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamilton's death also has touched many others who did not know her that 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Paggi, who works at the Revolver Club -- a combination store, bar and 
restaurant at the academy -- went Sunday to pay her respects to a woman she 
knew only as an occasional customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was my age and I admired her for doing what some 25-year-old guys can't 
do," Paggi said, choking back tears. "It's not just us, the whole city lost 
out."

PLO TO SEEK U.S. HELP IN PRESSURING ISRAELIS; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS WANT CURBS 
ON JEWISH SETTLERS BEFORE TALKS RESUME. JERUSALEM ALSO VIES FOR SUPPORT. 
</P>

<P>
 As Israel sought U.S. assistance in preserving advances made so far in 
negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and with its Arab 
neighbors, PLO officials said Monday that they will probably send a delegation 
to Washington to push for more curbs on Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied 
territories as a prelude to resuming stalled peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding two days of crisis talks after last week's massacre of 48 
Palestinians in a Hebron mosque, the PLO Executive Committee was preparing to 
name a small group of envoys to meet with Clinton Administration officials to 
try to win support for further security controls on Israeli settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO said it will also ask the United States to press for international 
protection forces in the occupied territories and a full investigation, under 
international auspices, of the Israeli army's role in the attack and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have announced that they are also pulling out of the 
peace talks in response to the massacre, the worst incident of violence in 
Israel's 27-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to understand the whole peace process has lost its credibility," 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said in an interview early today. "We are not asking 
for the moon. From the beginning, we have only been asking for the accurate and 
honest implementation of the Declaration of Principles we signed in September." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat said he will make a decision on the delegation to Washington after 
meeting today with a special envoy dispatched by Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat said that the Palestinians expect the Americans to exert the necessary 
pressure on Israel to make it possible to resume the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO information department, warned that "either 
we get guarantees or the Palestinian people will not back anymore the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, officials also warned they will not make major concessions out of a 
sense of guilt for the massacre in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Although senior Israeli officials said they had anticipated that the PLO and 
the other Arabs would suspend the talks to protest the massacre at a West Bank 
mosque last week by an Israeli settler, they said they were not confident of 
Israel's ability to restart them without U.S. mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, directly, would have a hard time persuading the Syrians and the Lebanese 
to return to the talks," Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said. "And 
concerning the PLO, this would not be easy, not at all. The next step should be 
the intervention of the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States 
is ready to discuss the tattered peace process with PLO envoys. But he gave no 
indication that the Administration will pressure Israel into new concessions to 
meet the Palestinians' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said the PLO's key demand for international observers to protect 
Palestinian civilians from Israeli settlers could be met by modifying a 
provision -- originally intended to send in international economic advisers -- 
of the agreement Israel and the PLO signed in Washington last September. But he 
made it clear that the United States will not pressure Israel to accept that 
interpretation of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's plea for U.S. intervention overrides its strong preference previously 
for direct negotiations with the PLO and other Arabs. Western diplomats 
suggested that it reflected serious concern by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin that the gains so arduously won in recent months might be lost as a 
result of the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to the Israeli Parliament on Monday, Rabin pledged to "continue the 
peacemaking.. . . We will accelerate the talks, the contacts and the 
negotiations, and even if it takes time, peace will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing Palestinians, Rabin said: "We are near to the conclusion of the 
next stage in the negotiations for peace. We already see the finish line. A 
little more effort, a little more readiness, a little more goodwill by you, the 
Palestinians, and by us, and we will be victorious. We have no other path, only 
that of peace. There is nothing without it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin ruled out major concessions in response to the massacre or to get 
the talks restarted. "The abominable murder in Hebron and the feeling of loss 
and sorrow will not change our fundamental positions regarding the security of 
Israel and its citizens, including the Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria 
(the West Bank) and the Gaza Strip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in discussions with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Rabin relented on the 
question of the international peacekeeping force demanded by the PLO, according 
to Israeli officials; he would accept such a contingent if it was agreed to in 
negotiations on Palestinian self-government. Israel would continue to reject an 
international force sent as a result of a U.N. resolution, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many PLO officials are calling for an end to the "Gaza-Jericho first" 
agreement signed in September calling for an interim period of self-rule in two 
enclaves of the occupied territories. But Arafat has clearly been looking for a 
realistic set of demands that would allow the negotiations, which had been near 
fruition before the massacre, to get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's pledge over the weekend to crack down on extremist settlers, 
arresting their leaders and disarming their most dangerous elements, has met 
with an unwelcome reception in Tunis, where PLO officials believe the measure 
will do nothing to protect Palestinians from the large number of armed settlers 
who do not belong to those groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting yesterday they would have something from the (Israeli) 
Cabinet to cool down the situation," Arafat said. "But as we say in Arabic, 
'What came down from the mountain? A mouse.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Abed-Rabbo emphasized that the demand for security "is not an offer" but a 
bottom line. "This is not a bargaining question. The safety of every single 
Palestinian is not a question of bargaining or negotiation." He said that 
without these guarantees, "this is something that might motivate us to ask our 
people to carry weapons in order to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials said the envoys would not meet with Israeli officials but would 
meet with the Administration "to discuss requirements for resumption of the 
peace talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Abed-Rabbo said the PLO is delaying adoption of a final strategy until it 
evaluates the Security Council response to the weekend attack. The council 
continued to deliberate on a possible resolution on the massacre late Monday.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ATTACK SHOWS NATO HAS BITE TO BACK UP ITS BARK; BOSNIA: SERBIAN 
FORCES MAY RECOIL FROM PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN RISK MORE WESTERN INTERVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its first resort to force after almost two years of empty threats and 
toothless directives, NATO has sent a message to Bosnia's warring factions that 
there is military muscle behind alliance warnings and a price to pay for 
flouting its edicts. 
</P>
<P>
 By striking out at Bosnian Serb warplanes blatantly violating a U.N. "no-fly" 
order, the 16-nation alliance took an easy, unassailable shot at Serb 
nationalist rebels with clear enforcement authorization from the Security 
Council, which even Serb-allied Russia had endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first reaction of the targeted Bosnian Serb forces was to 
escalate bombardment of the northern city of Tuzla, there were signs that 
Serbian forces may recoil from the punishment rather than retaliate and risk 
further Western intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb military and political leaders responded with contradictory 
expressions of bluster and restraint, hinting at disarray among the rebel 
forces that until Monday had encountered no serious Western deterrence to their 
deadly land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost two years, Western diplomats and other observers of the conflict in 
the former Yugoslav federation have argued whether the use of force against 
Serb nationalist aggression would break rebel resolve to carve a Greater Serbia 
out of ethnically diverse communities or spark angry retaliation and a wider 
Balkans war. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's action to enforce the "no-fly" zone, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the United Nations may see their peacemaking initiatives 
heeded with more respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Protection Force in the Balkans has set a March 7 deadline for 
opening an airport in Tuzla to humanitarian relief flights -- an objective that 
looked, until Monday, to have little chance of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosnian Serb forces now have to reckon with the possibility of forceful 
retaliation, if they continue to block relief flights to the airport and pepper 
the U.N.-controlled runway with artillery fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a U.N. plan for gradually imposing peace between Croats and Muslims 
in Central Bosnia appeared to get a boost from the NATO action. Fighting had 
continued unabated since the United Nations announced last week that it would 
seek to extend a tense peace imposed on Sarajevo to other areas of the 
republic. But the guns were reported to have fallen silent after word of NATO's 
first forceful intervention in the nearly 3-year-old Balkans war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs last week had scored a major diplomatic coup by evading punitive 
NATO air strikes, despite flagrant violations of an alliance order to pull 
heavy artillery out of firing range of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 After a heavy artillery shell killed 68 civilians at a crowded open-air market 
on Feb. 5, NATO ordered all tanks, howitzers and rocket-launchers out of a 
12-mile zone around the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Feb. 21 deadline approached, U.N. Protection Force officers and Russian 
politicians bargained for restraint on NATO's part, claiming an end to the 
siege of Sarajevo had been achieved by the threat of force alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But hundreds of Serbian weapons remained deployed within the exclusion zone, 
and increasing instances of mortar fire and artillery movements in recent days 
have made clear that NATO had foregone its opportunity to show the rebels it 
has the confidence and authority to use force. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO last summer threatened to strike at the Serbs, if they continued their 
slow strangulation of the Bosnian capital, and an earlier warning of impending 
air strikes to enforce a U.N.-mediated partitioning of the republic had also 
gone unfulfilled, leading the rebels to conclude NATO was a paper tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 The "no-fly" zone proclaimed in October, 1992, was the most brazenly violated 
NATO order and, therefore, a wise choice for enforcement by the alliance that 
needed to restore the notion that credible force stands behind its threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian intervention on behalf of traditional Serbian allies spared the rebels 
NATO air strikes last week; the Serbs appeared emboldened enough by that 
support to step up attacks on other government targets like the Tuzla airport, 
the besieged Maglaj region and the volatile Muslim enclave around Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's first-ever shots fired in anger also sent a warning to the Kremlin that 
it will not be allowed to protect Serbian rebels from Western punishment if 
they continue to violate U.N. resolutions and thwart the international 
community's attempts to restore peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin's response to NATO's downing of the four fixed-wing Galeb aircraft 
suggested that it had beat a face-saving retreat to join Western allies in 
their claims of resolve to halt the Balkan bloodshed. "If the Serbs did this, I 
see no justification," Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev said of the 
reported "no-fly" zone violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia has warned that military intervention could worsen the war, 
there were no immediate protests of the NATO action from Russian authorities in 
positions of power. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, also 
reacted with words of support for NATO, despite unmasked opposition to the air 
strikes that were threatened last week. "It shows NATO has teeth," Rose said of 
the NATO plane downings. "It shows that if people are in flagrant violation of 
agreements, they'll suffer the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's reputation has been riding on the deteriorating cease-fire proclaimed 
in Sarajevo prior to the NATO deadline for moving heavy guns out of firing 
range of the capital. At Rose's insistence, NATO withheld enforcement action 
only to see a steady escalation of hostile fire from remaining Serbian 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bosnian Serb leaders refrained from belligerent statements after the NATO 
action. Nationalist chieftain Radovan Karadzic, en route from Belgrade to 
Moscow for consultation with Slav Orthodox allies, said NATO reports that 
Bosnian Serbs had violated the "no-fly" zone were being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply do not know the truth yet. We will know soon what happened, whether 
it was a Croat or Serb flight or some training or combat flight," an 
uncharacteristically contrite Karadzic told reporters at Belgrade airport. 
</P>
<P>
 His wait-and-see approach contrasted sharply with the flat denial issued by 
the Bosnian Serb army, which claimed Serbian aircraft had "never breached the 
'no-fly' zone since it came into force in October, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources say at least 1,000 violations have been recorded, most of them by 
the Bosnian Serbs, who have at least 30 fixed-wing planes and 20 attack 
helicopters, in contrast with a handful of helicopter gunships held by the 
Croats and no combat aircraft among the Muslim-led government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondents Laura Silber in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and Danica 
Kirka in Zagreb, Croatia, contributed to this report. The 'No-Fly' Zone 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the area over Bosnia declared off limits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: The United States declared a "no-fly" zone over all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, aimed primarily at Bosnian Serbs, in October, 1992. On 
April 12, 1993, NATO planes began Operation Deny Flight, intended to enforce 
the declaration, the first instance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
flexing its military muscles beyond the territory of member states. 
</P>
<P>
 * Execution: Warplanes from aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea and NATO 
bases in Italy fly over Bosnia on daily patrols with the help of AWACS 
surveillance planes operating over Hungary to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 * Past violations: Though frequent violations of the "no-fly" zone have been 
reported, most often by helicopters said to be transporting troops or weaponry, 
there were no known instances of NATO aircraft trying to shoot down violators 
before Monday's incident. Mountainous terrain often makes spotting and 
confirming such violations difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Planes: Bosnian Serbs have older-model fixed-wing warplanes and helicopters 
at Banja Luka, their stronghold in northwest Bosnia. The Muslim-led government 
and Bosnian Croats are believed to have only a few helicopters used for 
transport.

SEPULVEDA VA HOSPITAL FACES UNCLEAR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, the stately Sepulveda Veterans Administration hospital 
complex looks as if it weathered the Northridge earthquake fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly veterans still stroll throughout its serene, campus-like grounds. 
Doctors, nurses and medical students bustle among offices and clinics. All of 
its brick-faced buildings are still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 But walk inside some buildings and it is clear that the 39-year-old federal 
medical center sustained heavy damage in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The main hospital, Building 3, is uninhabitable, its corridors strewn with 
broken glass, damaged medical machinery and waterlogged chunks of ceiling. With 
dozens of pipes ruptured, there is no water service. The boiler room is 
unusable, depriving the hospital of heat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most of the 331 patients evacuated on the day of the quake remain 
scattered among other VA hospitals in West Los Angeles, Long Beach and Loma 
Linda. So extensive is the damage that Congress recently appropriated $43.6 
million just to clean up Sepulveda and reconnect its utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But with that work under way, questions are being raised about the future of 
the hospital, which employs more than 1,700 people and has long been a center 
for geriatrics research and the training of medical interns and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials in Washington are quietly discussing whether to rebuild the 
431-bed facility, at a cost of $188 million, or convert it into an outpatient 
care center. Conversion would carry a far smaller price tag of $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has been joined by private hospitals in Los Angeles, which argue 
that given the thousands of empty hospital beds in the region, Sepulveda should 
not be rebuilt if its patients can be permanently absorbed at other VA 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans themselves, perhaps the most vocal and influential group in the 
controversy, are split on the issue. Some favor reconstruction while others say 
the hospital should change its focus from inpatient care to less expensive 
outpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some veterans argue that the VA should take advantage of the quake 
damage to transform Sepulveda -- as well as other hospitals in the nation's 
largest medical system -- into a model of health care reform, keeping in step 
with the Clinton Administration's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Sepulveda has been the site of a pilot outpatient program that 
proponents say could be extended to the entire, 172-hospital VA system. They 
argue that outpatient care makes more sense as the agency's budget shrinks and 
the veterans' population ages, creating a need for more long-term-care and 
fewer acute-care beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clinic services have reopened at Sepulveda, but Building 3 has been 
vacant since Jan. 17, when terrified patients were hurriedly evacuated by a 
small cadre of nurses and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperately gripping their mattresses, bedridden veterans were half-carried, 
half-dragged down several flights of darkened stairs as aftershocks swayed the 
six-story building and water from broken pipes cascaded into hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the shaking stopped, Building 3's three wings had split away from 
the core structure, as they were designed to. Rooftop heating and cooling 
machinery was wrecked. Operating rooms were littered with waterlogged 
equipment, packages of anesthesia masks and tubes of bone cement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how, when or if we're going to be salvaging millions of dollars 
of equipment," said the hospital's chief engineer, Ed Safdie, during a recent 
inspection of Building 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the damage to Building 3 and its equipment was caused by flooding from 
broken water pipes. With maintenance workers initially preoccupied with helping 
to get patients out of the building, the sprinkler system was not turned off 
until more than five hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake also caused extensive damage by knocking computers, expensive 
medical machinery, cabinets and other equipment to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Safdie said the VA appropriated $500,000 for internal bracing and anchoring of 
equipment at Sepulveda two years ago. But that money was diverted for 
additional waterproofing at the hospital after severe flooding hit the Valley 
in the winter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A VA spokeswoman in Washington said a number of buildings at Sepulveda are 
likely to be retrofitted against earthquakes, but she didn't know what specific 
work would be done or how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1955, the Sepulveda VA offered a range of hospital medical services 
as well as outpatient programs in primary care, substance abuse and mental 
health. It is also a teaching hospital affiliated with medical schools at UCLA 
and numerous other universities. Last year, 364 medical residents and interns 
trained at Sepulveda. The hospital's budget this year is $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda conducts research on aging, drug and alcohol abuse, neurological 
disorders, heart disease and other problems. In 1993, more than $8 million was 
spent on research activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, Sepulveda was edging away from traditional inpatient 
care under a pilot program known as PACE, or the Pilot Ambulatory Care and 
Education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1988, the program uses teams of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and 
psychiatrists to treat veterans in an outpatient setting. It emphasizes 
preventive health care and is seen as a potential money-saving alternative to 
long-term hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 PACE survived the quake. But what to do with the hospital, given the degree of 
damage to it, is being debated from Los Angeles to Washington within the VA, 
Congress and veterans' groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent briefing in Washington for members of Congress from California, VA 
officials outlined the pluses and minuses of renovating the hospital or turning 
it into an outpatient center. 
</P>
<P>
 Under either option, the hospital's 145-bed nursing home would remain. 
</P>
<P>
 By rebuilding, veterans in northern Los Angeles County would have continued 
access to acute medical care near their homes, and existing hospital employees 
could keep their jobs, the VA said. Also, existing research and outpatient 
programs would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the cost of rebuilding would be over $71 million more than converting 
to an outpatient center, the VA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, renovation would mean that 193 previously empty beds at the West Los 
Angeles VA hospital -- now filled with Sepulveda patients -- would go unused 
again. The West Los Angeles hospital, the VA's largest, has 1,157 inpatient 
beds, a 240-bed nursing home and a 300-bed domiciliary. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, converting to outpatient services, the VA said, would put 
Sepulveda in the forefront of health care reform efforts. At the same time, the 
hospital could maintain its research programs in geriatrics and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But although it would save millions, turning the hospital into an outpatient 
center would make it harder for Valley-area veterans to get acute care, the VA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving to the West Los Angeles hospital would be "a significant barrier to 
veterans, given the realities of freeway congestion and traffic in the greater 
L. A. area," said a briefing paper given to Los Angeles area members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely due to pressure from politically influential veterans' groups, and 
despite a large migration of veterans to Sun Belt states in the past 20 years, 
the VA has closed only one hospital anywhere in the country since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 And many Los Angeles-area veterans -- long accustomed to free, full-service 
medical care at Sepulveda -- strongly support rebuilding the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that there's going to be a consensus among our California 
legionnaires that they want that hospital completely rebuilt," said John 
Hanson, director of veterans affairs for the American Legion in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who favor rebuilding are backed by the influential head of the House 
Veterans' Affairs Committee, Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.). 
Montgomery's committee oversees the VA's annual budget and has tremendous 
political leverage over the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fully supportive of either rebuilding that hospital or building another 
hospital in the area and giving the same services," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Northeast, you might could close hospitals. But most veterans are in 
California, Arizona and Florida. . . . I understand the problems of spending 
$170 million, but we need that facility, and that's what I'm going to work 
towards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some veterans see wisdom in closing the hospital and converting to 
outpatient operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need hospital beds as much as long-term care beds," said Dave 
Gorman, deputy national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The VA can't maintain all these hospital beds, and maybe they shouldn't," he 
said. "They should be in the era of modern health care, like everyone else is." 
</P>
<P>
 David Langeness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
which represents mostly private hospitals, agreed, but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1993, he said, nearly half of the 31,000 hospital beds in Los 
Angeles County were empty, placing a serious financial strain on hospitals. 
Given that surplus, and if veterans displaced from Sepulveda can be 
accommodated at other VAs, the Sepulveda hospital should be closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the VA is going to make the same decision that other hospitals 
are going to -- and that is to downsize," he said.

SCOUTS CAN'T BAR ATHEISTS, COURT RULES; ORGANIZATIONS: APPELLATE JUSTICES 
UPHOLD ORANGE COUNTY RULING THAT PREVENTS EXCLUSION OF BROTHERS. DISSENTING 
JUSTICE ACCUSES COLLEAGUES OF UNDERMINING SCOUTING'S PRINCIPLES. 
</P>

<P>
 In a rebuke to the Boys Scouts of America, a state appeals court ruled Monday 
that twin Anaheim Hills brothers cannot be excluded from Scouting because they 
do not believe in God. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled 2 to 1 that the Orange County Council 
of the Scouts was a business as defined by state law and therefore cannot 
discriminate on the basis of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council could have no compelling justification for discriminating against 
children because of their current notions concerning the subject of God," the 
justices wrote. "Indeed, such discrimination would appear to contradict a 
variety of the principles of the congressionally chartered Boy Scouts of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sharply worded 12-page dissent, Justice David G. Sills accused his 
colleagues of undermining Scouting's values and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may come as a surprise to my colleagues, but there are those who still 
seek membership in an organization which teaches duty to God and country and 
the virtues of order and discipline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority opinion upholds a ruling by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Richard O. Frazee Sr. in 1992 that allowed William and Michael Randall, now 12, 
to remain in Scouting despite their views on the existence of God. 
</P>
<P>
 The Randalls' lawsuit was filed in early 1991, shortly after the twins were 
ousted from an Anaheim Hills Cub Scout pack for refusing to swear an oath to 
God. The boys argued that their 1st Amendment religious rights were being 
violated by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouting officials contended that their constitutional rights of freedom of 
association were being denied. They said allowing atheists in Scouting would 
undermine the founding principles of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The case hinged on whether Scouting was defined as a private organization, 
with the right to pick and choose members, or as a business and therefore bound 
by the state Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discriminating on the 
basis of religion or race. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority opinion, written by Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. with Justice 
Sheila Prell Sonenshine concurring, said the nonprofit Boy Scouts is a 
business. They noted that the organization has retail stores, three large 
recreational centers, $9 million in assets and an annual budget of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills disagreed, saying that even if the organization is a business, state law 
does not prohibit it from excluding "those who refuse to take their oath as 
long as the exclusion is not arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically," Sills concluded, "today's decision effectively tramples on the 
rights of atheists as well as believers. . . . If the 1st Amendment will not 
stop the government from effectively dictating the content of the Boy Scout's 
oath today, it will not stop the government from requiring prayer tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scout officials said they will appeal the decision to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James G. Randall, who represented his sons at trial, said they 
participate in a Tustin Boy Scout troop. Randall said his sons do not want to 
harm or disrupt the organization.

PRIOR CRIMES ADMISSIBLE, JUSTICES RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court made it easier Monday for prosecutors to 
introduce evidence of previous, uncharged offenses in rape and other criminal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling in a child molestation case, the court voted 6 to 1 that prior, 
uncharged misconduct is admissible if the circumstances, victims or offenses 
are sufficiently similar. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision overturns a 1984 ruling by the court that such evidence had to be 
part of a grand design or demonstrate a "single, continuing conception or 
plot." 
</P>
<P>
 But the court ruled that such evidence still should not be admitted to 
establish that the defendant had a criminal disposition or bad character. 
Rather, the court said, it should be intended to "prove that he or she 
committed the charged offense pursuant to the same design or plan used in 
committing the uncharged criminal acts." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case before the court, a man was convicted in Santa Clara Superior 
Court of molesting his stepdaughter. The trial court allowed the sister of the 
victim to testify that she too had been molested by their stepfather years 
earlier. A Court of Appeal held that the trial court had erred in allowing the 
sister to testify to molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Quin Denvir, the defense attorney in the high court case, called the ruling 
"very significant" because it substantially broadens the circumstances in which 
uncharged prior offenses can be introduced as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They overruled (precedent) as a way to get around a ban on character 
evidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Gloria Folger Dehart said the new rule established by the 
court is "much more sensible" than the more restrictive 1984 ruling. "I think 
it should be helpful" in prosecutions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 California has historically been among the toughest states in barring 
testimony from previous victims who did not file charges against a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue became controversial in the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, who 
was acquitted after a judge refused to admit the testimony of three women who 
claimed that Smith either sexually assaulted or raped them.

CHILDREN SAY MEDIA GIVE NEGATIVE VIEW OF YOUTH; IMAGES: FIRST STUDY OF ITS KIND 
FINDS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DEPEND ON NEWS SHOWS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR INFORMATION. 
BUT MOST COME AWAY FEELING ANGRY OR SAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Most children who watch television news or read newspapers believe the media 
portray a negative image of young people that emphasizes violence, drugs and 
crime, according to a nationwide poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of 850 children ages 11 through 16 -- the first study of its kind 
-- most youngsters said the media do not do a good job of covering issues 
important to them and that they feel "angry, sad or depressed" after watching 
or reading the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now, an advocacy group that sponsored the poll, said the survey shows 
that young people have faith in the media and rely on them for information, but 
often feel the news does not reflect the truth of their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of children see almost exclusively negative images of kids their age 
in the news every day," said James P. Steyer, president of Children Now. "This 
alone can directly affect their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted by telephone in late January, concluded that children are 
eager for positive news about members of their generation, with 44% saying they 
would like the media to give more coverage to children "doing good things," 
"staying away from trouble" or "helping the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, nearly two-thirds of the children polled agreed with the 
statement: "If it wasn't for the news media, people would do a lot less to help 
kids in trouble or fight violence against children." 
</P>
<P>
 The adults who sponsored the poll said they were surprised to find that 
youngsters follow the news closely and take it seriously. Of those surveyed, 
65% said they had watched a news program and 44% said they had read a newspaper 
the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are plugged into the news," said pollster Paul Maslin, who helped 
conduct the survey. "That is perhaps the most surprising thing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Four out of five children surveyed said the media are fair and believe what 
they see and read. But by the same margin, they also say their point of view is 
seldom represented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (the media) basically tell the truth," said Liam Carey, 13, a 
San Francisco eighth-grader who was one of three children helping to present 
the survey findings at a news conference. "They just don't tell everything that 
goes on. They don't tell kids' perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found the highest degree of alienation among African Americans and 
Latinos, with girls far more dismayed by the media than boys were. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-fourths of the African American children and about two-thirds of 
the Latino children said the only time members of their group were portrayed in 
the news was in connection with crime, violence or drugs. By comparison, half 
the white children surveyed held that view. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 66% of the girls polled said they felt angry after watching, 
reading or listening to the news, compared to 46% of the boys. And 62% of the 
girls said they felt sad or depressed by the news, compared to 40% of boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Steyer said the high level of violence in news about children makes many young 
viewers afraid, can damage their self-esteem and inspire some to act out more 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they believe what they read or see and they take it as true, it has a 
bigger impact on their self-image," he said. "It may increase their use of 
violence. It may legitimize violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The children's view that violence dominates news about their generation is 
supported by academics at UC Santa Barbara who studied the three network 
evening news shows and five major newspapers, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 That study, also released Monday, showed that 48% of television stories and 
40% of newspaper stories about children over a monthlong period involved crime 
and violence. During the same month, only 3% of the television stories and 4% 
of the newspaper stories about children touched on poverty, and even fewer 
dealt with the issues of child care or health care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Decrying the lack of attention to children's economic troubles, Steyer said: 
"Today, there are 14 million children who live below the poverty line and 
nearly twice that many just above the poverty line. Children are the poorest 
group in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of children also contained a bit of bad news for newspaper 
publishers concerned with their future readership: Overall, 44% of the children 
said television news did the best job of covering issues important to them, 
while 28% said daytime talk shows did the best job. Only 23% said newspapers 
did the best job.

EPA PLANS FOR DELTA DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California mayors, business leaders and water officials said Monday 
the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to restore the vital Sacramento-San 
Joaquin River Delta favors fish over people. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Wodraska, general manager of the vast Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, said that at stake in any delta plan "is preserving our 
drinking water" for MWD's 16 million customers from Ventura to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care about the environment in Northern California," Wodraska said, "and I 
think that represents a change from our historic, North-South battles." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA must tentatively decide by April 6 how to divvy up water from the 
delta, an environmentally delicate system of sloughs and islands that is a key 
link in the state's water distribution system and a vital nursery for fish and 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reduce the excessive salt levels in the delta by keeping enough 
fresh water there to restore the populations of spawning fish and wildlife to 
levels of two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The new water quality standards call for listing the Sacramento split-tail on 
the endangered list. The EPA's plan also declares that the winter-run chinook 
salmon on the Sacramento River have declined from threatened status to 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the traditional controversy centers on how much fresh water is needed to 
preserve the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirsty Southern California has demanded its share of the water while Northern 
California environmentalists and other groups fear too much water is being 
diverted to Central Valley agriculture and the growing south, thus threatening 
the fragile delta. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has held hearings in San Francisco, Sacramento and Fresno, but in 
holding the final hearing in Irvine on Monday, the federal agency heard from 
representatives and leaders of the richest, most populous and water-needy areas 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has criticized the Clinton Administration for proposing 
protections of the delta area, but also directed state officials to collaborate 
with federal authorities on a final regulatory plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, 1.7 million residents are served by the Municipal Water 
District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County imports more than half its water supply, and even without any 
further growth we'll always have a need for a reliable source of water," said 
Robert J. Huntley, president of the MWD of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that federal regulations have eroded the reliability of future water 
supplies to the point where the next endangered species may be the "Orange 
County resident and business owner." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly told EPA and U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials, "The 
export restrictions on delta water that you are proposing are tantamount to 
permanent water shortages to us in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly noted that Anaheim's tourist industry, including Disneyland and enough 
hotels to provide $35 million in annual hotel bed tax, is ranked as the biggest 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is home to the California Angels, the Rams football team, and the 
Mighty Ducks hockey team -- all of which provide revenue for the city and 
Orange County that could be jeopardized by severe water shortages, he 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already suffered economic disasters in the past year, such as 
firestorms, earthquakes and floods," Daly said. "This will be another 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, state officials have struggled with how to restore the delta, 
which stretches from San Francisco Bay nearly to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state refused to act and the federal government, facing a lawsuit by 
16 environmental groups, stepped in last year to propose water quality 
standards that would change the allocation for growers, cities and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the proposed federal standards, the state would need to restore to the 
bay-delta estuary an average of 540,000-acre-feet of water per year, which is a 
significant portion of the amount used by Southern California cities, Central 
Valley farmers and some Bay Area residents.

MUSLIMS JOIN IN MOURNING 9 CATHOLICS; LEBANON: THOUSANDS COME TOGETHER IN AND 
OUTSIDE OUR LADY OF SALVATION CHURCH IN JUNIYAH. VICTIMS DIED IN A BOMB 
EXPLOSION THERE.

<P>
 Anguished relatives flung themselves on coffins Monday at a funeral for nine 
Maronite Catholics that was held at the church where the victims died in a bomb 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of mourners gathered in and outside Our Lady of Salvation church, 
which had been cleared of debris and bloodstains overnight. The bomb exploded 
during Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the deadliest attack since a car bomb killed 17 people in mainly Muslim 
West Beirut in December, 1991. It came two days after an Israeli settler killed 
48 Palestinians as they prayed in a mosque in Hebron in the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, Muslims joined Christians in a government-sanctioned 
shutdown to show their solidarity against a rekindling of the 1975-90 civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Government offices, schools, businesses, most shops and recreation centers 
closed in Christian and Muslim areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was a setback for Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to rid 
Lebanon of the terrorist image it acquired during the civil war, when 
assassinations, hijackings, kidnapings and suicide bombings occurred regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no claim of responsibility for the church bombing in this suburb 12 
miles north of Beirut. Media reports said up to six people were being 
interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing also wounded 60 people. But the casualties could have been far 
worse: A larger bomb was found inside the church's organ and defused. 
</P>
<P>
 President Elias Hrawi and dozens of other dignitaries attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The altar was hastily repaired. But walls still bore shrapnel scars, and a 
small crater in the floor was covered by a piece of plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have been 14 in three months," George Bachalani said as he wept 
over his daughter's coffin. "We never expected her to die in a church." 
</P>
<P>
 Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of Lebanon's western-minded 1 
million Maronites, presided over the service, assisted by about 100 priests. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the mourners that it was the first time worshipers had been attacked 
in a church in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden what did not happen during the war years takes place today, 
and the sanctity of the church is desecrated and the blood of worshipers is 
spilled," Sfeir said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in a eulogy that he had been warned two weeks ago of an impending plot 
to blow up Christian churches in Lebanon, and he suggested that terrorists 
"want us to stop exercising our religious rites." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will never happen," he said.

NEW BUDGET SEEKS TO REVAMP INDIA'S CLOSED ECONOMY; ASIA: OFFICIAL UNVEILS PLAN 
TO CUT CUSTOMS DUTIES, EASE TAXES ON BIG BUSINESS. AIM IS TO BOOST NATION'S 
GLOBAL ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Endeavoring to carry this nation to the "second industrial revolution," the 
government unveiled a budget Monday that, by cutting customs duties, widening 
rupee convertibility and easing taxes on manufacturers, further integrates 
India into the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing hopes that his country will be Asia's next exporting powerhouse, 
Finance Minister Manmohan Singh said, "I have a vision of our industrial firms 
acquiring a global reach and their names becoming household words in far-off, 
distant lands." 
</P>
<P>
 India, a fiscal basket case three years ago when inflation was at 17% and 
foreign exchange coffers were bare, has become so solvent as a result of new 
export-oriented policies and other ongoing economic reforms that it will prepay 
$1.4 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund due in the next 12 
months, Singh announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, who presented the government's 1994-95 budget to lawmakers, 
acknowledged that the plan includes so many changes in the country's arcane 
revenue-raising system that India's deficit could reach a troubling 6% of gross 
domestic product. A self-described proponent of "fiscal rectitude," he said the 
continuing shortfall in government revenue is risky but necessary to reawaken 
the country's dormant industry and spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The former economics professor's eagerly awaited fourth budget mapped how the 
government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao intends to keep pursuing its 
gradual course, converting India's mixed, very bureaucratized economy into a 
freer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh's budget, which must be debated and approved by Parliament, would 
eradicate many of the bizarre inequities in India's maze of customs duties and 
excise taxes that sometimes have made it cheaper to import an item than to 
produce it locally. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major reform of corporate taxation, Singh proposed a single rate of 40% 
for companies regardless of size, in lieu of a tax burden that had reached 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of borrowing money will also be reduced and the capital gains tax 
cut, he said, two steps that should help Indian industry and business 
reorganize to take on global competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 As another badge of India's new economic confidence, the rupee will be made 
convertible on the current account, Singh said, meaning that people and 
companies will be able to freely buy and sell rupees to pay for personal 
expenses and business outlays abroad, like travel and advertising. India's 
currency is still not yet convertible on the capital account, meaning that 
large movements of money in and out of India are still subject to government 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to seek new sources of government income could not compensate for the 
new tax rates and goodies doled out by the finance minister. A new 5% tax will 
be tacked on to telephone bills and stock exchange transactions; building 
contractors and truck owners will be able to choose to be taxed according to 
fixed formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh said he realized there is a "serious danger" that the projected deficit 
could fuel inflation, push up interest rates and make it impossible to bring

3 ALGERIAN POLICE OFFICERS HIJACK JET, GIVE UP IN SPAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Algerian policemen hijacked a domestic flight with 131 people aboard 
Monday and forced it to land in southern Spain. They surrendered hours later 
but were denied political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the hijackers were fleeing political violence in 
Algeria, where Muslim radicals have targeted soldiers, police, intellectuals 
and foreigners in a two-year campaign against the army-backed regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Algerie plane was en route from Oran, in western Algeria, to Annaba, 
near the Tunisian border, when the three forced the crew to divert the jet 
across the Mediterranean to the southern Spanish town of Alicante, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 727, carrying 124 passengers and seven crew members, landed without 
seeking permission from air traffic controllers, and paramilitary Civil Guards 
surrounded it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers carried handguns throughout the five-hour ordeal that was 
prolonged by language problems between Spanish negotiators and the Arabic- and 
French-speaking hijackers, said Alfonso Calve, civil governor of the Alicante 
region. Calve said the three policemen will remain in custody pending an 
investigation and will not be granted the political asylum they had requested.

FIRST LADY'S BROTHER HAS UPHILL BATTLE IN SENATE BID; DESPITE HAVING NO 
EXPERIENCE AS A CANDIDATE, HUGH RODHAM SAYS HIS EFFORT TO UNSEAT REPUBLICAN 
CONNIE MACK IS NOT A JOKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After his last day in drug court as a county public defender, Hugh Rodham was 
on the escalator going down when a judge heading the other way shouted out, 
"Hey, senator, how's the campaign going?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," replied Rodham in a voice that reverberated off the courthouse walls, 
"it's a little like the guy who jumps out of an airplane without a parachute: 
'So far, so good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The genial Rodham is the younger brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
And the campaign, officially announced Monday on national television, is one in 
which he seeks to join the U.S. Senate by winning the Democratic nomination and 
then unseating Florida Republican Connie Mack in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his First Brother-in-Law connections and a familiar last name, 
many here think Rodham, 43, is heading for the same fate as his metaphoric 
parachutist: a hard landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what we've seen from Mr. Rodham so far," says Mitch Bainwol, a 
senior aide to Mack, "it's difficult to see an assistant public defender as a 
credible candidate for U.S. Senate." He calls Rodham's candidacy "a joke" 
predicated on family ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham has no political experience. For the last 13 years he has been an 
assistant Dade County public defender, most recently toiling in the innovative 
and often-chaotic drug court begun here by former state attorney Janet Reno, 
now the U.S. attorney general. And Rodham, a former backup quarterback at Penn 
State who now is shaped more like a nose guard, is considered an effective 
advocate of the "tough love" treatment offered to drug abusers hoping for a 
second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But as celebrated as drug court has been, it has only been since Rodham's name 
first surfaced three months ago as a potential political candidate that he had 
gained much personal attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, even Stanley M. Goldstein, who presides over drug court, has been 
fielding messages. "NBC wants you here at 10 a.m. tomorrow," the judge told 
Rodham from the bench Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of the publicity Rodham has received seems less than helpful for 
a man who wants to be taken seriously as a contender for high office. In one 
national paper, Rodham was compared to actor John Candy and to Norm on TV's 
"Cheers." The lead on another profile reported on a fire that was consuming his 
car outside his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the publicity, Rodham says: "It could have been better, it could have been 
worse. I wish they hadn't put in the thing about my car, but it is a fact. It's 
a '77 Caddy, a keepsake from my father, and it did burn up." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the comparisons to overweight actors: "Well, I think John Candy is a 
fine actor, a comedic guy. And Norm on 'Cheers,' I like him, too. But if that's 
all they think, they're in for a long, hot summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the irreverence that has greeted Rodham's announcement of his 
intentions may be rooted in history. When assessing political capital, 
President Jimmy Carter's brother, Billy, Ronald Reagan's children Ron and 
Patti, and Clinton's brother Roger have all been listed on the debit side. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, a political novice with little money and a bare-bones organization, is 
a big target, especially for Republicans who see his candidacy as a chance to 
attack the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons evidently see that chance as well. On CNN's "Larry King Live" 
Monday, Rodham all but admitted that the First Family tried to talk him out of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Rodham said, was only "cautiously optimistic." As for the 
President, "He said, 'It's not a horrible idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The early poll numbers aren't good. In a recent Mason-Dixon poll, Mack wins 
with 56% of the vote to 16% for Rodham when they go head to head. And Mack has 
more than $2 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 With the odds seemingly so high in Mack's favor, Rodham is the only Democrat 
to have entered the primary so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mason-Dixon pollster Bob Joffee: "It's a very long, steep climb. We feel 
Mack looks like one of the least vulnerable incumbents seeking reelection this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Copperthite, Rodham's campaign manager, cites other numbers, those 
that had Mack winning his Senate seat in 1988 by the narrowest margin in 
Florida history while George Bush swept the state handily. "We're going to run 
a very competitive campaign," Copperthite vows. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham met with the Clintons last week in Washington after taking part in a 
demonstration by Cuban Americans in support of the embargo against Cuba. 
Rodham's wife, attorney Maria Victoria Arias, is Cuban American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want or expect any special favors," Rodham said. "My sister is who 
she is, the President is who he is, and I am like I am. If people can't see 
that, then I better get out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about critics' charges that he is merely trading on his name, he 
bristled: "They don't know anything about me. They don't know my ideas. I'm 
more educated than all of them. But I'm an unknown commodity, and they want to 
pigeonhole me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham's positions are largely works in progress, he admits, although he 
expects to concentrate on crime, the top concern of voters everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As he kicks off his statewide campaign today, Rodham has picked up the 
endorsement of the Cuban American Democratic Council and the man who has worked 
with him down at the courthouse for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great guy," says Goldstein. "I like him, and it sure wouldn't hurt 
the drug court to have him in Washington."

A RASCAL CARTOON CHARACTER SETS OFF A CONTROVERSY IN S.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, that rascal Bart Simpson is causing commotion in school. But this 
time, it's not in the Fox network cartoon. It's here in this city of 20,000 in 
northwestern South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and teachers want the school board to back off its tentative approval 
of the name Springfield for the district's new $3.6-million elementary school. 
That's the name of Bart's school, and teachers say it's hard enough to win 
respect from children without having a tie to a cartoon character known for 
bucking authority figures and disliking school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Bible Belt; let's be real," said Greenwood County School District 
50 spokesman Furman Miller Jr. "Some parents are offended by someone like Bart 
Simpson. He's an obnoxious, talking-back little kid. He's a rebel, and most 
kids today need to be more respectful. You don't know how hard it is to deal 
with kids today." 
</P>
<P>
 The whole episode began harmlessly enough just before Christmas, when school 
officials decided to make naming the new school a learning exercise. They asked 
students to choose a name and then compose essays on why theirs should be 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The only stipulation was that the name reflect the natural surroundings of the 
red-brick building scheduled for completion by August. The school, the 11th 
facility in a district of 8,800 students, is in a rural area outside town, 
across the street from a pumpkin patch. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school student who submitted "Springfield" -- whom district 
officials have declined to name -- wrote that his name was best because "the 
school is being built on a field and Spring is a happy season." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten junior high students chose the Top 10 names, which were voted on by 
elementary students earlier this month. When the results were tabulated, 
Springfield won hands down: 1,254 votes of 3,233 cast. No. 2 "Skylight" got 
only 349 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted Jan. 19 to go along with the students. Toward the end 
of the meeting, one board member, whom Miller also declined to identify, 
wondered whether anyone knew why Springfield was the overwhelming favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said a parent had told her that it was the name of Bart's school," Miller 
said. "Most of us didn't even know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the county's PTA/PTO Council, made up of leaders from 
parent-teacher groups from each school, voted unanimously to ask the school 
board to reconsider its choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is the general lack of respect for authority and the 
negative attitude toward education and teachers on the show," said Jonathan 
Payne, the council's chairman, who stressed that parents here are concerned, 
but not obsessed or frantic in their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe some children might pattern themselves after Bart or he might become 
the unofficial mascot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not clear is whether the students set out to name the school after 
Bart's. Teachers say no one ever discussed the show in class, and Supt. Michael 
McKenzie didn't even know the name of Bart's school until it was mentioned in 
the board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know, but it's very possible," said Miller. "The media has a big 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said he doesn't believe the students intentionally named the building 
for Bart Simpson's school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is a third-grader and he said a lot of boys voted for field because it 
had athletic connotations," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said guidance counselors will try to find out from students over the 
next few weeks why they liked the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, folks around town have a few weeks to voice their 
opinions before the board makes a final decision. Miller said it will be a 
tough choice. District officials were the ones who turned the matter over the 
students in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked for it, and we got it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonia Coffman, "The Simpson's" publicist, said that the show's official 
response would come from Bart himself: "At least they didn't call it 'Beavis 
and Butt-Head' Elementary."

ISRAELI MILITARY CLAMPS DOWN LID ON 1.25 MILLION IN OCCUPIED LANDS; CURFEW: 
UNREST CONTINUES IN WEST BANK AND GAZA, HOWEVER, LEAVING TWO DEAD. PROTESTS 
ALSO ERUPT IN ISRAEL. 
</P>

<P>
 Israeli military authorities, trying to curtail Palestinian protests over the 
massacre of Muslim worshipers in Hebron last week, on Monday ordered more than 
1.25 million residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to remain in 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sweeping curfew, imposed on almost every Arab city, town and refugee 
camp in the two regions, failed to halt the unrest as youths attacked army 
patrols, blocked roads with burning tires and stoned cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men -- one a 65-year-old walking to a Hebron mosque to pray, the other a 
young lawyer going to court in Nablus -- were killed as Israeli troops opened 
fire in clashes with demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent protests also continued in Israel itself as Israeli Arabs in Nazareth 
and towns in the Galilee region demonstrated for the third day in solidarity 
with the Palestinians. Police arrested 52 people in Nazareth after rioters 
attacked Jewish motorists and stoned government offices and banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Israeli Arabs attended the funeral, conducted under Palestinian 
flags and anti-Israeli slogans, of a Bedouin killed by police Sunday, the first 
Israeli Arab to die in clashes with police since 1976. Police were ordered out 
of the town in the Negev Desert for the funeral, and no violence was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, overwhelmingly approved a resolution 
strongly condemning the Hebron massacre carried out by an Israeli settler, a 
Brooklyn-born physician from the extremist Kach movement, who killed 48 Muslims 
as they knelt in prayer before he was overpowered and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Jew, as an Israeli, as a man and as a human being, I am ashamed for the 
disgrace imposed upon us by a degenerate murderer," Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin told the Knesset as he provided details on the incident, the government's 
crackdown on Kach and other extremist groups and its efforts to salvage the 
peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This murderer came out of a small and marginal political context," Rabin 
said. "He grew in a swamp whose murderous sources . . . are foreign to Judaism 
-- they are not ours. 
</P>
<P>
 "To him and those like him, we say: 'You are not part of the community of 
Israel. You are not part of the national democratic camp. . . . You are not 
partners in the Zionist enterprise. . . . Sensible Judaism spits you out. You 
placed yourself outside the wall of the Jewish law. You are a shame on Zionism 
and an embarrassment to Judaism,' " Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 With detention orders authorized by the Cabinet, security police are searching 
for four leading figures in Kach and its affiliates; one settler has already 
been detained without trial for three months. The army is preparing to restrict 
the movements and activities of 15 other settlers and to disarm 20 more. Kach 
will probably be outlawed as well, Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud of our democracy -- there are few like it in the world," he 
said. "We will not allow anyone in Israel or in the territories under its 
control . . . to determine or change the policy of the government by blackmail 
or the trigger and false messianic claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "No political movement, secular or religious, no pressure group will dare 
raise its hand against democracy here," he said. "We as a government will stand 
like a wall and will vigorously employ all legal means, even if it requires 
force, to resist such an attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Cabinet members believe that even stronger measures are required.

KACH'S NUMBERS ARE SMALL, BUT IMPACT COULD BE HUGE; EXTREMISM: ZEALOTS ARE 
CALLED 'A DANGER TO THE JEWISH SOUL.' THEY SCOFF AT GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO REIN 
THEM IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Inside a drab stone house on a quiet street here Monday, the phone rang again 
and again in three rooms plastered with bloodthirsty bumper stickers, treatises 
on the Bible and photographs of Jewish martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fugitives of Kach, the small right-wing extremist group that the Israeli 
government has vowed to crush, were checking in with home base. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government wants to kill Kach," said Michael Delhorin, 46, who lives in 
the Golan Heights but was calling from "somewhere near Hebron." Speaking 
quickly, he added, "We are in a fight now." 
</P>
<P>
 The extremists of Kach and several other smaller Israeli groups claiming a 
scriptural basis for violence against Palestinians may be an insignificant 
political force in Israel. But even as the Middle East lurches toward a 
historic peace, these extremists have the weapons and the will to touch off 
even more bloodshed in occupied West Bank territories boiling with Palestinian 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Kach, which counted the man who massacred 48 Palestinians in a West 
Bank mosque last week as one of its own, "are even more dangerous than Arab 
terrorists, because they are a danger to the Jewish soul," said Immigration 
Minister Yair Tsaban. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the extremists "a 
foreign implant, an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits (them) out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kach and its radical kin have no more than a few hundred members, "but they 
have a culture totally different from any other group, even from the more 
militant Jewish settlers," said Ehud Sprinzak, a political scientist at 
Jerusalem's Hebrew University and an expert on the right. "It's almost a 
quasi-fascist culture, glorifying violence and not feeling ashamed of it. These 
people can cause enormous damage to the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that danger, Israel has taken the unprecedented step of unleashing 
security measures once reserved mostly for Palestinians on "radical elements 
among Israeli residents." On Monday, the Israeli army scoured the countryside 
for leaders of Kach and other radical groups, promising to detain them or 
disarm them. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said that it is considering a ban on Kach, something that 66% 
of Israelis would support, according to a poll conducted this week by the 
country's largest Hebrew-language newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kach office in Jerusalem, though, the government crackdown was laughed 
off by the faithful who stopped by or telephoned from new lives on the lam. "Do 
you know how many times we've been arrested and let go?" asked the group's 
secretary. "If they really wanted to catch us, they would have by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Alster, another Kach member, added, "They can put us in prison from now 
until doomsday and we won't change." Alster, a 71-year-old retired American 
salesman, was wearing a yellow cap with the words Kach Movement written in 
Hebrew on the front. He said the massacre of Muslim worshipers by another 
U.S.-born Kach member, Baruch Goldstein, "has had a tremendous effect on the 
movement. We applaud it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kach's name means, literally, "in this way," and its symbol is accompanied by 
a fist holding the Israeli flag. The group is an Israeli offshoot of the Jewish 
Defense League, founded in the United States by Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was 
assassinated in 1990 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 An entire room of Kach headquarters here is devoted to Kahane's memory. A 
large painting of him hangs on one wall between two eternal candles; his many 
theological books and bound collections of speeches are arrayed on a purple 
velvet ledge below. A television shows videos of Kahane's speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. background of many Kach members prompted Tsaban on Monday to propose 
restrictions on Jewish anti-Arab extremists seeking entry. Israel, which 
traditionally opens its doors to all Jews, has used laws barring citizenship to 
security threats only once, against the U.S. gangster Meyer Lansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans in extremist Jewish groups differ from other Israeli immigrants, 
many of whom have moved here to escape religious persecution. Those Americans 
came to Israel out of an ideological conviction that Jews have a birthright to 
all the biblical Land of Israel, and they want to expel all Arabs from the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not America. This is not a melting pot," said Baruch Ben-Yosef, the 
U.S.-born leader of the Yeshiva of the Temple Mount. His small band of 15 
extremists, based in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, makes daily 
pilgrimages to the Temple Mount, which is now occupied by a mosque, to demand 
that it be returned to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arabs claim this land is theirs, and we claim it is ours," Ben-Yosef said 
Monday as the Muslim call to prayers echoed through the Old City. "And we can't 
live together. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has ordered the arrest of five leaders of Kach and Kahane Chai 
(Kahane Lives), the two groups that were created in a dispute over leadership 
after Kahane's death. So far, one man has been detained. The others have 
appeared on Israeli television and made telephone calls to the local radio 
stations, but they have yet to be apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has not agreed to demands from some quarters that it disarm all 
130,000 of the often heavily armed Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. 
But it did decide to disarm 20 extremists and restrict the movements of 15 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's radical right has been in a period of decline for several years, and 
the massacre is unlikely to result in any permanent increase in its size, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But a television poll of the gunman's town, a traditional hotbed of militancy, 
indicated that a third of the Israelis there supported the massacre while 
another third opposed it and the remainder had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts say the killings and their aftermath indicate increasing 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw on Friday what a single individual could do," said Sprinzak, the 
Hebrew University professor. "So, in terms of their destabilizing potential, we 
are talking about a sizable number of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've not seen the end of this cycle of violence," Sprinzak said. "I would 
not be surprised if Palestinian counterstrikes are dealt. And under those 
circumstances it could get out of control, because Jews get very nervous when 
Jews are killed."

A MILESTONE FOR NATO; 20 MINUTES OVER BOSNIA

 The West's minute-by-minute entry into the Balkans war, according to NATO: 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:31 a.m. Bosnia time: An Advance Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) plane 
sounds the alarm at dawn. NATO aircraft report six jets flying five nautical 
miles southward from Banja Luka. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:35: The AWACS pilot orders the jets to land or depart the "no-fly" area. 
At the same time, he calls in the cavalry: a pair of U.S. Air Force F-16s on 
routine patrol farther south. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:42: The fast-approaching fighters issue the same warning: Get out or face 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:43: In the critical next minute, two things happen almost simultaneously. 
The F-16 pilots see the Serbian jets make what appears to be a bombing run and 
see what seem to be explosions. Just then, the American pilots, based at Aviano 
in northern Italy, receive permission to engage from NATO commander.

CHAMBER DROPS ITS SUPPORT FOR KEY PARTS OF HEALTH PLAN; INSURANCE: LARGEST 
BUSINESS GROUP NO LONGER AGREES TO MANDATORY PREMIUM PAYMENTS BY EMPLOYERS. IT 
ALSO SUSPENDS BACKING COVERAGE FOR ALL. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Monday that it no longer will support a 
requirement in President Clinton's health care reform proposal that all 
employers pay some portion of their workers' insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest business group also withdrew, at least for now, its 
backing for universal coverage -- the requirement that every American be 
guaranteed private insurance coverage. Clinton has declared universal coverage 
a non-negotiable issue and has vowed to veto any legislation that does not 
contain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies . . . just have a natural opposition to mandates," Chamber 
President Richard L. Lesher said of the requirement for employers to pay part 
of their employees' insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the chamber's 63-member board was not a surprise, given the strong 
opposition to the employer mandate from its membership. But it was another blow 
to the President's effort to restructure the nation's $1-trillion-a-year health 
care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's action drew a tepid response from the White House, which sought 
to emphasize its common ground with a business community that now has largely 
rejected Clinton's prescription for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the influential Business Roundtable, made up of the heads 
of more than 200 of the nation's largest firms, rejected Clinton's plan and 
instead endorsed as "a starting point" a far less ambitious proposal introduced 
by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). The National Assn. of Manufacturers later also 
spurned Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce previously was on record in support of an employer 
mandate -- as long as the employer share was no more than 50%. Clinton would 
require companies to pay at least 80% of workers' premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were in favor of 'shared responsibility.' Today, we are 
rejecting that position. The business community will not in our view support 
the employer mandate," said chamber official Robert E. Patricelli. "A very, 
very substantial portion of our membership opposes the mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 In a press conference Monday afternoon, he and Lesher noted that the 
organization supports many other elements in Clinton's plan, including 
provisions that increase consumer choice of providers, band consumers together 
voluntarily to increase their purchasing power and prohibit insurers from 
denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chamber has once again supported many elements that are contained in the 
President's health care reform proposal," said Lorrie McHugh, a White House 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration continues to believe that workplace-based insurance is the 
best means to achieve health coverage for every American," she added. "Nine out 
of 10 Americans already get private insurance at their work. The President's 
plan will build on this existing system and provide discounts to small 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 To further gauge opinion among its 220,000 members, the chamber is conducting 
an extensive survey, with results expected in about six weeks. But Lesher said 
it is already clear to the board that there is overwhelming opposition to the 
employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also suspending support for universal coverage," he added. "If the 
survey should show that there is a majority support for it, we will reconsider 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Feb. 15, the chamber's health and employee benefits committee 
voted to support the employer mandate, according to Patricelli, chairman of 
that panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board properly decided, in my view today, that in light of our knowledge 
of where our membership was, that we should not support employer mandates," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patricelli left open the possibility that the chamber may support a 
requirement that employers make available to employees -- but not pay for -- 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesher said that the chamber suspended its support for universal coverage 
"because it is very difficult, if not impossible, to get to the notion of 
universal coverage without some form of mandate."

GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON 3 TYPES OF RAPID-FIRE SHOTGUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the same day that the Brady gun-control law took effect across the nation, 
the Clinton Administration Monday placed new restrictions on the purchase of 
three types of rapid-fire shotguns that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen called 
"destructive devices, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen announced the reclassification of the "street sweeper," "striker" and 
USAS-12 during a press conference held at a District of Columbia police 
station.Buyers and current owners of the weapons will have to undergo extensive 
screenings and certification, and new taxes will be levied on manufacturers, 
dealers and purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Effective tomorrow morning, these weapons will be classified just what they 
are: machine guns," Bentsen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new taxes imposed on the guns are a $1,000 annual tax on 
manufacturers, a $500 annual license tax on dealers of the guns and a $200 
transfer tax on future sales. The Treasury Department estimates that there are 
about 18,000 of the weapons in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers and current owners will be required to register the guns with the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in addition to undergoing full 
background checks that involve fingerprinting, photographs and certification 
from a law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also announced that the Brady law, requiring a five-day waiting period 
for handgun purchases, was in full effect.

CLINTON VISITS CHICAGO, PAYS HIS DEBT TO ROSTENKOWSKI; POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT 
STOPS SHORT OF ENDORSING BELEAGUERED HOUSE LEADER'S REELECTION BID. BUT HE 
PRAISES HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton made a controversial trip here Monday to pay a political 
debt to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), the powerful but beleaguered chairman 
of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, 66, faces possible federal indictment on corruption charges and 
a tough reelection fight in a March 15 Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gravel-voiced Rostenkowski also was a major White House ally in last 
year's budget battle and is a key deal maker on health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who volunteered his support, spoke on crime and health care in 
Rostenkowski's presence before police, doctors and students at city-run Wright 
College, dramatizing Monday's effective date of the Brady law requiring 
background checks for handgun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping short of endorsing the 36-year congressional veteran, Clinton praised 
Rostenkowski for "his leadership last year" on economic matters and indicated 
that he is needed to pass important legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want me to get things done," Clinton said, "you have to say to the 
members of Congress: Act. The one person you don't have to say it to is Dan 
Rostenkowski. It's in his bones, and he will do it too." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clinton fidgeted in his chair as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley 
linked him with Rostenkowski as an exemplar of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski told Clinton: "I applaud you because you're not afraid to take on 
the tough ones." 
</P>
<P>
 A near-legendary powerbroker, Rostenkowski has spent $750,000 on legal bills 
during a two-year federal investigation into suspicions that he embezzled 
$21,000 through bogus House post office stamp purchases, put no-show workers on 
his payroll, rented campaign offices from himself and bought personal cars with 
public money. 
</P>
<P>
 He has denied any wrongdoing, though last month he reimbursed the Treasury 
$82,095 for china, jewelry and other gift items he had "inadvertently" billed 
to taxpayers. The $750,000, for staffers' legal fees as well as his own, has 
been paid from his campaign funds and from a legal defense fund he recently set 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 With Justice Department officials deciding soon whether to seek an indictment, 
reporters asked Atty. Gen. Janet Reno last week whether she had any views on 
the appropriateness of Clinton's Chicago trip. She answered only, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defended the trip Friday, saying, "There is still a presumption of 
innocence in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois State Sen. John Cullerton, one of Rostenkowski's two major rivals in 
the primary, called Clinton's visit "ill-advised." Noting the trip's law and 
order motif and Clinton's Whitewater land-development troubles, Cullerton 
gibed: "Both these guys are under investigation. It makes for interesting 
parallels." 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential aides emphasized that Clinton did not attend an official campaign 
event. But political observers said that simply by showing up alongside 
Rostenkowski, Clinton was underscoring the congressman's campaign theme: that 
he is close to the President and can bring home the pork for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 After his trip to Chicago, the President later Monday treated British Prime 
Minister John Major to an extraordinary show of hospitality: a tour of 
Pittsburgh, Pa., by limousine and an elegant dinner, capped by a ride on Air 
Force One and a White House sleepover in the Lincoln Bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-hour visit was a sentimental trip for Major, whose father and 
grandfather lived in Pittsburgh in the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to emphasize to all of you here in the heartland of America how 
important the relationship between the United States and Great Britain is," 
Clinton said, standing alongside Major in an airport hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have had sharp differences on Bosnia and Northern Ireland, the 
two leaders emphasized areas of agreement and cooperation, such as the 
importance of economic reform in Russia, expanding world trade and 
strengthening NATO.

COURT QUESTIONS CONGRESS' POWER ON TAX ISSUE; LAW: CALIFORNIA CASE CENTERS ON 
THE APPLICATION OF CHANGES RETROACTIVELY. JUSTICES APPEAR TO DISPUTE THE IDEA 
THAT LAWMAKERS HAVE THE AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, hearing a case brought by a California tax lawyer, reacted 
skeptically Monday to arguments that Congress has broad authority to apply tax 
changes retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 In their questions, eight of the nine justices appeared to dispute the notion 
that Congress can change tax laws so as to repeal deductions after taxpayers 
have acted to take advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibilities for the government are wonderful!" exclaimed Justice 
Antonin Scalia. "You dangled this (deduction) in front of a taxpayer and then 
took it away" after he jumped at the bait, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of retroactive tax changes arose in the case of a Newport Beach tax 
lawyer who lost $630,000 for a client when Congress in 1987 repealed a 
deduction it had created in 1986. The tax lawyer had taken advantage of the 
deduction in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the facts in this case are unusual, Republican senators have urged 
the justices to use it as a vehicle for sharply limiting the power of Congress 
to impose tax changes retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's argument, the justices gave no hint whether they would issue a 
narrow ruling limited mainly to the circumstances in the Newport Beach case or 
would rule broadly enough to affect the 1993 tax law, which Congress approved 
last August and applied retroactively to the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 They did suggest, however, that taxpayers are entitled to some protection 
under the Constitution's guarantee of "due process of law." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Solicitor General Kent L. Jones, representing the Justice 
Department, noted that the court for more than 60 years has given Congress 
virtually unlimited authority to impose tax changes retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "A taxpayer should be prepared for retroactive changes," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the taxpayer in this case, an executor of an estate, took "a perfectly 
sensible approach," commented Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and then was 
penalized when Congress decided the next year to repeal a deduction that was 
deemed overly generous. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Jones agreed, but the tax deduction as written in the 1986 law "was too 
good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is someone supposed to read the law and say, 'Well, Congress couldn't have 
meant that'?" asked a scowling Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
 Two justices posed this possibility: Suppose Congress repeals the capital 
gains tax during one year and millions of Americans take advantage of that 
opportunity to sell their stocks. If too much revenue is lost, could Congress 
re-enact the tax and retroactively impose it for the earlier year? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Jones said, as long as Congress saw it as a rational way to close a 
loophole or raise revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of any example that would violate your rule," Justice David H. 
Souter interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we should just trust Congress to be rational?" wondered Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Allen, a Newport Beach attorney representing the taxpayer, urged the 
court to declare unconstitutional any retroactive tax changes that punish a 
person who takes advantage of their provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayer here does not contend all retroactive tax legislation is 
unconstitutional," Allen said, but there are "serious problems of unfairness" 
if tax deductions are repealed after the fact, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The court will issue a ruling in the case, U.S. vs. Carlton, 92-1941, in 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court also announced Monday that it would clarify a child pornography 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose when a Van Nuys distributor of X-rated videos was caught 
selling tapes involving actress Traci Lords after it was learned that she was a 
minor when the films were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both the government and the video distributor agree that it would 
be unfair and unconstitutional to prosecute someone for distributing child 
pornography if he did not know the actress was under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributor, Rubin Gottesman, knew Lords was under age in the tapes he 
sold. Nonetheless, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated his 
conviction because it concluded the law was not clear.

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO CONSIDER APPEAL OF DEATH ROW INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment Monday to hear the appeal of a 
Texas Death Row inmate whose execution warrant was signed with a "happy face." 
</P>
<P>
 Lower courts previously had rejected the challenge of Robert Drew, who was 
convicted of fatally stabbing an Alabama teen-ager in 1983 and sentenced to die 
by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew's attorney, Ronald Kuby, said lower courts dismissed the case on a 
technicality and never ruled on whether District Judge Charles Hearn should be 
allowed to use the smiley face as part of his signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn has insisted that he had used the smiley face for years as a symbol of 
his faith in God. "The ruling speaks for itself," he said Monday. "It's part of 
my signature." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew, 34, came within hours of execution in October before being granted a 
reprieve by a Texas civil appeals court. No new execution date has been set. He 
maintains he is innocent.

 New Jersey's political Establishment turned out in force to denounce bigotry 
in anticipation of a speech by a controversial member of the Nation of Islam. 
But Khallid Abdul Muhammad offered a more subdued message than expected before 
an audience of about 350 at Trenton State College, his first public speaking 
engagement in New Jersey since his Nov. 29 polemic attacking Jews, Catholics, 
homosexuals and some black leaders.He said that "whites have taught us that we 
are black because we are cursed." But he said he did not come to teach black 
people how to hate whites. Politicians including Republican Gov. Christine Todd 
Whitman and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley earlier had attended panel 
discussions, made speeches and attended prayer vigils to counter Muhammad's 
presence.

CLINTON NAME TIED TO DEAL, WITNESS SAYS; ARKANSAS: EX-JUDGE CHARGED WITH FRAUD 
IS SAID TO REASSURE POTENTIAL BORROWER BY CITING GOVERNOR'S INVOLVEMENT. 
PRESIDENT HAS DENIED LINK. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Little Rock judge now charged with fraud invoked the name of 
then-Gov. Bill Clinton during a 1989 business deal to reassure a potential 
borrower who expressed concern that federally guaranteed funds were being used 
improperly, according to testimony heard Monday in a Whitewater-related case in 
federal court here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son, the governor of Arkansas wouldn't be involved in this if we were doing 
anything illegal," a witness said he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony came in the case of former Little Rock Municipal Judge David 
Hale, who is accused of defrauding the government of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars by misusing a federal program to aid small business. Hale claims that 
his legal troubles began when he had a meeting with Clinton in which he says 
Clinton pressured him to make a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, a partner with 
the governor in the Whitewater real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the loan ended up in the Whitewater venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has denied that he had any such dealings with Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony referring to Clinton came from Gayland Westbrook of Monroe, La., 
who appeared during a hearing on pretrial motions in the Hale case. Westbrook 
recalled that he visited Hale during the summer of 1989 because he wanted to 
borrow $75,000 for a computer business from a government-backed small business 
investment corporation that Hale operated. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook, who was called to the stand by an attorney for one of Hale's 
co-defendants, said he had reason to suspect that Hale was violating the laws 
governing operation of a small business investment corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale and two co-defendants are now charged with operating the firm, Capital 
Management Services, in a manner that cost taxpayers $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When Westbrook asked Hale about apparent improprieties, Westbrook said, Hale 
invoked Clinton's name and said the governor would never be involved in 
illegalities. He said Hale did not elaborate on the remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who served as governor of Arkansas until shortly before he became 
President in January, 1993, has denied meeting with Hale or asking him to loan 
money to McDougal. He also has denied knowing that any such funds were 
improperly used to finance the Ozark real estate investment known as Whitewater 
Development Corp. in which Clinton and his wife were partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, U.S. District Judge Stephen Reasoner, who will hear 
the fraud case against Hale and two co-defendants, agreed to allow Whitewater 
independent counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. to prosecute Hale -- even though the 
case technically is unrelated to the Whitewater affair. The ruling was a 
victory for Hale, whose defense depends on connecting his actions to Clinton 
and Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske was appointed more than a month ago by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to 
investigate allegations that Clinton and his wife, Hillary, may have benefited 
improperly from their joint real estate investment with McDougal and her 
husband, James, owner of a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate grand jury will soon be impaneled in Little Rock to hear evidence 
presented by Fiske and his staff relating directly to Whitewater. Before Fiske 
took charge of the case, Hale tried without success to trade his testimony 
about Clinton for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 While not conceding guilt in the fraud case, Hale asserts that his actions 
were necessary to save his small business investment corporation from 
insolvency after he made $700,000 in bad loans to the McDougals -- including 
the money that was diverted to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington on Monday, Sen. Alphonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican 
on the Senate Banking Committee, released documents showing that two federal 
regulators objected in 1989 when Mrs. Clinton's law firm was chosen to 
represent the government in the case of McDougal's failed thrift.

 The trial of an activist charged with murdering an abortion doctor opened in 
Pensacola, Fla., with the prosecutor saying the man confessed, and the defense 
saying a government witness will be implicated. Defendant Michael F. Griffin's 
lawyers won a victory just before opening statements, as Circuit Judge John 
Parnham rejected a prosecution attempt to block introduction of graphic 
anti-abortion materials. Dr. David Gunn was shot three times in the back March 
10 when he arrived for work at the Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic.

 Lorena Bobbitt was released from a mental hospital, five weeks after a jury 
found her innocent by reason of temporary insanity in the sexual mutilation of 
her husband.Accepting a medical evaluation that said Bobbitt posed no threat to 
herself or to others, Judge Herman A. Whisenant Jr. ruled that the 
Ecuadorian-born manicurist could be freed from a Virginia state hospital as 
long as she remains in the state and continues to undergo psychiatric 
counseling. "I am looking forward to my healing process," Bobbitt added in 
halting English. Her attorney said his client planned to move in "with a family 
that has been very supportive of her" and to return to her $24,000-a-year job 
as a manicurist.

PEPPER SPRAY NOW FOR SALE TO RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting today, Californians will be able to legally buy a pepper spray tear 
gas that can be used to disable an attacker for up to 45 minutes but rarely 
causes long-term injuries, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spray, available in 47 other states, was legalized in California by the 
Legislature with the condition that users be trained to properly apply the 
substance before being allowed to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said the state Justice Department has established a certification 
program and has licensed more than 200 outlets statewide to sell the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pepper spray is a reasonably safe and effective self-protection device," 
Lungren said at a news conference. "Ordinary citizens, properly trained, can be 
trusted to use pepper spray in a safe, legal manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren appeared with Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), who authored 
the law and today is scheduled to become the first California civilian 
certified to carry the spray. Police officers have authority to use the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Speier said she carried the legislation in the hopes of providing people 
concerned about self-defense an alternative to buying guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in the Dark Ages," the lawmaker said, explaining that it was 
easier to buy a gun in California than to buy tear gas. "All of us are 
concerned about the spread of lethal weapons in California." 
</P>
<P>
 When properly applied, the pepper spray, known as oleoresin capsicum tear gas, 
disables a person by forcing the eyes shut and restricting breathing ability. 
The symptoms are acute for a few minutes, subside within 10 to 15 minutes, and 
usually disappear within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 People who want to carry the spray will have three ways to be certified: 
</P>
<P>
 They can pass a 30-question test, watch a 30-minute videotape or attend a 
class at a police station, community college or private academy. In each case, 
they will be required to test-spray a canister holding a harmless gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants will have to pay a $17 fee and will receive a pink, wallet-size 
certification card good for life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a misdemeanor to carry pepper gas without a certificate or to carry a 
brand not certified by the attorney general's office. It is a felony to use the 
spray in the commission of a crime.

SEX ABUSE SUIT AGAINST CHICAGO CARDINAL DROPPED; CLERGY: FORMER SEMINARY 
STUDENT SAYS ALTHOUGH HE BELIEVES HE WAS ABUSED, HIS MEMORY IS UNRELIABLE. HE 
WILL PURSUE CASE AGAINST ANOTHER PRIEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, accused last November of sexual abuse, 
was exonerated of all charges Monday when a former high school seminary student 
dropped a $10-million lawsuit against the prominent churchman, saying that his 
memory was unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Steven J. Cook told a federal court in Cincinnati that although 
Cook, now 34, believes he had been sexually abused when he was a 17-year-old 
seminarian in the mid-1970s, he no longer could be sure that it was Bernardin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's decision drew expressions of gratitude from Bernardin, the 
highest-ranking prelate to be accused of sexually abusing minors. From the 
beginning, he had unequivocally denied the charges. Cook's action was also 
certain to again call into question the credibility of charges based on what 
has become called "recovered memory," the recollection of painful events years 
after their occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued after his attorneys met with U.S. District Judge S. 
Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati, Cook said that if he knew in November what he now 
understands about the limitations of recovered memory, he would never have sued 
Bernardin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been my intention to do the right thing," Cook said in a 
statement. "I filed the lawsuit against Cardinal Bernardin because I had vivid 
memories of abuse which I believed to be true. I even subjected myself to two 
polygraphs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the information I have learned since filing the lawsuit, I now 
realize that the memories which arose during and after hypnosis are unreliable. 
In fact, if I knew at the time I filed the lawsuit what I know now, I would 
never have sued Cardinal Bernardin," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cook said he will pursue his suit against Father Ellis N. Harsham of 
Beavercreek, Ohio, then a priest at St. Gregory's Seminary in Cincinnati, who 
was also named in the suit filed in November, along with the seminary and the 
Cincinnati archdiocese. Harsham has said he is innocent. The case is scheduled 
to go to trial May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 When he made the charges, Cook -- a substance-abuse counselor who left his job 
at a psychiatric hospital in February, 1993, and who said he has AIDS -- said 
that it was not until 1992 when he began to recall incidents of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook first publicly disclosed the charges in a CNN interview last November. "I 
don't really know if you can put words to describe it, what that pain is like. 
It shatters your world, it shatters your soul, it shatters your life. 
(Bernardin) has to pay a price," he told the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardin said Monday that he had been "totally humiliated" by the attack on 
his character. He said he has now been "vindicated." Bernardin has been viewed 
as one of the leading voices in the U.S. church calling for swift action 
against priest offenders and help for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I harbor no ill feelings toward Steven Cook," Bernardin told a news 
conference in Chicago. "I have compassion for him. I have prayed for him every 
day, and I will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that 10,000 adults in the United States have made recent 
claims of childhood sexual victimization based on recalled memories. But the 
issue is controversial among health care professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist John Hochman of Encino, who has written about the subject, said 
Monday that Cook's case may point out the limitations of basing charges on 
recalled memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you go through a hypnotic trance and you somehow have a fantasy, it 
becomes a memory once you're out of the trance. It seems real, in fact it seems 
so real you can pass a polygraph," Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardin said, as have others in the church, that he continued to be troubled 
by "the almost instantaneous judgment made by some that I had fallen from 
grace." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, president of the 
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that troubling questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without impugning the seriousness of authentic cases of sexual abuse, 
important questions remain concerning the role of certain attorneys, 
psychiatrists and media in bringing reckless charges against innocent people," 
Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable network's broadcast was itself controversial. The CNN interview had 
been delayed a few days to coincide with the opening of a national Catholic 
bishops conference in Washington, a CNN spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of CNN and others in the accusations made against Cardinal Bernardin 
is a story deserving of telling. Unfortunately, only the media, medical and 
legal professions can appropriately police themselves," Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, the archdiocese emphasized that the decision by Cook was entirely 
his own. "The withdrawal of charges is not part of any compromise or 
settlement. Neither the cardinal nor his attorneys, or anyone else, has offered 
anything in exchange for the action," the archdiocese said. Cook confirmed that 
his action was voluntary.

SURPRISE TRADE COOLED MCNALL-GRETZKY PARTNERSHIP; RELATIONSHIPS: SINCE THE DEAL 
THAT SENT HIS PAL AND KINGS DEFENSEMAN PAUL COFFEY TO DETROIT, THE KINGS' STAR 
AND THE FRANCHISE OWNER HAVE AVOIDED ONE-ON-ONE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. BUT THEY 
SAY ALL IS WELL BETWEEN THEM NOW.

 Their business partnership once seemed unlimited. Horses, a 1910 Honus Wagner 
baseball card bought for $451,000 and a football team were among the building 
blocks of the relationship between Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall and his 
top star and frequent investment partner, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 But the football team, the Toronto Argonauts, became a financial albatross, 
costing Gretzky about $2 million. However, Gretzky believed that gains from his 
horse racing investments with McNall offset his Argonaut losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For his current contract signed last week, Gretzky -- who once negotiated with 
McNall one on one in an unusual sign of trust -- left the details to his 
lawyer. The negotiations went on through the summer and there was an agreement 
in principle in late September. But it would take nearly five more months and 
many difficult moments before Gretzky signed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a departure from his first contract in 1988, shortly after he was 
traded from the Edmonton Oilers to Los Angeles. They scribbled numbers on a 
piece of paper, and McNall kept insisting that Gretzky be paid more. Gretzky 
argued for less. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, others spoke for them. For McNall, it was his vice chairman and 
chief financial officer, Suzan A. Waks. Gretzky was represented by his longtime 
agent, Michael Barnett, and lawyer, Ron Fujikawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate had changed after a strain developed in McNall's relationship with 
Gretzky. A crack appeared last season when McNall and his management team 
angered Gretzky by trading to the Detroit Red Wings defenseman Paul Coffey, one 
of his closest friends. Worse yet, McNall never warned Gretzky, who was openly 
emotional when he and his wife heard the news from Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall later admitted that it was not handled adroitly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the Paul Coffey trade was disappointing," Gretzky says. "It 
probably had something of a ripple effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The rift became public minutes after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup finals. 
Gretzky shocked the sports world -- and his business partner and boss, McNall 
-- with talk of possible retirement. Later, Gretzky and his entourage swept 
past McNall, who was surrounded by reporters, waiting for an explanation. 
"Thanks, Wayne," McNall yelled. Gretzky ignored him and walked by. The blood 
drained from McNall's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Gretzky and McNall insist everything is fine. "To me, it's 
back," McNall said. "There were some problems over the Coffey trade. There was 
a sense of miscommunication and misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both busy. I see him all the time. Yesterday, he came over to drop by. 
Our relationship hasn't changed in the sense that the last couple of months 
have been fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the major issue they differ on publicly is their football team. Gretzky 
wants to unload the Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky said he did not go along with every venture McNall has suggested in 
the past, but has not ruled out future partnerships. "I trust Bruce," he said.

 Transport workers struck in several cities Monday as industrial unrest spread 
from the engineering industry to the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus and train drivers in the industrial heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia 
prevented thousands of workers from getting to their jobs on time. Protest 
stoppages lasted for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, in response to employer calls for a wage freeze and benefit cuts, 
was the latest in a series of disputes over pay and job security hitting the 
German economy as it struggles to emerge from recession.

TIGHTER PUBLIC BUILDING SECURITY SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Accusing the Wilson Administration of foot-dragging in the wake of attacks on 
state employees at the work site, Sen. Art Torres proposed legislation Monday 
aimed at making people safer in public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Democrat and representatives of public employee unions said 
the Wilson Administration has all but ignored State Police recommendations for 
improving security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged that so few agencies have acted upon the State Police report," 
Torres, a candidate for insurance commissioner, told a news conference where he 
outlined his proposed Public Building Safety Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Eckery, an Administration spokesman, denied that the recommendations 
were ignored. "Things are moving forward," he said, including training 
employees in being alert to danger and watching out for the safety of one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' announcement was made at the headquarters of the state Franchise Tax 
Board, where a gunman last year held employees hostage until he was killed by 
police. Torres also cited the killing of three people Dec. 2 at the Oxnard 
office of the Department of Employment Development and the subsequent slaying 
of a policeman. The assailant was killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require state and local governments to conduct "risk 
assessments" of their buildings by Dec. 31, 1996, and establish priorities for 
making them more secure, including use of bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also would put the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration into the business of designing and implementing safety standards 
in new state buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, rank-and-file state employees would be added to a group against 
whom criminal attacks would be more seriously punished. This group already 
includes elected officials and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres noted that after the hostage incident in Sacramento last March, the 
Wilson Administration ordered the State Police to conduct a detailed security 
assessment of state facilities. The agency issued a list of recommendations 
last summer, including beefing up surveillance, alarm and building access 
systems, and conducting employee security training seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Crouch, health and safety coordinator for the 100,000-member California 
State Employees Assn., said his union had sought information on the security 
measures but was told by Administration officials that "everything costs 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be putting a price tag on safety," Crouch said. "They are 
prioritizing: What do you want, ergonomically safe furniture or bulletproof 
glass?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Eckery, spokesman for the State and Consumer Services Agency, said 
departments are being allowed to hire additional security guards and that 
relatively low-cost employee self-help training is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, money is tight," he said. "And clearly, you want to do the 
non-monetary things first."

BOMB HOAX SNARLS TRAFFIC OVER POTOMAC

 A man claiming to have a bomb held police at bay for several hours Monday on a 
Potomac River bridge, snarling morning traffic in the nation's capital and 
disrupting Amtrak service along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadiq Abubakar drove his car into a barrier on the bridge and refused to let 
anyone near him for hours. Police negotiated with him via a cordless two-way 
police phone they used a robot to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorced, unemployed Nigerian national demanded to see his 6-year-old 
daughter, who lives with her mother in Portsmouth, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He surrendered about 2 p.m. No bomb was found. Authorities said Abubakar had 
been treated for mental problems since 1991.

HYPE TENDS TO OBSCURE THE MEANING OF INTERACTIVE TV; INFORMATION: ONE MAN'S

COMPLEXITY. COST WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE.

 Three nights a week at 7 p.m., Manhattan cable Channel 37 cuts from the chat 
show "Realty Views" to a spinning green orb with a message: "Fly the Electronic 
Neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next hour, about a dozen home viewers use their telephone key pads to 
navigate a 3-D world studded with graphic icons -- a bicycle, a tree, a 
paintbrush, a Zen temple -- that contain multimedia fare. 
</P>
<P>
 They tour a Russian palace, peruse a cable TV guide, hear full-motion sound 
bites of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo nominating Bill Clinton for President. 
</P>
<P>
 They draw multicolored lines, watch a guy describe his bike route in Queens, 
read pro-feminist, anti-homeless, happy-birthday and get-well messages, view an 
animated film about civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not seem like much, but participants in this New York University 
experiment are pioneers in interactive television -- a field larded with hype 
but also the potential to change America's couch culture in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of companies are promoting the first wave of offerings. Countless 
start-ups have ideas but no money. Corporate partnering occurs almost daily. 
Newspapers describe the possibilities with wide-eyed fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one catch: For consumers, interactivity is still mostly talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have known that any revolution involving the media would be the 
most thoroughly analyzed and over-hyped revolution of them all," said Wired, a 
trendy techno-magazine. It placed "Interactive Everything" No. 2 on its "Hype 
List" in a recent issue.  
</P>
<P>
 The term grows broader daily. Are round-the-clock soap opera reruns really 
interactive, as one company claims, just because a viewer can choose when to 
watch? Does interactivity mean something more complex, like controlling what 
happens on screen or supplying program content? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get away from choice," said Red Burns, who chairs the NYU 
graduate program that developed the "Electronic Neighborhood." "More 
interesting is that you can manipulate, you can move around, you can create." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry, however, is driven by sales. Commercial tests will accelerate this 
year, allowing consumers to order movies, shop electronically, browse 
encyclopedias, and play along with sports events and quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology in a short time promises much more: "Virtual" tours of vacation 
spots. Traffic reports that let viewers manipulate cameras mounted alongside 
busy routes. Video catalogues showing how a consumer looks in an L.L. Bean 
sweater or Giorgio Armani suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The big mystery is how much consumers will pay for interactive information and 
entertainment -- potentially a $3.5-trillion industry, some have estimated.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very rich area to work in," said Ed Szurkowski, head of 
interactive computing systems research for Bell Labs, American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co.'s research arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is you have to be careful because ultimately it's driven by the 
question of what do people want and what are they willing to pay for," he said. 
"You can drive down a lot of dark alleys that ultimately lead to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's getting behind the wheel. Cable, telephone and entertainment 
companies are joining forces. The takeover fight for Paramount Communications 
Inc. illustrates the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of outfits with names like Voyager and Cyberdreams are developing 
interactive software. Computer hardware, software and chip companies are 
teaming to build the critical set-top decoder boxes that will control the new 
two-way TVs. Concepts are abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our ideas to the big companies and they jumped up and down," said 
Jennifer Carney, who with two partners started Vortex Communications to develop 
a video bulletin board program dubbed "America's Grapevine." 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't received any money. "It could be because they see so many good 
ideas that they're having trouble picking," Carney said. "There's a certain 
level of how do you pick which one?" 
</P>
<P>
 How indeed? Name a company or a business figure and they're probably involved 
with interactivity. Michael Milken, the paroled financier with a longstanding 
interest in education, has invested in a multimedia cable venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is kind of overblown right now because it is an experimental 
period," said Bruce Ryon, a multimedia analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, 
Calif., market researcher. "You're really not going to see anything settle out 
until the '97-'98 time period." 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology is in place but the cost is horrendous," he said. "In the 
consumer market, pricing is everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Big business is probing consumer tolerance and desire. AT&T and cable company 
Viacom Inc. soon will begin an interactive trial in Castro Valley, Calif., 
offering movies on demand to start. Time Warner Inc. is testing in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Corp. began one of the earliest trials in 1989 in Cerritos, Calif. About 
7,500 homes have access to on-demand movies. Another 350 pay $9.95 a month for 
a two-way system called Main Street, offers about 50 services ranging from 
airline reservations to stock trading. About 600 households in suburban Boston 
and 2,000 in northern San Diego County also subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say GTE's on-screen presentation is a dull mix of photos, audio 
and text for services with limited appeal. Rather than borrowing a book through 
TV, for instance, readers might want to visit a real library. 
</P>
<P>
 "What GTE is to be congratulated for is doing a trial and experimenting," said 
A. Michael Noll, dean of the University of Southern California's Annenberg 
School for Communication. "The negative side is . . . a trial creates a need to 
promote it and sometimes an inability to admit failure, that you didn't find a 
market for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The past is dotted with failure. Knight-Ridder Inc. lost millions in the 
mid-1980s on a videotext experiment in Florida that let TV viewers select and 
read news. J.C. Penney & Co. canned an interactive shopping experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquest recently surveyed 200 households with a minimum income of $30,000 
and an existing personal computer or video game, finding strong interest in 
interactive services -- but at low prices. Some trials indicate consumers won't 
pay more than a $1 premium over a store rental for an on-demand movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming must be compelling and entertaining without complexity. It's more 
than watching an "F Troop" rerun whenever you want, but that's a start. So is 
competing against "Jeopardy!" or predicting football plays, services offered by 
Interactive Network of Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Design is important. Using the TV is a culture. It evolved from turning a knob 
to change channels -- usually to watch a specific program at a specific time -- 
to remote-control "surfing" among offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid techno-exasperation that may sap consumer interest, industry 
executives want to make new contraptions and services unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very careful (not to) inundate them with the new technology," 
said Bob Meyers, who heads Viacom's Castro Valley test. "We'd like to make the 
steps reasonable so people don't trip on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom will inaugurate interactive services slowly to its 12,500 customers in 
the San Francisco suburb. First offerings: on-demand movies and an electronic 
TV guide. A home shopping service will follow, enabling consumers to specify a 
product and choose brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of people this is the beginning of direct involvement with the new 
world of the digital electronic marketplace," said Michael Sheridan, president 
of EON Corp. of Reston, Va., which is developing interactive programming with 
Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and others. "It'll take time and there will be a lot of 
lessons to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides consumer uncertainty, technological hurdles remain. A big issue is 
managing the enormous multimedia databanks needed to store and transmit the 
movies, pictures, newspapers, music and other data traveling on the network. 
</P>
<P>
 The network will have to be powerful enough to accommodate the electronic 
nightmare of tens of thousands of people dialing up "Terminator 6" at once. The 
system of switches, transmission lines and computer storage requires elaborate 
standards still under development. 
</P>
<P>
 Software maker Oracle Corp. recently unveiled a database program using a 
supercomputer it says can serve 66,000 homes simultaneously, up to 750,000 in a 
version due in 1995. Silicon Graphics Inc., International Business Machines 
Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and others are also developing such systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the commercial race, the interactive age has fuzzier aesthetic and 
intellectual ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the focus of NYU's year-old program, funded by regional phone company 
Nynex and available to 565,000 lower Manhattan households. Participants supply 
words, pictures and movies via fax, telephone and computer modem, and take 
turns controlling the picture seen by everyone who tunes in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany last summer, a group of artists with corporate and government 
support created a 100-day on-air multimedia experiment called Piazza Virtuale, 
designed to foster collaborative art and dismantle interpersonal barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts carry anti-TV overtones. They view television as an active, 
non-commercial medium that can stimulate communal behavior rather than satisfy 
individual cravings to be informed or entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the audience can choose their role and their function, the content -- his 
private truth -- will come more easily and clearly," said Karel Dudesek, a 
co-director of the Ponton European Media Art Lab in Hamburg, Germany. "We're 
talking about culture. We're not talking about information." 
</P>
<P>
 Esoteric? Sure. But such projects offer a window on behavior that could help 
companies determine what interactive arenas to pursue. Society in a few years 
probably will use its souped-up TVs in ways no one has yet conceived. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who grew up on Nintendo machines don't think this is so strange," said 
Nathan Myhrvold, senior vice president for advanced technology at Microsoft. 
"There's a huge generation that's mounting now where that's been their whole 
life."

FOR ONE FAMILY, RECOVERY COMING OVER TIME; ECONOMY: A VETERAN TRUCK DRIVER AND 
HIS WIFE SAY IT'S LIKE STARTING FROM SCRATCH, BUT SLOWLY, SURELY, THAT SENSE OF 
SECURITY, WITH THE HELP OF OVERTIME PAY, IS MAKING ITS WAY BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When John Harrington hears the pundits crowing about the booming economy, he 
can offer proof, too. It's right there in his paycheck, summed up in one word: 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Five extra hours, maybe 10 a week, if he's lucky. An extra day's pay won't 
make his family rich, but it's a notch up on their security ladder -- and 
that's good enough for the veteran truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything looked dismal three, four years ago," Harrington says. "Now, I'm 
more optimistic. I read the newspapers and see all the positive things. If 
people are buying and spending money, then I'm working. That's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been that way very long. About 2 1/2 years ago, the trucking company 
Harrington had worked for since he was 18 closed -- just two months after he 
and his wife, Ellen, bought a new house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard to get ahead," Harrington says, explaining why they had bought 
the home. "You couldn't wait for everything to be perfect. You had to take a 
chance. Then what we thought could happen, happened." 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a domino-like procession of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months without a job. Savings depleted. Two mortgages to meet, one from 
their former house. And a new worry: health insurance. Harrington's 
mother-in-law made the $250 monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, he said, 'I'll be working in a month,' " Ellen Harrington recalls. 
"One month went by. Then another. And another. I thought the economy must be 
really bad. Everything is not going to be as easy as I thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was determined to stay in trucking even though deregulation during 
the '80s had bankrupted companies and forced thousands onto the unemployment 
rolls. At age 43, he had 20 years invested in a Teamsters pension and wasn't 
about to change professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was locked in," he says. "It's almost stupid to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington eventually found temporary work at Carolina Freight Carriers Corp.; 
he was hired full time in February, 1993. He says he earns more than $15 an 
hour, still short of union scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's slightly more than his previous salary, the cost of living has 
soared and the Harringtons, like many other blue-collar workers across America, 
feel as if they're running in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're making progress, it's minimal," says the ruddy-faced, mustachioed 
Harrington. "But who is progressing? I just don't know. . . . We're just 
breaking even." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harringtons and their two daughters, 16 and 10, live modestly in a 
ranch-style home on the city's South Side -- a Democratic, blue-collar bastion 
-- about a mile from Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Harrington works part time as a secretary and travel agent to make ends 
meet. Their money disappears fast: $100 a week for their 16-year-old's Catholic 
school tuition; $100 a week for gas and lunch for her husband. Then the 
mortgage, food, clothes and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent from two tenants who live in their former home, a building with two 
apartments, helps out. Still, it's a scrimp-and-save world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep thinking we're going to have extra money," Ellen Harrington says. 
"But without any savings . . . we live from check to check. It seems like we're 
starting all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington has begun putting aside $20 from each check to build new savings, 
and he hopes his new job will restore the family's sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have postponed big purchases. Harrington drives a 1983 Ford pickup 
truck; his wife has a 1978 Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington is bracing for contract talks this spring, hoping there won't be 
concessions, but he's not expecting a raise, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the company is going to be around for a while," he says. "If they 
aren't, we'll just deal with it when the time comes.

SMALL BUSINESS OWNER LOOKS TOWARD BIGGER THINGS; GROWTH: JOHN WILSON KNOWS 
SUCCESS WON'T COME EASILY BUT, LIKE THOSE ON HIS FAVORITE TEAM, HE'LL KEEP 
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the day he opened up shop, John Wilson's frame of mind about his prospects 
as the owner of a small business could be likened to his experience as a 
die-hard Atlanta Braves fan -- high hopes and depressing reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gotten everything all set up -- the letterheads, the forms, the 
business cards. I was ready," he recounts in the office of Wilson & Associates 
-- the office being an upstairs room in his suburban Atlanta townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve hours and dozens of "no's" later, Wilson's mood had declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think you've got it all together, then you see it isn't going to come 
easy. You come from up here," he says, stretching his arms high, "then, right 
to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson & Associates remanufactures worn-out computer laser printer cartridges 
so they can be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 That first evening, Wilson switched on a tiny TV on his work table and 
followed his baseball team while he worked on cartridges. The Braves lost and 
were a seemingly insurmountable nine games behind the first-place San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started just when the Braves were starting their big comeback," says 
Wilson, grinning below a Braves pennant on his office wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves went on to catch the Giants in a dramatic race. Wilson, meanwhile, 
built up his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're chugging along. I've learned to ride that emotional roller coaster," he 
says, six months later. "The economy's getting better. I'm not fearful about 
the future anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Wilson is fulfilling one goal by owning his own business. He hasn't 
given up on another -- to be a millionaire by the time he's 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made it through some rough times," says Wilson, who moved here from 
southern New Jersey out of high school. He's "never not been working," but has 
often used odd jobs to get by, earning as little as $9,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked for $5 to $6 an hour off and on for years as a parking lot 
attendant. He has risen at 3 a.m. each day to load United Parcel Service 
delivery trucks, has been in the vending machine business, has been a 
photocopier repairman and a copier salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson learned a couple of years ago about remanufacturing the cartridges that 
enable computer users to print out files. He compares it to rebuilding an auto 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 New cartridges can run in the hundreds of dollars. He overhauls them and sells 
them back to their owners for half the cost of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has larger competitors, Wilson sees the field, less than a decade 
old, as one suited to a small operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't serve a client the way I can," he says. "I pick up and deliver 
myself, and I have a quick turnaround time." 
</P>
<P>
 The garrulous Wilson spent half a year preparing to open, investing $10,000 
from his savings and friends' loans. He also began lining up customers, some at 
the parking lot where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 His clients include advertising agencies, law firms, accountants, brokerage 
firms and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name of his business, Wilson's only associate so far is his wife, 
Felicia, who keeps the books. 
</P>
<P>
 He rises at about 7 a.m. each weekday, showers and dresses, then walks 
upstairs and shuts the door to his office, in which a packed shelf contains 
such books as "Getting Business to Come to You" and "The Small Business 
Survival Guide."

NEBRASKA AND FRESNO STATE WILL PLAY IN PIGSKIN CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska, which is expected to have one of the nation's top college football 
teams next season, and Fresno State have agreed to play in the Pigskin Classic 
Aug. 29 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., said 
athletic directors from both schools have accepted invitations to the game.But, 
according to Andersen, Nebraska Athletic Director Bill Byrne wanted to get 
final approval from Cornhusker Coach Tom Osborne this morning before making an 
official announcement, perhaps as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 "One last contact with Osborne (this morning) and it should be all set," 
Andersen said. "This matchup is in keeping with the high quality of teams we've 
had in the game, and it's also attractive from a gate standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, which has won back-to-back Western Athletic Conference 
co-championships, brought some 40,000 fans to Anaheim for the 1992 Freedom Bowl 
against USC. The Bulldogs beat the Trojans, 24-7, in front of a Freedom 
Bowl-record crowd of 50,745. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, which lost to Florida State, 19-17, in the Orange Bowl, also has a 
strong alumni base in Southern California, and Andersen believes the fifth 
edition of the Pigskin game could draw more fans than last year's USC-North 
Carolina game, which attracted a Pigskin high of 49,309. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary Cunningham, the Fresno State athletic director, said he thought they 
could sell 30,000 tickets, and Byrne said he thought Nebraska could sell 
15,000," Andersen said. "If we go in with 45,000 tickets sold by the teams, we 
could exceed 60,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska probably will be a heavy favorite. The Cornhuskers return seven 
starters each on offense and defense from a team that went 11-1 and fell just 
short of the 1993 national championship.

ANALYSIS; A WINTER OF IOC CONTENT AFTER LILLEHAMMER GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a divorce of convenience. Simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing had grown so unwieldy -- Winter Olympics in February, then the 
Summer Games only a few months later in a totally different part of the world. 
And then 3 1/2 years of nothing but preparation for the dreaded double all over 
again, in two other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bigger the Olympics got, the more difficult it was for all involved to 
put on Games twice in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's split them up," someone suggested, and the hush that followed was 
absolute, for those who run the Olympics are not used to hearing radical 
proposals. And this was definitely a radical proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Split the Games? Disturb the Olympic cycle? Goodness, what would people think? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, something had to be done. And upon sober consideration, radical began 
sounding reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 So, eventually it was decided to spin off the Winter Games from the Summer, 
putting them on their own four-year cycle. That meant one final Winter-Summer 
combination in 1992, then the Winter Games quickly again in '94, then four 
years later in '98, four years after that in 2002 and continuing on that 
schedule. Summer Games would continue in the old cycle after '92, again in '96, 
then 2000, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 That would make things much simpler for the International Olympic Committee -- 
and the national Olympic committees of the world, whose job it is to provide 
the athletes for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 And there might even be a byproduct. Maybe, just maybe, the Winter Games, that 
scrawny little brother always standing in the shadow of the strapping Summer 
Games, would grow a bit, acquire an identity of its own, perhaps even develop a 
little muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about your growth spurts! 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a certainty, but it's at least even money that in years to come, when 
the discussion gets around to it, Lillehammer '94 will be regarded as the 
Olympics in which the Winter Games came of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as a moneymaker, for these government-subsidized Games will not come close 
to covering expenses, but in terms of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Norway, and probably throughout most of Europe, the interest was 
enormous, as expected. But suddenly this time around, the Winter Games were 
boffo in the United States, too. Nobody had anticipated that. CBS might have 
hoped, but in previous years, hardly anybody said, "Gee, the Olympics are on 
tonight. Let's catch some of that great biathlon action." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Americans watched the women's figure skating, the hockey, a 
little of the speedskating, maybe some of the Alpine skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 This year? Many complained about CBS not having shown much of the action, but 
they watched whatever CBS was showing anyway. The network dominated the ratings 
during the first week of the Games, more of the same is expected when the 
second-week ratings are in, and last Wednesday night's showdown between Nancy 
Kerrigan and Tonya Harding was the third-highest rated sporting event in U.S. 
television history. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which would have been a bit surprising, had it not been for the X 
factor, the Harding-Kerrigan morality play. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Kerrigan in Detroit on Jan. 6, and the subsequent involvement of 
Harding, her former husband and others known to her in the real-life soap opera 
that followed, obviously alerted viewers to the fact that, yes, we were having 
Olympics again, even though we'd had them only a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even speedskater Dan Jansen, who played the lead in his own little ongoing 
drama here, was moved to remark about the Games' high rating. "I guess the 
situation with Tonya and Nancy had something to do with that. It seemed a few 
months before the Games that people didn't even know they were coming." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Tonyagate" piqued the interest, though, the Games themselves sustained it. 
The friendly Norwegians partied hearty for two weeks on the Alpine slopes, the 
Nordic arenas, the speedskating venues. They showed up in such great numbers 
for cross-country skiing and biathlon that other curious folk simply had to see 
what all that shouting, singing and flag waving was about. 
</P>
<P>
 And with audiences like that, the athletes responded like ham actors in a 
crowded drawing room. They showed new viewers what they, and people in so many 
other parts of the world, like about these winter sports. The men's 
40-kilometer relay cross-country race, for instance, was far more gripping -- 
for its 1-hour 40-minute duration -- than any Super Bowl, recent or otherwise, 
has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 These Games, in fact, so excited the Norwegians that they are talking here 
about bidding again for the Winter Olympics of 2010 and getting their money's 
worth out of the Olympic venues. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the $130-million deficit, that was part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tor Aune, press chief for the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee: 
"The deficit is what the (Norwegian) government is paying as an investment for 
new (tourist) activity in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 After the exposure of these Games, Norway probably won't remain Europe's 
best-kept secret. It is, in fact, every U.S. traveler's dream -- a beautiful, 
clean country whose people are not only warm, helpful and friendly but speak 
English in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee is almost giddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonderful," IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said. "Best ever." 
</P>
<P>
 More expansive was Andrew Napier, the IOC's media liaison, who said: 
"Lillehammer will be a golden memory. What Lillehammer has done for the Olympic 
movement is excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 What Lillehammer did for the Olympic movement was to move the Winter Games out 
front and center, right there in the sunshine, next to big brother.

JIM MURRAY: COURIER WILL DO HIS DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Connors put the golf vs. tennis controversy into perspective -- his -- 
when he demanded, "How can you call a thing a sport when you don't even have to 
run?" 
</P>
<P>
 Golf, of course, countered, "How can you call a game a sport where a shutout 
is called 'love?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis' last hurrah was, "Ever see a fat tennis player?" 
</P>
<P>
 By any yardstick, though, tennis' Jim Courier is an athlete. Growing up, he 
couldn't even decide whether to be a tennis or baseball star. He could play 
them equally well. He played shortstop and pitcher. If you can do that, who 
needs Wimbledon? He could be at Riverfront playing for his beloved Cincinnati 
Reds. He had a pretty good fastball and he could turn the double play. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose tennis. You have to hit the fastball there, too, and sometimes it 
comes in at velocities -- 140 m.p.h. -- that make Nolan Ryan's fast one look 
like a changeup. It's a game where you have to fool a hitter, too. Throw a 
little knuckler at him, otherwise known as a drop shot or lob. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Courier pounces on drop volleys like Ozzie Smith sucking up the ground 
ball in the hole and, with a racquet in his hands, he's Pete Rose edging up and 
guessing curve. His trademark baseball cap shades one of the most determined 
faces in sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the best tennis player in the world at the tender age of 21 years 5 
months and remained so for 58 weeks. He had picked the right sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He is down here this week for the Newsweek Champions Cup at the Hyatt Grand 
Champions resort, a venue and a tournament where Courier first burst on the 
tennis public's consciousness when he won the event in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A very select field awaits him this year, as imposing as any Wimbledon ever 
had, with 14 of the top 18 players in the world on the other side of the nets. 
Courier is as big a name as any of them with his four Grand Slam titles -- two 
French, two Australian -- to say nothing of his finalist finishes in one 
Australian (1994), a Wimbledon (1993) and a U.S. Open (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 But if tennis players run, if they stay thin and they hit a moving ball, they 
have sometimes been perceived as unlike their golfing brothers, additionally, 
in that they are not as patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers, to a man, consider selection to a Ryder Cup team, golfing for your 
country, as a high honor, an event to be hailed, a privilege. Tennis players 
have been known to view selection to the Davis Cup team as an unwarranted 
interference with their otherwise untrammeled ability to make money. They are a 
little like the fellow Abraham Lincoln used to tell about who had been tarred 
and feathered and ridden out of town strapped to a railroad tie and, when asked 
what he thought about it, said: "Well, if it weren't for the honor of the 
thing, I'd rather walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis players similarly have been known to have rather walked, to have 
regarded Davis Cup selection as a dubious distinction at best, and last year so 
many of them walked that the team, undermanned, went over to Australia and lost 
the Cup right off the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 So, this year, the U.S. Tennis Assn. was understandably buoyed when Courier, 
who had declined last year, announced that he was available for Davis Cup play 
and will join Todd Martin, Patrick McEnroe and Richey Reneberg in an effort to 
bring the Cup back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with Davis Cup is it's like the Holy Grail. You have to go to 
exotic places to get at it. Play for the United States starts in New Delhi 
later this month. It has been known to proceed to places like Paraguay, 
Colombia, the Bahamas, Bucharest, Dublin and once even to Cleveland and Little 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 And since Davis Cup matches do not have any niceties like tiebreakers in last 
sets, Courier is not only enlisting for a lot of long flights, but a lot of 
long matches. There is nothing like playing a 22-20 set in front of a hostile 
anti-American crowd after a 22-hour jet flight. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course, someone has to do it, and if the Couriers and the other top 
Americans failed their patriotic duties, the Davis Cup might wind up in a store 
window in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davis Cup "ties" (that's what the Davis Cup calls matches) come in March, 
July, September and December, which means they follow hard on the heels of this 
sport's "majors," or Grand Slam events -- the French Open, Wimbledon, the U.S. 
Open and the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf's Ryder Cup, by comparison, is played only once every two years and is 
concluded over a single weekend. The Davis Cup is more like a floating crap 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Nathan Hale played for his country, too. And in front of hostile 
audiences. And Courier says he likes curry. So New Delhi in March, while hardly 
Paris in the spring, is not exactly hanging for your country. And you only have 
to do it once, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he change his mind this year and elect to Davis Cup it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maturity, I guess," Courier said. "When we lost last year, it had a sobering 
effect. There's no reason to send less than our best. It's a responsibility. 
When you see what it means to other countries. . . . I mean, you play in Davis 
Cup in other countries, you really feel what it's like to be rooted against. 
It's you against the world." 
</P>
<P>
 It might even be good for you, Courier suggests. But he has other goals than 
the Davis Cup for '94, he says. He would like to regain his No. 1 ranking; he 
is No. 3 behind Pete Sampras and Michael Stich. He would like to win his third 
French Open, second Italian and, perhaps, first Wimbledon this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, he would like to win his third Champions here. It's where it all 
began for him. Look at it this way: If he hadn't won here in 1991 and '93, he 
wouldn't have to play Davis Cup. No one would ask him. When your country calls, 
you load up the bicarbonate of soda and go. Tennis is a sport where you not 
only run a lot, you fly a lot.

THE HOUSE'S NOT ROCKIN'; DOG DAYS ARE REPLACING THE GLORY DAYS AT LOYOLA AS 
PROGRAM TRIES TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years after the last days of Hank Gathers -- a white-hot era of lore, 
loss and impending lawsuits -- Loyola Marymount University has all but 
disappeared from the college basketball landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it all worked out as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame came hard and fast to this sleepy Westchester campus in the late 1980s, 
but the crash was harder. 
</P>
<P>
 The demarcation began on March 4, 1990, a Sunday afternoon, when an 
intoxicating burst of success gave way to excruciating grief as the team's 
star, Gathers, lay dying of heart failure on the court at Gersten Pavilion 
during a West Coast Conference playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrow turned to anger, then to accusations, then to litigation. The tiny 
school of 3,900 students, which had never bothered anyone before, found itself 
at the epicenter of scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount just wanted to curl up under the covers and turn out the 
lights. To a great extent, it has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is talking about Loyola basketball any more. ESPN hasn't called in 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Restore the Roar? 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions finished the regular season 6-20 and a last-place 4-10 in the WCC. 
When they defeated the University of Buffalo on Jan. 7, it ended a 19-game 
losing streak dating to last season, when the team finished 7-20 under 
first-year Coach John Olive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never the intention of Brian Quinn, the school's athletic director 
since 1985, to dismantle the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wants to lose? Quinn sits in the largely empty stands at Gersten and 
remembers the salad days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible, terrible," he says, describing the feeling he had watching an early 
season home loss to Wisconsin. "I turned to the fans and said: 'Are we in 
Madison?' It seemed like they had more fans than we had. It felt like an away 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was no accident that Loyola removed itself from the NCAA fast track in 
the aftermath of Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university was in turmoil," Quinn says. "The death of Gathers had such an 
impact on the whole campus. It was so sad, so difficult. Basketball was in its 
glory. Then, suddenly, we were being criticized, and lots of things were thrown 
at us from all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount was one of 14 defendants named in a lawsuit filed by the 
Gathers family after Hank's death. The university ultimately settled for $1.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity embarrassed academicians, many of whom did not appreciate their 
school being cast in such light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the school wanted to back it up a bit, move more conservatively," 
Quinn says. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its history, Loyola had never been a basketball high-roller. The 
school has had basketball teams, mostly mediocre, since 1923. Before 1985, it 
had 10 consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Quinn, a venerable Loyola alumnus, couldn't resist the crap-shoot chance 
to woo Paul Westhead into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who once coached the Lakers to an NBA championship was out of the 
game, teaching English in town, when Loyola came knocking in 1985 with its 
comeback offer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a toss-up whether the school needed the coach more than the coach 
needed the school. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next to Loyola, that rocket-burst to the top, could not have 
been predicted. It was a harmonic convergence of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Two USC transfers, Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, fell from the proverbial sky 
and landed on campus in 1987, a gift from the fast-break gods. 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead had already installed his never-before-seen, frenzied brand of 
break-neck basketball, a system that implored players to shoot until their arms 
ached. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Westhead, Loyola had four winning seasons in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bo-Hank years -- 1987 through '90 -- the Lions won 74 games and two WCC 
titles, scoring 100 points or more in 73 of their 95 games. 
</P>
<P>
 That 1989-90 Loyola team will be remembered for advancing to the NCAA 
tournament, riding the shoulders of Gathers' best friend, Kimble, as the Lions 
made an emotional run to the Western Regional final before losing to Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, it was the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate ensued over who might have been responsible for Gathers' death. Having 
a known heart condition, should Gathers have been cleared to play? Should the 
doctor have moved him out of the gym, away from the crowd, before making 
attempts to revive him? 
</P>
<P>
 So many questions. Few answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead, also a defendant in the Gathers' family suit, ultimately left to 
become the latest unsuccessful coach of the Denver Nuggets. Westhead was 
eventually dismissed as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the fondest memories of my five years," says Westhead, now at George 
Mason in Virginia. "They were good years for me, for basketball. The only hurt 
is the loss of Hank Gathers, and that supersedes all basketball. You can't 
match that with other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the school stuck with the style that made the program famous, 
hiring an Loyola assistant, Jay Hillock, to be Westhead's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Hillock's fast-break teams managed two winning seasons, the Lions 
were eliminated in the first round of the conference tournament each time. 
Hillock's contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a scout with the Washington Bullets, Hillock looks from afar at the Loyola 
program with a sense of bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked by the outcome of what happened there," he says. "They have 
fallen off the end of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillock, a Westhead disciple, was dismayed by Quinn's choice of Olive to 
succeed him. Olive, with no previous head coaching experience, had come highly 
regarded as Rollie Massimino's longtime assistant at Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive quickly scrapped Westhead's offense in favor of a more conventional 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillock says Olive's two-year record of 13-40 speaks volumes. He says Loyola's 
only chance of becoming a basketball power again is to hire a name coach such 
as Westhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be Paul, but someone that's bigger than the university," 
Hillock says. "We created, with TV, with Paul Westhead, with 120-point 
basketball, kind of artificial reasons to come to Loyola Marymount. There is no 
draw there, there is no hook." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time Hillock has criticized the program, but Quinn 
declines to be drawn into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like Jay as a human being," Quinn says. "(The decision) was very, 
very hard. He had a two-year contract, it was not renewed. It's that simple. I 
won't discuss personnel matters. We wanted to go a different way from where we 
saw it heading." 
</P>
<P>
 It became clearer that Quinn wanted a clean break from the Westhead legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn disputes Hillock's notion that run-and-gun basketball was the only way 
to pack the stands at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the national television exposure Loyola enjoyed in the Westhead years, 
Quinn claims that Loyola was not attracting the athletes capable of running 
Westhead's frenetic style of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't lining up (to come here)," Quinn says. "Maybe we got into homes 
we didn't get into before, but they didn't come. Where were they?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Hillock departed, Quinn stood as the last athletic department holdover 
from the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead believes that what Loyola did in his five years was unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we had, it was just kind of an unusual group of guys," he says. "The 
school was kind of alive and excited. Maybe it was one of those storybook 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Olive will not discuss Loyola in the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
 He does acknowledge that as an outsider, he felt his hiring at Loyola was "the 
passing of the era, putting everything that transpired to that point behind." 
</P>
<P>
 To show how committed Quinn was to building a program from scratch, he gave 
Olive a five-year contract, unusual for first-year coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing much has gone right since.  
</P>
<P>
 No poor season unfolds without explanations. To be sure, the Lions lost their 
best player, forward Zan Mason, to a season-ending knee injury on Dec. 30 
against Texas A&M. Ross Richardson, a senior guard and one of the team's best 
three-point shooters, sat out several games because of an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 A promising freshman forward, Mike O'Quinn, was declared academically 
ineligible after the fall semester and cannot compete the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, guard Bill Mazurie, a leading reserve, will sit out Saturday night's WCC 
tournament opener against Gonzaga at Santa Clara because he was ejected for 
fighting in last Saturday's loss at St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have done nothing to "Restore the Roar," the credo in Loyola's media 
guide, but the team has been competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola has lost three overtime games. And in a Jan. 14 home game against St. 
Mary's, they blew a 16-point lead with seven minutes left and lost, 82-77. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, definitely frustrating," says Wyking Jones, the team's star 
junior forward. "In the future, we'll win those close games. No one's giving 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday night, they did win a close one, rallying from nine points down 
in the last four minutes to defeat Cal State Sacramento, 73-71, on Jones' 
tip-in at the buzzer. There's only one catch: Cal State Sacramento had won only 
once this season, and none on the road in three years as a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was supposed to have been a rare breather for the Lions, who, some 
suggest, need to downgrade a nonconference schedule structured as if Loyola was 
still a top-25 program. This season, the Lions were thumped by UCLA, Wisconsin 
and UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I think we overscheduled," Olive acknowledged. "We probably 
should have played some easier teams early to get a couple of wins under our 
belt." 
</P>
<P>
 But Loyola is close to completing a deal to play Notre Dame at home next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 An obvious problem with the program is that Loyola has the wrong players for 
Olive's system. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of them, including Jones and forwards Rahim Harris, Robin Kirksey and 
Mason, were recruited by Hillock to run the Westhead fast-break system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids don't want to play slow," Hillock says. "They're skinny 
runner-jumpers, and when you get into a half-court game, you don't have to be 
Albert Einstein to see those kids can't play half-court basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn doesn't argue the point, but says that's even more of a reason that 
Olive must be given time to develop the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's got to get his own players," Quinn says. "It's going to take three or 
four years. He's got to see his freshmen through to their senior years before 
you can judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, averaging 19.9 points and 8.1 rebounds, was the player most affected by 
the coaching change.  
</P>
<P>
 Having played at nearby St. Bernard's High, he was a former Loyola ballboy in 
the Westhead years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones is not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an adjustment," he says. "But I don't see it as being too much of a 
setback. Coach Olive came in and stressed defense, and I don't see that as a 
setback. I wanted to learn more about that part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the glory of Hank and Bo? 
</P>
<P>
 "I say that 'Yeah, they went to the Final Eight,' but they had great players, 
not just a system." Jones explains. "Those guys, in any system, were going to 
win games." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the mounting losses, Jones says there is no dissension in the ranks. 
Rather than drifting apart, he says adversity has brought the team closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Players still go to Olive's house for barbecues and picnics. Jones has no 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 But losing is lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you like to win," says Mel Hebert, a 1957 Loyola graduate and 
president of the school's "Tip-in" booster club. "I think the main concern is 
how are the kids reacting, and the coaching staff reacting. Frankly, I've been 
very impressed by both. I think we're rebuilding. This is a phase we have to go 
through. This is where you find out where your loyal fans are." 
</P>
<P>
 Few remnants remain from past glories. The nucleus of the glory teams -- 
Kimble, Jeff Fryer, Per Stumer -- are playing professionally overseas. Terrell 
Lowery is pursuing a baseball career with the Texas Rangers. Tom Peabody did 
stick around, to attend law school at Loyola.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no Kimbles on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillock says Loyola had better get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're down for the count," he says. "I just don't see anything ever 
bringing it back to above .500 in (conference play)." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, out of the blue, a young man wearing an Loyola baseball cap walked 
into Westhead's office at George Mason and thanked him for the glory years. 
Westhead says the man was an Loyola student in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that was the best it was ever going to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn is hedging his bet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have signed two promising recruits in the early signing period, 
6-foot-7 forward Ben Ammerman from Sacramento, and Calvin Patterson, a 6-2 
guard from Fremont High. 
</P>
<P>
 If Loyola has made a retreat, Quinn says, it's only to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to win the league, we want to go to the playoffs, we want to compete 
in the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he implies, don't expect miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will come if we win," Quinn says. "They didn't come before, they came 
when we won, and they're not coming now. This is L.A. They didn't come to UCLA 
two years ago. It's tough out here."

DIAZO HURT, WILL SKIP SANTA ANITA HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diazo, winner of the Strub Stakes and one of the favorites for Saturday's 
Santa Anita Handicap, suffered a broken bone in his lower left foreleg during a 
workout Sunday and has been withdrawn from the $1-million race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing was bad on this," trainer Bill Shoemaker said Monday. "But they 
tell me that it's not a real bad fracture and there's a 75% to 85% chance that 
he'll be able to run again." 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo is an unwilling workout horse, so not much was made of his slow time of 
1:44 2/5 for a mile Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he worked good," Shoemaker said. "Laffit (Pincay) said that he 
didn't feel anything until he was pulling him up. Then (Diazo) sort of 
flinched." 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays showed a lateral fracture in the cannon bone, which runs between the 
ankle and the knee. Veterinarian Greg Ferraro inserted a screw Monday to fuse 
the break. The estimated recovery time is six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo's victory in the $500,000 Strub on Feb. 6, his sixth in 13 starts and 
second of the winter at Santa Anita, gave Shoemaker his biggest training 
victory. Starting in 1954 with Rejected and going through Lord At War in 1985, 
Shoemaker won the Santa Anita Handicap a record 11 times. Diazo would have been 
his first starter in the 1 1/4-mile race as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different when you're training," Shoemaker said. "When you were riding 
and your horse got hurt, you'd start looking around for another horse. Can't do 
that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Also out of the Big 'Cap is Slew Of Damascus, whose training has been 
compromised by a foot injury suffered when he broke through the starting gate 
before the San Antonio Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudy McCaffery, co-owner of Bien Bien with John Toffan, said Monday no 
decision has been made about their 5-year-old, who is the highweight for 
Saturday's race. The owners and trainer Paco Gonzalez think Bien Bien's 
120-pound assignment is about three pounds too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does this say about our handicap horses?" McCaffery said. "If our horse, 
who's only won one race in his life on dirt, gets 120 pounds, what does it say 
about the rest of them? 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Paulson, who owns Diazo, still has two probables for the Big 'Cap in 
Stuka, who is trained by Gary Jones, and Corby, who is trained by John Sadler. 
Stuka ran third in the San Fernando Stakes on Jan. 16, finishing 2 1/2 lengths 
behind his stablemate.

NEWSWIRE: UCLA'S WILLIAMS OUT FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natalie Williams' college career ended when the two-sport UCLA star learned 
Monday she has a serious knee injury requiring surgical repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, an All-American in basketball and volleyball, suffered a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament when she injured her right knee during a 
UCLA-Stanford basketball game Saturday at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a senior forward from Taylorsville, Utah, is the Pacific 10 
Conference's leading scorer (23.4) and rebounder (13.1). She also is the 
Pac-10's all-time rebound leader with 1,137. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA team orthopedist Gerald Finerman indicated he was optimistic she could 
return to sports after a post-surgery rehabilitation program. EARL GUSTKEY

 UCLA has hired Norm Andersen to succeed Rick Neuheisel as receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen played for Bruin coaches Pepper Rodgers and Dick Vermeil in 1973-75, 
catching 61 passes for 1,051 yards and six touchdowns during three seasons when 
the Bruins were primarily a running team.He played in the 1976 Rose Bowl game, 
catching a 14-yard pass from John Sciarra early in the third quarter to help 
open up a UCLA offense that had been shut out in the first half of a 23-10 
victory over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen was a volunteer assistant with Coach Terry Donahue's first UCLA team 
in 1976, then a full-time assistant for eight seasons before moving to Iowa 
State for two seasons. He had coached at Arizona the past two seasons before 
returning to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The third assistant hired since the end of the season, Andersen joins 
newcomers Bob Toledo and Gary Bernardi on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel resigned to coach quarterbacks and receivers at Colorado, joining 
offensive coordinator Homer Smith and line coach Bob Palcic as former Bruin 
assistants in new jobs. JIM HODGES

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LINE DRIVE SCARE FOR GUETTERMAN

 Reliever Lee Guetterman saw his career flash before his eyes when catcher Mark 
Dalesandro hit a sharp liner off Guetterman's left biceps. He immediately left 
the field, but the injury was diagnosed as only a deep bruise. He is expected 
to return Wednesday. "I never saw it coming," Guetterman said, "but I sure felt 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston, who is expected to be the Angels' opening-day starter for the 
third consecutive season, will also open their Cactus League season Friday 
against the Colorado Rockies. Chuck Finley, Phil Leftwich and John Dopson will 
follow in the four-man rotation, each scheduled to pitch two innings in their 
initial starts.

 The sound came from behind the batting cages Monday, startling players and 
coaches at the Angel complex in Tempe, Ariz. It was a man singing -- during 
their spring workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Players looked around to see the trespasser who had sneaked onto the field, 
but the voice turned out to belong to outfielder Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, as the Angels quickly realized, has quite a voice. And soon, the rest 
of the world may find out. Smith has just completed his first album, 'R U 
Down,' due out in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the great equalizer for me this winter," Smith said. "I had my 
music, so I didn't have time to focus on all the bad things with my contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's singing career was inspired by his former teammates on the Chicago 
Cubs. They were the ones who would turn off the stereo in the clubhouse and 
coerce Smith to serenade them. He even sang the national anthem three times at 
Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why it was so painful, Smith said, when the Cubs refused to tender him 
a contract this winter, severing their 10-year relationship. Although Smith, 
30, batted .300 and became their all-time leader with 50 pinch hits, the Cubs 
wanted to avoid arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to prove there was no resentment or lingering bitterness, Smith climbed 
into his sports car after practice Sunday and visited the Cubs at their hotel. 
He laughed and joked with his former teammates, teased his former coaches and 
even visited management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people were saying that Dwight should be bitter," Smith said. "But I 
came back with a smile. I wanted to show them that I was man enough to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I still love that organization and I hope they win the pennant. I told 
them, 'Now, if you need someone to help you down the stretch, don't be afraid 
to come get me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be there the day they finally win it all because when it happens, 
that whole city's going to erupt. No one deserves a championship more than 
those fans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels provided a new contract proposal Monday to right fielder Tim Salmon 
that would make him the highest-paid second-year player in baseball history. 
Salmon is expected to accept a four-year offer by Thursday that will guarantee 
him at least $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best drama of the day unfolded on the main practice field when reliever 
Troy Percival pitched to a hitter for the first time since undergoing elbow 
surgery last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who was at the plate? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe it?" Percival said. "The first live hitter I see in eight 
months, and I've got to face Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can think of is, 'Please, God, don't let me hit Bo. I don't care what 
happens, but don't let me hit Bo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Percival didn't hit Jackson, but his first pitch sailed just under Bo's chin, 
dusting Jackson off the plate. That was all Jackson needed to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw the next six pitches for strikes," Percival said, "and he watched all 
of them. He never swung again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson: "Once he threw that first pitch, that was enough for me. Believe 
me, I want no part of that guy." BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; COURSE OF ACTION LEADS TO DEGREE

 When Eric Karros was signed in 1988, he left UCLA nine classes shy of earning 
a bachelor's degree in economics. But even as the seasons went by and Karros 
began making a lot of money, he never stopped trying to earn a degree. This 
winter, he finally completed the required classes, and it happened to coincide 
with a new contract from the Dodgers, $6.15 million for three years. Last 
season he earned $435,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I graduated from UCLA and got the biggest raise of my life," Karros said 
Monday at Vero Beach, Fla. "Really, I got the raise from graduating from 
Lasorda University. But I wanted to finish school, it was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, 26, returned to UCLA after his 1989 minor league season and took four 
classes, then went back after the 1992 season to finish -- but it didn't work 
out. As the National League's rookie of the year, Karros traveled to Japan, and 
only two of his instructors were willing to let him miss two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understand how they felt, so this winter I went back to finish," Karros 
said. "Then, when the Dodgers went to Taiwan after the season, I went to my 
instructors and just told them that I was going out of the country and would 
miss four classes, and they all said that was OK," Karros said. "Last winter, I 
told them I was a baseball player, and I think in certain instances it can work 
against you, not help you. You can be singled out because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about a master's degree? 
</P>
<P>
 "Any more degrees are going to come from right here, Lasorda University," 
Karros said.

 Park Chan Ho of South Korea was formally initiated by his teammates while 
doing a television interview for Channel 5. Kevin Gross greeted him with a 
whipped-cream pie in the face. Park said later that the prank made him feel 
accepted. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder, who struck out 147 times in 143 games last season, is changing 
his swing to the way it was when he played for the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave (hitting instructor) Reggie Smith some tapes and he is helping me get 
back to my swing," Snyder said. The swing requires that Snyder throw his hips 
out more, and that has caused a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Fred Claire was in the clubhouse early talking with 
Mike Milchin, one of four left-handed pitchers who have been invited to camp. 
Milchin, who turned 26 Monday, impressed the Dodgers on Friday when he threw. 
He suffered pain in his elbow afterward, however, and his condition is regarded 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire's message to Milchin: Don't throw again before you're ready. Of the 
free-lance left-handers, Milchin appeared to create the most interest. MARYANN

LOS ANGELES MARATHON / DAILY REPORT; AFTERSHOCKS COULD SPUR RUNNERS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In virtually every other major sporting event, the rumbling of the earth 
beneath the competitors' feet would be cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Los Angeles, only now, would it be cause for an award. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks after the Jan. 17 earthquake, organizers of Sunday's Los Angeles 
Marathon will honor the first male and female to finish after an aftershock 
registering 3.0 or more on the Richter Scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The honor is called -- what else? -- "the Rock 'n Roll Award." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will receive free airline tickets to Memphis, Tenn., where Elvis 
Presley died. 
</P>
<P>
 "This award says that this is L.A., this is Hollywood, and we can survive 
anything," said Bill Burke, marathon president. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth annual marathon, which will begin at 8:40 a.m. in front of the 
Coliseum, has gained importance since the temblor, organizers claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people across the world think Los Angeles is still in rubble," Burke 
said. "This is a chance to show everybody that we're still standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke was in Mexico on the morning of the earthquake. He returned home that 
afternoon, as previously scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made an unscheduled drive around the 26.2-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to see for myself if anything was still left," he said. "I was 
surprised. Somehow, the earthquake missed our course. I don't know how that 
happened, but it did." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner did he return home than he announced that the race would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an announcement that was repeated hundreds of times to worried callers 
during the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon officials say runners have responded with more than 16,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to receive the maximum number of entries, 19,000, by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the response we received from around town let me know how important our 
race is," Burke said. "It was like people needed to see that we were still 
open. Like they wanted to know that not everything in their world had been 
turned upside down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, foreign runners will be favored to win both the men's and women's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Garcia of Mexico, winner of the New York City Marathon in 1991, and 
Ahmed Salah of Djibouti, who has run the second-fastest marathon in history, 
are expected to lead the men's field. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Santana of Brazil, who finished second here last year and fourth here in 
1992, also is expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Eyestone of Utah, a longtime standout competing in his first Los Angeles 
Marathon, is the top American male contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Appell of Mexico, who finished second in the New York City Marathon last 
year, leads the women's field. She is hoping to become an American citizen by 
race day. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once in the previous eight years has an American man won the marathon. 
Ric Sayre won the first one in 1986. South Africa's Mark Plaatjes won in 1991, 
two years before he became a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 American women have won four of the eight races. Nancy Ditz won in 1986 and 
1987, Julie Isphording in 1990 and Cathy O'Brien in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 19 fastest times by a man in marathon history, Americans have only 
three. American women have four of the 20 fastest times in their division. BILL

RAMS BRING MITCHELL TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' courtship of Miami free-agent quarterback Scott Mitchell officially 
began Monday night at a dinner with team officials in Los Angeles and continues 
today with a tour of Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have reviewed videotape of Mitchell at work, have talked to people 
who knew him in college and have rated him No. 1 among free-agent quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has been advised that it probably will take as much as $3.5-million a 
year to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 26, already has visited with Detroit and Minnesota, and will travel 
to New Orleans Wednesday. A trip to Washington has been canceled. Minnesota, 
according to most NFL observers, is considered the leading candidate to get 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also have made a pitch for Houston quarterback Warren Moon, but the 
Oilers appear unwilling to deal at this time. The Rams, who are in a hurry to 
resolve their quarterback problems, are concerned that the Oilers' asking price 
for Moon will be too steep. The Rams have let it be known that they will not 
mortgage their future in the form of multiple top draft picks to acquire a 
37-year-old quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's arrival, meanwhile, kicks off a busy week for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is expected to announce the hiring of Washington special teams coach 
Wayne Sevier Wednesday, and if all goes according to Ram plans, Sevier will 
soon be working with Phoenix punt and kickoff returner Johnny Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who played in last year's Pro Bowl as the NFC's top special teams 
performer, met with Ram officials Monday before undergoing a physical 
examination. If Bailey and the Rams come to terms, he will also earn duty as 
the team's running mate for Jerome Bettis in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will meet with Dallas defensive lineman Jimmie Jones, Atlanta 
quarterback Chris Miller and New York Giant offensive tackle Doug Riesenberg 
later this week, and Detroit wide receiver Brett Perriman next week.

NORDIC SAGA ENDS; KERRIGAN AND HARDING HEAD HOME; BAIUL TO CONNECTICUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan returned to the United States Sunday for a ticker tape parade 
at Disney World. Tonya Harding returns today to an uncertain future, which is 
the story of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her disappointing eighth place, Harding seemed liberated after 
finishing the Winter Olympic women's figure skating competition Friday night. 
She went bowling immediately afterward, skied Saturday and dined at a table 
next to reporters in a downtown restaurant the next night without being asked a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 That brief respite is likely to end, however, when she arrives home in 
Portland, Ore., where law enforcement authorities continue to investigate 
whether she played a role in the Jan. 6 assault on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. has scheduled a disciplinary hearing to 
begin on March 10 in Colorado Springs, Colo., to determine whether Harding can 
remain a member of the association. A USFSA hearing panel concluded last month 
that there were "reasonable grounds" to believe that she was involved with her 
former husband and her bodyguard in the plot against Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding, 23, loses her eligibility, she would be replaced in the World 
Championships March 22-27 at Chiba, Japan, by first alternate Michelle Kwan, 
13, of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, 24, might also skip the World Championships, although for decidedly 
different reasons. She has so many commitments, including the role as host of 
next week's "Saturday Night Live," that she might not have time to train. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials said last week that they believe Kerrigan 
will retire from competition. She does not need to compete to enhance her 
commercial value, which has been estimated at between $10 million and $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Olympics, she had deals with Campbell's Soup, Reebok, Xerox, 
Seiko, Evian, Chrysler, Northwest Airlines and Cosmopolitan magazine. Since, 
she has signed with Revlon and Disney, the latter agreeing to pay her a 
reported $2 million for theme park appearances, a made-for-television movie, a 
TV special and perhaps even a Nancy doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on April 10, Kerrigan will headline a 67-city tour that includes 
other medalists from the Olympics and World Championships and, according to her 
agent, Jerry Solomon of ProServ, she is negotiating for her own tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never has to compete again," said Michael Rosenberg, an agent from Palm 
Desert who represents numerous figure skaters. "She's already Peggy Fleming, 
Dorothy Hamill and Snow White rolled into one. Of course, she's also the silver 
medalist." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: There will be money left over for his client, gold medalist 
Oksana Baiul of the Ukraine. Rosenberg said he believes she will have more 
impact on the U.S. market after she relocates. Monday night, Hartford's city 
council approved construction of a $5-million world-class skating center, where 
Baiul will train. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul, who had also considered Lake Arrowhead, will be joined by her coach 
Galina Zmievskaya, and 1992 Olympic gold medalist Viktor Petrenko. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fantastic," Hartford Mayor Michael Peters said. "It will put us on the 
map again -- not just as the insurance capital and home of the Hartford 
Whalers, but home of some of the world's best skaters."

PREP SOFTBALL '94; POWER, DEFENSE PROVIDE A STRONG MIX FOR LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 You may have seen them at the Woodbridge tournament early in the season and 
thought, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 You might have watched them during league and thought, "Not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't look like champions. Not Southern Section champions. OK, they can 
win the Pacific Coast League. Big deal. But the Southern Section? 
</P>
<P>
 Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was because they didn't have the big, strong, overpowering pitcher 
like so many dominant teams -- Los Alamitos had Carrie Dolan and La Habra had 
Danielle Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills, 24-5 last year, was short on finesse and long on tape-measure 
shots. They didn't so much defeat teams as drill them: 23-2, 19-0, 16-2, 28-0, 
19-0. 
</P>
<P>
 If they could play defense, they could win. 
</P>
<P>
 They played defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the season ended, unseeded Laguna Hills had beaten powerful Irvine in 
the Division III championship game, 5-4, a veritable slugfest for a softball 
title game. One thing the Hawks could do was put the bat on the ball, put 
pressure on the other team to make the play. When they did, Irvine couldn't 
field it. The Vaqueros committed seven errors that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills is committed to doing it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking -- if we could work this hard again, we could be back in the 
same spot," said Alycia Stevens, who scored two runs that night. "That was the 
commitment we made: to work just as hard and to go as just as far as we went 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks have seven starters back. They have three four-year starters -- left 
fielder Stevens, third baseman Jennifer Arzola and center fielder Christy 
Journell -- and three three-year starters -- shortstop Misty Thompson, and 
pitchers Windy Scofield and Therese Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost only their second, fourth and eighth hitters in the lineup, making 
it easy to project 1994's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might be a cliche, but whenever we needed something done last year, 
someone did it," Coach Cary Crouch said. "It was different people at different 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say Laguna Hills won't feel the loss of Jennifer Milo (.464, 
24 runs batted in), a first baseman at San Diego, or Lesley Haynes (.327, 23 
runs), a catcher at UC Santa Barbara. Each had nearly flawless seasons, and 
championships are not won without some luck. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not like they needed every run last year. Stevens (.474, 38 runs, 17 
stolen bases), Thompson (.346, 35 RBIs, four home runs) and Journell (.333, 18 
RBIs) have proven themselves clutch players. Arzola (.348) and second baseman 
Amber Journell (.284) know how to hit. And sophomore designated hitter Sumer 
McMahon (.131) could easily contribute more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's team batted .329. The seven returners averaged .331 combined. 
Throw out McMahon's figures, and the top six batted .357. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks averaged 6.5 runs last year. Throw out the five blowouts and they 
still averaged 3.5. In their five playoff games, they averaged 4.0 runs. They 
know how to score. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key is their pitching -- it seems so average until you try to outscore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Scofield (16-3, 0.48) is the staff ace you would swear is related to Randy 
Jones or Tommy John. She averaged fewer than three strikeouts per game, but at 
Laguna Hills, that's not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think Windy serves up a ball you can hit and that we can field," 
Crouch said. "It allows us to be a better team when (opponents) hit the ball 
because everyone stays involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one, player-for-player, who does their individual jobs better than 
we do. Nine players deep, we can play with anyone. We're not going to go out 
there and allow a pitcher to cover a flaw that the team has. If there's a flaw 
out there, someone will find it because the ball is going to be hit every 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 But an advantage Scofield has over many pitchers is that Laguna Hills doesn't 
beat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Crouch) doesn't put up with stupid mistakes at all," said Stevens, the 
leadoff hitter and one of three seniors. "If we make a mistake at this point -- 
the seniors -- it has to be a physical mistake and not a mental mistake. We've 
become a very focused team."

MORTGAGE LENDERS GETTING CREATIVE AS RATES EDGE UPWARD; REAL ESTATE: NEW 
PROGRAMS LURE BORROWERS WITH SMALL DOWN PAYMENTS, FEE DISCOUNTS AND OTHER 
ENTICEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With interest rates moving higher and the refinancing boom subsiding, many 
home lenders in Southern California are launching new mortgage programs that 
they hope will drum up business and lure customers in time for the spring 
home-buying season. 
</P>
<P>
 The new programs offer everything from small down payments to discounts on 
loan fees and are aimed at home buyers rather those who simply want to 
refinance existing mortgages. Some are also designed to aid homeowners hurt by 
falling property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates on fixed, 30-year mortgages have jumped to 7.44% from 7.25% a week ago 
and are now more than half a point above the 25-year low reached last fall, 
according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refinancing wave seems to be over, so lenders are getting more aggressive 
and offering more deals to keep business coming in," said Earl Peattie, 
president of Mortgage News Co., a Santa Ana-based research firm that tracks 
lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new loans come with strings attached, analysts say they are also 
bringing relief to cash-strapped buyers who have been hurt by rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale-based Home Savings of America fired the latest salvo in the home 
loan wars Friday when it said it would begin a new program offering borrowers 
down payments as low as 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some other lenders offer similar programs, Home Savings added two new 
wrinkles: The down payment can be a gift from the borrower's parents or other 
immediate family members, and up to $300,000 can be borrowed under the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other low-down-payment plans require borrowers to put at least a few 
thousand dollars of their own money into the transaction. They also normally 
limit the loan amount to about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings spokeswoman Samantha Davies said the new plan should attract 
first-time buyers who have a good income but need their parents' help to come 
up with the down payment. Since the thrift will loan up to $300,000, it can 
even be used in high-priced communities such as West Los Angeles, Davies noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The program may also appeal to current homeowners who would like to buy a more 
expensive house but cannot because the long decline in property values has 
wiped out much or all of their equity. 
</P>
<P>
 With their equity eroded, the money they would get from selling their home 
would have to be used mainly to pay off the existing loan -- leaving them 
without enough cash to buy a new house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other low-down-payment loans out there, but they've got so many 
restrictions that they eliminate an awful lot of buyers," Davies said. "We're 
going after the good, credit-worthy buyers who just need help in raising a down 
payment." 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings made its announcement a few days after Calabasas-based ARCS 
Mortgage said it would begin offering what amounts to no-money-down financing 
for the 850,000 members of the California Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, CalPERS members can borrow their down payment from the 
pension fund, then get a loan from ARCS to cover the rest of the purchase 
price. "It's another way to get around the down payment hurdle," said Howard 
Levine, the mortgage bank's president. 
</P>
<P>
 With rates rising, Pasadena-based Countrywide Funding Corp. has been heavily 
promoting its "Lock 'N Shop" program that allows home buyers to lock in their 
interest rates before they even decide on homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate is guaranteed for 30 days: If rates go down while the borrower is 
still house hunting, he gets the lower rate. "Your rate can go down, but it 
can't go up," said Greg Lumsden, Countrywide's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all three programs have their drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings will make only adjustable-rate mortgages under its new program, 
while ARCS' new program is open only to CalPERS members. Countrywide's 30-day 
rate lock puts pressure on shoppers who might like more time to choose a new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 While other lenders are also offering various enticements, some are not 
advertising them to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Layana, a mortgage broker and president of N.J. Layana Mortgage in 
Fullerton, said two of the lenders he represents recently notified him that 
they are willing to trim hundreds of dollars off the fees usually charged to 
borrowers to generate new business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lenders are not advertising the discount, Layana said. Instead, they 
are giving brokers a choice of keeping the money to fatten their profits or 
passing the discount on to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm passing the savings on to my borrowers, but I'm not sure everyone else 
is," Layana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Layana said buyers should keep the disclosure statement they receive when they 
first apply for a loan and then compare it to the paperwork they get when the 
loan is actually funded. "If the closing papers show that the broker got paid 
more than the disclosure statement said he would," Layana said, "ask him to 
give the excess back to you." Rising Rates 
</P>
<P>
 Following a long period of decline, rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages 
have begun to climb.

FOR MINORITY LAWYERS, IT'S WHO YOU KNOW, BAR SURVEY SUGGESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minorities remain rare in partnership ranks at major U.S. law firms, largely 
because they have few contacts in white-dominated corporate suites -- where the 
decisions about hiring lawyers are made, according to an American Bar Assn. 
survey to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
 Such lack of contacts gives the biggest law firms little incentive to 
diversify their partnership ranks and tends to discourage minorities from 
joining these firms, the survey organizers suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, believed to be the first ever conducted of minority law 
partners, nearly half the respondents said lack of contacts and business 
networks outside their firms was the biggest impediment to building their 
practices. Nearly a quarter cited lack of such contacts within their firm as 
the major hurdle, and one-fifth said that "negative perceptions about minority 
lawyers" was the major impediment to their ability to generate new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Without business contacts on the outside and the mentoring and support network 
needed on the inside, minority lawyers fail to generate the numbers of clients 
and cases that are a key requirement of partnership and successive executive 
ranks within law firms, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 3% of partnerships at the country's large corporate law firms are held by 
minorities, according to Bar Assn. figures. And while 60% of those responding 
to the survey said they generate as much or more legal business as other 
partners at their level, many say they do so without the help of the "old boys' 
network" that continues to dominate partnerships at law firms and management 
ranks in Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty widely felt that minority partners do not have the same access to 
corporate decision makers that their white male counterparts have," said Karen 
Randall of the Los Angeles firm Katten, Muchin, Zavis & Weitzman. Last year, 
Randall was named co-managing partner of the firm, the first African American 
woman to reach such a position at a major U.S. law firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cycle," Randall said. "If minority partners are not able to generate 
the business to justify the position they've achieved in law firms, it has an 
impact on (that firm) recruiting other minorities and then on the number of 
minorities attending law school." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted in October by the ABA's Conference of Minority 
Partners in Majority/Corporate Law Firms. The 102 minority lawyers responding 
represent one-sixth of all African American, Latino, Asian American and Native 
American partners at major law firms. More than half said they were the first 
minority partners at their firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Holifield, head of the minority partners conference, said that because 
of "the absence of overall expressed interest in using minority law partners by 
corporations and their legal departments, there remains little incentive for 
the larger law firms to diversify their partner ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield said the ABA will ask major U.S. companies to "review and improve 
their procedures for involving minority law partners." 
</P>
<P>
 While 83% of the survey respondents said they receive support from other 
partners at their firm, they also said just 30% of their client referrals are 
gained through that source. 
</P>
<P>
 Many white male lawyers develop the business contacts needed to generate 
billings at "country clubs and other more traditional connections that have not 
been accessible to minority partners as a group," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, partners "pick people who look like them to hand down their clients to, 
or to groom," she said. Minority men, more than women, are the victims of this 
tendency because women lawyers often mentor other women lawyers regardless of 
ethnicity or race, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said these factors discourage minorities from joining large law firms. 
Katten, Muchin has 300 lawyers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Camara, a partner at Cox, Castle & Nicholson in Los Angeles, said his 
"comfort level," and not race or ethnicity, attracted him to that firm 21 years 
ago. A Latino graduate of the UCLA School of Law, Camara has been a partner at 
the 84-lawyer firm for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said large law firms seemed colder and he felt more insecure at them.

LOOKING OUT FOR THOSE AUDIT 'TRIGGERS'; TAXES: CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS -- CASUALTY 
LOSSES, SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND HOME OFFICE ARE SOME -- CAN OFTEN LEAD TO IRS 
SCRUTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service has vastly expanded its computer matching 
program, which may cause thousands of additional taxpayers to trigger so-called 
"computer audits" on their 1993 returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's tax police have also boosted scrutiny of those who claim certain 
types of income and deductions. These so-called "audit triggers" boil down to a 
handful of expenses, deductions and credits that the IRS believes are 
frequently exaggerated or fabricated. This year, the audit triggers include 
self-employment income and claims for the earned income tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants stress that taxpayers should never forego a legitimate deduction 
for fear it will cause them to be audited. But, they should be ready to provide 
clear substantiation of these highly scrutinized items. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some people may want to attach extra documentation to their returns -- 
information that would be required only in an audit -- as a preemptive effort, 
says Philip J. Holthouse, a partner at Holthouse, Carlin & Van Trigt in West 
Los Angeles. An IRS agent may look at the additional paperwork and decide it's 
enough to substantiate the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 What items are likely to single out a return for a closer look by the IRS? 
</P>
<P>
 * Self-employment income. There isn't much you can do about it, but if you 
work for yourself, you are far more likely to be audited than somebody who 
works for someone else. That's partly because the IRS believes that many people 
who call themselves "independent contractors" or "self-employed" are mislabeled 
employees who aren't due deductions for business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 You need receipts of deductible business expenses, contemporary records of 
entertainment and travel costs, records of taxes paid, income earned and where 
your income came from. You may also want to keep work contracts and records of 
people you've contacted in an effort to get work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casualty loss deductions. These normally rare deductions are likely to be 
fairly commonplace on 1993 returns, thanks to the devastating floods in the 
Midwest and the fires in Southern California. More recent losses, such as 
January quake damage can be deducted on 1994 or 1993 returns. If you have a 
casualty loss, be sure to keep good records, including a copy of your insurance 
adjuster's report on the value of the items you lost. Keep appraisers' reports 
detailing any disaster-related decline in the market value of your home, if 
you're claiming that decline as a casualty loss. And compile documentation that 
shows the cost of what you lost. (For tax purposes, you can deduct the lesser 
of the decrease in market value or the cost of the items you lost.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is a prime example of where you could benefit from including extra 
documentation, Holthouse notes. If you have a casualty loss, consider attaching 
a copy of the appraisal report and the statement of what is uninsured. An IRS 
agent may look at those documents and decide there's no need to call you in for 
further information. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home office deductions. If you write off a portion of your mortgage and 
utility costs because you work from home, you are very likely to be audited. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, accountants say your chance of being audited when claiming a home 
office deduction is so high -- and home office deductions are usually so small 
-- that most people should think twice before making the claim. You could spend 
more defending yourself than you'd save by taking the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do decide to take the deduction, make sure you keep records of meetings 
held at your home, hours worked and the types of activities done there. For the 
deduction to be acceptable to the IRS, your "most important" jobs must be done 
in the home office; the room you use as an office cannot be used for any other 
purpose -- in other words, it can't double as your den -- and you generally 
must meet clients there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earned income credit. This year, for the first time, the IRS is running all 
returns that claim this lucrative credit for low-income families through a 
computerized program that will check the names, Social Security numbers and 
ages listed on the EIC form to information on file with other federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
 That's likely to kick millions of returns out of the system even before 
they're completely processed, IRS officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal bad debt deductions. If you loaned money to a friend or family 
member who cannot repay the money, you can claim a bad debt deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 But beware. You'll need a signed note showing that this was a loan -- not a 
gift -- and you will need to show that you made an effort to collect the money. 
Otherwise the IRS will disallow the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barter income. Let's say that an orthodontist, who wants to have his kitchen 
remodeled, hooks up with a contractor, who has a child in need of braces. 
</P>
<P>
 The orthodontist and contractor strike a deal in which the orthodontist 
provides the braces. The contractor does the kitchen in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 No money changes hands, but they've both got barter income. If one of them 
reports the barter income on a tax return and the other doesn't, both could be 
audited.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: GOING FOR THE GOLD; ADVERTISERS RACE TO SIGN 
OLYMPIC MEDALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Don't look at it as the end of the Olympic Games. Think of it as the beginning 
of an even more high-stakes competition: the Endorsement Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top American medal winners from the Winter Olympics -- most notably 
Nancy Kerrigan and Dan Jansen -- are already well into the process of what few 
before them have accomplished to any great extent: cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Revlon announced a multiyear endorsement contract with Kerrigan, 
estimated to be worth nearly $2 million. Late last week, Jansen and skater 
Bonnie Blair were both snatched by AT&T to tout its long-distance service in 
television spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a gold medal dangling from her neck, sports marketers say, silver 
medalist Kerrigan -- who already has Disney, Reebok and Campbell Soup under her 
belt -- may soon line up annual endorsements exceeding $10 million. Speedskater 
Jansen is expected to rack up about $3 million in sponsorship fees. Blair, who 
has gathered more Olympic medals than any American woman in history, could 
amass $2 million in product endorsements. And even Tommy Moe, a little-known 
skier who sped off with two medals, could pocket $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in uncharted territory," said Arthur Kaminsky, president of the New 
York-based sports marketing firm Athletes & Artists. "From a marketing 
standpoint, no Olympics has ever had ratings or consumer interest like this." 
</P>
<P>
 But two little-known American gold medal winners are not generally viewed by 
sports marketers as likely product endorsement candidates: Cathy Turner, who 
won gold for her short-track skating but was disqualified by officials from a 
second short-track event, and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, who won the women's 
super giant slalom but who sports marketers say lacks the charisma for most 
major corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding, perhaps the most closely watched athlete of the Olympics -- who 
finished eighth in the women's figure skating competition -- has already cashed 
in by selling exclusive interviews to tabloid TV shows. She is not, however, 
expected to land big endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for lack of trying. Harding's representatives recently contacted No 
Excuses jeans, a company that built its image by using provocative women in its 
ads, including Donna Rice and Marla Maples. "At this point, we have no plans to 
use her," said Dari Marder, vice president of marketing at No Excuses. "We want 
somebody a little more universally liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite paying Harding $25,000 to help with her Olympic-related finances, Nike 
officials said Monday that she will have no endorsement career with the 
company. "It's not in the cards," Nike spokesman Keith Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 So unusual was this Winter Olympics that for the first time ever, an American 
athlete who didn't win a gold medal -- Kerrigan -- is still expected to race 
off with what could be the all-time endorsement gold. This despite the fact 
that Kerrigan may have taken some luster off her own shining image by skipping 
the Olympic closing ceremonies Sunday for a commercial venture to Disney World 
and then publicly complaining that she should have won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy Kerrigan will be the only American in Olympic history to cash in on the 
silver medal," said Andrew Woolf, chairman of the Beverly Hills-based sports 
marketing firm World Class Sports. "In her case, silver is virtually as good as 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Revlon, which inked its contract with Kerrigan shortly after her 
silver medal routine Friday night. "If she had been shut out from the medals, 
we would have still signed her," a Revlon spokesman on Monday said. Revlon will 
air its first Kerrigan TV spot during the Academy Awards on March 21. The ads 
are scheduled to be filmed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kerrigan, endorsements clearly took precedence over the Olympic closing 
ceremonies. She skipped the event Sunday, instead flying with her family to 
Orlando, where she joined Mickey Mouse to lead a parade down Main Street. A 
Disney TV spot featuring her -- filmed before the Olympics -- began airing 
Saturday, the night after Kerrigan won the silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney announced its contract with Kerrigan after the Winter Games began. 
Among other things, the deal -- estimated at nearly $2 million -- includes a 
made-for-TV film about her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sky is the limit for Nancy Kerrigan," Kaminsky said. "I don't know of a 
single athlete who has ever received so much positive publicity in such a short 
time -- for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the top athletes began lobbying marketers months before the Games 
began. Jansen's marketing team, for example, sent brochures with background 
information on the speed skater to all the Olympic sponsors and to dozens of 
potential sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We primed the pump that he'd be skating for the gold," said Frank Vuono, 
president of Integrated Sports International, which represents Jansen.  
</P>
<P>
 A letter boasting of Jansen's victory was prepared "and kept in the ready" 
before both the 500-meter and 1,000-meter speed skating events, Vuono said. 
After Jansen won the gold medal in the 1,000-meter race, the marketing firm 
sent the letters to the companies by fax. 
</P>

 AT&T responded quickly. An ad featuring Jansen and Blair making long-distance 
calls back home is scheduled to air during tonight's Grammy Awards telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jansen is also being besieged for the motivational speakers circuit, where 
executives say he will pull in up to $15,000 per speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance giant John Hancock has never asked Jansen to speak to its 
executives. But since Jansen won the gold medal, it has already booked him for 
two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to go for people who have been medalists," said Ralph Brunner, 
spokesman at John Hancock Financial Services. "It happens to be the vehicle 
that makes people more widely recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Reede, who books speeches for athletes, has set several corporate 
speaking dates for Jansen. "Everyone wants their sales teams to never take no 
for an answer. Dan Jansen's career epitomizes that," said Reede, president of 
Beverly Hills-based Nationwide Speakers Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's agent declined to estimate how much his client might make in 
endorsement fees. But "from a marketing standpoint, we'll do better than in any 
previous Olympics," said Parkes Brittain, vice president at Washington-based 
Advantage International. Blair already has several top sponsors, including 
Kellogg, Jeep and Evian. 
</P>
<P>
 Downhill skier Moe, who won a gold medal and a silver, expects some fat 
financial rewards from his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt his price has gone up since he won the gold medal," said Todd 
Schlopy, president of Park City, Utah-based Action Sports Management, which has 
represented Moe for years. "But we're not going to turn our backs on people who 
got him where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe currently has a handful of ski equipment endorsement contracts that expire 
in April. Schlopy said Moe intentionally held off from extending the contracts 
before the Games, hoping he'd win an Olympic medal. As a result, Moe's 
endorsement income, said Schlopy, "will probably triple." Briefly . . .

 The Santa Monica ad agency Rubin Postaer & Associates has parted with its 
$8-million account for Miller's Outpost. . . . The Los Angeles agency 
Cohen/Johnson has picked up a client it formerly handled, the $8-million ad 
business for Chi-Chi's restaurants. . . . After complaints and a threatened 
boycott from citizens of Todi, Italy, Visa has pulled a TV spot in which two 
tourists unwittingly trade their camera for a donkey. . . . Buena Vista Home 
Video has contacted a number of Southern California agencies about its 
estimated $3-million creative account. . . . Los Angeles ad veteran Craig 
Campbell, whose agency Campbell & Wagman closed earlier this year, has been 
named chief executive of the Los Angeles office of the ad agency EvansGroup. . 
. . Brentwood agency Stein Robaire Helm has lost the estimated $1-million 
account for Teva Sport Sandals, which the Carpinteria-based firm moved 
in-house. . . . L.A. Gear, the sneaker maker whose ad account has been with the 
Los Angeles office of Ogilvy & Mather for less than six months, is holding 
discussions with other agencies. . . . Reebok is reportedly unhappy with its 
highly paid top endorser and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. Olympic

 Star TV, Hong Kong's Wharf Cable Sever Agreement: Asian satellite broadcaster 
Star TV has ended its agreement with Hong Kong-based Wharf Cable for the latter 
to retransmit Star TV's programming. The decision is significant because it 
will probably make it more difficult for Star TV to launch a pay TV channel in 
Hong Kong, one of the most lucrative markets in Asia, because Wharf Cable is 
set to become the largest cable TV system in the world.Star TV, which was taken 
over by Rupert Murdoch in July, has been embroiled in a legal dispute with 
Wharf since January. Under the agreement, Star TV was to be the exclusive 
provider to Wharf Cale for all English-language programming in Hong Kong.

 Whittle Puts Network on Ice: Chris Whittle, chairman of Whittle 
Communications, said the company has suspended for at least two years 
operations of its money-losing Special Report Network, which provided 
television programming in doctors' waiting rooms.The service, launched in 1988, 
is seen in some 30,000 doctor's offices across the country. Whittle said the 
costs of the network significantly exceeded its revenue. Special Report Network 
accounts for about 20% of the company's overall revenue this fiscal year. As a 
result of the shutdown, Whittle expects to lay off about 150 of its 1,100 
employees.

 Kmart Shakes Up Bookstore Operations: In an effort to lure affluent younger 
readers, Kmart Corp. said it will close 187 of its 1,216 Waldenbook stores and 
upgrade its Borders super stores to a popular book and music format. The new 
format will combine books and music in a casual setting with novelties such as 
coffee bars and children's reading centers.The move comes as Kmart is putting 
the finishing touches on a plan to sell up to a 30% stake of the combined 
Borders-Waldenbooks to raise cash for its core discount store operation. Troy, 
Mich.-based Kmart acquired Borders in 1992 to strengthen its role as the 
nation's largest book retailer and compete with the growing popularity of 
Barnes & Noble's super stores.

DOW DIPS AS THE BROADER MARKET GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Blue chip stocks fell during late trading Monday, although other major 
market indicators rallied, encouraged by steady interest rates and higher share 
prices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond rates retreated as traders welcomed a regional economic report 
indicating that inflation pressures may be less than feared. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against most major currencies in light trading. Gold 
finished higher. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 After spending most of the session in positive ground, the Dow Jones average 
finished the day down 6.76 points at 3,832.02. But in the broader market, 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little to account for the Dow's decline, other than jitters among 
stock investors provoked by rising interest rates and inflation, as well as by 
events in Russia and Bosnia, said Michael Metz, investment strategist with 
Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said late-session, computer-generated sell programs helped fuel the 
blue chip barometer's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was a moderate 267.61 million shares, down from 273.68 
million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
rose 1.07 to 467.14, while the NYSE's composite index rose 0.66 to 259.23. At 
the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 3.89 to 471.34. 
</P>
<P>
 A surge in telecommunications stocks after news of MCI's move into wireless 
communications and gains in high-technology shares lifted the Nasdaq composite 
index of mostly smaller stocks 8.72 points to 792.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the tobaccos, it's not a bad day," said William LeFevre, senior 
market analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 LeFevre noted that the Dow ended February with a 3.7% decline after rising 6% 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're going to have a correction in a bull market, that's the kind of 
thing that happens," he said. "I don't see this as the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco stocks fell in heavy volume after the Food and Drug Administration 
raised the possibility Friday that drug regulations might be applied to 
cigarettes because of their nicotine content. 
</P>
<P>
 A factor in the broader market's advance was a strong start from overseas 
stocks. Tokyo stocks ended firmer, with the Nikkei 225-share average closing at 
19,997.20, up 193.82. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,091.57, up 
16.65 points, while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended 46.9 
points higher at 3,328.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index retreated 10.95 points to 2,585.44. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow component Philip Morris fell 2 to 56, RJR Nabisco dropped 3/8 to 6 7/8 
and American Brands lost 5/8 to 33 1/8, although industry analysts downplayed 
the possibility of the FDA action against cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was also hurt by profit taking in some cyclical stocks, including 
Alcoa, off 1 to 75 1/4, and International Paper, down 7/8 to 72 5/8, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * MCI Communications, which topped the Nasdaq activities list, rose 7/8 to 27 
3/8 after announcing a $1.3-billion investment in Nextel Communications as part 
of an alliance including cable television operator Comcast Corp. Nextel, which 
runs wireless networks using mobile radio technology, gained 5 5/8 to 44 1/4, 
and Comcast rose 1 1/4 to 20 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Companies dealing with Nextel also rose. Dial Page, a volatile wireless 
stock, rose 5 1/4 to 54 1/2, and Cencall Communications rose 3 7/8 to 28 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Viacom traded actively. Some Blockbuster Entertainment shareholders asked a 
Delaware judge to block the video rental company's merger with Viacom, 
including its plans to buy $1.25 billion in Viacom stock. Viacom Class B shares 
rose 1 3/8 to 28 3/8 and Blockbuster rose 1/4 to 26 1/2. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond fell to 6.65% from Friday's 6.71%, which pushed prices up 
21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. On Friday, the key bond's price 
rose 5/16 point. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. Analysts 
cautioned that Monday's price increase came on thin trading volume and that the 
market was still fundamentally weak following a monthlong selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to be characterized as a sea change in attitudes. The truth of 
the matter is there still is a lot of skepticism about where interest rates are 
headed," said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean 
Witter, Discover & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago reported that its index of area 
business activity rose to 60.3 in February from 59.6 the month before. But the 
Chicago survey also showed lower employment and price indexes, conditions that 
can help increase the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Job and price weakness both point to milder inflation. Bond investors follow 
inflation trends closely because higher consumer prices can make the returns on 
their bonds worth less over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of inflation also increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board 
will move soon to raise interest rates again. Higher rates on new securities 
diminish the value of already sold bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago area report is frequently seen as a precursor to a widely followed 
national report on the manufacturing economy, which is to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose between 3/32 point and 1/8 
point, and intermediate maturities rose 7/32 to 13/32 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. Commodities  
</P>
<P>
 Gold, silver and platinum futures prices rallied Monday as political and 
military tensions around the world prompted investors to seek the traditional 
safe haven of precious metals. On the New York Comex, gold for current delivery 
closed at $381.40 an ounce, up $2.80 from Friday. Silver closed at $5.356 an 
ounce, up 13 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's gains were driven by the violent aftermath of the massacre in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank, the NATO's downing of the Bosnian Serb aircraft and 
the chill in U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent spying scandal, 
said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Raptopoulos said silver's strength relative to gold indicates buying by Middle 
Eastern investors, who have been big players in the silver market since last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying silver as a safety asset," Raptopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, crude oil futures weakened on the New York Merc in reaction to 
heating oil's failure to sustain strong gains early in the session. Light, 
sweet crude oil for April delivery fell 9 cents to $14.48 a barrel. Currency  
</P>
<P>
 Bearish sentiments about the greenback outweighed concerns of a crisis 
following the downing of four Bosnian Serb planes by U.S. jets under NATO 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the dollar rose slightly after two U.S. fighter jets shot down 
the planes. The four planes had crossed into a United Nations no-fly zone over 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar usually gains on political crises because it is seen as a haven. 
However, the dollar couldn't sustain its gains and fell through several 
important technical levels against the German mark, triggering prearranged 
orders to sell the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar may also have been hurt by comments by Federal Reserve Board Gov. 
Lawrence Lindsey, who said he wasn't sure if the central bank would have to 
raise short-term interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that took a little wind out of the dollar's sails," said Randolph 
Donney of Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Donney said investors were bearish on the dollar because they expected the 
U.S. economic performance in February to be hurt by bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "increasingly believe the yen is going to strengthen," said David 
Durst, a vice president at Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 104.60 Japanese yen, down from 104.85 on 
Friday. It also fell to 1.704 German marks, down from 1.711.

 T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.40%, up from 3.33% last 
week. Another $12.7 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.61%, up from 3.53%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since the rate of 3.59% on June 29, 1992. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since six-month bills averaged 3.66% on the same date. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors: 3.48% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,914.10, and 3.73% for a six-month bill 
selling for $9,817.50. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value.

THOMAS YUEN TAKES A SHOT AT MULTIMEDIA; TECHNOLOGY: THE AST RESEARCH CO-FOUNDER 
FORMS COMPANY CALLED NUREALITY TO DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas C.K. Yuen, who made more than $60 million as one of the founders of 
computer maker AST Research Inc., has formed a new company, NuReality, to 
develop and sell multimedia products. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based NuReality will initially market products to enhance sound 
in video games. The products are based on technology developed by SRS Labs 
Inc., a Newport Beach-based start-up company in which Yuen bought a majority 
stake last month for $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen, who serves as chairman of SRS Labs, will be president of NuReality. 
</P>
<P>
 NuReality is the first of three ventures that Yuen said he intends to launch 
in the next several months as part of his long-planned return to the computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had enough rest," Yuen said in a telephone interview Monday. "I've done 
a lot of looking. . . . I believe in this market for multimedia," or computers 
and software that can combine text, sound, graphics and video. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS Labs was formed last summer when a group led by investor Stephen Sedmak 
purchased a patented sound technology developed by Hughes Aircraft Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Yuen's company will market SRS Labs' technology worldwide as part of its 
Vivid 3D sound enhancement system for video games. The device, which can be 
added to personal computers or Nintendo and Sega game systems, will compete 
with other companies that have licensed SRS' technology, such as Calypso Micro 
Products in Los Gatos, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen said NuReality will hire area manufacturers to produce Vivid 3D, which 
will be available in April for less than $100. Yuen said he also plans to start 
two other companies soon, including a firm that will specialize in direct 
marketing of portable notebook computers and accessories. He declined to 
identify the third company or reveal further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen co-founded AST Research in 1981 and helped it grow to a billion-dollar 
company. He resigned in 1992 after a power struggle with co-founder Safi 
Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving AST, Yuen founded Atlantis, a Newport Beach start-up, to seek 
new opportunities in the computer-related business. NuReality, a subsidiary of 
Atlantis, will focus on developing multimedia products in addition to Vivid 3D. 
Yuen is the sole owner of NuReality and Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen said his company includes a number of former AST veterans, including 
Robert J. Becker, a former vice president of government system sales; Gregory 
A. Cutler, a manager in AST's consumer products division; Alan D. Kraemer, a 
former vice president of engineering; Tami L. Pereira, a former vice president 
of international sales and marketing operations, and J. Ronald Shiroke, who 
held various titles in sales at AST.

 Tobacco stocks fell Monday after a flurry of reports last week condemning 
cigarette makers was capped by a federal regulator's suggestion that tobacco be 
regulated as an addictive drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Philip Morris Cos., the nation's largest cigarette company, fell $2 
to close at $56 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's 
brands include Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette, Benson & Hedges 
100s, Merit and Virginia Slims. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the No. 2 U.S. cigarette maker, 
dropped 37.5 cents to close at $6.875. It was the most actively traded NYSE 
stock, with nearly 4.5 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler raised the 
possibility that drug regulations might be applied to cigarettes because of 
their nicotine content, a move that could force them off the market and 
possibly behind drugstore counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging on the FDA, an anti-smoking group Monday asked the agency to regulate 
cigarettes as a drug or medical device. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, Action on Smoking and Health, said the tobacco industry 
deliberately adds nicotine to tobacco used in cigarettes, which shows that the 
firms intend the nicotine to either cause an addiction or satisfy an existing 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco giants Monday jumped to their own defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris and RJR separately said they do not increase nicotine in their 
tobacco blends above what naturally occurs. They said their manufacturing 
processes result in lower nicotine levels in cigarettes than those found in 
unprocessed tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The claims that RJR increases the nicotine in its products is false," the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other reports hitting the industry last week, U.S. Surgeon General 
Joycelyn Elders accused cigarette makers of targeting young people with 
marketing tactics such as RJR's Joe Camel mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, McDonald's Corp. banned smoking from the more than 1,400 restaurants it 
directly owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said they doubt cigarettes will ever be regulated to the 
same degree as drugs and said the FDA's statement poses more of an opportunity 
for investors to buy tobacco stocks. But some warned that the industry's 
reputation could be further damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber, said the FDA should have trouble 
proving tobacco addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is Congress' domain of whether cigarettes are viewed as an addictive 
drug," said Barry Ziegler of A.G. Edwards. "And I do not think Congress will go 
along with that."

KMART POSTS $1.19-BILLION QUARTERLY LOSS; RETAILING: CHARGES FOR MODERNIZATION 
PROGRAM AND DISPOSITION OF UNITS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFICIT, COMPANY SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Kmart Corp., weighed down by hefty charges to leave its warehouse and 
drugstore businesses and upgrade the image of its core discount stores, said 
Monday that it lost $1.19 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss contrasts with a profit of $535 million in the fourth quarter of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's second-largest retailer attributed the loss to $862 million in 
onetime charges for disposing of its Pace Membership Warehouse and PayLess 
Drugs units, as well as modernizing its Kmart stores in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Kmart said it would sell some of its Pace stores to No. 1 retailer 
Wal-Mart Inc. and sell PayLess to TCH Corp. of California. The PayLess sale is 
expected to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 For the full year, Kmart lost $974 million, or $2.15 a share, on sales of 
$34.6 billion. In 1992, it earned $941 million, or $2.06 a share, on sales of 
$31 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the onetime charges, Kmart said it lost $328 million in the year 
ended Jan. 26, contrasted with a profit of $882 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart blamed the year's operating loss on slimmer margins, stiff competition 
and a shift by consumers to less-profitable items. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there was pricing pressure in both hard lines and apparel merchandise 
throughout the year because of the competitiveness of the retail environment, 
the primary reasons for margin reduction in the fourth quarter and full year 
were related to Kmart's inventory reduction program and increased markdowns at 
the Kmart Fashions division," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart's four remaining specialty store units -- Borders-Walden Group, Builders 
Square, Sports Authority and OfficeMax -- reported mixed results for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Restructuring charges pushed Builders Square and Borders-Walden into the red 
for the year, while OfficeMax and Sports Authority reported record profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said its Builders Square home improvement unit lost $164 million in 
1993, contrasted with a profit of $81 million in 1992, while the Borders-Walden 
bookstore chain lost $168 million last year, contrasted with a profit of $46 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Both subsidiaries are undergoing substantial reorganizations ahead of a 
planned public offering of Kmart's specialty store stock later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Office supply firm OfficeMax earned $20 million last year, while Sports 
Authority reported operating profit of $21 million. In 1992, OfficeMax earned 
$1 million, while Sports Authority earned $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Kmart said it would sell, subject to shareholder approval, up to 
30% of the equity value of the four subsidiaries to shareholders in an effort 
to raise cash for the refurbishment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said 191 of its discount stores were upgraded in 1993, bringing the 
total number of stores with the retailer's new look to 1,321. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart has nearly 5,000 retail outlets, including Kmart, Builders Square, 
Borders and Waldenbooks, Sports Authority and OfficeMax. It has stores in the 
United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia. It plans to open stores in Mexico and Singapore this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart stock closed unchanged at $19 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

 Key Mortgage Rate Resumes Slide: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th District cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
mortgages are tied, fell to 3.710% in January from 3.879% in December. The rate 
had edged higher in December for the first time in three years before resuming 
its decline. The rate measures the average cost of funds to the thrifts and 
other financial institutions in the bank's 11th District, which covers 
California, Arizona and Nevada.

 Turkey Orders More Lockheed F-16s: Turkey would get an additional 40 of the 
fighter jets under an agreement signed by representatives of the Turkish and 
U.S. governments, Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. said. The company estimated 
the value of the order to Lockheed at $350 million. The follow-on order, which 
increases Turkey's total F-16 orders to 240 from 200, provides for the jets to 
be built at a factory near Ankara, Turkey, by Tusas Aerospace Industries Inc., 
a joint venture partly owned by Lockheed, and delivered beginning in 1998.

 Hughes, China Reportedly Reach Launch Accord: The pact calls for the Optus B3, 
an Australian telecommunications satellite built by Hughes Aircraft Co., to be 
launched from China by one of China's Long March rockets in the second half of 
1994, the Xinhua news agency reported.It would replace the Optus B2, another 
Hughes-built satellite that failed to reach orbit after launching from China in 
December, 1992. However, the Optus B3 launch will first require clearance by 
the U.S. government, because of U.S.-imposed sanctions on certain technology 
exports to China last summer. Los Angeles-based Hughes, a unit of General 
Motors Corp., had no immediate comment on the report.

SOME LONG-HAUL AIR FARES SLASHED; TRAVEL: AMERICA WEST TRIGGERS LATEST CUTS IN 
COAST-TO-COAST RATES. SAVINGS OF MORE THAN 50% OFFERED ON SOME ROUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's airlines Monday slashed discount air fares by more than 50% on 
some major coast-to-coast routes through mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent price cut, which was started by America West Airlines and 
matched by most other major carriers, will prove popular with leisure 
travelers, particularly around the Easter and spring break holidays, travel 
agents said.  
</P>
<P>
 The America West sale applies to a limited supply of seats in about a dozen 
long-haul markets, two of which include Los Angeles. A Los Angeles-New York 
round trip costs $318, while a Los Angeles-Boston round trip costs $328. Before 
the sale, the lowest discounted round-trip fare to both cities was $659. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale ends March 10 and travel must be completed by June 15. The 
non-refundable tickets must be purchased two weeks in advance and require a 
Saturday night stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty good deal," said Thomas Nulty, president of Associated Travel 
Management in Santa Ana. During the same period last year, the sale price of a 
Los Angeles-New York round trip was $50 higher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sale "will stimulate traffic anytime you get down to the $300 range for 
travel to the East Coast," Nulty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major carriers -- including American, Delta and United -- matched America 
West on competing routes. 
</P>
<P>
 America West also announced a second sale, which applies to a larger number of 
destinations but cuts discount fares by no more than a third. That sale, which 
expires March 30 and is good for travel through June 15, is an extension of a 
promotion the Phoenix-based carrier has been offering for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the one-third-off sale, the price of a Los Angeles-Atlanta round trip 
falls from $566 to as low as $418 for travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and 
Saturdays. Fares are higher on other days. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sales come as several carriers said their advance bookings through June 
are running ahead of last year. "Things are looking a little bit better than 
they have in the past," said Marty Heires, a spokesman for American Airlines. 
"It's one of the signs of an improving economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the string of America West sales, coast-to-coast discount air fares had 
risen above $600. "They've gotten pretty high," said Marilyn Hoppe, vice 
president of revenue management at America West. "These fares at the lower 
levels will hopefully stimulate a little more traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines' more costly regular discount fares and the constant fare sales 
result in more travelers than ever waiting for the next promotion before buying 
a ticket, travel agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nulty said he is asked the same question by clients and acquaintances: "When 
is the next sale coming?"

FED GOVERNOR SAYS NEW HIKES NOT CERTAIN; ECONOMY: LINDSEY'S REMARKS CALM THE 
BOND MARKET. BUT HE WARNS THAT PRICE PRESSURES COULD NUDGE INTEREST RATES 
AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Gov. Lawrence Lindsey said Monday that he hopes the 
recent rise in short-term interest rates will keep inflation at bay, but he 
warned that another upward push may be needed if price pressures build in the 
moderately expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, one quarter-point is going to solve the problem," Lindsey said at 
a meeting of the Credit Union National Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were the first indication from a Fed policy-maker that the central 
bank may not have to continue nudging interest rates higher over the coming 
year -- if early signals of potential price problems abate. 
</P>
<P>
 The jittery bond market calmed on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices have been dropping, and interest yields rising, since the Fed in 
early February surprised markets by pushing up the federal funds rate a quarter 
of point to 3.25%. It was its first upward move in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been warning that further increases may be 
needed to keep the economy growing steadily without inflation sapping its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Many market analysts interpret this to mean the federal funds rate, the only 
measure the central bank directly controls, will rise to 4% by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed uses the rate to increase the cost of money throughout the economy. It 
does so by reducing cash in bank reserve accounts, which forces banks to charge 
each other more for short-term liquidity loans, known as federal funds. This 
pushes up rates across the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the expectation for gradually increasing rates, the bond market has 
fallen in the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 This has pushed up the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue to about 
6.7% -- its highest level in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey's encouraging remarks on the outlook for monetary policy, combined 
with an economic report suggesting inflation was well-behaved in February, gave 
the market some confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago purchasing managers index, a gauge of the health of the 
manufacturing industry, edged up slightly to 60.3 in February from 59.6 the 
prior month. But its inflation component dipped to 56.7 from 59.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey did not rule out further Fed action on rates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he agrees with Greenspan that interest rates are more likely to head 
up than down, but he said he doubts there will be a rise on the magnitude of 
the 4% increase seen in the federal funds rate in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every hope and every expectation that preemptive action on our part 
will keep us well below that rate of increase," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Fed pushed up the federal funds rate Feb. 4 because it saw 
"precursors of what might be inflation down the road," not because prices were 
in imminent danger of getting out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 These early warning signals included rising commodity prices and tightness in 
specialized labor markets, especially in the Midwest. If the Fed had waited 
much longer, price pressures may have burst forth, he said.

PACIFIC MUTUAL LIFE DISCUSSES INVESTMENT BUSINESS MERGER; CONSOLIDATION: 
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST LIFE INSURER IS TALKING WITH A CONNECTICUT MUTUAL FUND 
MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. said Monday that it is discussing a possible 
merger of much of its investment business with that of Thomson Advisory Group, 
a Connecticut mutual fund manager with about $11 billion under its control. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger would result in a combined company with assets under management of 
about $70 billion. About $60 billion would come from several asset-management 
subsidiaries of Newport Beach-based Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the companies would not elaborate on their discussions. But 
investment industry analyst Michael Lipper suggested that the talks might be an 
effort by Pacific Mutual to take its investment services operation public 
through a merger with Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks appear to be aimed at pushing most, if not all, of Thomson's 
investment advisory business onto Pacific Mutual's plate. But Thomson, a 
limited partnership whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 
would keep its master limited partnership status and NYSE listing, a 
spokeswoman for the company said. Thomson stock closed Monday at 35.25, up 
2.875. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, which has a steady history of profitability and posted a profit of 
$24.2 million in 1993, manages the $5-billion Thomson McKinnon mutual funds 
through its mutual funds group and about $6 billion in institutional and 
individual assets through its Columbus Circle Investors subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual is California's largest life insurance company, with more than 
$40 billion in insurance in force at the end of 1992, the latest year for which 
financial and performance data for the company are available. The company 
reported $2.5 billion in revenue for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the merger discussions anticipate creation of an 
entirely new business or whether the combined funds would be handled under the 
auspices of one of half a dozen Pacific Mutual subsidiaries that would 
contribute to the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have a quarter, or maybe half, of the puzzle," Lipper said. Both 
companies have good reputations and names that help their sales forces market 
their services, he said. But Thomson "is too small when the (investment 
management) business gets rougher to maintain a strong effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Mutual investment subsidiaries manage $74 billion in assets, 
including about $60 billion for outside investment clients. Pacific Investment 
Management Co. is a major fixed-income assets manager; Cadence Capital, 
Parametric and NFJ Investment Group manage U.S. equity accounts for the company 
and its clients -- mainly government and corporate pension funds, and 
Blairlogie Capital manages international portfolios.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: VIACOM TAKEOVER FORCES OUT PARAMOUNT'S JAFFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Midway through his six-year contract, Paramount Communications Inc. President 
Stanley Jaffe got word Monday that there will not be a role for him after 
Viacom completes its acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a well-placed source, Jaffe was informed of the decision by 
Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis, who was the only Paramount executive to 
attend a meeting of Viacom executives in Vail, Colo., last week, where 
Blockbuster executives were also in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The ouster of Jaffe was widely expected because Viacom already has a strong 
No. 2 man to manage Paramount in Frank Biondi. Jaffe declined to comment on his 
status Monday. One report has valued his exit package in stock and stock 
options at about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe's plans are undisclosed. Sherry Lansing, his former producing partner, 
is telling friends that she expects to remain as Paramount Pictures chief under 
the new regime. Earlier speculation had Jaffe, a sports fan, trying to buy 
basketball's New York Knicks and ice hockey's New York Rangers from Paramount, 
but the company recently said those assets are not for sale. Some sources say 
Jaffe will probably return to producing.

POLYGRAM PROFIT JUMP OF 21% REFLECTS GLOBAL STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Global entertainment giant PolyGram said its net income climbed 21% in 1993 to 
$316 million, continuing a nine-year string of profit increases that reflect 
the company's strong worldwide music sales. 
</P>
<P>
 PolyGram's net income a year earlier was $262 million. Its sales rose 12% to 
$3.8 billion, from $3.4 billion. The company is 75%-owned by Dutch electronics 
giant Philips, and 25% is publicly held. 
</P>
<P>
 PolyGram, which has rapidly expanded its music and film operations, was helped 
by two major albums from its A&M Records unit: Sting's Grammy-nominated "Ten 
Summoner's Tales," which has sold nearly 5 million copies worldwide, and Bryan 
Adams' "So Far So Good," which has sold about 7 million copies worldwide. 
Another big seller was U2's "Zooropa" from PolyGram's Island Records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, PolyGram Chief Executive Alain Levy also cited the debut 
releases from the Gin Blossoms and the Cranberries as significant contributors. 
Results included only a small contribution from Motown Records because PolyGram 
did not complete its $325-million acquisition of Motown until September. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions by PolyGram's film units continue to grow, with revenue rising 
23% last year. But their contributions to the company's overall revenue pales 
in comparison to those from music, where pop sales contributed 69% to revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy reiterated previous forecasts that films will account for about 25% of 
PolyGram's revenue by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, PolyGram released 13 films. It expects to increase the total 
released annually to as many as 15 this year and about 25 by 1996. PolyGram's 
Interscope films, which are released through Walt Disney Co., will also be 
distributed through MGM/UA under another agreement. PolyGram and Universal 
Pictures also co-own Gramercy Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy said PolyGram's goal is to set up its own distribution system but said it 
must first "focus on the quality of what we are producing" before taking that 
step. He predicted that once that focus is achieved, it will not be difficult 
to set up a distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the kind of cash flow we have, it would take us five seconds to get into 
distribution," he said.

YOUR TAXES; CHANGES IN LAW: STUDY THEM WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer's tax law ushered in a host of changes for American taxpayers -- 
from higher rates for the wealthy to little-known breaks for small-business 
owners and philanthropists. Knowing how the law changed could pay off by 
providing you with increased deductions and, in some cases, retroactive tax 
refunds. Here's a look at some of the changes and how they could affect you. 
</P>
<P>
 * New top rate. The top marginal tax rate is now 36% on taxable income above 
$140,000 for married couples and $110,000 for singles. There's also a 10% 
surtax on income over $250,000 for both individuals and joint filers. However, 
if you must pay more tax because of these new rates, you can elect to pay it in 
three annual installments. But beware. There are tricks to calculating the 
installments and to paying the tax, notes Gregg Ritchie, a partner in the 
personal financial planning group of KPMG Peat Marwick in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To use the three-year payment plan, you must calculate what your 1993 tax 
would have been under the old rates and then calculate it using the new rates. 
The difference, with a few exceptions, is the amount you can elect to pay over 
the next three years. But if you miscalculate and underpay by even a dollar, 
you could lose the ability to defer payment of the additional tax, Ritchie 
says. If in doubt, pay too much and file for a refund later, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retroactive break. Self-employed individuals got a retroactive tax break 
that allows them to write off 25% of the cost of health insurance premiums for 
all of 1993 and part of 1992. For instance, if you paid $2,000 to buy medical 
insurance for yourself and your family last year, you would subtract 25% or 
that cost, or $500, from your income. (You report the cost on Line 26 of Form 
1040.) For someone in the 31% tax bracket, that would save $155 in tax. 
</P>
<P>
 You can amend last year's tax return to claim a credit for the last half of 
1992 as well. Assuming that your premiums and tax rate were the same, that 
would net you about $77.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expenses. Self-employed individuals and small-business owners can now claim 
up to $17,500 in office equipment purchases, compared to $10,000 under the 
previous law, says Philip J. Holthouse, a partner at Holthouse Carlin & Van 
Trigt in Los Angeles. If you spent more than $17,500, the remainder must be 
depreciated according to a set schedule -- usually over five to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The change provides a substantial break for anyone who bought a lot of 
equipment in 1993 to start a business and then had taxable income.  
</P>
<P>
 * Trust income. Taxes on trust income also soared under the 1993 tax act. But 
people who have put money into trust accounts can opt to "distribute" -- take 
some of the income out of the trust -- if they do it quickly. That would cause 
the trust income to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, which could result 
in substantial savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider someone who has a trust account for the benefit of a 15-year-old 
child. If the trust earned $10,000, the earnings would be taxed at the newly 
created 39.6% rate. But if this person distributed the income to the child 
before March 6, it would be taxed at the child's ordinary income tax rate, 
which is probably 15%, Ritchie says. 
</P>
<P>
 (If the child is under age 14, the income would be taxed at the parents' 
marginal rates. But unless the parents are exceptionally wealthy, that rate is 
still likely to be less than the trust tax rates.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Alternative minimum tax. More people will fall into the onerous alternative 
minimum tax system for 1993. The AMT is primarily a concern to high-income 
Americans who pay high state income taxes and high property taxes. You're 
particularly at risk if you recognized a big capital gain during 1993 and live 
in a state that doesn't have a separate capital gains tax, such as California, 
notes Holthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the AMT works is you have to calculate your tax liability twice -- 
once under the ordinary income tax system and once under the AMT system, which 
offers lower overall rates but allows fewer deductions. You then pay whichever 
amount is higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appreciated donations. People who make large charitable contributions should 
also know that the tax law allows them to donate appreciated property without 
triggering the AMT. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you have stock you purchased in 1969 for $100 and it's now worth 
$10,000. If you give the stock to charity, you get a $10,000 deduction, which 
saves you about $2,800 in tax. And neither you nor the charity pays capital 
gains tax on the $9,900 gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home office. It wasn't part of the 1993 tax act, but the rules on home 
office deductions also tightened last year because of a Supreme Court decision. 
Now you can deduct home office expenses only if you meet several strict tests. 
The home office must be your primary place of business, you generally must meet 
clients there, and you must not use the office for any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mutual funds. Middle- and high-income filers need to be more careful about 
how they report mutual fund income this year because of the widened difference 
between ordinary income tax rates and capital gains rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds typically distribute both dividend and capital gains income. The 
dividend income is taxed at your ordinary income rates, which may be 31% or 
more in 1993. The capital gains are taxed at 28%. But you must fill out a 
separate form (Schedule D) to get the lower rate. Time to Get Organized 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether you do your own taxes or have them done, getting your 
records together and putting down your deductible expenses can save you time 
and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced? Here are checklists and a work sheet to help you get organized. 
CHECKLIST: What you'll need to establish your income...and expenses 
</P>
<P>
 * W-2s, indicating the wages, salaries and tips you earned in 1993 and the 
federal, state and local taxes you've already paid through employee 
withholding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1099s, which show earnings from jobs as an independent contractor or that 
can indicate the proceeds from stock or bond sales. If your 1099 is for 
securities sales, you'll also need documentation indicating how much you paid 
for the security. The difference between what you paid and the amount you sold 
it for -- shown on the 1099 -- is your capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1099-DIVs, which are provided by mutual fund companies to report your 
dividend and long-term capital gains or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1099-INTs, for interest income you've earned in bank and brokerage accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * K-1 forms. If you invest in partnerships, you'll get a K-1 form, which 
indicates partnership income and losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * SSA-1099s, which report your Social Security income, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security numbers for you, your spouse and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1098s, showing the mortgage interest expenses you paid during the year. If 
you refinanced, you may have two or more of these forms. Refinancers will also 
need loan papers that show how much they paid in "points," which are deductible 
over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canceled checks and receipts for charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deposit receipts for IRA and Keogh contributions. 
</P>
<P>

self-employment income or losses. 
</P>
<P>

 * Social Security number or employer identification number for your 
baby-sitter or child care provider, if you paid for child care so that both 
spouses could work for income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canceled checks for any estimated tax payments you may have made during the 
year. WORKSHEET: Fill in the blanks that apply INCOME: Wages (worker No. 1):

YOUR TAXES; PC TAX PROGRAMS NOT FOR EVERYONE; SOFTWARE: KNOWLEDGE OF IRS RULES 
IS A MUST IF THE RETURNS ARE TO BE CORRECTLY COMPLETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aided by a handful of popular software programs, an increasing number of 
technologically savvy taxpayers have begun to prepare their annual tax returns 
on personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quick, easy and accurate, they say. Give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving these software programs to some taxpayers is like giving a gun to a 
3-year-old," says Gregg Ritchie, partner with the personal financial planning 
group at KPMG Peat Marwick. "They don't know how to use them." 
</P>
<P>
 We gave the two top-selling tax software programs -- "Andrew Tobias' TaxCut" 
and "TurboTax" -- to a handful of taxpayers to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The taxpayers, who were savvy about neither software nor taxes, 
loved the programs. They found them easy to load into their computers. Easy to 
complete. They loved the fact that they could run out an IRS-ready copy of 
their tax returns on a home printer. 
</P>
<P>
 They found "TaxCut" as easy to use as "TurboTax" and vice versa. Indeed, the 
only difference between the two programs seemed to be that TurboTax's 1040 form 
looked a little sharper -- hardly a difference to write home about. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem: Some of the returns were wrong -- drastically 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished returns were each scrutinized by a tax accountant, who checked 
them for accuracy. In three of four cases, there were errors. In one case, the 
errors were significant -- amounting to thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? It's difficult to reconstruct because no one stood over the 
reviewers while they were preparing their returns. But it appears the problems 
were mainly that the reviewers misunderstood some questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of background: Both of these programs are set up to quiz taxpayers. When 
you load them into your computer, you're given a choice of going directly to a 
1040 form, or completing a question-and-answer session with the computer, where 
you answer questions about your income, deductible expenses, investments, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer digests your answers, and then plugs the appropriate numbers into 
the right forms and schedules. All you have to do in the end is hit your print 
button, and the computer will spit out IRS-approved forms and schedules. The 
only time you have to look at the Form 1040 is when you sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayers' errors mainly fell into two categories: Deductions for state 
and personal taxes. Two of the three filers failed to note the DMV taxes they 
paid. They say they simply didn't realize that questions about "personal 
property taxes" included DMV fees. One also failed to note state disability 
insurance payments, which are deductible on federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The third error-filled return had problems with state taxes -- the reviewer 
plugged in his total state tax liability for 1993 rather than the actual amount 
that he paid. And significant problems with a rental property. Somehow 
deductible property depreciation, taxes and mortgage expenses were all severely 
misstated. The taxpayer is not sure why, and neither is our tax accountant who 
found the errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, however, the errors that appeared on the computer forms are errors 
that these taxpayers may have made if they had prepared their returns by hand. 
They say they may have been lulled into a false sense of security, because the 
programs seemed so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably should have spent more time reading the booklet," one taxpayer 
sighed. "But it was supposed to be so easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: If you're fairly good at filing your own tax return and 
you're on friendly terms with a personal computer, you'd probably find tax 
software appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 It does your math. It automatically plugs in the right figures for standard 
deductions and personal exemptions. It calculates certain limitations in the 
wink of an eye. If you want to make changes on a form, you don't need to bother 
with white-out or erasers. You simply delete or add whatever items you need. 
And, when you're done, you can hit a few buttons and print the whole thing out 
in a format that's acceptable to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 But the programs are not a substitute for a tax accountant. If you haven't got 
a clue about how the various tax rules affect your return and if you need 
someone to remind you about which expenses are deductible and which aren't, you 
need an accountant, not a software program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The software is going to do the arithmetic, but it is not the same as going 
to a savvy tax adviser," says Lawrence Magid, a syndicated computer columnist.

<P>
 Here are some unusual tidbits about taxes: 
</P>
<P>
 Tax History 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know our present income tax system is only 81 years old? Income taxes 
started with the Tariff Act of 1913, which added the 16th Amendment to the 
Constitution. In short, the 16th Amendment states that Congress can "lay and 
collect taxes on income from whatever source derived." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, a 1% tax was levied on all companies and on individuals with net 
income above $3,000. (A $1,000 exemption was allowed for married couples.) One 
in 271 Americans found themselves subject to tax that year, according to CCH 
Inc., a Riverwoods, Ill., publisher of tax law information.

 President Clinton's tax law, passed last August, may cost the Clinton family a 
few bucks. The new law, which retroactively raised tax rates on wealthy filers, 
pushes the Clintons into the 36% tax bracket, according to CCH Inc., a 
Riverwoods, Ill., publisher of tax law information. If their income is the same 
in 1993 as it was the year before, they would pay an extra $4,502 in federal 
tax, CCH analysts estimate.

 Demographics, Deductions 
</P>
<P>
 Used to be that kids grew up, got married and created a few little tax 
deductions of their own. But in the last several years, there's been a decided 
shift. Kids, sometimes as young as 12 years old, are having kids. And, from a 
tax standpoint, that can be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting an increasing number of questions about filing status," says 
Nina Homfelt, a national spokeswoman for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service in Irving, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a mother, living with your mother, and caring for your child, do you 
file "single" or "head of household?" Is your child your dependent or your 
mother's? What happens if the child's father contributes to the baby's support? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers hinge on who pays what. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the grandparent provides more than half of the support for both the mother 
and child, the grandparent claims both as dependents," says Tim Robinson, 
Jackson Hewitt's Southern California district manager. "The parent would file 
'single' and not claim anyone (including herself) as a personal exemption." 
</P>
<P>
 If the father is paying child support of less than 50% of the baby's expenses, 
he would not get a deduction for the child -- nor would he get a deduction for 
the child support expenses. If he pays alimony, he'd deduct the amount of the 
alimony payments and the mother would have to claim the alimony as taxable 
income. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Think the IRS Is Tough? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration wants to put professional bill collectors on the 
trail of some delinquent taxpayers. The Administration's recent budget proposal 
advocates launching a "test" that would allow the IRS to hire collection 
agencies to track down and get payment from about 100,000 people with back tax 
bills. The proposal is controversial because past congressional probes have 
found that bill collectors often engage in abusive and, sometimes, illegal 
tactics to collect debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan would put several safeguards in place -- such as restricting 
the collection agencies' access to taxpayer records and how far they can go to 
collect tax bills. There would also be an IRS survey of taxpayer 
"satisfaction." It is unclear whether Congress will approve the plan. About

YOUR TAXES; 2 NEW TAX GUIDES SUCCEED IN SIMPLIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two new entrants in the already crowded market for tax guides -- 
Consumer Reports' "Tax Workbook" and "Tax Guide for the Intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that these two short texts do what the five industry 
veterans have been unable to do: They make it a bit simpler for an average 
person to file a federal tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the five other thick tomes that aim to help the 50 million taxpayers 
who file their own returns, these guides have some shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tax Guide for the Intimidated," written by Joseph P. Markunas, a Seattle area 
certified public accountant, and Lisa Apelt, a licensed tax consultant, is the 
shortest of the nation's general-purpose tax guides. And that's one of the 
book's main strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't get bogged down in arcane details of the tax law. It simply leads 
readers through the 1040, using clear language to explain areas that many find 
complex. At the end of each chapter, it has a question-and-answer section that 
aims to clarify some less obvious points. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the book isn't for everyone. If you're a low-income filer, it doesn't 
do anything to help you claim the earned income tax credit, a lucrative break 
for the working poor. If you're a higher-income filer or someone with 
substantial investments, it doesn't go far enough in explaining some rules 
about some investments. It does, however, recognize its limitations, and it 
refers taxpayers to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service publications for 
further questions. 
</P>
<P>
 But for someone with a few questions about a fairly simple return, this $10.95 
book does a pretty good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The other new entrant, Consumer Reports' "Tax Workbook -- 1994 Edition," 
$8.99, is even more limited in scope, providing lots of work sheets but paltry 
explanations -- even in some complex areas. Where it can help, however, is in 
reminding people about deductions and easily forgotten tax issues. Near the end 
of the book, there's a nice listing of deductible and non-deductible expenses; 
taxable and non-taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five guides give far more detailed advice on a wide array of 
subjects, ranging from itemized deductions to declaring farm and business 
income. They also share one main shortcoming: By giving so much advice, they 
become a bear to read. Those with simple returns are better off with the IRS' 
1040 instruction booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you've got complicated issues not covered in the IRS booklet and 
don't want to hire a professional to prepare your return, these are the guides 
for you. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 "J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax," which retails for $14 but offers a $2 send-in 
rebate; "The Ernst & Young Tax Guide," which is $13.95 but offers a $1 send-in 
refund, plus a free calculator; "H&R Block 1994 Income Tax Guide," $12.95, 
gives readers a $10 coupon for electronic filing or tax preparation service in 
H&R Block offices; "The Consumer Reports Guide to Income Tax," which sells for 
$13.99, and "The Money 1994 Income Tax Handbook," which is put out by the 
publishers of Money magazine, $13.99. About This Report

YOUR TAXES; TAX CREDIT OFTEN UNUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Monterosa's financial deliverance came from an unusual source: the 
Internal Revenue Service. Last year, she was newly divorced and unable to 
collect child support from her out-of-work ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 After buying food and paying rent, Monterosa, who earns $12,000 a year working 
in a Washington delicatessen, didn't have enough money to pay the day care 
bill. And no child care meant no job. 
</P>
<P>
 But, thanks to a sweeping outreach effort by several children's rights groups, 
Monterosa found the earned income tax credit -- the nation's most generous and 
underutilized tax break. Uncle Sam sent her $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fabulous," says Monterosa, who has two daughters, ages 5 and 6. "I was 
able to pay for day care and even buy my daughters birthday presents this year. 
This credit is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterosa is among millions of Americans who have discovered the earned income 
tax credit, which can pay low-income parents up to $2,364 -- even if they paid 
no federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of individuals applying for the earned income credit is expected to 
top 16 million this year, a 20% increase from 1992 levels, tax officials say. 
But some say the credit is still underutilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly one in six Americans who can claim the credit don't, says Nancy Duff 
Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law Center in Washington. The 
reasons are twofold: Some of the people who are due an earned income refund 
simply don't file tax returns. Married couples who earn less than $10,900 
aren't required to file. Nor do single parents earning less than $7,800 have to 
file returns. Yet people in these income brackets are the targets of the EIC. 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is simply confusion. Claiming the earned income credit is 
fairly complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the widespread confusion is the number of people who improperly 
claim the credit, says Judith Golden, an IRS spokeswoman. Where some 13.5 
million individuals claimed the credit on 1992 returns, only 9.7 million of 
those qualified, she says. Indeed, inaccurate claims are so common that merely 
claiming the EIC is now enough to single out your tax return for an audit. 
Returns including the EIC will be personally scrutinized this year instead of 
being automatically fed through the IRS computer, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrutiny should not deter anyone from legitimately claiming the credit, 
Golden notes.  
</P>
<P>
 How do you determine if you qualify for the EIC? 
</P>
<P>
 The test is three-pronged: 
</P>
<P>
 * You must have earned income -- that's wages, salaries, tips or income from 
self-employment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your total income -- including interest, dividends, contributions to 401(k) 
plans and the value of military housing and subsistence payments -- must amount 
to less than $23,050 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * You must have a "qualifying child," who lives with you in the United States 
more than six months a year and for whom you provide support. To qualify, your 
child must either be under the age of 19 or a full-time student under the age 
of 24 or be permanently and totally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 If you meet the criteria, you must file a regular tax form -- the form 1040 or 
1040A -- along with a Schedule EIC. The EIC form is a little complicated 
because it's broken into three parts. If you qualify, you get a "basic credit" 
just for having children and a low income. If you have an infant, you get 
another credit. If you pay health insurance premiums to cover your children, 
you get a third credit. You then add all those credits to come up with the 
total earned income credit amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Importantly, this credit is refundable. If it amounts to more than you owe, 
you get a tax refund -- even if you didn't pay a dime of federal income tax. 
Example of Earned Income Credit 
</P>
<P>
 How do you claim the earned income credit? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's follow a hypothetical single parent, Mary Jane, through the process. She 
has two children, ages 3 and 5, and earns $15,000 annually. She pays $500 a 
year for family health coverage. But her employer has not withheld any federal 
income tax from her paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jane files the 1040A form -- it's shorter and simpler than the 1040 -- 
noting her children's names and Social Security numbers in section 6c. Her 
wages of $15,000 are written on lines 7, 16 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
 At line 19, she subtracts the value of the standard deduction for a head of 
household -- $5,450 -- and, on line 21, deducts three $2,350 personal 
exemptions for herself and the children. Her taxable income, written on line 
22, is $2,500. She looks up her tax in the tables and finds she owes $377 in 
federal income tax, which she notes on line 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she's going to claim the earned income credit, she pulls out the 
Schedule EIC, where she repeats the personal information about herself and her 
children. On line 3 she writes in that she pays $500 for family health 
insurance premiums. On lines 4, 7 and 9 she repeats that her income is $15,000. 
She looks up the value of her basic credit on Table A and finds that she's due 
a $1,118 "basic credit." 
</P>
<P>
 She moves on to the second section where she claims a health insurance credit. 
Based on her income and the cost of her health insurance, she gets a credit of 
$344. But, since neither of her children are infants, she is not able to claim 
the third part of the credit for "a child born in 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds together the health care credit and the basic credit, and writes 
$1,462 on lines 28a and 28d. 
</P>
<P>
 Line 29 asks her to subtract line 28d -- what she "paid in" -- from line 23 -- 
her federal tax liability. The result: Mary Jane gets a $1,085 tax refund even 
though she paid no federal income tax. About This Report

YOUR TAXES; WINNERS AND LOSERS FACE REAL ESTATE WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For investors in residential real estate, 1993 was a year of either good news 
or bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of lucky homeowners were able to refinance their mortgages at 
historically low interest rates, often cutting mortgage payments by thousands 
of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands of financially troubled borrowers walked away from homes 
that had declined in value. And scores more restructured loans or sold homes at 
steep losses, with the help of lenders that agreed to take less money than was 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Americans are preparing to file tax returns, all of these homeowners 
are likely to find themselves with tax woes on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
 If you lost a lot of money but still owe tax, you should probably consult a 
skilled tax adviser to consider strategies for your situation. 
</P>
<P>
 If you refinanced, you probably owe some federal income tax. If you suffered a 
foreclosure, you could owe a lot. Here's a question-and-answer guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Q Why would I owe more federal income tax after I refinanced? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Because you probably reduced your mortgage interest payments by a 
substantial sum. And few of the upfront costs, such as loan fees and "points," 
are tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Joe Homeowner, who traded in his $200,000 loan at 9% for a mortgage 
at a 7% fixed rate. He saves $3,337 annually in interest, which means he has 
$3,337 more in taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming he's in the 31% tax bracket, that means he'll pay $1,034 more in tax 
for 1993 than he did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What about the points and loan fees? I thought those were deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Loan fees on a refinance are not tax-deductible, nor do they reduce the tax 
basis (that's the cost for tax purposes) in your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Points, which are prepaid interest charges calculated as a percentage of your 
loan amount, are deductible. But they must be deducted over the life of the 
loan. In other words, if you got a 30-year mortgage and paid $3,000 in points, 
you could deduct $8.33 a month. That's $3,000 divided by 360 months. If you 
secured the loan in February, that means you'd get a 1993 deduction amounting 
to $91.63. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q I've refinanced three times in the past two years just because interest 
rates kept dropping. Now I'm completely confused about what to do about the 
points. Do I have to continue amortizing them over 30 years, or can I now write 
off the points on the first two refinances? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A You can write off the remaining points on the first two refinances, because 
once you refinanced again you ended the "life" of the previous loan. To 
illustrate, consider Sally Rateshopper, who paid $3,000 in points when 
refinancing her 30-year mortgage in January, 1992; $2,000 when she refinanced 
again in January, 1993, and another $2,000 on her final refinance in October. 
She deducted $100 of the points from the 1992 refinance on her 1992 tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 How much can she deduct in 1993? $4,917. 
</P>
<P>
 That's $2,900 in points remaining from the 1992 refinance; $2,000 from the 
early 1993 refinance, and 3/360ths of the $2,000 from the October, 1993, 
refinance ($16.67). (You're allowed to round off numbers to the nearest dollar 
on your tax return.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q The bank took my home in foreclosure last year, which was the worst 
experience of my life. How could that possibly land me a tax bill? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A If it was your first home, it wouldn't. However, if you had a gain in a 
previous residence that was "rolled" into this home, you may have triggered a 
big tax bill. That's because the IRS treats foreclosures as if they were home 
sales. The buyer is the lender; the price is considered to be the loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
 To show how that works out, consider someone who paid $400,000 for a home in 
1989 and has a $300,000 mortgage. He bought this house with the $150,000 profit 
he got from his previous house that he sold at the peak of the market. As far 
as tax authorities are concerned, the old $150,000 profit reduced this man's 
"tax basis" (cost) in his home to $250,000 ($400,000 minus $150,000). 
</P>
<P>
 The foreclosure triggered a "sale" at $300,000, which for tax purposes means 
he had a $50,000 taxable gain. Unless he buys another expensive house within 
the next two years, he'll have to pay roughly $14,000 in tax, assuming a 28% 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What happens if my lender just agreed to take less than what was owed? The 
house was worth less than I paid, and I couldn't make payments on the higher 
loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A You may have something called "cancellation of indebtedness income." If, for 
instance, you had a $200,000 loan and the lender reduced your loan amount to 
$150,000, you have a $50,000 canceled debt, which is taxable income as far as 
the IRS is concerned. About This Report

YOUR TAXES; FORGET-ME-NOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What are among the nation's most overlooked tax deductions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Child care credit. Some people think this credit is just for low-income 
families.It's not. If you pay for child care so that both parents can work, 
you're entitled to a credit equaling 20% to 30% of your child care expenses up 
to set amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parental support. Those who furnish more than half of the total support of a 
parent or other individual -- whether they're a child, in-law or friend -- can 
claim a personal exemption for that "dependent." However, make sure no one else 
is claiming the same dependent, or you could trigger an audit.  
</P>
<P>
 * Gambling losses. Unless you're a professional gambler, you can't deduct 
gambling losses. But if you had gambling winnings, you can reduce them by the 
value of all your lost bets in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 * DMV taxes. Only a small amount of your annual DMV registration cost is a 
non-deductible fee. The rest is a tax that can be deducted under "other taxes 
paid" on your itemized deduction form. 
</P>
<P>
 * Self-employed health insurance. Self-employed individuals can deduct up to 
25% of the cost of their 1993 health insurance premiums on their 1993 returns, 
subtracted directly from gross income. The on-again, off-again nature of this 
tax break causes many people to overlook it. About This Report

ASBESTOS ABATEMENT IS A QUAKE SIDE EFFECT AT NORTHRIDGE MALL; CLEANUP: THE 
TEMBLOR TRIGGERED AN ALL-OUT EFFORT TO RID THE CENTER OF THE CARCINOGENIC 
MATERIAL -- FALLEN OR STILL IN PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake, John Graham, vice president of 
property management at MEPC American Properties Inc., which owns the Northridge 
Fashion Center mall, made an urgent phone call from his Dallas office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to bet there's asbestos in there . . . on the floors" in the 
mall, Graham told Lou Magnifico, construction manager at Professional Service 
Industries Inc., an asbestos abatement contractor in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnifico hurried that day to the mall and took pictures of the heaps of 
fallen ceiling tiles and drywall. When Graham saw the photos, he spotted a 
telltale gray, fluffy-looking material amid the rubble and said, "Uh-oh." 
</P>
<P>
 And so began a multimillion-dollar asbestos cleanup and abatement effort at 
the Northridge mall, which is about a mile from the epicenter and by far the 
most heavily damaged shopping center from the quake. Two other shopping malls, 
Topanga Plaza in Woodland Hills and Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood, have also 
undergone asbestos cleanups since the temblor, although nothing like the 
undertaking at the Northridge mall, where the plan is to remove every bit of 
the cancer-causing substance -- even what was not dislodged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asbestos is an emotional subject," Graham acknowledged. Although asbestos is 
not considered to be a health hazard if it is properly maintained, "our 
corporate philosophy is just take it out." 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC, a subsidiary of British real estate concern MEPC PLC, purchased the 
Northridge Fashion Center in December as part of a $302-million acquisition of 
American holdings. Now MEPC is hoping to turn its bad luck into opportunity. 
When the mall reopens in July -- except for its six department stores, which 
will take longer to rebuild -- MEPC hopes to publicize the center's 
squeaky-clean condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos is present in more than half of all commercial and residential 
buildings 15 years old or older, authorities say, and in some newer buildings. 
Asbestos is resistant to heat and very durable, but in recent years it has been 
discovered that asbestos materials that are moved or broken may release 
microscopic fibers into the air. If inhaled, these fibers can cause lung 
disease and other cancers. The substance is considered to be inert, however, 
when left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In any building containing asbestos, experts say, it is necessary to test the 
air to see how many particles might have shaken free. Air pumps with filtering 
devices are used in the testing. If a high level of airborne asbestos is found, 
cleaning up the site may include misting to weigh down floating particles, 
wet-wiping hard surfaces and using big vacuums with special filters to trap the 
tiny fibers. Workers doing the cleanup must don protective clothes that 
resemble space suits, which are used once and discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes and other porous items from the stores being rid of asbestos will also 
be bagged and sent to asbestos-disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Things took an odd turn recently, when police investigated a report that 20 
members of an asbestos cleanup crew had walked off with asbestos-contaminated 
new clothing from the Sears outlet at the Northridge mall. No one was arrested, 
since taking items headed for a toxic-waste dump apparently is not a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, which owns the store, was responsible for the asbestos cleanup and had 
hired a crew from CST Environmental in Anaheim. Sage Khara, CST's president, 
said he was outraged by the "theft" of the clothes and fired those workers the 
same night. "It was a very devastating experience for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CST has also been doing emergency asbestos work for MEPC at most of the other 
Northridge mall stores. Graham said that CST has worked for his company five 
years, and has been reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, CST and other companies will bid on a new asbestos cleanup contract 
at the Northridge mall. Meanwhile, security guards are charged with ensuring 
that nothing is taken from stores during the cleanup. "We made it clear to CST 
that heads will roll if it happens with us," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos shaken loose in the quake has been a bigger problem at shopping malls 
than at other large commercial structures in the Valley. Most of the office and 
industrial buildings with the worst quake damage were made of concrete slabs, 
without asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many office buildings old enough to have contained asbestos -- say, some 
of those along Ventura Boulevard, built in the 1960s and 1970s -- had been rid 
of the substance before the quake. "There is not nearly as much asbestos in the 
Valley as there was five years ago," said Seth Dudley, senior vice president at 
real estate brokerage Julien J. Studley Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, asbestos abatement contractors have been busy since the quake. 
Asbestos cleanups have also been done at Cal State Northridge, a Kaiser 
Permanente medical building in Granada Hills and the County Courthouse in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Fashion Center, Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza were built in the 
'60s and early '70s, when asbestos was commonly used for fireproofing and 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The malls had done some asbestos abatement in the past, as tenants moved out, 
but a comprehensive asbestos-removal project would have meant closing the malls 
temporarily. Until the earthquake, there was no compelling reason to remove 
asbestos that was safely contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza will have some asbestos remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 David Reed, director of facilities services at CenterMark Properties, owner of 
Topanga Plaza, said that over the years, asbestos had been removed from 75% of 
the mall and all common areas. About 16 shops were contaminated when the 
earthquake dislodged ceiling tiles, exposing sprayed-on asbestos behind them, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total Topanga Plaza asbestos cleanup and abatement is estimated to have 
cost less than $250,000. Some shops will still have asbestos, Reed said, but it 
will be properly maintained and the air in the stores will be monitored for 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Laurel Plaza, some asbestos that had been sprayed in ceilings and walls was 
released by the quake and subsequent repair work. The asbestos cleanup will 
probably be completed this week, General Manager Brian Pearson said. When the 
mall reopens April 15, about 80% of the asbestos will have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason for concern," Pearson said. "We are following the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lange, hazardous materials coordinator at Los Angeles property 
management company Shuwa Management, said that leaving old asbestos in place is 
"absolutely safe, as long as there's correct air monitoring." And Dudley does 
not believe asbestos will detract from property values. "Even in high 
rise-office buildings with asbestos, I haven't seen a significant effect on 
rental rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northridge Fashion Center owner MEPC is doing a full abatement anyway, at 
a cost expected to run to "seven figures," according to MEPC President David 
Gruber. MEPC is expecting part of that expense to be covered by its earthquake 
insurance, although it is still negotiating with the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 store sites and some common areas of the Northridge mall have 
asbestos that was sprayed onto the structural steel. The day after the 
earthquake, 100 workers began sweeping the mall corridors from one end to the 
other and bagging anything suspected of being hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews began monitoring the air in the mall and sealing off tenant spaces. 
On the thick plastic placed over the shops with asbestos, the word HOT was 
spray-painted in red. MEPC plans to clean 15 feet into stores that don't have 
asbestos, in case fibers drifted into them. Merchandise with hard surfaces, 
such as jewelry, also is being cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC expects to complete the removal project by May 1. Until then, floors are 
vacuumed each morning. Asbestos workers in contaminated areas wear respirators 
and the protective suits. They pass through mobile chambers where they remove 
the suits and bag them for disposal, then shower and change.

CLINTON ADVISER IS REPORTEDLY FAVORED FOR FED POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House economist Alan Blinder is likely to be nominated as vice chairman 
of the Federal Reserve Board, a senior Clinton Administration official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Blinder is "the strong 
front-runner," with the support of President Clinton's advisers. Clinton could 
make his final decision on the recommendation as early as this week, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approval is expected, the official said. Another official, not 
directly involved in the selection process, said a routine FBI background check 
may be the only thing standing in the way of Blinder's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder was a respected economist at Princeton University before joining the 
Administration last year as one of three members of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his teaching duties, Blinder wrote a regular column for 
Business Week magazine. He once characterized himself as an "inflation dove" 
and holds views that make him appear less hard-line in fighting inflation than 
some current Republican-appointed Fed members. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder would be Clinton's first Fed nominee. The vacancy was created when 
David Mullins, appointed by then-President George Bush, unexpectedly announced 
his resignation Feb. 1 to join a private investment management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the vice chairman's post, Clinton must fill another position on 
the seven-member board that was created when Wayne Angell left recently after 
his term expired. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the names most often mentioned to fill the Angell vacancy is George L. 
Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, but the senior official said 
the White House was not as close to naming someone to fill Angell's seat. It 
was unclear whether Perry was still in the running or whether he would accept a 
spot on the board if he was passed over for the more prestigious position of 
vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Fed nominees must be approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that the person Clinton names to the vice chairman's job 
would have to be considered a top candidate for the post of chairman when Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's term ends in 1996.

U.S. WARNS FRANCE ON BLOCKING FISH EXPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States warned Paris on Monday to stop blocking its fish exports, 
raising fears of a tit-for-tat strike against French wine and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says it has yet to decide what French products to 
attack if the fish standoff is not resolved, but wine and cheese were reported 
high on the list, and action was expected to come sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 The food fight erupted early in February when France began restricting a range 
of foreign fish, leaving it to rot on the docks to appease French fishermen 
leery of cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to allow this to continue," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor vowed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what retaliatory steps he planned, Kantor told reporters, "We have a 
number of ways to pursue that." 
</P>
<P>
 While the fish dispute is new, it fits a long pattern of U.S.-French farm 
friction that runs from beef to oil seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor refused to say what strikes he plans. But other trade officials would 
not rule out the possibility that he will soon slap back well beyond the fish 
arena, including wine and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. industry official said American fishermen are preparing to protest in 
the capital -- following the example of the French -- and that Washington had 
already told Paris that the most prized of French foods might soon feel the 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retaliation is under active consideration. Both cheese and wine have been 
mentioned as possible targets," an official at the National Fisheries Institute 
said.

PERSONAL HEALTH; THERAPISTS MUST HONOR BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost anyone would agree that when a psychiatrist or psychologist becomes 
sexually intimate with a patient, the relationship has become too close. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the mental health professional -- the psychotherapist, the social 
worker, the family counselor -- who brews coffee for a patient? 
</P>
<P>
 What about the therapist who sets two patients up on a blind date? 
</P>
<P>
 Or the shrink, male or female, whose attire is just too seductive for office 
hours? 
</P>
<P>
 A recent article in "Harvard Women's Health Watch," the newest periodical from 
Harvard Medical School, addresses the sensitive issue of "boundary crossings" 
in the therapeutic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning signals that a therapist may be trying to exert too great an influence 
include telling a patient not to discuss his or her therapy with anyone else 
or, worse, insisting that the treatment be kept a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should also be wary of a therapist who advises severing ties with 
family or friends, demands absolute trust, offers to protect a patient from 
"the outside world" or threatens to "expose" a patient to family, friends or 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely does the patient-therapist relationship move from talk to sexual 
action. But if this does happen, a complaint to the state licensing board is 
definitely in order. California is among a handful of states where sexual 
contact between a therapist and a patient is a crime. ELIZABETH MEHREN

TO HEAL A NATION; AS HEAD OF CDC, DR. DAVID SATCHER TAKES A HOLISTIC VIEW. 
ALTHOUGH HEALTHY MINDS IN FIT BODIES ARE IMPORTANT, HE KNOWS FIRSTHAND THAT WE 
MUST ALSO CURE SOCIAL ILLS -- INCLUDING VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two memories, like freeze-frames in time, re main with David Satcher from the 
twilight of his near-death half a century ago and have defined much of his 
life: 
</P>
<P>
 He is 2 years old and suffering from a severe case of whooping cough. His 
parents are told that he will not survive the week.  
</P>
<P>
 Even at such a young age, he remembers a desperate, searing struggle for air. 
"You never forget that," he says today, very softly. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors come, dozens of them, to gather on the front porch of the 
Satcher home in rural Anniston, Ala. They are there to comfort the family of a 
dying child.  
</P>
<P>
 "They came to be supportive," he recalls. "They didn't have any medical 
expertise. They were there because a family was about to lose a child." 
</P>
<P>
 His was an extraordinary recovery, due to the efforts of a local doctor -- the 
only black physician in the area and the only physician willing to travel to 
the Satcher home -- and to those of his mother, Anna, who struggled mightily to 
keep her young son alive. In the years that followed, she recounted the story 
for him again and again: How he refused to die, despite the doctor's dire 
prediction. How, in the segregated Alabama of the 1940s, one physician 
responded when no one else would.  
</P>
<P>
 The experience inspired Satcher's decision, at age 8, to make medicine his 
calling. Like the doctor who helped save him, Satcher would help others without 
adequate medical care. Moreover, his near-death from a disease that today is 
preventable by immunization only heightened that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my whole life -- what I've experienced personally," Satcher says. 
"It makes me what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly surprising, then, that Satcher intends to apply many of those 
same ideals in his new role as director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.  
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous examples from Satcher's past to demonstrate his commitment 
-- delivering care to the poor in Watts and migrants in Upstate New York or, as 
president of Nashville's Meharry Medical College, bucking Establishment 
academia to ensure that black students had the same academic opportunities as 
their white counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, he served as interim dean at Charles R. Drew Postgraduate 
Medical School and chairman of its family medicine department.  
</P>
<P>
 While at Drew, he created a program with UCLA in which medical students would 
study for two years at UCLA and two at Drew, where they would then provide 
medical care to Watts residents. And by 1974, he established a free clinic in 
the basement of the Second Baptist Church, where he was a member, and became 
its medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 During his time in Los Angeles, he also worked in the Martin Luther King Jr. 
General Hospital and directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Center. In addition, he 
taught and worked at UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most impressive things about Dave is that he always keeps his 
sights on the needs of the most vulnerable members of our society, particularly 
minorities, the poor, women and children," says Dr. Marc Rivo, a friend who has 
worked with Satcher on health reform and professional medical issues during the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every policy decision he makes factors that into it -- it's not just a 
rhetorical position for him," says Rivo, who directs the division of medicine 
in the bureau of health professions in the Health Resources and Services 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Satcher, 52, a tall man with salt-and-pepper hair and a matching beard, is 
thoughtful, deliberate and soft-spoken. But he is also an imposing figure who 
emanates a kind of presence.  
</P>
<P>
 He was one of nine children born to self-taught farmers whose formal education 
did not extend beyond elementary school. All were delivered at home by a 
midwife -- an old-fashioned midwife, he is quick to point out, "not a nurse 
midwife." Two of the children who came before him died -- one at birth, the 
second within the first week. His parents also adopted a 10th -- the child of a 
relative who had gotten into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have come from a poor family economically, but they were not poor in 
spirit," Satcher says. "We had a rich environment from the spirit of my 
parents, both of whom had a vision for their children. They didn't keep us out 
of school working in the fields. They made it clear that school came first, and 
that teachers were heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents had no money to send him to college. Satcher received scholarships 
and worked lots of jobs and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Morehouse College, 
where Satcher's son, Daraka, 19, is a student. (Satcher and his wife, Nola, a 
poet, have three other children: Gretchen, 25, a graduate student at USC; 
David, 23, a student at the University of Texas, El Paso, and Daryl, 17, a high 
school junior.) 
</P>
<P>
 Satcher received both his medical degree and doctorate degree in cytogenetics 
at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where he was elected to Alpha 
Omega Alpha honor medical society.  
</P>
<P>
 As president of Meharry -- the post he held just before coming to CDC -- he 
came up with a plan to save both his school and a failing municipal hospital in 
Nashville. The two would be merged, in effect making the city hospital the 
teaching center for Meharry students. The proposal was controversial because 
black doctors would be caring for mostly white patients. But the plan -- which 
Satcher says evoked a "community debate that spanned several years and resulted 
in a coalition of support which cut across all racial, ethnic and economic 
levels" -- worked, saving both the hospital and the school. 
</P>
<P>
 He was no stranger to such conflict.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a medical student in Cleveland, during my first rotation as a student in 
the ward, one of my first patients was a white man from Mississippi. When his 
family found out I was black, they got him out of the hospital." He pauses, and 
smiles. "I wasn't fazed. There were some advantages to having grown up in 
Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Meharry, he pushed to move the educational setting from the hospital 
into the community. "He received funding from us to relocate their family 
medicine training program into a public housing project, directly into a 
community health center that was on site," Rivo recalls. "We gave him the seed 
money and he arranged the linkage with the United Neighborhood Health Center -- 
and family medicine residents are now providing regular care in that 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivo pauses. "One thing is real clear: he is in his element when he's out in 
the community," Rivo says. "He's one of those people who has the ability to 
carry himself in a way that brings respect and admiration -- whether he's at a 
meeting of medical school deans or hospital execs, or out in public housing. He 
connects with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Satcher also decided that Meharry would admit students who scored lower on 
admission tests than their white counterparts -- and, in 1982, the school was 
in danger of losing accreditation because of this. Again, his instincts proved 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "At any level, most black students score lower on all standardized tests," 
Satcher says. "Meharry tried to work with that knowledge. We took students no 
other medical schools would take, students that others had given up on. We 
said: No student will be allowed to graduate without passing both parts of the 
national boards. Will you let us take who we want? That meant we had to get 
them ready. By 1991, 94% of those who entered, graduated." 
</P>
<P>
 The school did not lose its accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meharry took them, believing there was nothing more important we could do 
than develop people," he says. "Many of those students are now full professors 
at those medical schools where they were turned down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In taking charge at CDC, Satcher faces a formidable task -- that of 
revitalizing a demoralized agency that has become politicized and fragmented in 
recent years over how best to deal with some of the more controversial public 
health issues: AIDS, abortion and violence, for example. Satcher also has the 
job of steering CDC back to its original mission: preserving the public health 
through global surveillance by identifying and tracking diseases before they 
get out of hand, as well as prevention and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Satcher has a tremendous challenge in convincing the American public of 
the appropriateness of linking public health and social problems -- and in 
revitalizing an agency that has not seen inspiring leadership for some time," 
says Jeff Levi of the AIDS Action Council Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are good people there who have become demoralized. And there is also a 
generation of people who entered the system without being exposed to the 
positive philosophy of CDC's mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Satcher's bosses clearly think he's up to it. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala interrupted a recent a meeting with several members of 
her staff to rave to a reporter about the man she describes as "one of the 
great catches of the Clinton Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider CDC one of the jewels in our crown, and he's the right person at 
the right time," she says. "We were very anxious to get him. He's got 
first-class credentials. He is a physician and a leader in health, and he has 
particular concerns about prevention and minority health, which is of great 
concern to this department." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Satcher's direction seems resolute. He wants to return the 
agency -- with its 6,800 employees and $2 billion budget -- to its original 
mission, keeping politics out of it, and broaden CDC's scope in the way it 
defines public health. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, "we are going to follow the science," he says, citing the 
agency's recently released AIDS education campaign promoting condom use as an 
example. "There are people in this country who disagree with this, saying the 
best way to keep from getting AIDS is to refrain from having sex. But the 
science told us that people between the ages of 18 and 25 are very active 
sexually. What does that tell us? We've got to prevent the spread of AIDS. So 
we'll follow the science." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of widening the agency's reach, he regards violence as a pressing 
public health issue because it is killing people as swiftly as any deadly virus 
or bacterium. The subject is not a new one for CDC -- the agency has been 
working on violence for some years -- but it has been overshadowed by other 
issues. Having Satcher embrace it so publicly -- and place it so high on CDC's 
agenda -- will undoubtedly give a needed boost and more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence is a global issue and we are a Third World country when it comes to 
violence," he says. "We at CDC believe violence is a public health problem, and 
that we can prevent a lot of it by educating people about firearms," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared, and they think the way to protect themselves is to get a 
gun. That's ridiculous. Our easy access to guns is what distinguishes this 
country from other countries, especially for children. (When) we grew up, we 
fought -- but nobody got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 It is at this point that Satcher evokes the vision of his childhood neighbors 
who came to support his parents as he lay near death. It is this strong sense 
of community embodied in the vision of the townsfolk who rallied around his 
parents that Satcher thinks is missing from much of America today -- a loss, he 
believes, that lies at the root of some of the country's most disturbing social 
ills, including its public health failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to us?" he asks. "We've lost that community. That's why 
kids join gangs -- to try to have a family, a community."

FROM FITNESS FAN TO SURE SLOTH; MANY EX-HARD BODIES ARE NO LONGER HOISTING THE

 Two years ago, Dr. Mark Aranbasich was the poster guy for healthy living. He 
worked out four or five times a week, took aerobics classes, lifted weights and 
didn't let too much fat creep into his diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Then "It" happened. He stopped working out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could say that it was because I was injured or I attained my fitness 
goal," says the Los Angeles dentist, "but it was just a matter of laziness. 
Once you've fallen out, it's hard to get back into the swing of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent lifestyle surveys suggest that Americans have been slowly backsliding 
on their health regimens -- eating more junk food, smoking more, exercising 
less -- despite an almost daily assault of information about the benefits of 
good nutrition and moderate exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll of 1,250 adults for Prevention magazine found a 5% rise in the number 
of smokers from 1991 to 1992. And in an American Dietetic Assn. survey of 1,000 
adults last year, 39% of respondents said they were "doing everything they 
could" to eat a healthy diet. The year before, 44% said they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in body-fat-obsessed Los Angeles, where most gyms are packed during the 6 
p.m. crunch, we've been slipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich mashed potatoes and artery-clogging goose liver pate are what diners 
hunger for, says chef Joachim Splichal of Patina and Pinot Bistro restaurants. 
Although his lower-fat spa dishes satisfy the lunch crowd, dinner is another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ordering more mashed potatoes, double orders of mashed potatoes, 
and it seems as if we're selling a little more foie gras than the year before," 
he says. "A few years ago, a five-course menu was impossible to sell. Now, 
people are really indulging themselves in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Splichal hesitates to suggest that this binge has reached trend status: "It's 
too early for me to say that -- we've just started the new year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah yes, the New Year, when resolutions are made and broken. But resolutions 
are remade all year long and re-broken in a predictable pattern of being 
good/being bad. We wake up at 5 a.m. to exercise and eat steamed vegetables 
until we've had enough personal sacrifice, thank you, and then it's back to 
sleeping in and inhaling chocolate chunk cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal trainer Adrienne Williams knows the mind set behind the 
healthy-unhealthy roller coaster. First come the excuses, then the missed 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense it when their enthusiasm starts waning and work starts to take 
precedence," she says. "Or they'll say they're not feeling too well, and before 
they'd go even if they weren't feeling well. They don't pull out for good 
reasons -- it's never because great things are happening, but because money's 
too tight or something bad's happened. One client said she'd been eating and 
drinking so much that she wasn't fit enough to get back into the gym, which is 
kind of ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams won't shake a finger at anyone, because she's been through 
slack-off stages, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's all interconnected with the ebbs and flows of energy, and mental 
strain that produces these types of effects," she says. "At different times in 
our lives we need more or less exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 She also believes that society endorses inactivity via media messages: "Read 
this, watch this, come to the movies -- it's easy to let yourself slip into 
that." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When burnout -- or just plain inertia -- hits, it can produce intense guilt 
feelings, coupled with rationalizations: My job is so tough I'm too exhausted 
to go to the gym; I've been working out a lot lately, I deserve a break. And so 
on. The mental gymnastics can be as exhausting as an hour of aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say exactly what made me stop going," says Aranbasich, the 
dentist. "Burnout . . . there were some things going on in my personal life 
that were taking my up attention. Between those two, that was enough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was an exercise die-hard for six years before getting off the treadmill two 
years ago, easing up on a fairly strict low-fat diet and gaining 15 pounds. 
("But I haven't ballooned out or anything," Aranbasich says.) Forays to the gym 
have been sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having that routine made it easier to follow through on other 
routines," he says. "My life used to be more regimented -- every Friday I'd 
bring my clothes into the cleaners. I still get things done, but thinking back 
on it, my life was really together." 
</P>
<P>
 But on the flip side, too much structure began to wear him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go to the gym, be there for two hours, get home at 8:30, eat dinner and 
go to bed. I thought, 'I'm spending so much time doing this, what other things 
could I be doing rather than devoting so much time to this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Job pressures, money worries and relationship problems cause enormous stress, 
which can trigger episodes of self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have to fight traffic for two hours a day, (and) they may 
have pressures at work, people telling them what to do," says Dr. Gail Frank, 
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn., epidemiologist and professor of 
nutrition at California State University, Long Beach. "And when it comes to 
food, they say, 'Listen, I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm at lunch, this 
is my break time, and I'm going to do what makes me feel good.' I believe it's 
sort of a sign of the times. This is one way of having control when so many 
things are under the control of someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just plain burnout that finally got to "Jerry" (whose name has been 
changed to protect the guilt-ridden) when he stopped his intense workouts cold 
turkey four years ago. But the 39-year-old, who works in TV production, still 
has to deal with his friends' shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still run into people who say, 'I can't believe you're not going to the 
gym!' And this was a good one: 'You were our inspiration!' Yeah, thanks. And 
now I'm going to be a slug like the rest of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry's workouts were strenuous: Three hours a day, six days a week of stomach 
work, stretching and weightlifting. That routine went on for seven years. The 
last year he tacked on 1 1/2-hour ballet classes four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where that energy came from," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever it came from, one day it just went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the gym and I had really just had it," he recalled of the fateful 
day. "It had been building up, but basically everybody was annoying, and it was 
becoming more and more a chore to go, and it was getting more crowded. And then 
this steroid freak screamed at me, accusing me of leaving my sweat on the 
bench, and I thought, 'Do I really need this in my life?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for the dreaded guilt monster to strike -- it still 
does, Jerry admits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a little midriff bulge and my butt's starting to sag," he says, 
betraying a hint of sadness. "It was always an effort to do it. But now I don't 
have the sense of accomplishment that I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Will there come a day when he ventures back among the few, the proud, the 
buffed? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I won't," he says without hesitation. "I just can't see myself doing 
it. . . . There would be mornings when I'd do a couple of sit-ups and keep that 
going for a week or two, but then I'd forget about it. I don't know, maybe I'll 
get a Nordic Track. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trainer Williams has seen gung-ho clients metamorphose into sprouting couch 
potatoes. "They get into a workout, they see results, and then pressures come 
on. But once they stop, they think it's really going to be hard to get back 
into it. So they get depressed, they may eat more, take up smoking, drinking 
more often, and they get into a bad cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 But others do manage to work their way out of slothdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia (who requested that her last name not be used) recently started back 
on a three-day-a-week program after knocking off for six months, during which 
she battled remorse and a 40-pound weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her downfall started when she opened an advertising company, which propelled 
her from manageable 11-hour work days into killer 15- and 16-hour days. Then 
she began daily psychotherapy sessions, cutting out her workouts altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of feeling almost self-destructive," she admits. "I knew I wasn't 
doing anything for me, and this was the one healthy thing I did. When I was 
working out I had dropped 20 pounds, and when I stopped I put on 40. I made 
food my little comfort zone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Georgia's trainer didn't want to forever lose a client to the black hole 
of workaholism and Haagen-Dazs Triple Brownie Overload. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept calling me. She was cool about it -- we're friends," Georgia, in her 
early 40s, explains. "She'd say, 'How's it going? Finally we went out for 
breakfast, and I said, 'If you think I'm going to be back working out with you, 
you're wrong. I don't see how I'm going to be able to do it.' She didn't press 
it at all. But then I started thinking, 'Well, how can I fit it in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia finally managed to squeeze in the appointments. "If I can work it into 
my life, anybody can."

TOP PRIORITIES: PREVENTION, EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. David Satcher, new director for the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, has four priorities: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, he wants to strengthen the agency's core public health functions -- 
the kinds of activities that are largely invisible until they fail -- that is, 
when there is an outbreak of food poisoning, or contaminated water makes people 
sick or some new mysterious illness gets a grip on the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the nation has really supported these functions because nobody 
gets excited about the fact that you prevented somebody from dying," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * He wants to increase the focus on urgent threats to health, including 
emerging or re-emerging infections such as tuberculosis, by beefing up global 
surveillance and tracking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a global agency," he says. "Viruses and bacteria don't respect 
borders. They don't need passports or visas." 
</P>
<P>
 * He seeks more attention on prevention -- in programs to prevent the spread 
of AIDS, for example, and in widespread immunization programs to protect 
children from preventable diseases, and in programs to encourage Americans to 
exercise more. He expects the agency to work closely with states, local 
governments and the private sector to establish prevention programs and 
incentives to practice preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "One-half to two-thirds of deaths in this country every year are preventable," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * He hopes to steer the agency to a new emphasis on women's health, which he 
describes as "an area of neglect," through prevention and education. He 
includes workplace and domestic violence against women as part of this package, 
as well as more education and prevention programs for sexually transmitted 
diseases, and breast and cervical cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of this agenda comes as a result of his personal and 
professional experiences, there is more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've called these evolving priorities," he says. "They come from a 
combination of my personal background and CDC's background, coming to 
understand CDC's history and its strengths and weaknesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of listening since I've been at CDC. I've had a lot of 
briefings. And I've read the history of CDC more than once. These priorities 
are not just what I am, but what CDC is."

PUTTING IN A GOOD WORLD FOR O.C.; PROTOCOL FOUNDATION, WHICH PROMOTES ORANGE 
COUNTY, HONORS L.A. AND SAN FRANCISCO CONSULAR CORPS WITH A GALA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 400 guests, including consuls general representing more than 40 foreign 
countries, came together for what has become a kind of miniature United Nations 
-- the 10th Anniversary International Protocol Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Visitors and Protocol Foundation of Orange County staged the 
worldly gala Saturday at the Newport Beach Marriott to salute the consular 
corps of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The $150-per-person gala was expected 
to net more than $50,000 for the foundation, which promotes Orange County 
around the world. Peaceful Coexistence 
</P>
<P>
 The consuls general, representing the People's Republic of China, Switzerland, 
Britain, Japan, Germany, South Africa and other foreign nations, mingled at a 
champagne reception in a salon decorated with the flags of their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get along beautifully. All is at peace here," said Eva Schneider, deputy 
chief of protocol, who attended with her husband Fred. "You would never know 
that there are wars" going on in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 For event organizers, staging the ball requires much diplomatic skill to make 
sure all of the dignitaries feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a great deal of thought and time to seat them correctly and 
introduce them correctly," said Jerrel Richards, president of the protocol 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with protocol, each member of the consular corps was introduced by 
master of ceremonies Erich Vollmer before the dinner and escorted into the 
ballroom by a U.S. Marine carrying that country's flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests sat at tables adorned with sparkling golden globes topped with white 
doves -- a tribute to the gala's theme of international harmony. Dinner 
included consomme de polard, a salad of exotic greens with jumbo prawns and an 
entree duet of filet mignon and salmon on a bed of dill sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert was served with pomp and circumstance befitting the occasion. The 
lights were lowered, and six waiters carried out trays of baked Alaska 
illuminated by glowing light sticks and surrounded by a mist made from dry ice. 
As the desserts were presented, the Gary Tole Orchestra played "It's a Small 
World." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a celebration of friendship," said Eve Foussard, ball chairwoman. 
Citizen Diplomats 
</P>
<P>
 The protocol foundation was founded 10 years ago to foster business 
relationships between Orange County and the rest of the world. Last year the 
foundation hosted 290 dignitaries from 56 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Orange County is) the 26th economic unit in the world -- the focus is on us 
internationally," said Richards, who as a citizen diplomat has entertained a 
crown prince in his home and escorted the vice president of Argentina around 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the cutting edge of a county (conducting) international relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Harriett Wieder received the Citizen Diplomat Award 
from Richards for starting the protocol office and foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 40% of Orange County (companies) doing business overseas. Don't you 
think it's time we grow up?" Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The office introduces dignitaries to the county and helps local businesses 
arrange contacts with international companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very helpful," said Kurt Welte, Swiss consul general and acting 
dean of the consular corps. "We know where to go to make that first contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Gayle Anderson, chief of protocol; Annemaria Ballin, 
first president of the Protocol Foundation; Carl and Pat Neisser, vice 
president of the foundation; Zee Allred, Thomas and Margie Gephart, Dan and 
Carole Green, Sir Eldon and Lady Betty Griffiths, Jerry Harrington, Joe and 
Ethel Hunt, Dennis Ku, Gerald and Shana Larsen, Bee Lavery and William Murphy, 
Bob and Patricia Marshall, Len and Mary Ann Miller, Irving and Julia Rappaport, 
Elaine Redfield, Gail Robson, Wolf and Ann Stern, Jim and Mary Thompson and 
Sultan Hadji Amirullah Sy Mangelen. KATHRYN BOLD

 If you want to cut the risk of corneal damage by up to 74%, remove your 
contact lenses before going to sleep. Johns Hopkins University researcher 
Oliver Schein says sleeping with contact lenses is the leading culprit for 
ulcerative keratitis, a condition caused by an infection with bacteria or other 
germs. It produces a destructive inflammation of the cornea. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by Schein and other researchers showed that users of disposable soft 
contact lenses, which can be worn for up to two weeks without removal, were 13 
times more likely to suffer ulcerative keratitis than those who removed their 
soft contacts regularly for cleaning. But when researchers adjusted for 
overnight wear, the risk of developing ulcerative keratitis with disposables 
dropped to three times higher than other lenses. "The main point is that most 
of the risk is due to overnight wear, not lens type," Schein said.

 Wait and See: Surgery to relieve trouble caused by an enlarged prostate is 
done too often and treatment instead should be determined by the patient's 
level of discomfort, according to the Agency for Health Care Policy and 
Research. Often, the best treatment is to just monitor the condition, the 
government panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watchful waiting is not the same as benign neglect," said panel chairman John 
D. McConnell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 According to guidelines issued recently by the group of specialists, some 
patients are routinely treated with surgery when less intense therapies could 
relieve their symptoms. The panel recommended strongly that in any cases where 
the patient is not especially troubled by symptoms, treatment be postponed 
indefinitely and a period of "watchful waiting" be instituted.

ABC'S RESPONSE TO 'ROSEANNE' EPISODE: THE KISS IS STILL A KISS; TELEVISION: 
SITCOM EXPLORES SEXUALITY, BUT NETWORK EXECS THINK TWO WOMEN'S EMBRACE IS 
INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. WHAT WILL AIR TONIGHT REMAINS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fresh-faced Roseanne Arnold beams at readers in a full-page TV Guide ad this 
week touting a "very special must-see episode" of her high-rated "Roseanne" in 
its regular 9 p.m. slot tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 But what viewers will see tonight in the "must see" episode was still unclear 
Monday at ABC, where the installment has been the source of bitter 
finger-pointing and heated words for several weeks between network executives 
and the show's executive producers, Roseanne and Tom Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 And through much of the controversy -- in which the Arnolds have been accused 
by industry insiders of staging yet another of their infamous publicity stunts 
and the network has been charged by advertising executives with shamelessly 
hyping one of its shows to get higher ratings during sweeps -- Roseanne 
Arnold's expression has been far from beaming. The debate is the latest chapter 
in the widening rift between ABC and one of its most popular stars. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the episode is a kiss in a gay bar between Arnold's character, 
Roseanne Conner, and a new character named Sharon (guest star Mariel 
Hemingway), a stripper who is the lover of Roseanne's gay friend, Nancy (Sandra 
Bernhard). The kiss lasts about five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold has complained for weeks that ABC has balked at showing the kiss, 
even though, in a rough cut of the show made available to The Times, lip 
contact is obscured because of the camera angle. Executives, he said, felt the 
moment was inappropriate for a prime-time situation comedy that is likely to be 
seen by many children. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold argued that the kiss is presented tastefully, and that the dispute has 
overshadowed the real point of the episode -- that Roseanne, who has gay 
friends but has never questioned her own sexuality, finds out that she was more 
intrigued by the encounter than she would have expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "ABC has been so cool with us for six years, and then this comes up," Arnold 
said last week. "There seems to be no one in charge there, no set of rules. You 
can have nudity on shows like 'NYPD Blue,' you can show a woman getting beat 
up, but for a woman to be kissed by another woman is too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold added, "It's not like they're tonguing each other. My whole thing 
wasn't about showing the kiss. It's about Roseanne's response to it. Her 
reaction is one of the funniest things she's ever done. It's like a 'Lucy' 
moment. We're not trying to be lurid. We're not selling out our gay 
characters." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while executives at the network, including ABC Television Group 
President Robert Iger and ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert, approved the 
kiss after viewing the episode, Steve A. Weiswasser, president of Capital 
Cities/ABC Multimedia Group, has told him repeatedly that the kiss will not be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that kids who watch the kiss think it will be OK for people of the 
same sex to kiss each other," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC executives would not comment officially on the episode or on the Arnolds' 
complaints, other than to say that the matter "is being discussed." Regardless 
of how the episode is edited, the network said it will carry a disclaimer 
advising parental discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor apparently has not scared away sponsors for the popular series. ABC 
said all advertising time for the episode was sold at its usual rate, which has 
been estimated at $300,000 per 30-second spot. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last week, there was speculation in New York advertising circles 
that the controversy was ABC's attempt to heighten interest in the episode, 
which is competing against the Grammy Awards on CBS. "There's a lot of 
speculation about ABC just wanting to hype this show," one agency executive 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Network concern over the depiction of gay behavior on prime-time shows is not 
new. In 1989, two male characters on ABC's "thirtysomething" were shown talking 
in bed after having sex, and advertisers largely declined to purchase time on 
the show. ABC said the sponsor defection cost the network more than $1 million, 
and it omitted the episode during summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a bisexual attorney played by Amanda Donahue gave a female co-worker 
a good-night kiss on NBC's "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 But rarely has affection between the same sexes been displayed so openly on a 
prime-time network comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold said he and the show's co-executive producer, Rob Ulin, came up 
with the idea for the episode several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gay characters on the show, and we were thinking, 'What else can we 
do with them besides jokes?' " Arnold said. "We wanted to develop storylines 
with these characters. We also wanted to show Roseanne thinking she was so 
cool, then put her in a situation where she finds out she's not as cool as she 
thinks. We wanted to show a crack in her." 
</P>
<P>
 But the network was not as pleased with the show's content, Arnold said. 
Executives sent back several notes on the scripts, stipulating that the network 
would not show an episode that depicted two women kissing. The original script 
also had another kiss at the end of the show in which Roseanne's sister, 
Jackie, who has been teasing Roseanne about her reaction to Sharon's kiss, gets 
kissed by Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The network is always rejecting things we write, but then we always come back 
and show them we can do it in good taste," Arnold said. "We've done that time 
and time again." But he agreed to cut the second kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said the kiss was shot from four different angles, including a view 
from behind Sharon's head that highlights Roseanne's startled reaction: "We 
felt this was the most appropriate way -- it was the safest kiss possible while 
still being a kiss. It was important to get Roseanne's reaction immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The show also contains other potentially explosive elements. There are jokes 
about vibrators and pierced nipples. Roseanne flirts with a female bartender, 
and several couples in the bar are shown being affectionate. Later in the 
episode, Roseanne's husband, Dan (John Goodman), gets aroused when Roseanne 
tells him about the encounter in a post-coital conversation in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kiss is the only aspect that has the network up in arms, said Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate comes at a time when relations between the Arnolds and ABC have 
been increasingly strained. Tom Arnold said there was still bitterness because 
of the network's cancellation last year of his "The Jackie Thomas Show." And 
Roseanne Arnold said last week that she had not signed a new agreement with ABC 
or the show's producers, the Carsey-Werner Co., for the renewal of "Roseanne" 
for three more seasons, despite an earlier announcement by ABC and 
Carsey-Werner.

GERMANY'S SCREEN DATE WITH ITS PAST; MOVIES: PRE-RELEASE COMMENT ON 
'SCHINDLER'S LIST' HAS BEEN POSITIVE. SOME HOPE THE FILM WILL BE AN 
'EYE-OPENER' FOR GERMAN YOUTH.

<P>
 Germany's President Richard von Weizsaecker has an important date at the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight in Frankfurt, he will meet Steven Spielberg at the invitation-only 
premiere of the director's Oscar-nominated Holocaust drama, "Schindler's List." 
The movie, opening in Germany on Thursday, already has generated tremendous 
pre-release buzz with an outpouring of media attention and overwhelmingly 
positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a real-life backdrop of resurgent neo-Nazism throughout Germany, Von 
Weizsaecker's presence at the benefit screening -- which will raise money for 
the preservation of Auschwitz as a memorial -- is meant to send a resounding 
message to the German people to take a hard look at their dark history. 
</P>
<P>
 A Von Weizsaecker aide said the president "wants his presence to signal to 
others that this (movie) is really more than just a product. . . . It engages 
the public to work on our own past. This is another opportunity for Germans to 
be confronted with our own history and the history of Europe, and, starting 
from that point, to try to face the present task, which you can only do if you 
really know the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Weizsaecker has been forthright in condemning the rising neo-Nazi 
activities while, conversely, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been criticized 
at times both in Germany and abroad for not taking a harder line against 
neo-Nazi attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List's" overseas distributor, the London-based United 
International Pictures, says that initial market research indicates a high 
percentage of the German public is ready to see a film that confronts the 
horrors of their country's past. Hy Smith, UIP's senior vice president of 
international marketing, says research shows 41% of the moviegoing population 
in Germany is aware of "Schindler's List" and 34% have a "definite interest" in 
seeing the picture. Smith claims the results are "impressive," relative to the 
German movie market, especially since they predated any television or print 
advertising, which only began late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the film's success in the United States, UIP has decided to release the 
movie on more screens in Germany than originally planned. It will open in key 
cities with approximately 35 prints; within a week it will expand to around 200 
theaters, a major release for an "up market" film of this kind in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal told The Times from Vienna that he is 
optimistic about the potential impact that "Schindler's List" will have on 
German viewers. The film's opening in Germany, he said, "is very, very 
important in this time of so many neo-Nazi events, with so many rightist 
extremists, and in a year of elections." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects the movie to raise the public consciousness -- especially 
among young people -- and translate into fewer votes for extreme right-wing 
parties. Wiesenthal called "Schindler's List" the "best film about our tragedy 
that I have seen, and I've seen 99% of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Runge, a sociologist and leader of the Jewish Cultural Assn. in Berlin, 
said she hopes the movie will be "an eye-opener for a generation of youths" who 
may be unexposed to the subject. But she also fears many intellectuals 
accustomed to repressing the issue might focus on discussions of "aesthetic 
values -- talk about how well the movie was done or not done, according to 
their standards," and not on Nazism and its victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of "Schindler's List" has been making itself felt even before the 
film's opening. Last week, the German magazine Der Spiegel ran a cover story on 
the film titled "The Good German," which said Spielberg "tells his story as 
precisely and brilliantly as never before, vividly in every detail, so full of 
life and, therefore, so intensely, so densely, that it takes the viewer's 
breath away." 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an astonishing outpouring of attention on this film," says 
Gerry Lewis, international marketing consultant for Spielberg's Los 
Angeles-based production company, Amblin Entertainment, from UIP's London 
headquarters. He said the momentum of media coverage "has grown immensely over 
the last four or five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and Smith, who work closely on all of UIP's releases of Amblin films 
overseas, characterized the marketing campaign for the movie as very 
straightforward, mirroring the look and strategy Universal Pictures enlisted to 
sell the picture domestically. The campaign was low-key and no frills, 
positioning it as an important "experience" rather than just a movie. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Based on the true story of German industrialist and Nazi Party member Oskar 
Schindler who secretly saved more than 1,100 Jews from the death camps, 
"Schindler's List" is the first major movie specifically confronting the 
subject in Germany since the 1979 U.S. television miniseries "Holocaust," which 
drew 20 million viewers despite being aired on WDR network's third-rated 
channel. That brought the word Holocaust into the German vocabulary, replacing 
"The Final Solution" or the still-preferred term "persecution of Jews."  
</P>
<P>
 As Der Spiegel points out, even though the president is attending tonight's 
premiere, the German government hasn't always been so willing to address the 
subject of the Holocaust. In 1956, the government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer 
exercised considerable pressure to block the showing of Alain Resnais' "Night 
and Fog" at the Cannes Film Festival because it saw the film as an offense 
against Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the people behind tonight's premiere is 37-year-old lawyer Michael 
Friedman, whose Holocaust survivor parents, Paul and Eugenia, were saved by 
Schindler. Friedman, who said Schindler attended his bar mitzvah in Tel Aviv, 
said the president's presence at the movie's premiere is a "sign of recognition 
of what Spielberg did in this film."  
</P>
<P>
 Like other countries where the movie has begun to open, Germany is rolling out 
the red carpet for Spielberg. He arrives in Frankfurt just before lunchtime 
today after a meeting this morning in Paris with French President Francois 
Mitterrand. Later today, Spielberg will be honored at a lunch at Frankfurt's 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he will fly to the film's premiere in Krakow, Poland, where 
Oskar Schindler established his work camp that saved Jewish workers from the 
Auschwitz death camp. Poland's President Lech Walesa is expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's premiere benefit in Frankfurt was arranged by a committee of an 
organization known as Wider Das Vergessen, which roughly translates as "against 
forgetting." The organization is made up of leading German industrialists who 
raise money for the preservation of Auschwitz as a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum at Auschwitz is in bad shape and needs approximately $30 million 
(of restoration). The German government is giving 10 million marks ($7 million) 
toward it, and the rest has to be worked out worldwide," said Amblin's Lewis.

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ACCORDIONS FOR POLKA 
SHOWDOWN!; GRAMMYS: FORMER WINNERS JIMMY STURR AND WALTER OSTANEK ARE GOING 
HEAD-TO-HEAD FOR BEST POLKA ALBUM. IT'S A HOT BUT FRIENDLY CONTEST. 
</P>

<P>
 If CBS thinks it found drama at the Winter Olympics, wait until the network 
trains its cameras on tonight's Grammy showdown between Jimmy Sturr and Walter 
Ostanek. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturr and Ostanek are going head-to-head in the best polka album category in 
an up-close-and-personal duel that has the potential for more pathos than 
someone's mother collapsing on "The Montel Williams Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Sturr and his orchestra was a dominant force, a polka juggernaut, having won 
the best polka album Grammy six years running until last year, when Ostanek and 
his band usurped the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men also make claims of royalty: Sturr, who operates out of a small town 
in Upstate New York named Florida, calls himself "the King of Polka," while 
Ostanek, who makes his home in St. Catharines, Ontario, bills himself as 
"Canada's Polka King." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Sturr's album "Saturday Night Polka" will butt heads with Ostanek's 
"Accordionally Yours." Also nominated: Eddie Blazonczyk's "A New Batch of 
Polkas," Lenny Gomulka & The Chicago Push's "Most Requested Hits" and the Polka 
Family Band's "Polka Music Fan." But the latter are merely the Oksana Baiuls 
and Surya Bonalys in this tense matchup (of course, Baiul actually won the gold 
in Lillehammer, so anything could happen). 
</P>
<P>
 We asked the two men: Are they gunning for one another? Are they thinking of 
taking a crowbar to the other man's hands to prevent him from playing his 
instrument? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," says Ostanek. "All five of us are friends. In the polka 
category, most guys get along good. Naturally, we're competitive and want to 
win. But I can't see any animosity. If lose, I'll probably feel blue for a 
half-hour or so, but the project won't go down the tubes. But you get 10 times 
the exposure for winning than when you're just nominated." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Sturr says, "Last year when I lost, I got more publicity 
for losing than I ever did for winning. The papers around home the next day 
didn't say who won, they said, 'Jimmy Sturr Dethroned,' 'Polka King Loses.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter and I are very good friends," Sturr continues. "I really hate to say 
this, but I'm almost glad I lost last year. That way, people couldn't say, 
'Sturr buys the Grammys; he knows somebody.' Of course, I felt sort of bad -- 
you have to feel a little bad. But I was glad someone else won. Your wins mean 
more when someone else wins too. It gives a lot more credibility to the awards 
that I lost the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Sturr points out, "All of the records nominated in the polka category are 
really good recordings -- you couldn't pick five better ones in that category." 
And how many other categories can you say that about when it comes to the 
Grammys? 
</P>
<P>
 All nominated bandleaders save for Sturr play the accordion; Sturr plays 
clarinet and alto sax (he does, however, have two accordionists in his 10-piece 
ensemble). Both men have been performing professionally since childhood -- 
Ostanek, 58, began playing on the radio at age 18 and has been leading bands 
for 37 years, while Sturr, 46, formed his first group, the Melody Makers, at 
age 11 and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ostanek has released 45 albums, while Sturr weighs in with an impressive 90 
disks, each of which, he estimates, takes only 26 hours' worth of studio time 
to produce. Ostanek estimates his albums each sell about 25,000 copies, while 
Sturr has three gold albums -- one sold 650,000 copies. Most of Sturr's sales 
come from regional TV advertising. Both men expect even bigger things from 
their next releases -- Ostanek is recording his next album with the dean of 
polka music, Frankie Yankovic, while Sturr's album will be released on the 
respected folk label Rounder. Sturr also hosts a syndicated radio show 
dedicated to polka music. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men tour constantly -- Ostanek plays about 150 dates a year, chiefly in 
Canada, New York, Pennsylvania and the Midwest. Sturr performs about 170 shows 
yearly, mainly along the East Coast and through the Southeast and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturr admits that polka is the Rodney Dangerfield of musical genres -- once, 
when a beer company ran a commercial poking fun at polka, Sturr had it written 
into his contracts that beer would not be sold at the venues he played. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest problem is the word, 'polka,' " admits Sturr. "If I didn't use 
that word, I would do better. When people hear the word, a lot of them snicker 
at it. A lot of my music has a country feeling, not because I want to be a 
country artist, but country is close to polka, and country fans when they hear 
my music say this is great." Still, he says, even as a child he had no desire 
to play anything else but polka music. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, both Sturr and Ostanek will be in the audience awaiting the 
outcome of the Grammys. Ostanek says he won't be too anxious, that he intends 
to enjoy the ride. "Every time I've been a nominee, I've been treated super. 
Even when you're in the polka category, you're treated as well as everybody 
else, no matter how big they are."

Q&A WITH SHIFRA M. GOLDMAN; TAKING 'ARTISTIC GEMS' OUT IN PUBLIC; 'MODERN 
MEXICAN ART' CURATOR SEES PLENTY OF JEWELS IN A SHOW SHE ADMITS ISN'T FLAWLESS 
</P>

 Exhibition curators generally speak with unbridled enthusiasm about their own 
shows. They soft-pedal shortcomings or ignore them altogether -- if they can 
see them. Shifra M. Goldman, guest curator of "Seven Decades: Modern Mexican 
Art From the Bernard Lewin Collection," at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in 
Santa Ana through April 25, spoke in a recent interview to her show's 
weaknesses as well as its strengths. She also spoke freely about the museum, 
the collection on which the show is based, other shows and art critics. "She's 
a pistol," said a Bowers spokesperson. sg,2 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How would you evaluate the Lewin Collection, on which "Seven 
Decades" is based, and how did it aid or limit your vision for this show? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: While the Lewin Collection is certainly the largest collection (of 
modern Mexican art) in Southern California and possibly the country, it's one 
collection, and I was not free to draw from other collections. Still, I was 
able to glean a show that was more than simply a collection of precious 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a collector who collects has one kind of collection. But we're talking 
about a commercial gallery owner, someone who sells his work. After looking 
over the gallery collection, I chose X number of works to best represent a 
historical sweep, but the commercial activities of the gallery have left great 
gaps. As I write in the (exhibition) guide, the show is "an introduction to the 
pioneering and experimental conceptions and developments," and as such, it 
"allows visitors to see a number of little-known artistic gems." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Artistic gems -- is that like an unassuming wine? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By gems I mean works that are not constantly reproduced -- outstanding 
small works that a museum might own. Mexican art is my area of specialization, 
yet there are works here that I'd never before seen. At ("Mexico: Splendors of 
Thirty Centuries," at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1991), they 
showed modern works that we'd seen over and over and over, even on postcards! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since you brought it up, how does "Seven Decades" compare to the 
"Splendors" show? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The "Splendors" show was enormous. (The 400-piece show was one of the 
biggest in LACMA's history.) "Seven Decades" is a small show, under 100 works, 
and it has no pretensions to be a historical overview. To mount a purely 
historical show for Bowers would have been very difficult in terms of what I 
had available to me. The Mexican government could draw on all the resources of 
Mexico. And they did. They took pulpits out of churches, materials out of 
remote villages . . . and there were protests about that. 
</P>
<P>
 When the "Splendors" show hit Los Angeles, the impact was huge. Los Angeles 
has the largest Mexican population of any city outside of Mexico City, and it 
has an active Chicano art movement . . . so the local Chicano community was 
very excited, and (there were) 350 subsidiary events from the Chicano community 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were your overriding goals for this exhibition? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wanted to put together a show that would correspond to major shifts in 
ideas. . . . I'm also very aware that modern Mexican art gets very rare play, 
at least outside of New York. I was very conscious, and so was Mr. Lewin, of 
the "Splendors" show, which was a splendid opportunity, but I thought heavily 
overloaded with ideological biases.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: For instance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It helped (promote) the NAFTA cause by portraying Mexico as a great 
civilization that continues without any contradictions. Yet today we watch the 
uprising of the Mayan peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, I'm an art historian, not a political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As an art historian, why do you say modern Mexican art gets "rare play"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Many critics know only Eurocentric art, and anything that doesn't fit into 
that isn't treated well. Latin American art is systematically (treated as) 
second class. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tracked the Los Angeles edition of the L.A. Times for 25 years, and I 
have yet to find a critic who has any appreciation for any period or master of 
modern Mexican art. To say that Tamayo is not as good as Picasso, that's 
Eurocentrism. Even over the last 10 years, there are people who have written 
very stupidly about Latin American art, simply out of ignorance or (because 
they're) convinced that there are only several European masters and they 
condemn everybody else. Putting down Tamayo as not a very good painter, 
(writing that) after seeing a Matisse you cannot even consider Tamayo. . . . 
You don't have to paint like Matisse to be a very good painter. It was 
astounding to me that somebody could write this. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So modern Mexican art is getting play. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The '80s were a Latin American art boom, equivalent to the Latin American 
literature boom of the '60s. Those who do not comment on this phenomenon would 
be out of step. But it has not been commented on well in these pages. In the 
past it was really horrendous, but some people who write for The Times today, 
and some outside writers who have been brought in, have been more sympathetic. 
The San Diego edition, for instance, had given excellent coverage, but I can't 
say why. . . . They've been both critical and laudatory, but they've been 
flexible enough to get out from under their Eurocentric training. Learning as 
they go -- that to me is a very good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What, specifically, still needs to be learned? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have to combat the stereotypical notions that all art south of the Rio 
Grande is somehow exotic or folkloric, colorful and strident, and that one 
needn't concern oneself with artists who didn't work in magic. 
</P>
<P>
 This art is not an exotic art. It's right in sweep with the international bank 
of ideas, only with a national concern. Like everybody, (Mexican artists) dip 
into this bank, they contribute to it, they withdraw from it what pictorial, 
aesthetic and conceptual ideas they want, then shape them to their needs, their 
roots, and what they want to say. Tamayo has done so splendidly. He was very 
influenced by Picasso and Braque, but his art is his own. Latin American 
artists are not imitations, or second class -- these notions have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where there any glitches in putting together the Bowers show? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unfortunately, the museum didn't find the funding to do a catalogue, and 
the newsletter is fraught with errors. One glaring, obvious mistake I hope 
people see through, they substituted Chicago for Chicano: Chicago mural 
movement instead of Chicano mural movement. The newsletter also identifies the 
Estridentista movement as loosely based on Picasso's "Guernica," and Goya as a 
spiritualist. I don't know how Picasso's "Guernica" came up, and Goya is not a 
spiritualist. (These are) very embarrassing errors. I wish they'd been more 
careful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any other problems? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We lost one of the gems in our show when it was sold (by the Lewin Gallery) 
and sent to Mexico. I was very upset. It was very important to me to find 
another work by Maria Izquierdo, who is very hard to come by. By some 
tremendous quirk of fate, the Bowers owned one her works. Instead of "Horses," 
we now have "Nanny and Child." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why were you so upset about losing the Izquierdo work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unfortunately, the United States knows only one female Mexican artist. 
Frida Kahlo is like a star shining in a heaven without women. Olga Costa and 
Izquierdo are two others. Nobody among Mexican artists is given proper 
attention, and certainly the women get less.

GRAMMYS OPERATE ON DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH; COMMENTARY: ONLY A HANDFUL OF PAST 
ALBUM OF THE YEAR WINNERS ARE SIGNIFICANT POP EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When it comes to rock 'n' roll, fans have long looked elsewhere besides the 
Grammys for their barometer of what's blowin' in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A look back at the annual winners in the Album of the Year category over 3 1/2 
decades finds only a handful of honorees that would land on anyone's list of 
the most significant pop albums of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, there have been years that the Grammys got it right, or at least 
close enough for credibility -- picking "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" 
as the best of 1967, Paul Simon's "Graceland" in 1986, U2's "The Joshua Tree" 
in 1987 and strong albums by respected artists such as Frank Sinatra, Stevie 
Wonder and Bonnie Raitt in other years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pattern more clearly hews toward singling out long-forgotten superstar 
entries from the likes of Glen Campbell, Christopher Cross, Toto, Billy Joel 
and Phil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison, we picked seven turning-point years in rock 'n' roll since the 
first ceremony in 1958, and lined up some of the best or most acclaimed pop LPs 
from those years against what actually walked off into the Grammy sunset as 
Album of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 1958 
</P>
<P>
 Significant eligible albums included: Frank Sinatra's "Come Fly With Me" and 
"Sings for Only the Lonely," Elvis Presley's "King Creole," "The Kingston 
Trio," the "South Pacific" soundtrack, "The Everly Brothers," "Sam Cooke." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Grammy went to . . . Henry Mancini's "The Music From Peter Gunn." 
</P>
<P>
 1964 
</P>
<P>
 Significant eligible albums included: The Beatles' "Meet the Beatles," "The 
Beatles' Second Album" and "A Hard Day's Night," Bob Dylan's "The Times They

Temptations," Barbra Streisand's "Funny Girl" and "People." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Grammy went to . . . Stan Getz & Astrud Gilberto's "Getz/Gilberto." 
</P>
<P>
 1966 
</P>
<P>
 Significant eligible albums included: Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited" and 
"Blonde on Blonde," the Beatles' "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver," the Beach Boys' 
"Pet Sounds," Simon & Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence," the Rolling Stones' 
"Aftermath." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Grammy went to . . . Frank Sinatra's "A Man and His Music." 
</P>
<P>
 1969 
</P>
<P>
 Significant eligible albums included: The Who's "Tommy," "The Beatles" (white 
album), "Led Zeppelin" and "Led Zeppelin II," Bob Dylan's "Nashville Skyline," 
the Rolling Stones' "Beggars Banquet," Jimi Hendrix's "Electric Ladyland," Neil 
Young's "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere," Creedence Clearwater Revival's 
"Green River," Sly & the Family Stone's "Stand." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Grammy went to . . . "Blood, Sweat & Tears." 
</P>
<P>

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMERICAN PACIFIC'S PROFIT FALLS 54% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks reported a 54% decline in its 
fourth-quarter profit after increasing its 1993 loan loss reserves from 
$700,000 to $3 million, in part because of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks-based bank, one of the nation's largest Small Business 
Administration lenders, also cited continuing economic troubles in the region 
for causing earnings "to drop temporarily." 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific earned $197,899 in the three months ended Dec. 31, in 
contrast with $430,556 in net income a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In all of 1993, the bank earned $1.57 million, a 28% drop from $2.18 million 
in profit the previous year.

A CONTENDER IN COMPUTERS; PACKARD BELL MOUNTS A TURNAROUND BY STICKING TO LOW 
PRICES, MASS MERCHANDISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, many observers questioned whether personal computer 
manufacturer Packard Bell Electronics Inc. would survive the market's 
relentless price cutting and cutthroat competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell's sales were growing at five times the industry average, but its 
profits were nose-diving as fast as the dizzying rounds of cuts in the price of 
computers. The company canceled a $70-million stock offering intended to raise 
desperately needed working capital when investors were turned off by Packard 
Bell's $93-million debt and negative net worth of $4 million as of Dec. 31, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "When everyone got to look at their books, they were under heavy attack. 
Everybody, including us, was predicting Packard Bell's death. But they 
regrouped, withstood the barrage and came back strong. Their computers are 
everywhere now," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with International Data Corp. 
in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than two years, Packard Bell has rebounded to become the 
fourth-largest personal-computer maker in the United States in units sold, 
behind IBM, Apple and Compaq, according to International Data. 
</P>
<P>
 While some computer companies like Gateway 2000 sell personal computers 
through direct sales or dealers, Beny Alagem, Packard Bell's chief executive 
officer, has long followed a strategy of selling his IBM-compatible PCs in high 
volume and as cheaply as possible through mass marketers like Montgomery Ward, 
Price Costco, Circuit City and Office Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was forced to move its headquarters and production facilities from 
Chatsworth to Westlake Village and Camarillo because of last month's 
earthquake. Its Chatsworth facilities, which were under lease, suffered 
extensive damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Packard Bell's revenues grew 35% to $1.25 billion, from $925 million 
in 1992. Company officials expect 1994 revenues to hit $2.3 billion. This is a 
big change from sales of $676 million, and a loss of $798,000, in 1991. 
Although Packard Bell is still a private company and under no obligation to 
reveal its earnings, analysts who follow the company believe it is now 
profitable but they say Packard Bell's profit margin is only 3 to 5 cents for 
every $1 of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying this formula to the $1.25 billion in revenues reported for 1993, 
Packard Bell earned a profit of between $37 million and $62 million last year. 
"They are nicely profitable. This company is making money," said Lloyd Greif, 
president of Greif & Co., an investment-banking firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Compaq is considerably larger than Packard Bell both in units sold 
and revenues, officials of the Houston-based company are keeping a wary eye on 
Packard Bell. "Quality-wise, we still believe our products are much better. But 
you've got to give them credit. Packard Bell is a formidable competitor who is 
not going to go away soon," said a Compaq official who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Packard Bell complete its turnaround from the brink of collapse less 
than two years ago to a company that now has larger PC makers looking over 
their shoulders? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have remained focused on our key channels of (retail) distribution. We 
remain committed to selling our products through retail channels" rather than 
selling PCs through specialty stores or direct sales, said Mal Ransom, Packard 
Bell's vice president of marketing. Packard Bell also claims to have been the 
first company to sell PCs with software included, enabling consumers to take a 
computer out of the box, plug it in and use it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Others offer a more succinct explanation. "Mass merchandising, low cost. 
That's their key," said Philippe de Marcillac, analyst at Dataquest in San 
Jose, who follows Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell computers are affordable to consumers because the company sells 
them cheap and in volume to mass retailers like the electronics chain Circuit 
City. Last week, Circuit City stores were selling a Packard Bell Legend 115 
model, minus the monitor, for $899 retail, only $50 more than what Circuit City 
paid Packard Bell wholesale for the machine. A complete Packard Bell PC with 
monitor, keyboard and processor ranges from $1,100 to $2,700 at retail. 
</P>
<P>
 But mass production and inexpensive products have not been the only keys to 
Packard Bell's fast growth. In 1993 computer maker Groupe Bull of France bought 
19.9% of Packard Bell, investing an estimated $50 million in the U.S. company. 
Packard Bell also received $100 million in financing from Congress Financial 
Corp. of New York. The infusion of cash helped Packard Bell clean up its 
balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're everywhere. You can't walk into a major retailer or discount 
warehouse without seeing their computers. They're not at 7-Eleven yet, but who 
knows where their product will appear next?" said Stephen of International 
Data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our studies have shown that 70% of homes in the United States don't have a 
personal computer. Many of the other 30% that have computers have old 
technology. That's an awesome market. We're targeting household penetration," 
Ransom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell is also attempting to penetrate the business market, but with 
less success. About 2,000 office workers polled by J.D. Power & Associates in a 
1993 survey listed Packard Bell as below average in user support. "The main 
complaint from business users was that they had a difficult time getting help 
from Packard Bell when they experienced problems with their machines. The 
company's consumer hot line was not very helpful," said Adrian Heryford of J.D. 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell Computer ranked highest in customer satisfaction, followed by Compaq and 
Gateway 2000, the only companies rated above average in the study. Apple, AST, 
CompuAdd, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Packard Bell were rated below average. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell officials acknowledged the survey's findings, but they claim the 
company was the first computer maker to offer consumers a toll-free help line 
in the United States, in 1988. The company claims the line handles more than 
70,000 calls each week, 24 hours a day, in more than 30 languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its recent success, the company still suffers from an identity 
problem. Packard Bell was founded in 1987 by Alagem, Jason Barzilay and Alex 
Sandel. The trio purchased the name Packard Bell from Teledyne Inc. for an 
undisclosed sum. Older consumers still confuse the Packard Bell name with the 
defunct company that manufactured television sets and radios. Others confuse it 
with the larger and better-known computer maker Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, questions remain about the reliability of the company's products. Do 
people buy Packard Bell computers because of brand loyalty or because they are 
the cheapest on the market? 
</P>
<P>
 "People buy our computers because they represent the top end of technology at 
the right price," said Packard Bell's Ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said that Packard Bell computers are usually 10% to 20% 
cheaper than those offered by IBM and Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of shoppers at Office Depot, Circuit City, Good Guys and 
Wal-Mart showed that Packard Bell computers are often purchased by first-time 
buyers looking for a less expensive model. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is in high school and we thought it was time to buy our first 
computer. I bought a Packard Bell model because it was the cheapest I could 
find," said Patricia Warner, who purchased a personal computer at the Office 
Depot in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A salesman at a Good Guys electronics store in the San Fernando Valley said 
that consumers whose first personal computers are Packard Bell models usually 
"upgrade" to IBM, Compaq or Apple when they purchase a second computer. 
"Normally, I don't recommend Packard Bell. The only thing that makes them 
attractive is the price," said the Good Guys salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in 
1991 about 17% of Packard Bell's monthly shipments were returned to the factory 
for a variety of reasons. However, Ransom said that "returns and adjustments 
have improved considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 But salespeople at several retail stores said that Packard Bell computers are 
returned for defects more frequently than other brands. A salesman at a Good 
Guys store said the Packard Bell Legend 605 on display did not work when 
plugged in the first time. When store employees opened up the personal 
computer, they found a wire that was not connected to the hard drive and 
corrected the problem themselves. "With Packard Bell, you can take it home, and 
if it doesn't work when you plug it in, bring it back. Eventually, you'll get 
one that works," said the salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The return issue is not a quality issue," Ransom insisted. Instead, he 
compared the returns to when "your wife goes shopping and buys a toaster. A few 
days later you decide it isn't what you wanted and you take it back." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain: Packard Bell is poised for major growth in 1994. The 
company expects its sales to double this year in part by expanding its foreign 
markets in Australia, Europe, Asia and South America, where Packard Bell 
maintains offices. In addition, the company will introduce a new series of 
multimedia machines, including computers that can be used with compact 
disc-read only memory software and a line of notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell is not hampered by high overhead. The company leases most of its 
facilities and runs what one analyst called "a bare-bones, no-frills 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in there one day, waiting to meet with (Alagem). I was dressed in a 
business suit and felt out of place while waiting in the lobby. It was pretty 
Spartan, and there were people pushing trash cans through the lobby in the 
corporate office. It was pretty amazing," said the analyst, who asked to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Packard Bell officials announced plans to move the company 
headquarters and about 1,200 employees out of Los Angeles. The new sites under 
consideration at the time included Palmdale, Salt Lake County, Utah, Portland, 
Ore., Camarillo and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, four days after the Northridge earthquake, company officials told 
about 420 service center employees in Chatsworth they would have to move to new 
facilities in Utah and accept pay cuts of up to 30% or be laid off. Packard 
Bell said the jobs were being transferred to Utah in order to cut the company's 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the company was forced to relocate temporarily to Westlake Village 
and Camarillo when its Chatsworth facilities were damaged. Ransom said the 
company had signed a one-year lease for the new facilities and added that the 
company will not make a decision about whether to move until later in the year.

FOR SOME FIRMS, TEMBLOR MEANS A JOLT TO PROFITS; DISASTER: DAMAGE VARIES FROM 
STRUCTURAL TO LOSSES IN SALES. MORTGAGE LENDERS AND INSURERS WILL BE GRAPPLING 
WITH IMPACT INTO THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as the physical force of the Northridge earthquake hopscotched around the 
Valley, picking and choosing the victims of its worst punishment, some local 
companies are taking a hit to their bottom lines because of lost business. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems cited include damage to facilities and merchandise, and lost 
sales in the days after the quake. Some insurance companies face big payouts 
for claims. Financial institutions could suffer if homeowners walk away from 
their mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer printers and communications 
products, was one of the first to announce that because of earthquake-related 
setbacks it will post a loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31. A year 
earlier, Datametrics earned $300,000 on revenue of $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was shut down for four days after the quake because it had no 
electricity. Later, shipments of materials used in Datametrics products didn't 
arrive. The delays were particularly damaging because they came at the end of 
the quarter and because the recession has forced companies like Datametrics to 
time shipments very tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the nail in the horse's shoe that makes you lose the war," said 
Datametrics Chief Executive Sidney E. Wing. "You can't ship because of a 
50-cent component." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also suffered, Wing said, because workers needed time off to deal 
with personal problems. And every time an aftershock rattled, "they wanted to 
get out of the building," even though city building inspectors deemed the 
structure safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Fan Co. in Woodland Hills estimated that as much as $200,000 of 
its $2-million inventory of ceiling fans was destroyed when it fell off shelves 
and was soaked by water. None of those products were earthquake-insured. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be an impact on quarterly earnings," Controller Neil MacDonald 
said. Fortunately for Beverly Hills Fan, before the earthquake it had already 
rung up $1.6 million in sales, double the total sales for the first quarter a 
year earlier. The company said that if it posts a profit this quarter it will 
be a small one. 
</P>
<P>
 Art publisher and retailer Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc. in Van Nuys 
also said its first-quarter sales would probably be "significantly" lower 
because of the earthquake as well as the severe cold in the Midwest and East 
Coast. The firm hopes to recover at least some quake-related losses from its 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said that quake damage has kept its galleries closed in the 
Northridge Fashion Center and Sherman Oaks Fashion Square shopping malls. Also, 
the company's headquarters was shut down for two weeks after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ended March 31 last year, Martin Lawrence lost $1.7 million on 
$4.7 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer software distributor Kenfil Inc. in Van Nuys said that $3 million to 
$4 million of uninsured inventory was destroyed in the quake, and its 
operations were halted for about two weeks afterward. That will hurt profits, 
said Chief Financial Officer Peter Grubstein, although he wouldn't say by how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those companies likely to feel an earnings bite from the earthquake are 
property-casualty insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Industries, the Woodland Hills parent of 20th Century Insurance 
Co. and 21st Century Casualty Co., estimated its quake claims at $160 million. 
After taxes and reinsurance, that total will drop to $62.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of that will be in the first quarter," said Richard Dinon, 
senior vice president at 20th Century, the state's sixth-largest carrier of 
earthquake insurance. In the first quarter of 1993, the company earned $23.9 
million on $263.1 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at Amwest Insurance Group Inc., the earthquake "is going to be 
immaterial" to earnings, said Steven R. Kay, chief financial officer. That's 
because the Woodland Hills company specializes in writing surety bonds 
guaranteeing construction and other projects. In fact, said Kay, Amwest might 
benefit if the earthquake spurs rebuilding. "That's what you need surety bonds 
for. It could be an opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and savings and loans also stand to feel some pain from the earthquake. 
American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, one of the nation's largest Small 
Business Administration lenders, cited the Northridge earthquake as one reason 
it added to its loan-loss reserves for 1993. As a result, its earnings declined 
54% in its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, to $197,899 from $430,556 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp. said it did not expect a "material loss" from 
the quake. Two buildings at its large Chatsworth complex were badly damaged, 
but rebuilding costs should be covered by the savings and loan company's 
insurance, said spokesman Steve L. Hawkins. "So there won't be a huge financial 
hit in the first quarter because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger problem would be if large numbers of homeowners who can't afford to 
rebuild their quake-damaged houses abandon their mortgages, Hawkins said. The 
company is hopeful that scenario won't come to pass because most borrowers who 
are taking advantage of Great Western's offer to place a 90-day moratorium on 
mortgage payments do not have severe structural damage on their properties -- 
and many have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank estimated that it has $1.5 billion in real estate loans 
in earthquake-affected areas. But Judy Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the 
Glendale-based thrift, said the extent of any losses wouldn't be known for 
"another week or two." She said that Glendale Federal was calling all its 
borrowers and depositors and inspecting properties. "There are still so many 
variables." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies also said it was too soon to tell what impact, if any, the 
earthquake would have on profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven M. Besbeck, president of Creative Computer Applications Inc., a 
provider of information systems for laboratories and pharmacies, said his 
company didn't resume full operations until a few weeks after the quake. Its 
Calabasas offices were drenched when sprinklers went off during the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Besbeck has hired specialists to determine if the company's electronic 
equipment is salvageable. "It may have an effect on the quarter that ends Feb. 
28," he said, "but I'm not even sure about that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land & Farming Co., a Valencia real estate developer, said its 
Valencia Town Center shopping mall and its office and apartment buildings were 
operating within a few days after the quake. But Newhall Land spokeswoman 
Marlee Laufer said the company can't yet gauge the effect of closures of 
earthquake-damaged freeways leading into the area. "There may be an impact on 
the first quarter," she said. "The long-term impact is difficult to assess 
because of transportation issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman International Industries Inc., a maker of audio speaker systems, 
suffered no major damage at its Northridge manufacturing plant despite its 
proximity to the quake's epicenter. Chief Executive Sidney Harman also credited 
the plant's 2,000 employees for returning the facility to full operations by 
the Sunday after the quake. There was some lost inventory and building repairs 
needed, Harman said, but that should be covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no impact on earnings."

BANK IS FACING FEDERAL DEADLINE TO BEEF UP CAPITAL; MANDATES: VENTURA COUNTY 
NATIONAL BANK MUST MEET THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS BY SEPT. 30 OR FACE HARSHER 
MEASURES BY REGULATORS, INCLUDING CIVIL PENALTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County National Bank, trying for the past year to reorganize and get 
out from under a heap of bad real estate loans, now faces a Sept. 30 federal 
deadline to shore up its capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new consent agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
the Oxnard-based bank agreed to meet unusually tough capital requirements or 
confront harsher measures by regulators, including civil penalties or removal 
of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital mandates are on top of other stringent operating constraints that 
were imposed in a broader consent agreement signed in March, 1993. The latest 
action was announced last week as the bank's holding company, Ventura County 
National Bancorp of Oxnard, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $3.5 million. The 
quarterly loss reflected lingering problems with troubled commercial real 
estate loans, and brought the company's total loss in 1993 to $12.1 million, 
compared with a profit of $685,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, with assets of about $340 million, also owns 
Frontier Bank, a smaller institution based in La Palma. Frontier is operating 
under a separate consent order, but its capital levels are above regulatory 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Cupp, chief executive officer of Ventura County National Bancorp 
since July, said the company would consider a number of steps to raise capital 
levels, including selling more stock to existing shareholders, a private 
placement of securities and the sale of certain assets, including Frontier 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp, 53, was confident that Ventura County National Bank, which has three 
branches, would be able to meet the Sept. 30 deadline to boost its capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid Nagle, an analyst at SNL Securities, a banking research firm in 
Charlottesville, Va., said the new capital requirements suggest that "there's 
still significant regulatory concern" about Ventura County National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle said the bank has shown improvement in the last year by putting in 
stronger management and cutting costs. But he said: "The institution's 
non-performing assets continue to grow, the company continues to lose money and 
it's situated in what is today the most troubled economy in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp has been reorganizing the company since he replaced William E. McAleer, 
who resigned in May amid regulatory pressures. In an interview, Cupp said he 
has hired a new team of credit officers, cut expenses and staff by outsourcing 
departments such as data processing, and tried to identify and better manage 
troubled assets. The bank holding company, and its two banking units, have a 
total of about 200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our expectation is that we have most of the problems behind us," Cupp said. 
"We intend to return to profitability this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bank has yet to stem the growth of non-performing assets, which surged 
to $21.8 million as of Dec. 31, more than double the supply of bad loans and 
leases it had on its books at the end of 1992. Those non-performing assets Dec. 
31 represented 6.4% of the bank's total assets, much higher than the industry 
average and up from 2.02% at the end of 1992. Most of the bank's bad assets are 
commercial real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the bank last year was forced to set aside $16.2 million in loan 
loss provisions, compared with $3.4 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a positive sign, however, Ventura County National Bank's loan loss 
provisions declined in the fourth quarter to $1.8 million, from $6.1 million in 
the third quarter. Also, the bank's fourth-quarter loss of $3.5 million, which 
compared with a profit of $422,000 in the same period in 1992, included onetime 
charges of $2.2 million for writing off goodwill, tax write-offs and other 
reorganizing steps, all aimed at reducing operating costs and improving 
profitability in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ventura County National Bank must now comply with more stringent 
capital requirements than those mandated at healthier banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the latest consent agreement, the bank must achieve a so-called Tier 1 
capital ratio of 12% and a leverage ratio of 7%. As of Dec. 31, the bank had a 
Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.24% and a leverage ratio of 5.49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ratios reflect a bank's equity as a percentage of risk-based assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new consent agreement also restricts the bank's ability to declare or pay 
a dividend, and requires the bank to develop a three-year capital program. 
</P>
<P>
 These requirements and restrictions are in addition to numerous regulatory 
controls agreed to by the bank in March, 1993, including supervision of bank 
staffing, policies and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle, the analyst, said the bank has "done as well as expected" since March, 
1993. But for the future, he said, "the real issue is how many more problem 
assets will be discovered and the California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp said he did not expect a big improvement in the regional economy this 
year. But he asserted that the bank would return to profitability this year 
anyway.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MEDICAL PROPERTIES DEFAULTS ON DEBT OF $14.35 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Medical Properties Inc., an Encino real estate investment trust, said Monday 
that it has defaulted on its $14.35 million in debt and faces possible 
foreclosure on its medical properties. 
</P>
<P>
 If it can't sell the properties or restructure to obtain new capital, the 
company added, it could lose all its assets and be forced to discontinue 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt payment was due Dec. 31, but Medical Properties said it wasn't able 
to sell any of its properties in time, and it has no other resources to pay the 
debt. It previously said its total assets are estimated to be worth far less 
than its total debt.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMERIGON GETS PATENT FOR AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amerigon Inc., a Burbank company that develops products for 
advanced-transportation and alternative-fuel vehicles, said it has received a 
U. S. patent for its audio navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent is for a vehicle navigation system that speaks to drivers to help 
them find their destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Other auto navigation systems on the market use satellites to pinpoint a car's 
location. Although they use some verbal prompts, directions are mainly given on 
a dashboard screen. Amerigon's product, AudioNav, does not use satellites but 
is totally audio and works with a compact disc player. A driver tells the 
system where he is and where he wants to go, and the system responds with audio 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Amerigon said it has received purchase orders totaling $142,000 for prototype 
AudioNav units from five manufacturers of car compact disc players.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: TOP 3 OFFICIALS OF GOLF DEVELOPMENT REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The three top officials of the ambitious Spanish Hills Golf & Country Club 
development in Camarillo are being replaced, but the Japanese-controlled firm 
in charge of the project denies that slow home-site sales in the project's 
early stages are behind the shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Stricklin, president and co-managing director, is leaving April 1 to 
pursue other interests, according to Ty McCutcheon, marketing coordinator of 
the project, which is being developed by Sato Kogyo Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Makoto Miura, senior manager, and Masakazu Ochiai, co-managing director, are 
also leaving but have been reassigned to the parent company's headquarters in 
Tokyo, McCutcheon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing them in as-yet unspecified positions will be Toshihiko Uchimaru, 
Frank Howington and Katsuhiko Hayashi. "Japanese companies move people around a 
lot. That's their traditional way of doing business," McCutcheon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost two years since the developers started marketing home sites, only 
nine lots have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCutcheon maintained that things are picking up, saying that 29 other 
lots have been reserved for prospective buyers and that the country club now 
has 550 members.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: QUAKE MAY BE BEHIND 8.6% DROP IN HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake may have derailed Ventura County's housing comeback at least 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in the county fell 8.6% in January, according 
to TRW REDI Property Data's monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales decreased to 444 from 486 in January, 1993. The average sales price was 
$219,747 in January, down 2% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales dip may have been caused by lenders requiring reinspections of homes 
whose sales were pending prior to the quake, notes Joe Brown Sr., chairman of 
Brown Realtors in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we've seen a nice rebound in February, so I don't consider the 
January decline meaningful," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, with a year-to-year drop of less than 1%, was the only 
other Southern California county to show reduced sales in January.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: GTE BUILDING PURCHASE WOULD BRING 650 JOBS TO OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks-based GTE California is on the verge of purchasing the 
never-used Chevron USA building in northeast Oxnard and installing a 
customer-service center that would bring 650 jobs to the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE officials are expected to decide within two weeks whether the center will 
be in the 115,000-square-foot Chevron structure or the San Bernardino-Riverside 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard is the clear favorite, GTE officials report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard's chances look good and, if we choose that city, we'll definitely be 
using that building," said Mike Raydo, GTE's public affairs manager. "We also 
like that location because it's much closer than the competing area to our 
offices in Thousand Oaks. And there's an excellent pool of potential employees 
in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Marcy, a Chevron spokesman, confirmed that the sale to GTE is imminent. 
"It's a matter of crossing the t's and dotting the i's," he said. "We're very 
excited, especially in view of the jobs and economic benefits this would bring 
to Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 GTE is tentatively planning to transfer 250 of its employees to the new 
center, and to hire 400 new workers to staff the unit. The facility would 
consolidate work done at a number of GTE offices throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It would process new service installations, handle customer inquiries and 
dispatch service trucks from other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Raydo said a price has already been agreed upon for the Chevron structure, but 
he and Marcy declined to disclose the amount. "All I can say is that it's a lot 
less than Chevron paid to build it," Raydo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building at Rice Avenue and Gonzales Road was completed in 1990 at a cost 
of $15 million. Chevron had planned to base its Southern California regional 
headquarters there, but later decided to move most of its offices to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete-and-steel structure, surrounded by spacious lawns, has stood 
vacant since its completion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is located in a 60-acre development that borders the Ventura Freeway.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BENTON OIL INCREASES STAKE IN JOINT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Gas Co., an Oxnard energy concern, said it has acquired an 
additional 30% interest in its Venezuelan joint venture, Benton-Vinccler, for 
$3 million cash, $10 million in promissory notes and 200,000 shares of Benton 
common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase brings Benton's share of the oil-drilling venture to 80%. The 
company also said that Benton-Vinccler has refinanced $15 million of commercial 
paper, which served as project debt financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton-Vinccler is reactivating and developing three oil fields in Venezuela 
with proved reserves of 78 million barrels of oil. Benton said the venture 
successfully tested its first horizontal well in one of the fields.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: K-SWISS HAS RECORD PROFITS IN 4TH QUARTER AND FOR 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 K-posted record revenue and profits for the fourth quarter of 1993 and the 
full year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth-based sneaker concern said in its fourth quarter that ended 
Dec. 31, its profit more than tripled to $1.5 million, compared with $395,000 a 
year earlier.Revenue in the quarter rose 12% to $23.8 million from $21.2 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 K-Swiss attributed the increases to higher sales of its line of mid-priced 
leather sneakers and greater profit margins from reduced manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's net income for all of 1993 climbed 41% to $12.5 million. In 
1992, an extraordinary charge of $896,000 for early retirement of debt made the 
company's final net income $8.9 million. Without the onetime charge, K-Swiss 
would have earned $9.8 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for all of 1993 climbed 17% to $149.6 million from $127.8 million.

PACIFIC MUTUAL, THOMSON ADVISORY GROUP HOLDING TALKS ON POSSIBLE MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. said Monday that it is discussing a possible 
merger of much of its investment business with that of Thomson Advisory Group 
L.P., a Connecticut mutual fund manager with about $11 billion under its 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would create a $70-billion portfolio, about $60 billion of it coming 
from several Pacific Mutual subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the companies would not comment further after making a joint 
announcement of the negotiations. But investment industry analyst Michael 
Lipper suggested that the deal might be an effort by Pacific Mutual to take its 
investment services operation public through a merger with Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the talks are aimed at pushing most, if not all, of Thomson's 
investment advisory business onto Pacific Mutual's plate. But Thomson, a 
limited partnership whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 
would keep its master limited partnership status and NYSE listing, a 
spokeswoman for the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, which has a steady history of profitability and posted a profit of 
$24.2 million for 1993, manages the $5-billion Thomson McKinnon mutual funds 
through its mutual funds group and about $6 billion in institutional and 
individual assets through its Columbus Circle Investors subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the merger discussions anticipate creation of an 
entirely new business or whether the combined funds would be handled under the 
auspices of one of half a dozen Pacific Mutual subsidiaries that would 
contribute to the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have a quarter, or maybe half, of the puzzle," Lipper said. Both 
companies have good reputations and names that help their sales forces market 
their services, he said. But Thomson "is too small when the (investment 
management) business gets rougher to maintain a strong effort." 
</P>
<P>
 A pumped-up company with a $70-billion portfolio would have a lot more muscle 
to flex. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual would likely be the controlling element, with a controlling 40% 
stake if its share of the combined portfolios translates as its ownership 
share. About 43% of Thomson's 10 million partnership units are publicly traded. 
The company's shares closed Monday at $35.25 a unit, up $2.88 on news of the 
merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Mutual investment subsidiaries manage $74 billion in assets, 
including about $60 billion for outside investment clients. Pacific Investment 
Management Co. is a major fixed income assets manager; Cadence Capital, 
Parametric and NFJ Investment Group manage U.S. equity accounts for the company 
and its clients -- mainly government and corporate pension funds; and 
Blairlogie Capital manages international portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual is California's largest life insurance company, with more than 
$40 billion in insurance in force at the end of 1992 -- the latest year for 
which financial and performance data for the company are available. The company 
reported $2.5 billion in revenue for 1992.

COUNTY IS STILL AMONG STATE'S MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the real estate downturn, Orange County remains one of the state's 
most expensive housing markets and its home buyers are generally richer than 
their counterparts elsewhere in California, according to a newly released 
survey by Chicago Title & Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The median home price in 1993 for first-time Orange County buyers was 
$172,200, according to the study, called "Who's Buying Homes in California." 
The only two markets in the state more expensive than Orange County were San 
Francisco, where first-time buyers spent $234,300, and Ventura, where the 
median was $183,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Among repeat buyers -- those who have previously owned a home -- the median 
price of an Orange County residence in 1993 was the second highest in the state 
at $252,600. San Francisco had the most expensive homes for repeat buyers, with 
a reported $267,700. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County residents are better able than most Californians to afford 
such pricey homes. The study found that Orange County had the highest reported 
median household income in the state, $77,500. San Francisco was second with 
$71,900 median income. 
</P>
<P>
 The national study randomly surveyed 1993 home buyers in eight California 
markets: San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, the San Francisco area and the Central Valley. Conducted every year 
since 1976 by Chicago Title, the nation's largest title insurer, the study 
surveys new-home and repeat buyers by telephone and analyzes buying trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a diverse suburban community (but it is) still a bedroom 
community of Los Angeles. You can get houses on a hill, houses in a valley, 
houses near the ocean -- you can get anything you want. But it's geared 
primarily for families, especially move-up families," said John Pfister, 
manager of marketing research for Chicago Title. "You've got mostly upscale 
housing, and as a result it's one of the most expensive markets in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Orange County had the lowest percentage, 34.3, of first-time 
buyers in all of California. In Los Angeles, 57.4% of buyers were first-timers, 
the highest percentage in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pfister cautioned that these figures could be misleading, as Los Angeles 
County could have fewer repeat buyers than Orange County, which would boost the 
percentage figures for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally in a recession, the first-time home buyers would be in the market, 
but Orange (County) had the lowest percentage, which is kind of odd," Pfister 
said. "But that may not be indicative of anything more than that in Orange 
County, first-time buyers bought in 1992, and repeat buyers are coming back in 
the market stronger there than other areas in California." The 1993 Orange 
County Home Buyer Both first-time and repeat buyers preferred resale, 
single-family homes over new homes or condos. Repeat buyers tended to scout the 
market longer, shopping an average of five months and viewing an average of 
14.6 houses. A statistical comparison of first-time and repeat buyers in the 
1993 housing market: Home Purchased First-Time Buyer New: 26% Resale: 74.%

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; DIFFERENT VIEWS ON TEACHING MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE KNOW-HOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While consumers may be flocking to stores to buy multimedia software, they may 
not be so eager to learn how to create it. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Michael Brinda, president of Santa Ana-based New Horizons Computer 
Learning Centers, which has 53 centers that train people how to use computers 
and software. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinda said his training centers geared up for the age of multimedia -- 
software that combines video, text, sound and graphics -- by offering classes 
last year on how to use programs such as Macromind Director, which supplies 
tools for people to create multimedia programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "multimedia club" classes bombed and turned Brinda off to the 
unfulfilled promise of multimedia. The centers still teach a variety of 
computer training, but not with as much concentration on multimedia alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say multimedia is a real job mirage," he said. "We were pioneers there 
and tried and failed. It was a flop. We finally killed it. We teach classes on 
using certain tools, but we don't teach programming. That's something we leave 
to the vocational schools or colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 But John C. Stebbins, a principal of the multimedia company Digital Vision 
Design & Automation in Irvine, disagrees. He will teach the UC Irvine Extension 
program's first-ever classes entitled "Introduction to Multimedia" for the 
spring semester. The classes are aimed at the masses, not just techies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can learn anything if you have the desire," Stebbins said. "To some 
extent, it's true that only a few people can master it. But the people who have 
the passion and desire will learn it."  
</P>
<P>
 Stebbins says the existence of multimedia user clubs and graphic arts computer 
classes and universities proves that there is a growing thirst for multimedia 
know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 Stebbins' classes will meet on Mondays, May 16 to June 20; Wednesdays, April 6 
to May 4; and Tuesdays, April 5 to May 3. The classes will be from 7 to 10 p.m. 
on the UC Irvine campus. The cost is $325.

 CareLine Inc.: The Irvine provider of ambulance services reported an annual 
loss of $3.4 million, or 51 cents a share, including a one-time loss of $2.4 
million from early repayment of debt. That contrasted with a profit of 
$500,000, or 5 cents a share, for the previous year.Revenue rose to $32.4 
million from $10.3 million as a result of the acquisition of nine ambulance 
service providers during 1993. The company, which began doing business on Feb. 
10, 1992, went public in December, 1993. For the fourth quarter, the company 
lost $2.3 million, or 32 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $124,000, 
or 1 cent a share, for the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue 
increased to $16.8 million from $4.2 million.

60 DISNEYLAND ADMINISTRATIVE WORKERS IDLED; JOBS: HOURLY EMPLOYEES ARE 
UNAFFECTED. LAYOFFS ARE THE SECOND AT THE PARK IN A DECADE. OFFICIAL CALLS THE 
MOVE AN EFFORT TO 'STREAMLINE THE OPERATIONS.'

 Disneyland began laying off 60 administrative and support workers Monday, the 
second time in this decade that Magic Kingdom employees have been idled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing that would impact the guest experience," park spokesman Lindsay 
Schnebly said."It is an attempt to streamline the operations of the resort." 
</P>
<P>
 All of those laid off worked behind the scenes and were salaried, rather than 
hourly workers, Schnebly said. They represent less than 1% of the park's 9,000 
to 12,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park's ride operators, sweepers, people who dress up as Disney 
characters and others who generally work with the public are paid by the hour 
and are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Disneyland's attendance has been reported by trade journals to be 
stagnant recently, Schnebly said, the layoffs are more a factor of a general 
restructuring and reorganization similar to one in 1992, when the park cut 
about 30 employees from its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnebly said no further layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers being idled will be offered unspecified benefits, Schnebly said, and 
will get help finding new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson C. Green, president of Disney's theme park division, told a group of 
managers in the Anaheim park at the Jan. 27 meeting that the cuts are "part of 
doing business in the '90s" and will affect the company across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney World, Disney's Florida resort, announced Friday that it will lay 
off 360 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial difficulties at the Euro Disney theme park outside Paris has put 
pressure on the rest of the corporation. The park, of which the Disney Co. owns 
about half, lost more than $900 million for its latest fiscal year. LAYOFFS

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: WESTERN NATIONAL ACQUIRES KEMPER APARTMENT PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western National Group, Orange County's largest apartment developer and 
manager, said it has acquired the entire apartment portfolio of Kemper 
Residential Management for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Western's first nationwide acquisition adds 17 apartment complexes with 3,419 
units to its holdings, bringing its total apartments under management to 
27,000, the company said.The apartments are located in nine states: California, 
Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and 
Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 The employees at Kemper, a property management firm based in Lafayette, in 
Northern California, will join Western National, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This expands our portfolio under management by more than 12%," said Don 
Vodra, managing partner of Western National Group. "We expect it to increase 
our exposure to similar medium- and large-scale opportunities with 
institutional investors, asset managers and property managers."

ROCKWELL TO REPLACE 145 SECURITY GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerospace giant Rockwell said Monday that it is laying off 145 uniformed 
security guards and contracting with private guard companies in a move to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, effective Monday, is being made at Rockwell's headquarters in Seal 
Beach and at divisions in El Segundo, Anaheim, Palmdale, Downey, Thousand Oaks 
and Palmdale, spokesman Bill Blanning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications division in Newport Beach, which already uses an 
outside security force, and the Rocketdyne division in Canoga Park, where 
guards double as firefighters, are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 A benefits package was offered to the guards being laid off, Blanning said, 
but was rejected in a vote by the union, the United Plant Guard Workers of 
America. The union could not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery Maxwell, a protective services officer for nine years at Rockwell 
before being laid off, said that guards have made several concessions to the 
company over the past few years, such as accepting part-time workers and 
reduced benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not being laid off. We are being locked out," Maxwell said. "We want 
to bargain. We want to work for Rockwell." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanning said the company made clear to the guards' union that layoffs were 
pending.

NEW-HOME BUYERS MORE SATISFIED, 1993 SURVEY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southern California's new-home buyers are increasingly satisfied with their 
purchases, and their builder of choice is John Laing Homes of Laguna Hills, 
according to the results of a 1993 survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, last year's buyers were more satisfied with their homes than those 
five years earlier, according to National Survey Systems, an Irvine-based 
research firm that compiles data for the Home Buyers Choice Awards.The survey 
of more than 9,000 buyers found that 88% were satisfied with their purchases 
last year, compared to 1988, when only 81% were happy with their dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, more buyers were pleased with the construction quality of their homes -- 
95%, up from 81% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five builders participated in the annual survey, which began in 1988. 
The results are from a post-move-in questionnaire asking buyers to evaluate the 
process used by the builder to sell, close and service the new home.  
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, John Laing Homes was the No. 1 builder for 
overall customer satisfaction, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1990, John Laing was rated extremely low, and they were very concerned 
about it. In the last three years they have turned that company around," said 
Robert Mirman, president of National Survey Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in the past four years, Akins Homes of Newport Beach won 
for construction quality. California Pacific Homes' Orange County division was 
cited as having the best record for customer service response speed last year, 
the survey found.

 Video Games: Davidson & Associates, an education software company in Torrance, 
has acquired two software developers, including video game developer Chaos 
Studios in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos Studios is known for developing titles such as "The Lost Vikings," "Rock 
and Roll Racing," and the upcoming "The Death and Return of Superman."The stock 
deal is valued at $6.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos, formerly known as Silicon & Synapse Inc., was founded in 1991 by Allen 
Adham, 27, and Michael Morhaime, 25. The company has produced 30 versions of 
its games for the Nintendo and Sega game systems and for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a research and development company, Chaos' 20 employees produced games that 
were published by larger publishers such as Davidson, Sunsoft Inc. in Cypress 
and Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Adham said Chaos chose Davidson because it needed money for developing 
increasingly costly video games, and Davidson's focus on education software 
meant that Chaos could continue developing games with its own style of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our company is young, with the average age at 24.5," Adham said. "That means 
we are the target market, in a position to know what people like us want in a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson also agreed to acquire Learningways Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., an 
education software firm.

NICHOLS INSTITUTE POSTS 1993 LOSS OF $4.4 MILLION; EARNINGS: THE MEDICAL 
TESTING COMPANY BLAMES DECLINE ON REORGANIZATION AND COST-CUTTING IN THE WAKE 
OF A SERIES OF ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Blaming a major cost-cutting consolidation and restructuring, Nichols 
Institute posted a $4.4-million loss for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Executive George Bragg said that the San Juan Capistrano-based maker 
of medical test kits and provider of specialized laboratory services should be 
profitable again by midyear as the company emerges from last year's difficult 
cost-reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the (health care) environment as it is right now, we had to pull as many 
costs and expenses out of our system as we can," said Bragg, a former Western 
Digital executive who was hired by Nichols Institute in September to lead the 
financially troubled company back into the black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we should begin to see the benefits (soon) . . . and the balance 
of the year will see some significant improvements," Bragg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols Institute announced in November that it was restructuring its 
nationwide operations, consolidating many of its 12 regional laboratories in 
Texas, the Bay Area and the Midwest. That announcement came after a long series 
of strategic acquisitions that Nichols Institute officials hoped would secure 
the company's position as the nation's premier medical laboratory testing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the expansion strategy eventually went bust partly because Nichols 
Institute, which employs about 4,000 workers, failed to efficiently integrate 
the new operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was forced late last year to lay off about 150 workers -- none of 
whom were in Orange County -- and begin selling off obsolete and superfluous 
equipment it inherited during its buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the company reduced operations in Dallas by 75% and moved much 
of that workload to its El Paso facility. Operations at the firm's Houston and 
San Antonio laboratories were also cut back, Bragg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.4-million loss for 1993, equal to 28 cents a share, compares to a 1992 
loss of $4.2 million, or 28 cents a share. The earlier loss was blamed on the 
uncertainties of the changing health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual revenue of $279.6 million last year was down slightly from 1992 revenue 
of $284.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of 1993's loss occurred in the fourth quarter, when the company took a 
restructuring charge of $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That charge resulted in a fourth-quarter loss of $10.2 million, or 61 cents a 
share, compared to a 1992 fourth-quarter profit of $1.8 million. Revenue for 
the fourth quarter was $68.3 million, compared to revenue of $70.5 million for 
the year earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street appeared to react to the news positively. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols Institute stock rose to $5.375 a share on the American Stock Exchange, 
up 37.5 cents a share from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Anast, publisher of Biomedical Market Newsletter based in Costa Mesa, 
said that the moves, although painful, are expected to turn the company around. 
Though it has been mired in corporate and administrative problems, Nichols' 
business remains solid, Anast said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proves the point I have been making for a long time that not all 
acquisitions are in the best interest of the acquirer," Anast said. "Nine times 
out of 10 they involved large quantities of layoffs, huge management headaches 
and reversing momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 By year's end, Anast added, Nichols Institute should reflect the upswing that 
analysts expected when Bragg came to the company. Bragg was credited with the 
financial and management reorganization at Western Digital, the Irvine-based 
maker of computer components. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is one person out there who can make a dramatic difference, he is 
certainly capable of it," Anast said. "Anyone who knows him and his track 
record should concur without exception." Nichols Institute Incurs Loss 
</P>
<P>
 For the year ended Dec. 31, 1993, Nichols Institute reported a loss of $4.4 
million as its revenues declined to $279.6 million. The company attributed the 
loss to a major corporate restructuring that resulted in layoffs and partial 
plant closures. Figures in thousands of dollars, except per-share data:

LACK OF CONTACTS FOUND TO HURT MINORITY LAWYERS; CAREERS: BAR SURVEY SUGGESTS 
THAT THIS GIVES THE BIGGEST LAW FIRMS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR 
PARTNERSHIP RANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Minorities remain rare in partnership ranks at major U.S. law firms, largely 
because they have few contacts in white-dominated corporate suites -- where the 
decisions about hiring lawyers are made, according to an American Bar Assn. 
survey to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
 Such lack of contacts gives the biggest law firms little incentive to 
diversify their partnership ranks and tends to discourage minorities from 
joining these firms, the survey organizers suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, believed to be the first ever conducted of minority law 
partners, nearly half the respondents said lack of contacts and business 
networks outside their firms was the biggest impediment to building their 
practices. Nearly a quarter cited lack of such contacts within their firm as 
the major hurdle, and one-fifth said that "negative perceptions about minority 
lawyers" was the major impediment to their ability to generate new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Without business contacts on the outside and the mentoring and support network 
needed on the inside, minority lawyers fail to generate the numbers of clients 
and cases that are a key requirement of partnership and successive executive 
ranks within law firms, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 3% of partnerships at the country's large corporate law firms are held by 
minorities, according to Bar Assn. figures. And while 60% of those responding 
to the survey said they generate as much or more legal business as other 
partners at their level, many say they do so without the help of the "old boys' 
network" that continues to dominate partnerships at law firms and management 
ranks in Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty widely felt that minority partners do not have the same access to 
corporate decision makers that their white male counterparts have," said Karen 
Randall of the Los Angeles firm Katten, Muchin, Zavis & Weitzman. Last year, 
Randall was named co-managing partner of the firm, the first African American 
woman to reach such a position at a major U.S. law firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cycle," Randall said. "If minority partners are not able to generate 
the business to justify the position they've achieved in law firms, it has an 
impact on (that firm) recruiting other minorities and then on the number of 
minorities attending law school." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted in October by the ABA's Conference of Minority 
Partners in Majority/Corporate Law Firms. The 102 minority lawyers responding 
represent one-sixth of all African American, Latino, Asian American and Native 
American partners at major law firms. More than half said they were the first 
minority partners at their firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Holifield, head of the minority partners conference, said that because 
of "the absence of overall expressed interest in using minority law partners by 
corporations and their legal departments, there remains little incentive for 
the larger law firms to diversify their partner ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield said the ABA will ask major U.S. companies to "review and improve 
their procedures for involving minority law partners." 
</P>
<P>
 While 83% of the survey respondents said they receive support from other 
partners at their firm, they also said just 30% of their client referrals are 
gained through that source. 
</P>
<P>
 Many white male lawyers develop the business contacts needed to generate 
billings at "country clubs and other more traditional connections that have not 
been accessible to minority partners as a group," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, partners "pick people who look like them to hand down their clients to, 
or to groom," she said. Minority men, more than women, are the victims of this 
tendency because women lawyers often mentor other women lawyers regardless of 
ethnicity or race, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said these factors discourage minorities from joining large law firms. 
Katten, Muchin has 300 lawyers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Camara, a partner at Cox, Castle & Nicholson in Los Angeles, said his 
"comfort level," and not race or ethnicity, attracted him to that firm 21 years 
ago. A Latino graduate of the UCLA School of Law, Camara has been a partner at 
the 84-lawyer firm for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said large law firms seemed colder and he felt more insecure at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our firm is entrepreneurial-sized, and a more medium-sized firm doesn't have 
the institutional obstacles that may exist at other, larger law firms," he 
said. "I have access to all the tools necessary . . . to be as successful as I 
want to be in my organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Camara finds it an "outrage -- quite amazing that the majority 
(white-dominated) law firms -- the big law firms -- have so few minority 
partners. It's tough to explain how that happens, except that there are more 
institutional hurdles at large firms."

GLOBOCARS: THE NEXT CENTURY; AUTO MAKERS DRIVE FOR NEW WORLD MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The automobile is a century old and showing no signs of putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 million vehicles roam the roads -- from Germany's high-speed 
autobahns and America's interstates to the gridlocked streets of Thailand and 
unpaved byways of interior Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year about 50 million cars, trucks and other vehicles -- an average of 
135,000 each day -- were driven off the world's production lines. Two-thirds 
came from U.S., European and Japanese factories, but an increasing number were 
built in Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 With their home markets overrun with cars, major auto makers are driving 
relentlessly into new markets. Aided by globe-shrinking technologies and 
communications, the push for profits is creating far-flung operations where 
both risks and potential payoffs are great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies that don't think globally will be left behind," said John F. Smith, 
president and chief executive of General Motors. "And so will the countries 
whose policies impede rather than encourage companies to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 The automobile, almost since its infancy in the 1890s, has been the 
engineering wonder and then the economic engine of the developed world. No 
other industry turns out a consumer product that requires such a vast array of 
materials, processes and technologies or such large amounts of capital, labor 
and allied businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the allure is intoxicating for emerging nations with growing 
middle classes. For them, the auto industry is a jobs machine capable of 
propelling their people to prosperity and worldly status. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer size of some untapped markets has car makers salivating. China has 
20% of the world's population but less than 1% of its vehicles. Sales are 
expected to triple by 2000 to 3 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Like desserts, anything this good must be bad, and the auto industry's 
projected growth has a dark side -- congestion and pollution. Traffic is so bad 
in Bangkok that the 15-mile trip into town from Don Muang Airport can take 
three hours. The skylines of Los Angeles, Mexico City and Jakarta are darkened 
by smog largely caused by vehicle exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is increasing social demand on the auto industry to civilize its 
products," said Jim Olsen, vice president of Toyota's U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other pressures are helping redraw the map for the industry as it 
enters the 21st Century. Here are some of the road signs guiding it into the 
future: 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States, Europe and Japan are mature markets with sales growth 
rates averaging just 1% to 2% yearly. With worldwide overcapacity, a company 
can expand only by taking market share from a rival or moving into new markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Globalization means more consolidation and strategic alliances as car makers 
seek to share costs and spread risk. Efforts are mounting to build "world 
cars," models that can be sold in multiple markets with only minor changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southeast Asia is the world's hottest market. But the most coveted prizes 
are China and India. Latin America also has great potential. Economic and 
political concerns make Russia and Eastern Europe unattractive now. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trade barriers are coming down in emerging nations. Trade frictions will 
continue to flare up, especially involving big exporters like Japan. To ease 
tensions, firms are moving production into the countries where their vehicles 
are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Environmental and technological pressures are mounting on auto makers 
worldwide, including those of absolutists who say: Just stop making the things. 
That's not going to happen, and even reducing emissions, alleviating traffic 
congestion and improving safety will result in higher car prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The automobile has been called "the machine that changed the world." Clearly 
it has. Many regard it with emotion, awed by the freedom, speed and opportunity 
it has brought their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, its reach is limited. Today only one in 12 of the world's people owns a 
car. As that figure increases, the auto will certainly bring more change -- for 
companies, consumers and countries. Troubled Global Landscape 
</P>
<P>
 The auto changed Japan. Its auto industry was a juggernaut that made Toyota, 
Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Mitsubishi household names. For nearly 40 years, it 
was the classic growth industry, some years increasing 10% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Japan's domestic auto industry has been in decline for three years, a 
reflection of the economic slump that has overtaken the country. "The Japanese 
automotive economy is changing from a growth to a cyclical industry," said 
automotive consultant William Pochiluk. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift caught some auto makers unprepared. Nissan lost nearly $1 billion in 
1993 and continues to bleed red ink. It became the first Japanese company ever 
to close a car factory when it shuttered the Zama plant last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese sales also fell in the United States as the yen rose in value against 
the dollar, making their products pricier than U.S. models. They fared worse in 
Europe, where a severe recession drove industrywide sales down 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 The European slump exposed the weakness of car makers there as well. Fiat of 
Italy suffered huge losses. Volkswagen, once revered for its engineering 
excellence, lost $1.3 billion last year and now is ridiculed for its 
inefficient plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the news is better. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler 
all reported strong operating earnings in 1993. But the profits came after 
three years of painful losses. GM alone lost $18 billion in North America in 
the last four years as it closed plants and fired workers. 
</P>
<P>
 With such economic and competitive pressures, a further shakeout is widely 
expected, with some weaker auto makers likely to go under. Perils and Partners  
</P>
<P>
 It was once theorized that the auto industry would shrink to just three major 
players: GM, Toyota and Volkswagen. Only these companies -- the largest, most 
powerful car makers in their regions -- could make the investments and achieve 
the economies of scale necessary to compete on a global basis, it was argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Few ascribe to that view today. The reason: New technologies are more 
accessible, and new production methods require being lean and nimble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Size is absolutely no guarantor of success in the auto business," said Robert 
Lutz, president of Chrysler, the smallest U.S. car maker. "It's not going to be 
the large that eat the small, but the swift that eat the slow." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the German luxury auto maker BMW devoured Rover Group of Britain, 
acquiring a controlling 80% share in the weaker company for $1.2 billion. The 
remainder of Rover is owned by Honda. The BMW-Rover marriage is considered a 
good fit. BMW gets access to key products, such as Rover's acclaimed sports 
utility vehicles, while the British firm gets access to its partner's financial 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But even mergers that make sense are difficult to pull off. The combination of 
Renault and Volvo fell apart last year when Swedish investors rebelled, fearing 
the French would control their national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acquisitions tend to have a lot of unknowns," said Maryann Keller, a New York 
auto analyst and author. "Consolidations that look good on paper often don't 
work. The reason is people. Different cultures are hard to mesh." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case with the seven-year engagement of GM and South Korea's 
Daewoo Group. GM bought 50% of Daewoo Motors in 1985. The idea was to build the 
Pontiac LeMans using GM's engineering and marketing and Korean labor. Initially 
hailed as a model for global manufacturing, the venture collapsed in 1992 amid 
heated recriminations involving divergent cultures, language difficulties and 
differing business goals. Such failures have prompted many companies to eschew 
equity mergers for strategic alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the world's 41 largest auto makers there are 244 agreements, including 
joint ventures in manufacturing, parts sharing and research, according to the 
authoritative Ward's Automotive International. Peugeot of France, for instance, 
has 22 agreements with other car companies, including a partnership with 
Taiwan's Chinese Automobile Co. to build Citroen C15s and one with Fiat to 
produce a commercial van. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone advocates alliances. Chrysler, which once owned 24% of 
Mitsubishi, has sold its equity stake and unwound many of its joint operations 
with the Japanese car maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alliances don't work," Robert Eaton, chairman and chief executive of 
Chrysler, said flatly. The reason, he said, is that the market changes so 
rapidly while product development takes so long. Thus what made an alliance 
attractive initially often vanishes by the time the vehicle is produced. 
</P>
<P>
 For any partnership to succeed, it must benefit both sides. The Nissan Quest 
and Mercury Villager are produced by Ford at its Avon Lake, Ohio, plant. 
They're the same vehicle with different brand names. The venture helps both: 
Nissan gets a minivan without having to pay an import tariff, and Ford gets a 
small minivan to complement its larger Windstar. 
</P>
<P>
 These close ties have allowed manufacturers to learn valuable lessons from 
each other. U.S. manufacturers have recovered in part because they have applied 
so-called lean production techniques copied from the Japanese. World Cars 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson is designing cars that can be sold on more than one continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is not new. VW's Beetle is the archetypal people's car. It was tiny, 
cheap and well engineered. As an anti-status symbol in the 1960s, the roly-poly 
car became the first significant export to invade American shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese also used their centralized design and assembly operations to 
produce so-called world cars -- vehicles sold on more than one continent with 
only minor changes. An example: Toyota's Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt at a world car is Ford's Mondeo. The family sedan, which 
was launched last year in Europe, is being built in Belgium, Mexico and the 
United States. Ford hopes to sell 750,000 a year in 59 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ford failed in an earlier attempt to build a global car. The Escort 
subcompact was envisioned for the world market in the 1980s. But internal 
rivalry between the European and U.S. staffs resulted in two cars with only two 
common parts -- an ashtray and an instrument panel brace. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the company says that 90% of the European Mondeo is the same 
as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, the car's U.S. marques. But the 
program came at tremendous cost: $6 billion. Ford argues that the tab is 
reasonable. It is providing three cars in five body styles with two new engines 
that will be used in future products. Most important, the project has 
integrated Ford's parts buying, manufacturing, design and engineering on a 
global basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ford is regarded by many industry experts as a model global car 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is slowly melding its once autonomous international operations using 
supercomputers and video teleconferences. It has developed a web of global 
alliances: Mazda in Japan; Kia in South Korea; VW in Portugal, Brazil and 
Argentina, and BMW in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been evolving into the next level of multinational company," said Alex 
Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive. "We've been managing more on a 
global basis." Where the Action Is 
</P>
<P>
 For Ford and other major auto makers, that means seeking opportunities in new 
markets. Simple math shows why. There is a car for every two people in the 
United States and Germany, and one for every three in Japan. In contrast, China 
has an auto for every 652 individuals; India, for every 356; Indonesia, 136; 
Egypt, 109; Colombia, 42; Turkey, 31; Russia and other former states of the 
Soviet Union, 17, and Mexico, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a high-octane mix of rising incomes and free-market policies, many 
of these emerging countries want to become significant car and truck producers. 
Eventually, some hope to become major exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is likely to produce a jobs bonanza. For every auto assembly job 
created, there could be up to 10 more jobs generated in parts manufacturing, 
distribution, sales and service. 
</P>
<P>
 But major manufacturers are treading carefully. After all, auto production is 
not as easy as selling a formula for Coke or building a McDonald's on a busy 
street corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't move in and sneeze without spending $1 billion in some of these 
places," said W. Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford's international 
automotive operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the maze of trade regulations and local restrictions can be 
dizzying. Maintaining quality control in distant plants is difficult. The 
threat of labor unrest and even war is often real. And building vehicles to 
suit local taste is challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the possibility of 10% to 15% annual growth rates is irresistible, and 
car makers are maneuvering on many fronts to get a foot in the door. Here is 
where the action is hottest: 
</P>
<P>
 * Southeast Asia: Spurred by a rising, affluent middle class, the region -- 
including Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam -- is 
rapidly replacing traditional transport with cars. Tom McDaniel, president of 
GM's Asia-Pacific operations, based in Singapore, sees a near doubling of sales 
from 860,000 in 1993 to 1.4 million by 2000. "The market is exploding," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand, where sales increased more than 25% last year, is the biggest and 
hottest market. Malaysia is building vehicles in two ventures with Japanese 
partners. In less than a decade, production has topped 100,000 units a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam, boosted by the end of the U.S. trade embargo, has licensed half a 
dozen companies to build cars, trucks and buses. Taiwan, which is a bigger 
market that Australia, continues to be strong, with annual sales exceeding 
400,000 vehicles. Exports are slowly increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese dominate the region, accounting for 90% of all sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * China: With a population of 1.2 billion, this is the market most lusted 
after. Sales are projected to soar from 1.2 million in 1993 to 3 million by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "China stands out as the major opportunity for growth in the next 10 years," 
said David Herman, chairman of Adam-Opel, GM's German subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning a nation of bicycle, bus and oxcart riders into car drivers will not 
be easy. The country's roads are primitive. Economic and political 
uncertainties abound. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential rewards are so big, however, that no one wants to be left out. 
Volkswagen, Peugeot, Chrysler and GM already are making vehicles there in joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 * India: There has been an auto industry in India for 50 years, but high 
duties on cars and tight government control of investment and expansion have 
hindered development. Recent actions to lift these obstacles have raised hope 
that India is ready to build a competitive industry to serve its population of 
820 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki is investing $200 million to build a second plant for its Indian joint 
venture. Mercedes-Benz and GM are both negotiating entry. 
</P>
<P>
 * South America: With the debt crisis behind it, this region is no longer the 
market of the future. Auto sales and production are booming, thanks to 
widespread trade liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Production in Brazil jumped 30% in 1993, and sales soared 43%. Brazil recently 
reduced taxes 20% on small cars. The decision prompted VW to resume production 
of the Beetle in Brazil after a seven-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's major manufacturers -- VW, Fiat, Ford and GM -- are increasing 
spending in the region and seeking export opportunities. Economic concerns 
persist, however. Inflation is so severe in Brazil -- a 2,500% annual rate last 
year -- that in January GM instituted daily price hikes on vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico: Although auto sales and production were down in 1993, the slump was 
overshadowed by the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Trade Commission projects that NAFTA will mean a 7% increase 
in jobs and a 16% increase in wages for Mexico. With its central location, it 
is likely to become a major staging ground for exports to both North and South 
America. VW, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan all have plants there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Russia and Eastern Europe: Auto makers are proceeding here with caution 
because of the unstable economic and political situation. GM and Suzuki are in 
Hungary. Fiat is working in Poland. VW acquired Skoda in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia privatized its largest auto maker, Volga Auto Works, two years ago. GM 
is providing the company with $700 million in engine-control systems over the 
next five years. Trade Winds 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of emerging markets has accelerated as trade barriers have come 
down worldwide. Despite nagging problems, global trade in general is freer 
today than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tariffs are coming down in a lot of places," said Dick Nerod, GM's vice 
president of South American operations. "It results in more competition and 
more choices for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, for instance, vehicle sales are booming because of a surge of 
imports made possible by a 25% reduction in import duties. Many of the vehicles 
are coming from Venezuela and other South American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations -- Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, 
Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei -- has adopted a tariff-reduction system 
to spur trade and increase market access. ASEAN supports tariff reductions of 
20% by 2000 on most goods, including cars with more than 50% local content. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of restrictions remain. Certification requirements, foreign ownership 
restrictions and high local-content rules are common. India, seeking to protect 
its supplier industry, imposes a 70% local-content requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade frictions continue to flare among the major auto-producing nations. This 
is likely to persist as long as there are significant disparities in their 
balance of payments and the efficiencies of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe has imposed import restrictions on Japan until 2000 to buy time to 
restructure its inefficient auto industry. The United States continues to press 
Japan to open its market and lower its trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The main issue in these battles is jobs. The U.S. Commerce Department says 
every $1 billion of trade imbalance equals a loss of 20,000 jobs. With a little 
over half of the nearly $60-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan tied to autos 
and auto parts, that means 600,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many major auto makers are undertaking global expansion in efforts to 
alleviate trade tensions and shield themselves from currency fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese have concentrated design, engineering and manufacturing at home. 
But as trade tensions and the yen have risen, they have adopted a localization 
strategy -- moving production to where the vehicles will be sold. Greening of 
the Auto 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as rancorous as trade arguments is the growing debate over 
environmental damage caused by the automobile. Is the dream machine that 
promised mobility becoming a global nightmare causing oil-consuming gridlock, 
land-scarring sprawl and environmental degradation? 
</P>
<P>
 "Environmental damage from driving plagues the farthest reaches of the globe 
-- polluting the air in cities, squandering valuable land and even altering the 
earth's climate," wrote Marcia D. Lowe of the Worldwatch Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 In the developed world, growth in the number of autos is slowing but miles 
traveled is increasing. In emerging nations, the demand and desire for cars 
race forward despite inadequate infrastructure and pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of society's inability to cope with the auto abound: Traffic tie-ups in 
Amsterdam's narrow downtown streets were so bad that it declared its central 
city a car-free zone. So much lead is dumped into the air in Bangkok in the 
exhaust from cars, trucks and the ubiquitous motorbikes and tuk-tuks -- 
three-wheeled vehicles -- that babies are routinely born with high trace 
levels. Excessive exposure to lead can cause neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report funded by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and 
written by Elmer Johnson, a lawyer and former executive vice president of GM, 
calls for greater government reliance on pricing strategies -- higher fuel 
taxes, parking fees and highway tolls -- to curb vehicle usage. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also urges development of computerized smart highway systems to ease 
congestion; production of electric vehicles to reduce emissions; greater 
recycling of auto components, and development of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Strides are being made to make the auto greener, even in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico now requires catalytic converters on its vehicles. Brazil encourages 
small, fuel-efficient vehicles through its tax policies. Singapore controls 
traffic with an expensive licensing system limiting driving time. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany is in the forefront of auto recycling, a response to the country's 
shrinking landfill capacity and to the strength of its Greens movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric vehicle research is under way throughout the world. The effort is 
being propelled by California, which has mandated that 2% of vehicles sold 
there in 1998 be zero-emission models. Prototypes are being tested throughout 
the world, even as auto makers argue that battery technology is lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a global trend toward increased cooperation among government, 
industry and the environmental community. The U.S. government has formed a 
historic partnership with the Big Three to develop a "clean car" that can get 
up to 80 miles per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lessening of environmental 'wackoism,' " said David Cole, 
executive director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at 
the University of Michigan. "It is being replaced by government and industry 
working together as a team."

GLOBOCARS: THE NEXT CENTURY; LATIN AMERICAN PRODUCERS PUT PEDALS TO METAL; NO 
COUNTRY IN THE REGION HAS A MASS MARKET YET. BUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS BOOMING 
AS NEVER BEFORE.

 Abram Boczkowski wanted a new car, so he joined "the plan," a national sales 
lottery, hoping that his number -- and his car -- would come up in the monthly 
drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just for the opportunity to buy, he had to pledge to make monthly payments of 
$300 for five years. And if his number didn't come up, he'd still have to keep 
making them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery systems such as Argentina's remain a popular way to buy a car in a 
region where demand outruns supply and often-rampant inflation has discouraged 
long-term loans typical in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Boczkowski was not lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited 15 months and didn't win the draw," said the 67-year-old accountant 
with sparse gray hair and wire-rimmed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 So he opted for the monthly bid, another variation on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidders offer to pay, in a lump sum, any number of their monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I offered $8,000 for them to deliver the car to me," Boczkowski said. "If 
someone else offered $9,000, the car would be delivered to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boczkowski's turned out to be the winning bid. Now he was in the paperwork 
department of the Serra Lima auto agency, making his payment and filling out 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether through "the plan" or standard purchase programs such as bank loans, 
now increasingly available as inflation subsides, Argentines and other Latin 
Americans are buying more cars, boosting the importance and potential of the 
automobile in this region of 450 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 While economic development and living standards have yet to reach levels that 
would give any Latin American country a mass market, the automobile industry is 
booming as never before. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Brazilian and Argentine manufacturers produced record numbers of 
vehicles. Mexico had a record 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen, Ford, General Motors and Fiat manufacture complete cars in Brazil. 
Ford, VW, Renault, Fiat and Peugeot do so in Argentina. In Mexico it's Ford, 
GM, Chrysler, Nissan and VW. In some other Latin American countries, including 
Chile, multinational companies assemble cars from imported components. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade barriers have been lowered, opening the door to more imports and 
exports. With free-market reforms and less customs protection, Latin American 
auto industries have had to become more competitive, and many car prices have 
been reduced. Bank credit is more accessible to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 If prices keep dropping, and purchasing power keeps rising, automotive 
analysts foresee years of expansion in manufacturing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief survey of Latin America's Big Three auto markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1987, when Latin American economies were slogging through a deep slump, 
Brazil's vehicle production (cars, trucks and buses) plunged to barely 600,000 
a year, about half the historic peak of the late 1970s. All Brazilian car 
makers were hit hard, and the two largest joined forces to survive. In both 
Brazil and Argentina, the manufacturing subsidiaries of Ford and Volkswagen 
merged to form a new automotive giant, Autolatina. 
</P>
<P>
 Autolatina went through a bumper-to-bumper overhaul -- scaling down staffs, 
renewing machinery and unifying assembly processes. Its current work force -- 
47,000 in Brazil and 7,000 in Argentina -- is 30% thinner than seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the slump seemed like distant history. Brazil produced a record 1.4 
million vehicles (Autolatina 550,000). Exports ran more than 20% of total 
automotive output. Brazilian manufacturers say their early reports show 1993 
production will put Brazil in 10th place among world auto makers, up from 14th 
in the mid-1980s and ahead of Italy and Mexico. By the year 2000, industry 
leaders predict, they will sell 2 million units.  
</P>
<P>
 Free-market reforms since 1990 have pried open Brazil's closed economy, 
lifting bans on imported cars and gradually reducing duties. Competition has 
forced all companies to begin voluntary retirement programs to reduce the labor 
force. Industry employment has been slashed from 158,000 in 1986 to 119,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is a long way from putting a car in every garage. This country of 150 
million people has about 15 million vehicles, including buses and trucks. But 
even that number has created severe environmental problems. Greater Sao Paulo, 
the only Brazilian city where atmospheric pollution is systematically measured, 
has 3.5 million cars for 16.5 million inhabitants -- and a sky blackened with 
exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, Brazil began introducing pollution-control methods in 1988, 
concentrating on the engines and exhaust systems of light vehicles, which 
contribute 80% of the carbon monoxide emissions. By 1997, if further planned 
controls are implemented, Brazil will achieve the U.S. standards in force in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico's industry is rapidly moving from a domestic to a hemispheric focus. 
Auto makers are refitting their old plants around Mexico City to make them more 
competitive by international standards. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, Mexico was making 2.4 million engines a year -- most of them for 
export, because the country produced only 357,000 finished vehicles. Soon 
afterward, companies built modern assembly plants near the U.S. border to 
manufacture cars for export. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, autos are second only to oil in Mexican industry, accounting for 2.4% 
of the gross domestic product and 9.6% of manufacturing. About 457,000 
Mexicans, one of every seven factory workers, are employed in some phase of 
auto making.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, auto makers were allowed to import fully assembled foreign cars for 
the first time in three decades, and that opening will continue under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect Jan. 1. By 1998, Mexico 
will be required to lift all restrictions on imports of new cars made in North 
America, and by 2019 all North American used cars must be allowed into the 
country as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers are already producing for a unified North American market by 
shifting production among plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's domestic auto sales reached a record high in 1992. The 1993 
recession, combined with tougher tax rules for company cars, put a damper on 
sales, but some middle-class consumers are still able to buy economical, 
compact models that sell for about 10% to 30% more than U.S. retail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volkswagen Beetle is still king of the road in Mexico, not only because of 
the low price but also for the company's creative financing schemes. VW runs a 
lottery like the plan in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5 million automobiles in Mexico City are responsible for 70% of the 
metropolitan area's choking air pollution. City-sponsored awareness campaigns 
encourage people to drive less, but overcrowded buses and subways are not 
appealing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the government opened the Argentine market to auto imports, local auto 
makers groaned. "We weren't accustomed to competition," said Rodolfo Ceretti, a 
longtime Ford executive. "Now we are getting accustomed." 
</P>
<P>
 One in every four cars bought by Argentines today is an import. "It's a 
threat, but it is a challenge to be efficient," Ceretti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Argentina's total vehicle production -- including cars, trucks, 
utility vehicles and buses -- rose from 99,600 in 1990, in the depths of a long 
economic crisis, to a record 342,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, with a population of 33 million, is the smallest Latin American 
country with a full-scale auto industry. One strategy for efficiency has been 
mergers. Argentina's Fiat and Peugeot manufacture jointly, as do Ford and VW in 
Autolatina, the Brazilian-Argentine joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors, which left Argentina more than a decade ago, is coming back to 
join the Argentine subsidiary of Renault in the manufacture of pickups and is 
expected to get back into building cars. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give GM manufacturing interests in both Argentina and Brazil, 
something that Ford, VW and Fiat already have -- a cross-border presence. By 
combining to produce for both markets, car plants on both sides of the border 
cut costs by producing vehicles in larger quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercosur, an economic integration project scheduled to take full effect at the 
end of this year, will combine the markets of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and 
Paraguay. "With integration with Brazil, it has become necessary for all 
companies there or here to be on both sides," said Dasso of the Assn. of 
Automotive Factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine auto makers are also reaching for a piece of the global market. 
Argentine-made Uno motors, for example, are exported to Fiat in Italy. 
Argentina's total automotive exports were valued at $800 million in 1993, up 
from $167 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The national market is also expected to keep growing. With 6 million cars in 
the country, industry planners calculate that a 10-year replacement cycle will 
require 600,000 new cars a year, 258,000 more than the record production of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth will add to urban air pollution, but breezy Buenos Aires has natural 
defenses. Widespread use of natural gas as automobile fuel also helps. More 
than 250,000 vehicles, mostly taxis heavily concentrated in Buenos Aires, run 
on clean-burning gas.

GLOBOCARS: THE NEXT CENTURY; THE LAST FRONTIER FOR SALES; AUTO MAKERS THE WORLD 
OVER EYE CHINA LUSTFULLY. YET INEFFICIENCY AND TRADE BARRIERS HAVE HELPED KEEP 
ITS POTENTIAL LARGELY UNREALIZED.

 When General Motors executives in Detroit committed $30 million to invest in 
the Jinbei truck factory in Shenyang, capital of China's northeastern Liaoning 
province, they expected to make a profit in 1993, the first full year of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Things went fine until last summer, when China's economy czar, Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji, alarmed by the country's overheated condition, ordered a clampdown 
on credit for state enterprises. The effect on the Chinese automobile industry, 
which depends almost entirely on state businesses for its orders, was the 
equivalent of changing the combination on the company safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of its selling the 25,000 Chinese-designed, GM-improved "Gold Cup" 
pickup trucks it anticipated, GM-Jinbei's orders fell to 15,000. In addition, 
said GM regional manager Ron Gilchrist, the company managed to sell only 800 of 
the S-10 model pickups it had brought over in assembly kits to use to train the 
Shenyang work force and test the market. The two-door S-10, priced at a hefty 
$20,000 in a country where the annual per capita income is only $367, turned 
out to be the wrong product for China. Truck buyers here prefer more passenger 
space to accommodate large work crews. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, GM's first major plunge into the Chinese market ended up in 
trouble and deeply in the red. If business does not improve this year, said 
Gilchrist, the company may be forced to cut some of Jinbei's 4,000 employees. 
Layoffs are risky business in China, where workers are accustomed to guaranteed 
employment under the "iron rice bowl" social welfare net built up under 40 
years of Communism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the comfortable, distant boardrooms of the world's great auto makers -- in 
Detroit, Tokyo and Munich, Germany -- the huge China market looms tantalizingly 
on the horizon like a shiny red apple, ready to be plucked. 
</P>
<P>
 China is the world's last great automotive frontier. Nowhere else are there so 
many people and so few cars. Even India, with nowhere near China's economic 
might, has three times as many private cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, when foreign auto moguls discuss China, the talk turns to the 
country's fantastic numbers: 1.2 billion people, 20% of the world's population; 
a rapidly growing middle class; fortunes being made on every street corner from 
steamy Hainan Island in the south to the frigid reaches of Manchuria in the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 If only one Chinese person out of 120 bought an automobile, that would be 10 
million cars -- a number rivaling the markets of North America and Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. President Robert Lutz, whose own company has had a rocky 
experience with its Cherokee Jeep factory in Beijing, recently rated China the 
No. 1 future growth market in the world, followed by the former East Bloc 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here on the ground, in the sobering reality of a China that has not quite 
weaned itself from its state-dominated economy, things are not nearly so bright 
and promising -- a least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, there were more than 125 different motor vehicle manufacturers 
in China, more than in any other country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They range in size from the big Volkswagen Santana plant in Shanghai that 
produces almost half of the country's passenger cars to tiny assembly lines on 
remote military bases where vehicles are assembled from components of other car 
makes, Chinese and foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these plants are like cottage industries with just a roof to keep out 
the rain," said Toshiaki Yasuda, general manager of Nissan's modest China 
operations. Of all the world's auto makers, the Japanese have been the most 
cautious about diving into the China market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smaller companies simply buy the components and put on their own logo," 
Yasuda continued. "Sometimes the only original thing on the vehicle is the 
logo. I've seen some Chinese micro-buses on the streets that look very similar 
to our own products." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent afternoon, the sales lot of the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition 
Hall featured a sampling of China's output, dozens of barely distinguishable 
cars and trucks bearing colorful Chinese names like Bright Sun, East Wind, 
Liberation, Yellow River, Jade of the Sea, Three Peaks and Golden Dragon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese industry is also the world's least efficient. Nowhere else does it 
take more people and more tea breaks to produce a single car. Japan, the 
world's most productive auto maker, averages 17 vehicles per employee per year; 
U.S. labor productivity is 13 vehicles per employee per year. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by Lo Dic, a University of Leeds economist, reported that China 
produces only about 0.24 vehicle per employee per year. Put another way, the 
average annual output of four auto workers in Japan is 68 cars; in China, the 
average annual output of four workers is one car. 
</P>
<P>
 Such amazing inefficiency exists because China is also one of the most 
protected automobile industries in the world. Because of hard-currency 
restrictions, the only entities permitted to buy imported cars are foreign 
companies and Chinese-foreign joint-venture companies based in China. During 
recent years, the Chinese government has limited even these imports to 100,000 
cars per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking into account the estimated 100,000 foreign cars that are smuggled into 
China each year, imports account for about 13% of the relatively small Chinese 
market. In addition, China levies duties of 150% and more on imported cars. 
That allows Chinese auto makers, big and small, to offer their products at 
highly inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one of the most popular and cheapest passenger cars on the 
market, the compact Xia Li (Charade) manufactured by Tianjin Minibus Works 
under license from the Japanese company Daihatsu, retails for more than 
$11,000. The Chinese-made Audi 100 sedans, favorite transport for China's 
high-ranking Communist elite, sell for a staggering $35,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few flashy exceptions in the major cities, the phenomenon of the 
family car has yet to arrive here. Last year, for example, only 230,000 sedans 
were produced in China. Of these, only 3% to 5% were purchased by private 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the vehicle industry is still largely dependent for its survival on 
orders from government units. These buyers range from the mighty People's 
Liberation Army to tiny regional and municipal corporations. Late last year, in 
fact, the central Ministry of Education reported that schoolteachers in many 
areas were not paid because local authorities had used money dedicated for 
salaries to buy cars instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such a state-dependent system, sales can be turned off by the government 
like water from the tap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The automobile industry can't look at China the way Coke or Pepsi does," said 
Tony Cevrone, a Chrysler spokesman in Detroit. "The main customers continue to 
be fleet customers. We have been in China virtually 10 years now, and we still 
feel we are in the infancy of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Like General Motors with its new Shenyang joint venture, Chrysler also 
suffered during the credit crunch last summer. In 1992, the Beijing plant 
produced and sold a record 20,000 Jeep Cherokees, producing a handsome profit. 
The company was on the same track in 1993 when the central government, 
concerned about inflation, restricted credit available to state work units. As 
a result, orders at Chrysler's Beijing Jeep plant fell to about 12,000, a 40% 
drop in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem with the Chinese automobile market," said a Western 
diplomat, "is that it is tremendously overpopulated with companies. The 
companies are all too small, and their costs too high. The market, such as it 
is, exists at the expense of Chinese taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the many handicaps and frustrations associated with working in China, 
few foreign auto makers have resisted entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Chrysler, which inherited its China business when it bought 
American Motors in 1987, French and German companies have been the main 
pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps the companies interested is not the current market but rather the 
dream that China will someday explode as a market for family-owned automobiles. 
Fueling this dream is the fact that at least 10 cities in China already have 
annual per capita incomes of more than $1,000, three times the national 
average.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the most successful foreign venture in China is Shanghai Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the peculiarities of the Chinese auto business is that there are 
virtually no showrooms or sales lots where customers can fondle the upholstery 
or test-drive the new vehicles. To buy a car in China, the customer is obliged 
to go to the factory to make the order. With little or no marketing, however, 
Shanghai Volkswagen last year produced and sold more than 100,000 four-door 
Santana sedans from its factory offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santana is a basic six-passenger model not sold in Europe for years. 
Nonetheless, Volkswagen was able to sell the cars for more than $20,000 apiece, 
reaping a pretax profit of $115 million for the German company and its Chinese 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Volkswagen's success, said Peter Loew, the company's deputy 
manager, was getting into the market earlier, locating in economically booming 
Shanghai and pairing up with a powerful joint-venture partner, the city of 
Shanghai itself. Motor-vehicle production

 It's the year 2003. With public transportation as slow and unreliable as ever, 
you're still driving to work. But you've decided to make the daily commute a 
little more pleasant by junking the old 1994 Ford Taurus and buying a fully 
loaded Chrysler sports coupe. You liked the Toyota, but it was twice as 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 When you unlock the door, the seats and mirrors automatically adjust to your 
favorite position. You turn the ignition and the engine purrs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupe is the same size as your old car but somehow roomier. The dashboard 
looks about the same except for the liquid crystal display of the on-board 
computer that flashes maps, maintenance information and electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 As you put the car into reverse to back out of the driveway, the little screen 
displays a picture of the sidewalk and road behind you. A small video camera 
above the rear license plate is scanning the area for cars and pedestrians. The 
way is clear, so you pull out and drive away. 
</P>

 You have an appointment across town, but you don't know the way. Push the 
navigator button on your display and, enunciating clearly, give the address of 
your destination. A voice recognition system picks up the address, searches its 
database and flips through a CD-ROM filled with maps of the area. Almost 
instantaneously, a map appears on the display and, with data from a satellite 
signal, the computer indicates the exact location of your car with a red dot 
that moves as you move. A blue line shows the best road to take to avoid 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling onto the freeway and putting the car on cruise control, you let your 
eyes drift to the horizon, where white clouds are floating lazily by. Beep! 
Your forward laser-based radar system is warning that the truck ahead of you is 
suddenly slowing and you're dangerously close. You step on the brakes, your 
heart pumping at the close call. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a close call, and you're glad you went with the eight-tire option along 
with the standard anti-skid brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers have known for years that while highly pressurized tires drive the 
most efficiently, soft tires are better for braking. Only recently did they 
begin offering cars with four double tires that use a set of highly pressurized 
inner tires for efficient high-speed driving. When you brake, the computerized 
suspension system puts the additional four soft tires on the road for extra 
gripping power. The extra wheels also help grab the road for sharp cornering. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, still flustered, you decide to move over to the slow lane. As 
you try to turn your wheel, it stiffens and there is another beep, this time 
from the side sensor. A picture comes up on your display showing a little 
sports car driving alongside you in a blind spot your mirrors hadn't picked up. 
You wait for the car to pass, pull off the freeway and take a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds futuristic, it is. But the technology for this experience is 
already available. And safety will become an increasingly critical factor in 
the design of tomorrow's cars. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Less certain is the extent to which heightened environmental consciousness and 
energy concerns will force a radical change in the engines and materials of 
21-Century automobiles. The expert consensus is that they won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most changes will be evolutionary," says David Cole, director of the 
University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. The 
institute recently completed a three-volume study of how cars will change over 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the views of a wide range of industry experts, it concludes that cars 
will get about 8% lighter as a result of the introduction of more plastics, 
aluminum and steel alloys. Average mileage will climb to about 32 miles a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest changes will be in electronics, Cole says. He predicts 20% of the 
car's value will be represented by the electronic system, up from about 11% 
today. Microprocessors will be connected by wire or radio to sensors throughout 
the car to operate the warning systems, measure tire pressure, check gasoline 
levels and control the standard air bags (front and back seat) and anti-lock 
brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an alternative view on where the car is headed, and how fast. Critics 
of Detroit's conventional wisdom predict another external shock that will force 
changes on the industry, just as the oil shock forced Detroit to build smaller, 
more efficient cars in the early 1970s. It could be new federal regulations 
concerning pollution, or it could be another energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of future that designer Michael Seal has in mind. As director 
of Western Washington University's Vehicle Research Center, he works with his 
students building state-of-the-art technology into experimental cars. He hopes 
clean, efficient cars will be a status symbol of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 For Seal, who has done consulting work for Ford and Chrysler, today's car is 
packed with features of questionable value -- such as electronically controlled 
windows, locks and sun roofs and gasoline-hungry engines. But he concedes that 
most American consumers will never accept the sacrifices in performance and 
distance driving required in an all-electric car. 
</P>
<P>
 So his latest car, the Viking 21, has a hybrid engine. In the city, it runs on 
electric batteries that can be charged with a home outlet or by solar cells 
pasted to the car's roof. On a long drive, the car would be powered by an 
engine fueled by cheap, clean natural gas. The grinding noise it makes each 
time the car is braked is the sound of a generator using the braking power to 
recharge the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal's next car, the Viking 23, will be made of carbon fiber and weigh less 
than half today's average automobile. The motor will generate its own 
electricity by burning natural gas and directing infrared rays at highly 
efficient photovoltaic cells. Its efficiency: the equivalent of a car getting 
150 miles to the gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies are working on some interesting variations on the internal 
combustion engine. Mazda and Mitsubishi are investigating engines that operate 
more efficiently by adjusting the capacity of the engine according to the power 
required for the job. Driving in the city, for example, a Mitsubishi 
six-cylinder engine would shut down one bank and operate on only three. For 
long distances, all six cylinders would kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David L. Greene, a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., offers another solution. He suggests that cars use highly efficient, 40 
horsepower internal combustion engines. In instances when more power is needed 
for climbing a hill or passing, an electric motor would kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit, which has a huge investment in factory equipment, training and 
technology that would be lost if automobile technology veered in a new 
direction, isn't receptive to even minor changes in the design of the engine. 
But that could change too. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal recalls how a General Motors engineer laughed at him in 1971 when he 
talked about the importance of aerodynamic design. "The guy told me 
aerodynamics was irrelevant unless you were driving at above 200 miles an hour. 
They kept building cars like shoe boxes," Seal recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he said, Detroit engineers were calling him for advice on 
building more aerodynamic cars.

 Dan Gurney, a championship driver from Le Mans to Indianapolis who now builds 
winning race cars in Santa Ana, thinks every time capsule should include an 
ignition key. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then," he says, "in 2094 somebody would recover it, recall the importance of 
the car and say, 'This, not the dog, was man's best friend.' " 
</P>
<P>
 French essayist Jean-Francis Held has taken that thought deeper, writing in a 
1990 UNESCO study that from its indelible position in literature, movies, art, 
business, social progress and national decay, the automobile exemplifies man -- 
and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 True. Rattletrap East German Trabants were a symbol of totalitarianism, then 
of German reunification. It's no coincidence that the wood-and-leather 
interiors of Jaguars and Rolls-Royces are suggestive of the comforts of a 
British gentlemen's club. The gray, heavy Mercedes-Benz personifies the 
stereotypical mind-set of Germany, and, with their Day-Glo paintings, flags and 
tassels, "jeepneys" are a rolling folk art unique to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 America's passages have always been linked to symbolic automobiles. The 
Roaring '20s belonged to Packard, the BMW was a yuppie car and baby boomers 
drive Volvos. Rebels without causes favored hot-rod coupes, and later cruisers 
flexed their Dodge and Mustang muscle cars. In the '90s, mini-trucks with trick 
hydraulics memorialize the hip-hop urban culture. 
</P>
<P>
 So, essayist Held suggests, if a collection of automobiles was preserved in a 
garage-tomb after a nuclear cataclysm, "some skillful archeologist . . . would 
be able to deduce from them everything that we were." 
</P>

 The Americans, for instance. Americans give their cars names, religiously wash 
them on weekends and, say the sociologists, generally treat their Toyotas like 
pets. Baby shoes and St. Christopher medals dangling from rearview mirrors are 
talismans to keep us, and our cars, safe. Vanity license plates are a form of 
jewelry, psychologists say. And any man cruising his stuff -- whether in a '32 
Ford hot rod or a Range Rover that will never tread mud -- usually is playing 
peacock to the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 We all have our favorites. Our President has said his most prized possession 
is a blue, six-cylinder 1967 Ford Mustang convertible he bought from his 
brother for $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, with its freeways, was made for cars. As a nation, we are 
spending $176 billion a year buying cars, $150 billion to fuel them and $60 
billion to insure them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us were conceived in cars, born in cars, eat in them, work in them and 
cover about 2 trillion miles a year in them. Each year, more than 40,000 
Americans die in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is intense and not without a downside. Psychologists say cars 
are steel bubbles obviating contact with other humans. Freeways avoid town 
centers, polarize cities and erode our sense of community. Without cars, we 
might hear the birds again, there could be air without particles and no 
drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as individuals and nations, the world continues to elevate the car as a 
fetish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty complex gestalt," acknowledged Robert Cumberford, a former GM 
designer and columnist with Automobile magazine. "They are still, to me, 
inefficient, unreasonable objects far from what they could be . . . but also a 
powerful icon, a powerful operating force for an enormous number of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents, to me, a freedom, an ability to go where I want to go, when I 
want to go. It's also a cozy little tin house you take with you. . . . Always, 
a car offers the possibility of endless adventures in distant places. And 
you're just not going to get that from public transportation."

 The passion is no weaker in Germany, where the recent recession has seen some 
purists moving to less expensive houses rather than selling their precious 
cars. For citizens born to the mechanical precision of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, 
Porsche and Audi, driving and not the destination is the thrill of car travel. 
There are no speed limits on the autobahns, and German motorists typically 
cruise in excess of 100 m.p.h. In town, drivers are noticeably aggressive and 
totally unforgiving. Said one Californian after a day behind the wheel in 
Berlin: "This is war in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans have the powerful National Rifle Assn. protecting their rights to 
own, bear and fire guns, Germans have the almighty All German Automobile Club 
lobbying against speed limits. The auto club issues bumper stickers to its 
members: "Free Driving for Free People." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Eastern Europe, car ownership and traffic volumes have doubled in 
the four years since the fall of communism. With a severe housing shortage, the 
nouveaux riches have few ways of flashing their status beyond buying expensive 
cars. Favorites are the Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Alfa Romeo. But 
taxation is excessive, and so are fees for plates and insurance -- on the 
premise that anyone who can afford a Mercedes can afford the equivalent of a 
month's pay to register it. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving schools in Eastern Europe are quick to flunk students, who are then 
ordered to take another expensive course of training. One woman in the 
Macedonian capital, Skopje, complained she had taken a 70-hour training course 
23 times and still hadn't earned a license. 
</P>
<P>
 In Western Europe, the car culture is more settled, but not what it once was. 
As the birthplace of Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Jaguar and Land Rover, Britain was a 
crucible of the automotive world. But Jaguar is now owned by Ford; GM controls 
Vauxhall; BMW recently bought Rover, and German wooing of Rolls-Royce and 
Bentley continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Rover gone, there are now no mass-production British car manufacturers 
under British ownership," noted Phil Llewellin, an automotive critic for 
London's Independent newspaper. "More and more these days, when I write about 
the great traditions of British sports cars, I'm writing about Bentleys winning 
at Le Mans, and that was decades before I was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a cottage sports-car industry remains, he says, one that includes such 
handcrafting companies as Griffith-TVR, Caterham and Morgan, with its work 
force of elderly artisans "happily turning out about 1.75 cars a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Peculiarly British is the company car. More than 60% of the automobiles in 
Britain are registered to companies that dispense them to ranking employees as 
perks. "That way, you can be seen in a 3-Series BMW that otherwise you could 
never afford," said Gordon Bruce, a London automotive publicist. "It relates to 
keeping up with the Joneses as an unspoken statement of your position and 
worth. People will actually work harder to get a better company car, because 
it's worth more as an outside symbol than a raise." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this vanity, there are no vanity plates in Britain. If luck of 
issuance produces a plate that might make a statement for someone, commerce 
flourishes. A recent advertisement listed for sale plate "1 BW." If your name 
is Bertie Witherspoon or you are the CEO of British Wedgwood, the plate would 
be a steal. For $27,750. 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, the car culture is as strong as in 
the automotive heartlands. Brand loyalty to Ford is almost a faith in 
Argentina. The manufacturer established a subsidiary there in 1913, rose to 
claim 43% of the market and saw its distributorships become community 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say in the interior that there was the church, the army and the Ford 
distributorship," noted Rodolfo Ceretti, a Ford executive in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's Falcon was prince of the pampas. It won stock car championships in a 
country whose national torch has been held high by racing immortals Juan Manuel 
Fangio and Carlos Reutemann. Almost half a million Falcons were manufactured in 
Argentina from 1961 to 1991. Now, Argentina has a new love. The Ford Escort, 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 India, a nation of 900 million people, is served by fewer than 2.5 million 
cars. Vast numbers of Indians have never been inside an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the middle-class precincts of Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore, automobiles 
are a home-grown parade of oddities. One is the cockroach-shaped, peppy but 
fragile Maruti 800. There's the Contessa Classic, the marriage of a 
British-built Vauxhall and an Isuzu engine. And the Ambassador, patterned on a 
1950s Morris Oxford and the limousine of choice for India's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new era approaches. Duties on imports are being reduced. Alliances are 
forming -- among them Hindustan Motors with General Motors, Premier Automobiles 
with Peugeot -- that will put the country on new wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, old, not new, is in. The Gaza Strip, for instance, is a 
place of neglected and potholed roads, of the promise of autonomy in the 
ongoing peace talks with Israel. The strip's two auto dealerships closed in 
1967, casualties of that year's Arab-Israeli War. In this battered territory, 
the king of the car cult for 900,000 largely poor Arabs is the Peugeot 404, the 
older the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car is like us -- tough, reliable and strong," said taxi driver Kamal Abu 
Hlail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly Souk Sayarat -- which takes place on a dirt field that doubles as a 
soccer pitch -- is Gaza's only used-car market. It forms each Saturday and is 
filled with scores of Peugeot 404s in varying states of proud decay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our situation, you can't own a better car," noted another owner. "It'll 
take you anywhere. Anyone can fix it. And it's a lot faster than a donkey." 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, the standard of living is rising, and the automobile is along for 
the ride. The number of cars at the end of 1992 was up 9% from 1991. And fatal 
accidents have increased accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Each country is distinct in the world of autos, and some present surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 * For all its power as a big-time automobile producer, Japan is in the minors 
when it comes to enjoying cars. There are few freeways. Tokyo is a city of 12 
million people built to handle half that number, and traffic is bumper to 
bumper. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the relative lack of room to move around, interest in 
four-wheel-drive vehicles and camper vans is growing. Commercial parks have 
opened where owners of 4WD vehicles can enjoy off-road travel without leaving 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, we never had RV shows," commented businessman and car 
enthusiast Hiroshi Soma. "Now, so many people want to go see camping shows." 
</P>
<P>
 * France is also a country with a new affection for sports utility vehicles 
and campers -- and a nation choking on vehicles, with 1.6 million cars 
competing each day for Paris' 1.3 million parking spaces. Traffic jams cost the 
city $300 million a year in wasted gasoline, particularly irritating when gas 
costs $3.50 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, scooters and motorcycles are replacing Renaults and Citroens in 
French affections. A recent study showed that 85% of all scooter riders are 
executives who live in cities. And in Paris, cycles and scooters are considered 
bon chic, bon genre. Rough translation: preppy. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Italy, the birthplace of Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati, sales of 
designer sports cars are flopping, with fewer on the streets than are seen 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Italy is now one of the richer countries in the world -- its gross 
national product exceeds all Latin America's -- scarred and battle-wise 
subcompact cars are a family norm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brazil, another nation famous for world racing champions -- Emerson 
Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna -- is slightly infamous as one of 
only two countries -- the other is Mexico -- still building Volkswagen Beetles. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit President Itamar Franco, a self-styled man of the people, who publicly 
swore affection for the enduring people's car and urged its return. Last 
summer, the Beetle was back in production in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an early frenzy of sales, but it hasn't lasted. Beetles priced at 
$7,000 currently are piling up at dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if there is one icon among all the automotive idolatry, it is the Beetle. 
Demanded by Adolf Hitler, designed by Porsche, the historic little car has 
remained in production somewhere in the world for more than half a century. 
Twenty-one million Beetles have sold, for a world record. That is 5 million 
units more than Henry Ford's Model T. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? One day they might stuff a Beetle into a time capsule.

 In Landshut, Germany, engineers painstakingly dismantle BMWs that have come to 
the end of the road. Like forensic surgeons performing an autopsy, they drain 
the tired hulks of fluids, strip off the metallic skins and remove engines and 
other vital components. 
</P>
<P>
 Each part is carefully labeled and set aside -- metals in one pile, plastics 
in another, rubber and glass into others. All that is left is a steel skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 The detritus is then sent to recyclers, modern-day alchemists whose job is to 
find a future for the used material.

 The process is repeated over and over in Landshut -- and in other pilot plants 
set up by BMW in the United States, Europe and Japan -- as the German luxury 
car maker tries to fathom how to recycle a larger portion of the materials in 
scrapped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gaining experience and knowledge that we are transferring into the 
design of our vehicles," said Karl-Heinz Ziwica, general manager of 
environmental engineering at BMW of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Today about 94% of scrapped vehicles are subjected to some amount of 
recycling, and about 75% of the material in those vehicles is reused. Most of 
the reusable matter is steel and other metals that make up a car's structural 
frame and major components, such as engines, transmissions and generators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder consists of plastics, fluids, rubber, glass and other materials 
that are more difficult to separate and recycle. These materials, shredded into 
waste known as fluff, usually end up in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of fluff disposed of each year is enormous. About 30 million 
vehicles are scrapped worldwide annually, according to auto makers and 
recyclers, and each can generate up to 600 pounds of non-salvageable waste. 
Pressure to recycle a greater portion of vehicles is increasing as landfill 
space diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the pressure greater than in Europe. Landfills are in short supply, 
costs of disposing of fluff -- often contaminated with operating fluids -- is 
rising, and political calls for more complete recycling are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, the strength of the Greens Party with its strong environmental 
agenda has led to regulations mandating car recycling. There, and in the rest 
of the European Union, each car manufacturer is considered responsible for its 
vehicles from the factory cradle to the junkyard grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, regulations have been proposed requiring car owners to take clunkers 
to recycling centers and obtain a certificate of disposal -- essentially a 
death certificate issued by an official car coroner attesting that the vehicle 
was given a proper burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the threat of stricter regulation, car makers in Europe, Japan and the 
United States are stepping up recycling research -- focusing on developing new 
dismantling techniques, designing vehicles for easy disassembly and finding new 
uses for plastics and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vehicle recycling is a worldwide issue because auto makers are sending their 
cars throughout the world," said Susan Yester, chairwoman of the Vehicle 
Recycling Project, a joint research effort of Detroit's auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, Toyota operates its own auto recycling plant. It also has a 
demonstration project in Europe to which its 870 German dealers send scrapped 
polypropylene bumpers. They are then ground up and remolded into new bumpers 
for the Carina E, a mid-size sedan sold in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has a goal to get from 75% to 85% recycling of auto parts by 
2000," said Jim Olsen, vice president of Toyota's U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge to recycling plastic parts is finding applications and 
markets for the new products. This requires looking beyond the auto industry. 
"Auto parts do not have to be recycled into autos," said Yester. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options are already being examined. Some plastic parts are ground up and 
used as an additive to strengthen concrete. The Big Three use recycled 
soft-drink bottles made out of the plastic resin polyethylene terephthalate for 
luggage racks and other parts on some new models. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors formed a consortium in 
1991 to study ways to increase the amount of a vehicle that is recycled. 
Recently, the partnership opened a recycling research center in Highland Park, 
Mich., to dismantle up to 500 vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three are focusing on the recycling of plastics. They are conducting 
research with the American Plastics Council, representing 27 major resin 
producers, and the Automotive Recyclers Assn., the trade group for many of the 
nation's 12,000 junkyard operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the average car contains about 245 pounds of plastics, about 8% of a 
typical vehicle's total body weight. That is up from an average of 60 pounds 
two decades ago. The amount of plastic is expected to continue to increase as 
demand for strong, lightweight materials grows to meet higher fuel-efficiency 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastics are found throughout cars -- in body and instrument panels, seats, 
seat belts, bumpers, taillight assemblies, battery casings, air bags, safety 
glass, gas tanks and engine components such as intake manifolds. 
</P>
<P>
 These parts are made from a wide variety of plastic resins, many of which are 
hard to identify in older cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They are often complex composites not compatible with other plastics, which 
makes the financial equation for plastic recycling problematic. Efforts to 
identify, separate, collect, process and find applications all add to the 
recycling cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major obstacle to recycling plastics is economics," said Jerry Fosnaugh, 
vice chairman of the plastics council's automotive group and recycling business 
director for Dow Plastics. "Our approach is to minimize cost and maximize value 
in order to create an economically viable recycling system." 
</P>
<P>
 Progress in disassembly design is also likely to have a positive impact on 
recycling in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW, for instance, has adopted several design principles gained from its 
Landshut research efforts: Components should be as light as possible and easy 
to remove; plastic components should be marked to specify their material; 
components should be made of compatible materials, and combinations of plastic 
and metal should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 The company applied some of these ideas with the launch of its Z1 roadster in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle's body is made entirely of recyclable plastic parts easily 
removed. More recently, the BMW 3-Series used coded recyclable and recycled 
parts for easy identification and dismantling. The company said more than 80% 
of the BMW 325i sedan is recyclable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we design for safety, we now also design for recycling," Ziwica said.

 Auto recycling actually dates to the Model T, says Ford Motor Co. Magnate 
Henry Ford built floor boards from wooden boxes used to ship bearings to his 
factory. Today, about 75% of the average automobile, mostly metals, is 
recycled. The rest, mostly plastics, is posing challenges to engineers and 
drawing fire from environmentalists.

 Recycled steel, iron: 70.4% Non-recycled plastics, fluids, rubber, glass, 
other: 24.0% Recycled aluminum, copper, lead, zinc: 5.6% The Traditional System 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the road for most old cars is a dismantler. Here is the usual 
process: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Stripping: Components that can be reconditioned, such as the engine, or 
sold for materials, such as the catalytic converter, are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Smashing: The remainder of the car is flattened and put through a rotary 
shredder, reducing it to fist-sized pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Metal extracting: Pieces are rolled under magnets, which extract iron and 
steel for sale to steel mills. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Sifting: Pieces are sifted or sometimes sorted by hand; heavy metals such 
as aluminum fall to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Dumping: The rest, including plastics, rubber and glass, is called "fluff" 
and goes to landfills. The New System 
</P>
<P>
 In an ideal future, old cars would be dismantled and 100% recycled at 
recycling plants. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Deregistration: Car owner takes old car to recycling plant. 2. Fluid 
removal: Oil, brake and other fluids, coolant, refrigerant are extracted. 3. 
Stripping: Components that can be sold as-is or reconditioned, such as the 
engine, are removed. 4. Disassembly: All plastic parts, rubber and glass are 
removed. 5. Final processing: Plastics and glass are sent to other plants for 
grinding and remolding. Metal is sent to steel mills. Rubber is shredded and 
reprocessed. Little is wasted. The Plastics Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Plastics are ever-growing components of cars, but they are hard to recycle. 
They come in many chemical formulas, often incompatible. So, two parts can't be 
remolded together to make a third. Or the parts are contaminated with oil or 
painted. Or they may be combined with metal parts and impossible to separate. 
Some Solutions: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regranulation: Plastics can be ground up and remolded to make new parts. This 
is already done by BMW and the Big Three. As an example, BMW takes components 
from air intake manifolds and processes them to help make camshaft covers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Design for dismantling: In 1988, BMW devised the Z1 roadster with an 
all-plastic body that was easily disassembled from the metal chassis. This 
allows plastic to be separated from metal and reprocessed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bottles to parts: Used bottles are gathered an ground into pellets, which are 
then combined with 35% glass and mineral. The result is a plastic that is then 
used by car companies to make side rails, window guides, luggage racks, tail 
lights, splash shields and other parts for new cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair: A plastic part may be salvageable for the used-parts market, either 
as-is or with repairs of cracks and other damage.

TOKYO REMAINS A FAVORITE IN THE AUTO WARS. IT HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD AND TOP 
TECHNOLOGY.

 Once seemingly invincible, the Japanese auto industry is suffering declines in 
both exports and domestic sales. Profits are falling, work forces are being 
trimmed. Has the juggernaut reached the end of the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts say no. After all, despite hard times now, it is the Japanese 
who taught the world how to build a first-rate car economically -- and how to 
market it abroad. Whatever the challenges, they will be heavyweight players for 
many decades to come. London-based Financial Times Business Information 
foresees 40% of the cars sold worldwide at the turn of the century bearing 
Japanese brand names. Pemberton Associates of Britain puts the figure at 50%. 
At present, the Japanese share is about 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the old self-confidence has been shaken. After a binge of investment in 
the late 1980s, Japanese auto makers have been battered by recession and a 
painfully strong yen, which drives up the price of their cars abroad. The days 
of export-led growth seem gone forever. Industry executives talk of building 
new factories overseas to promote growth, while holding their existing capacity 
in Japan to meet any rebound in domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession and yen appreciation "very heavily damaged the strength of 
Japanese auto manufacturers. . . . We are struggling for survival," said 
Yoshikazu Kawana, Nissan's executive managing director. At least two years will 
be needed to recover, said Mazda Executive Vice President Makoto Miyaji. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1971, Japanese auto makers have overcome one spurt after another in the 
value of the yen. But this time they have been staggered. The yen shot up more 
than 20% against the dollar at one point last year -- with devastating effects 
on export profits. Although the currency then softened for a while, last 
month's historic summit clash between President Clinton and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa sent it back to a near-record level. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate was regarded as competitive when it was 115 yen to the dollar. Now, 
Japan's auto makers face a rate of about 104 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong yen cost Japanese auto makers 300,000 cars in lost production last 
year, according to Richard Koo of Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, two new threats have entered the picture: the possibility that the 
Clinton Administration might take further action to force open Japanese markets 
-- perhaps a 25% tariff (a tenfold increase) on minivans and sport utility 
vehicles, which would effectively wipe out exports of those vehicles -- or 
American pressure for an additional increase in the value of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers' share of the U.S. car market slipped to 29.1% last year, 
down from 30.1% in 1992. And the situation was far worse at home, with sales 
down 7%. Of Japan's 11 manufacturers, only one -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. -- 
posted gains. Toyota, the Japanese giant, saw its profits in the second half of 
1993 sliced razor-thin. Nissan ran in the red last year, as did Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, reinvigorated competition from Detroit's Big Three -- General 
Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- may put further pressure on Japanese 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To offset declining profits at home and in the U.S. market, Japanese auto 
makers are seeking a major share of anticipated growth in Latin America, the 
Middle East and, especially, Southeast Asia. The strategy will be establishment 
of overseas assembly plants because many developing countries forbid imports of 
finished cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe profits in Japan will go down, but on the other hand, profit in the 
outside operations will go up," said Reijiro Kuromizu, a Mitsubishi managing 
director. "That's exactly what we're aiming at." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese are not giving up on exports. For instance, Mazda hopes to 
make itself competitive overseas even at an exchange rate of 100 yen to the 
dollar in the next two years, said Toshio Wakiya, manager of its North American 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the auto makers will once again rejuvenate their structure, and in two 
or three years become strong again," Miyaji, the company's executive vice 
president, predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's production "will become really global" by the year 2000, predicted 
Iwao Isomura, a Toyota executive vice president. "On the world scale we'll be 
producing about 6 million cars, with domestic production about 4 million." This 
would mean a doubling of overseas production. 
</P>
<P>
 As it looks to the future, the Japanese industry still has great advantages to 
draw upon. Its technology stands at the forefront of the world's auto makers. 
And of the 12 producers turning out 1 million or more cars a year, five are 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese factories already operating in the United States have a combined 
capacity of 2.4 million units a year, ensuring that they will remain major 
players in the world's biggest market. Investments in Southeast Asia have given 
the Japanese a big head start over their competitors in what is widely expected 
to be the world's next boom auto market. And throughout the world, including 
the United States, auto makers remain reliant upon the Japanese to supply 
top-quality parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the higher yen has a positive side. Overseas investments and imports of 
raw materials and parts become cheaper. And the excessive investments of the 
late 1980s in the home market mean there is fat that can be trimmed. Mazda's 
labor union chief, Takeshi Morikawa, cited several examples. 
</P>
<P>
 One step, he suggested, would be to reduce the number of models. Mazda, for 
example, increased its models from six to 30 between 1985 and 1992 and, as a 
result, was producing only 30,000 a year of some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Morikawa also said companies end their "excessive competition on sales." "We 
workers struggle to save even a single yen on the assembly line, and they (the 
management) spend 200,000 yen ($1,942) on incentives to sell a single car," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the trend toward offering consumers an ever-expanding array of 
choices is being reversed. "During the 'bubble era,' cars became overly high 
quality and overdesigned, and too expensive," said Toyota's Isomura. "After the 
bubble burst, people didn't want cars that were too expensive. The biggest 
issue now is how to redesign cars to be less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to meet that demand is already paying off, with the reduction of 
parts in new models exceeding 20%, Isomura said. Toyota and other manufacturers 
are also moving toward greater "commonization" of parts -- using the same parts 
for various models. 
</P>
<P>
 Pragmatic collaborations in which manufacturers make certain models for each 
other are growing. Toyota, for example, offers a fuller line of vehicles by 
procuring trucks from Hino and mini-cars from Daihatsu. Such hookups help keep 
Japan's weaker manufacturers alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmonious labor-management relations also offer Japanese auto makers hope for 
overcoming current difficulties. For example, workers who last year found 
themselves taking home smaller paychecks for the first time in decades have not 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign cars, while still a minuscule 3.1% of the market, are running against 
the trend. Last year, sales of imported vehicles rose 9.1%. Imports came mainly 
from Japanese plants in the United States -- which produce right-hand-drive 
cars for export to the home country -- and from European car makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports to Japan by Detroit's Big Three amounted to only 19,000 last year, or 
0.29% of the total market. Although Japan imposes no tariff on car imports, 
U.S. makers claim the market is closed -- chiefly because few dealers are 
willing to handle imports. Motor vehicle production (units)

 The earliest automobile of which there is a record was a two-foot-long 
steam-powered model constructed in 1668 by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Belgian Jesuit 
priest, and described in his "Astronomia Europaea." His model was possibly 
inspired either by Giovanni Branca's description of a steam turbine, published 
in his "La Macchina" in 1629, or even by "Nan Huairen," writings on "fire 
carts" in the Chu Kingdom (c. 800 B.C.).

 * Starting Oct. 1, a new form of sticker shock may afflict purchasers of new 
automobiles and trucks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to window stickers listing price and anticipated gasoline mileage, 
vehicles will be required to display a sticker providing information about the 
points of origin of the car or truck, and its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all-American convertible really all-American? The sticker should tell 
the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a law passed in 1992, the list must include the city and state or 
country where the vehicle was assembled, the place where the engine and 
transmission were built and the percentage of parts built in the United States 
and Canada or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be relatively easy for a car buyer to discover, for example, that 
the engine of a car that has caught his or her eye was built in South Korea, 
the transmission was assembled in Japan, 40% of the overall parts were made in 
the United States, 35% were built in Mexico and they all came together at a 
factory in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic-content labeling proposal was originally supported by the United 
Automobile Workers and Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.). The American 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn. signed on, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such regulations, said Steve Collins, the association's director of 
economics and international affairs, "there was no uniform basis by which to 
judge various claims of domestic content." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, particularly those representing foreign manufacturers, remain 
unconvinced, claiming that the requirements give preferential treatment to U.S. 
car makers in the calculation and could mislead buyers. JAMES GERSTENZANG /

 There was a time when Southern California prided itself as a top auto 
manufacturing center -- second only to Detroit. In South Gate, Commerce, Pico 
Rivera and Van Nuys, the Big Three auto makers churned out vehicles for a state 
and city that were wedded to the car, where freeways had surpassed palm trees 
as a civic symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women on the production lines earned a good wage for bone-wearying 
work. At the high point, more than 8,000 auto workers filled the plants around 
Los Angeles and shared the benefits of Southern California's boom economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a tight friendship on the line that spilled over to after-work 
activities. They were a family, and no strikes, layoffs or pay cuts could take 
that security from them. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed in the past two decades. The oil crises of the '70s drove 
down demand for luxury cars. Foreign competitors shipped in compacts, giving 
local auto makers a run for their money. Detroit consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Chrysler closed its plant in the City of Commerce. Nine years later, 
Ford shut down at Pico Rivera. General Motors folded its South Gate plant in 
1982, after a brief effort to compete with "J" cars -- compact Chevrolet 
Cavaliers. GM auto workers in Van Nuys thought their plant would never shut 
down, but it rolled out its last car -- a flame-red Chevrolet Camaro -- in 
August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all that remains of big-time auto production in California is a 
GM-Toyota joint venture in Fremont, which is making GM's Geo Prizms and Toyota 
Corollas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, there are only memories for now, and three former auto workers 
share theirs in this look at an era not long gone. 'We used to work almost 10 
hours a day' 
</P>
<P>
 When Jessie Dominguez was 17, he left college after one semester to go to work 
at GM's Van Nuys plant, hoping to make enough money to buy a car and then 
return to classes. Instead, he stayed almost 19 years, married and fathered 
three children. After the plant shut down in 1992, Dominguez and his family 
lived in limbo for a while. Now 37, he's back in school at Valley College, 
pursuing a degree in communications.  
</P>

<P>
 When I was hired by General Motors, I went right to the assembly line. Because 
of my youth, I was put into a very hard job there. I worked on the assembly 
line where I'd install steering columns in the cars. I would wire them up and 
secure them, bolt them down to floorboard and to the column. We used to work 
almost 10 hours a day. Back then, it was very common. 
</P>
<P>
 I went from that to what they called an ARO, which is an absentee replacement 
operator. Because I was able to learn a lot of jobs, you know, whenever 
somebody was sick, absent from work or was out on vacation, I would take over 
their jobs. I had to know at least 20 jobs. And the pay you got, I think, was a 
nickel (per hour) more for knowing that. 
</P>
<P>
 So, that's when I started doing my next job -- in repairs, and I did that for 
a number of years. At that point, say in '83, that was when I started getting 
involved with the union. I ran for an office in '84, and I became an executive 
board member. A lot of people knew my father (who was a union representative) 
very well. Because of my father's name, and because I was his son, for that 
reason, I became heavily involved in the union. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My work was like part of my life. It was the kind of work I enjoy. Working for 
the union, you work at a nonstop basis. You're not just a representative, 
you're a lot of times a confidant of the people. You're a social worker on one 
term and a negotiator with the management on another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when I worked on the assembly line, I enjoyed my work. I took pride in my 
work. I have no problem telling people I work for General Motors, I build cars. 
Working in an auto plant, you had a sense of prestige. We had a sense of, how 
do you say, satisfaction building cars. We didn't look at it as just, oh, it's 
just a product. We look at it as it's part of America. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I have a lot of friends that call me on the phone and ask me how I'm doing. 
Everywhere I go, to any shopping mall, anyplace, I always see someone from 
General Motors, and it's different. Every auto worker, when we see each other 
on the street, we'd stop, we'd hug, or hand shake, whatever the case may be, 
and we ask how you're doing, and we talk. The closeness is something I couldn't 
even describe. Because you grew up together. I went to General Motors as a 
teen-ager, became a young man and ultimately entered manhood at General Motors. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 What General Motors was doing was downsizing. The only auto plant that was 
remaining (in Southern California) was us. . . . In July '91, I think it was 
the second week, they ushered us all out to a meeting in the back yard. They 
brought in an individual from Detroit, Mich., one of their (General Motors') 
spokesmen. He came out with his speech, which was supposed to be, hey, General 
Motors' reasoning why they had to close the plant, and then announced the plant 
would close a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it was . . . I was breathless. I just sat there and (was) in shock. We 
couldn't believe what was told to us. We couldn't. What? This isn't happening 
-- we are just dreaming. A lot of us thought, no way. . . . People were stunned 
. . . stunned. People went home that day. Many times on a Friday, when the 
plant closed, people would go off to the local taverns and have a drink with 
their buddies. Everyone's in a cheerful mood. Nobody stayed around (that 
Friday). Everybody went straight home. 'The company used to have dances, get a 
big crowd' 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel (Manny) Talavera, 70, worked at Ford's Pico Rivera plant for 28 years. 
He had a good job and a good home. All that changed for him and his wife, Cora, 
when the plant closed. He was 56 and still had to make house payments. "What 
the hell am I going to do? Who's going to give you a job at 56 years old?" he 
asked himself at the time. The Talaveras recall the good old days, and the 
not-so-good ones.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel: The job? It was rough. I was spot welding. I had an easy job before. 
Well, I used to go by there (the Ford plant) every morning. I said, "One of 
these days, I'm going to come in here and apply for a job." So finally, one 
morning, I'm going to stop by and apply for a job. I was working graveyard at 
my other job. I was getting out at 6. So on my way home, it was 7 o'clock in 
the morning, I stopped by and got a job. I started working that same day. And I 
(was) working 10 hours a day. In 1952 -- February, 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Spot welding was hard. I would come home and my arms would be burning. My wife 
said, "Dinner's ready." Oh hell with dinner, I went straight to bed. I didn't 
take a shower or eat anything. I went straight to bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Cora: It's a wonder he survived all those years. Very hard, very hard. I mean 
he used to come home so exhausted that he would not be able to enjoy the food. 
He was hungry, but he couldn't even eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel: And it was a rough first few days, and . . . but jobs were scarce 
then, so I stuck it out. The pay was good, good benefits. But you have to work 
your butt off. I was 70 in December. I was 56 when they closed the plant down. 
. . . It was terrible! 
</P>
<P>
 I felt bad. What the hell am I going to do? Who's going to give you a job at 
56 years old? . . . I went on an early retirement. At Ford, you can retire (at) 
55 and 30 years' service. But since I only had 28 years and 56 years old, I 
went on a special. . . . Because I didn't have 30 years, I didn't get full 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 All these auto factories were rough -- Chrysler, General Motors, Ford. Well, I 
tell you, we had big turnover at the body shop where I used to work. Later on I 
started breaking in new people . . . hiring in. They started working and, next 
day, they won't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was heavy work, spot welding, putting the metal together. And you worked 
about 50, say, 55 minutes out of the hour. You're always on the go. It's harder 
than any other department in the auto industry putting the body together. You 
have to keep up with the line. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cora: I think the hardest job for him was when he was in the body. The spot 
welding machine is heavy. I remember you telling me your limbs hurt because you 
had to squat down for a few minutes. And when the car comes by, you (lift it 
up) and then again . . . ooo . . . it hurts right now (thinking about it). He 
created big muscles. I always remember the big muscles you created then. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel: The best was quality control. I had different jobs. They had me all 
over the place. I was like a utility man. If somebody was out, they'd throw me 
in there. And then at times I used to inspect the cars in the final (stage) 
before it goes, and check the front end . . . check for water leaks. I had 
different jobs. Quality control was a lot easier. You didn't get dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora: He really went through a lot. Sometimes he comes home tired and the kids 
are ready for baseball, to go practice. He did a lot for them. He did! He 
always has, always. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel: I was involved in Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora: Oh yeah, all the time. And now they appreciate that. My younger son has 
two kids. He has a little boy too. And he says, "God, I don't see how Dad used 
to do it. I have half the job he has, and it's hard for me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel: No, no regrets. Ford is a good company to work for. Real good friends. 
We still get together. Yeah. The company used to have dances, get a big crowd. 
We work together, we associate. We used to form our softball team, played 
baseball for my department. Every department had a team. So, we used to play 
each other after work. And we like to get the tension out of our system. Don't 
get old. Once you get old, you fall apart. 'At first, the men didn't want us 
around' 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Martin, 52, of Sylmar was one of the first women to join General 
Motors' Van Nuys plant. During her 22 years there, she fought sexism, took care 
of two children and gave birth to two more. "The money and benefits were good . 
The job was hard," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I started at the bumper line, assembling the bumpers. It was in the 1970s. It 
was the assembly line. Everybody was on the line, and I had my part to do. It 
starts from the bumper taillights, gutters. The bumper line would be the main. 
People were there to reach for the bumper to fix it to the car. 
</P>
<P>
 It was heavy. It was a man's job. When I first started there, many, many times 
I thought of quitting. The money and benefits were good, the job was hard. The 
moment I hit the pillow, my arms would hurt so much. My bones, my joints, my 
muscles -- they were aching. But when I saw my first paycheck, I said to my 
ills and pains: "Hang in there; we got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard part were the first seven, eight years. After that, the people were 
more gentle. On my first day, the foreman told me that "this is going to be 
your job. You have three days to learn this job. If you don't learn it in three 
days, out you go." I showed him that a woman can do this job. And I showed him. 
They treated us like men from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they, the men, didn't want us around. For them, it was like their 
own private kingdom. What made them hire women was because of federal laws: Ten 
percent of employees had to be women. It all started in Detroit. The government 
made them hire women. It was equal right. 
</P>
<P>
 Men used to mistreat us, giving us the hardest jobs. They wanted to make sure 
they made it hard for us so we would hang (up) the apron and leave. They used 
to harass us with Playboy magazines. They used to hang pictures on the assembly 
line with Playboy magazines. Ooo . . . that used to get us so mad. 
</P>
<P>
 When I worked there, I had two children already. And that was another job! 
Now, I don't understand how I did it. I got off work at 3:30 a.m. At 7:30 a.m., 
I was up already, getting my son ready for school. When I came home, I would do 
the chores and clean the house, cooking. Sometimes, I would take the time to 
take a nap before work. Sometimes, I wouldn't. By the time I went to work, the 
house is clean, dinner cooked. God knows how I did it. My husband, he wanted me 
to quit. He could tell in my eyes that I needed sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here we are. I have two boys and two girls. I'm proud I was able to help 
my husband raise our kids and give them education. It takes sacrifices, and it 
takes two. 
</P>
<P>
 I retired in November, 1992. It was like leaving a family, a family that 
split. We used to organize potluck. Everything started with one green salad. 
Everybody get together and enjoy a big meal. Everybody looked at me as their 
mother. I was 50 when I left. 
</P>
<P>
 Even over here, just now, I stopped at the store, I met a couple I worked 
with. Everywhere I go, I see someone I know. My kids will say, "Must be GM, 
huh?" Motor-vehicle registrations

GLOBOCARS: THE NEXT CENTURY; THE NATION THAT'S MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT GROWTH; 
SOUTH KOREA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH BOTH A NOTABLE INDUSTRY OF ITS OWN AND A 
BOOMING DOMESTIC MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korea is not what one would call motorist-friendly. In the parking lots 
of apartment complexes, spaces are so rare that cars are left in lanes, 
unlocked so other motorists can push them out of the way when they want to pull 
out. Most homes have no room at all for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes make up as much as 40% of the price tag of a new car and drive the cost 
of gasoline to more than three times U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, by the year 2000, virtually every household in South Korea is expected to 
own at least one car. The era of "motorization" is under way; and with it, 
Korean auto makers, which now stir only passing interest from international 
rivals, are emerging as major global players. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai, which produced 960,300 cars, trucks and buses in 1993, appears 
certain to add its name this year to the elite ranks of 12 world auto makers 
with production of more than 1 million units. Kia also is expected to join the 
club before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2000, the Korean auto industry is expected to turn out at least 
3.2 million vehicles and brush shoulders with Canada as the world's 
fifth-biggest producer (Japan, the United States, Germany and France will head 
the list). Last year, production edged above 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exports, which reached 630,000 last year, are expected to surpass the 1 
million mark by the turn of the century -- a conservative estimate since this 
year's prospect for overseas sales is 815,000 vehicles. Rhee Du Whan, senior 
fellow of Hyundai Research Institute, put his turn-of-the-century forecast at 
1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a measure of enthusiasm, South Korea's Big Three auto makers -- 
Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo -- have announced plans to challenge Japan by building 
factories to assemble 2 million vehicles a year in the next decade in 
developing countries that ban imports of finished products. No other nation's 
auto industry is as optimistic as South Korea's on opportunities for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 This, for instance, is the only nation that possesses both a booming domestic 
market and a notable industry of its own. In addition, it sits in Asia, the 
region expected to provide the fastest market growth in the next decade. Japan, 
North America and Europe, by contrast, have strong industries but do not 
anticipate exceptional growth. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at least until the turn of the century, South Korea's domestic market 
will remain unsullied by imports, auto makers agree, despite American trade 
negotiators' knocks on the door. Imports from Japan are banned overtly, and 
only about 4,000 cars from other countries are sold here each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The next six years are crucial to the Korean industry because demand will slow 
after the turn of the century. Replacements will become the main prop of 
growth, instead of first-time purchases, said Kang Soon Gon of the Ministry of 
Trade, Industry and Energy's transportation machinery division. 
</P>
<P>
 There are problems, however. Despite the industry's tenfold growth in the past 
12 years, Western economic analysts raise eyebrows at its expansion plans. "The 
industry's production is so inefficient that just expanding won't solve its 
problems," said one diplomat who asked not to be named. "Even at Hyundai, the 
cost structure is uncompetitive internationally. And with this background, the 
push to expand seems wildly unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite its 10.3% production growth in 1993, Hyundai's profits fell 
during the year -- to about $62.5 million on sales of around $8.8 billion,said 
Lee Sang Bae, an auto analyst at Dongsuh Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daewoo, meanwhile, is estimated to have lost $87.5 million in 1993 and is not 
likely to show a profit until 1995, Lee said. Ssangyong, with a $25-million 
loss last year, will remain in the red until 1996 when it starts manufacturing 
passenger cars, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the skeptical Western diplomat admitted that he would not have 
predicted the demand that now exists in the Korean market. He also praised 
Korean auto makers' "gutsy CEOs." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Korea has seven auto firms, but three of them are sister 
companies of Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo. The fourth independent, Ssangyong, 
manufacturers sports utility vehicles, buses and trucks. In the wings are the 
Samsung and Halla conglomerates, both of which plan to start manufacturing 
heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the potential for labor strife remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has no labor troubles at all, but . . . whether the (Korean) companies 
are in good shape or bad shape, they always have a problem," said Ha Yung Ku, 
vice president of Citibank here. 
</P>
<P>
 But Korea's auto makers remain optimistic. Despite a disastrous collapse in 
U.S. sales when American consumers suddenly turned their backs on Hyundai in 
1989, Korea is set to make a new effort in the American market. On Feb. 3, Kia 
joined Hyundai in establishing its own dealerships in 11 Western states. Daewoo 
President Kim Tae Gou says his company "is working on" exporting its own cars 
to the United States in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the move is coming after, rather than before, the establishment of 
a substantial base of exports elsewhere -- mainly Latin America, Southeast Asia 
and the Middle East. And this time, Korean makers declare they intend to build 
up after-service networks, unlike Hyundai when it made its 1985 splash into the 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhee of Hyundai said that Korea could win a 5% share of the U.S. market by 
2000, or about 500,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the appreciation of the Japanese yen, Korea's cars in all 
ranges have regained a price advantage of between $1,500 and $2,000 over 
Japanese models, Kang said. Small cars now stand nearly equal in quality to 
Japan's, although medium-sized and large models lag far behind, the ministry 
official added. 
</P>
<P>
 All four auto makers continue to rely on foreign help in technology -- Hyundai 
from Mitsubishi, Kia from Ford and Mazda, Daewoo from Honda and Suzuki, and 
Ssangyong from Daimler-Benz -- "which shows they still have some things to 
learn," Kang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the gap will be closed quickly. Look how far we have come with an 
auto-making history of less than 30 years," he added. Motor-vehicle production

 The words of the founder remain true. "We have remade this country with 
automobiles," Henry Ford wrote in 1926. "But we do not have these automobiles 
because we are prosperous. We are prosperous because we have them." 
</P>
<P>
 The automobile has been an industrial and a social revolution rolled into one; 
its importance transcends categorization. 
</P>
<P>
 It has employed people and improved them. From the start, when Ford hired 
unskilled immigrant workers to produce his Model T, right through to the 
present when one job in six in the United States, Japan and Western Europe is 
linked to the automobile, the car has been an economic and social engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto workers bought cars and houses and educations for their children. The 
auto industry drove science and technology, spurring knowledge of power and 
propulsion, metallurgy and manufacturing. And it created highways and suburbs 
and new kinds of cities. It raised living standards in the United States and 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 And more recently it has brought all those wonders to new countries. South 
Korean farm boys fresh from the fields now are capable of fashioning Hyundai 
cars -- and the engines and computer chips that power them. Chinese, Indian, 
Russian and Indonesian farmers are learning to do likewise. The revolution 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a successor to Henry Ford, like many Americans now frustrated by clogged 
freeways, had forgotten that when he met a boss of the Soviet Union in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. McNamara, former secretary of defense and former head of Ford Motor 
Co., was president of the World Bank when he visited Moscow for the first time 
and met with the late Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union, then as always, was struggling to create a civilian economy. 
But McNamara opened the conversation by telling Brezhnev how pleasant it was 
that Moscow streets were relatively free of traffic. The Soviets could "avoid 
the problems of the automobile," McNamara said sunnily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, Brezhnev slapped his desk for emphasis and growled: "We must have an 
automobile industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian had it right, perhaps because he recalled a visit by Soviet 
emissaries to Henry Ford in the 1920s. They wanted Ford to build tractors in 
the Soviet Union -- tractors, not cars, because they did not need "luxury" 
goods just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car is not a luxury," Ford told them. "You ought to buy automobiles and 
get your people used to machinery and moving about with some freedom. The motor 
car will bring roads and then it will be possible to get the products of your 
farms to the cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets never got the crops to town, probably because they did not share 
Ford's belief in the importance of "freedom." Perhaps the Russians will. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be understood that Ford did not invent the car. He invented a 
process for making cars called the assembly line that profoundly affected labor 
relations the world over. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar way in 1949, Taiichi Ohno, a Toyota production engineer, 
concentrated on what workers did to invent a system called lean production that 
improved upon Ford's assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's insight was that through interchangeable parts he could reduce the time 
and cost of the craft system in which a skilled artisan assembled most of an 
automobile. It took more than 12 hours of work to make a car that way. Ford's 
assembly line, in which each worker performed only a single task, reduced that 
to 1 1/2 hours, an 88% reduction in cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The system greatly broadened the industrial working class, and it paid them 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford paid his workers $5 a day in 1914, arousing protests from other employers 
but creating new customers for the motor car, the new mass transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford himself was neither a model employer nor a model businessman. He hired 
goons and gun-toting executives to rough up unionizing workers in the 1930s and 
almost sank his company by insisting on selling cars in only one color, black. 
</P>
<P>
 His rival, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., chairman of General Motors, moved past Ford by 
offering customers cars in five styles and price ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 But both their systems relied on the economies of mass production -- making as 
many cars as possible so as to spread the costs of plant and machinery over 
more units and thereby reduce the price of each car. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big-company strategy, seemingly impregnable to competition from 
smaller car makers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in postwar Japan, Ohno of Toyota couldn't count on long production runs -- 
his company made 2,685 cars in all of 1950, less than half the daily output of 
a single Ford plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ohno, who with his boss, Toyota Chairman Eiji Toyoda, toured Ford's Rouge 
plant in Detroit, noticed that in their eagerness to run as many cars as 
possible through the assembly line, U.S. makers allowed defects to go through 
and corrected them at the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohno changed the emphasis to getting it right the first time. Workers could 
stop the line to make sure parts were properly attached, so there was no need 
for a repair department at the end. The system gave line workers 
responsibility, so there was less need for checkers and supervisors. It was a 
recognition that the mindless labor of a former day -- the assembly line work 
satirized by Charlie Chaplin in "Modern Times" -- did not suit the new, 
intelligent factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohno's lean production system also sharply reduced inventories and devised 
ways to change models in minutes as opposed to days, and thereby made short 
production runs economic. 
</P>
<P>
 He reduced total car assembly time and cost by 56%, built Toyota into the 
third-largest car producer in the world and opened the way for new countries 
and smaller producers to participate in the automobile business. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp., for example, has adapted lean production enthusiastically 
because it allows profitable manufacture of many kinds of vehicles, from Jeeps 
to minivans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing lasts forever. Just as Ford's mass production ran its course, 
so Ohno's production system has now become an excuse for bureaucracy and labor 
discontent at Toyota, reports analyst Maryann Keller in "Collision," her new 
book on the global auto industry as it faces the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That century, which in a sense has already begun, is making new demands on 
automobiles and their producers, covering everything from the environment to 
traffic congestion to road safety -- air bags are only a beginning. It's 
probably the internal combustion engine's last roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 The new century will see a new kind of vehicle, powered electrically by a fuel 
cell or similar device, which may well be developed and produced in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also likely that the automobile industry of the 21st Century, at 
least in the United States, Japan and Europe, will become an adjunct to 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envision a great variety of patterns, substituting communication for 
transportation," says futurist Alvin Toffler. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications today refers to the new industry combining computers, 
telephones and televisions that is already creating new values, reducing costs 
dramatically and changing the nature of work -- producing, in short, its own 
industrial and social revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ford would have understood. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Today and Tomorrow," his 1926 book, he wrote: "The progress of the world 
has been in direct ratio to the convenience of communications."

GLOBOCARS / THE NEXT CENTURY; THE CAR OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood? Instead of pulling over at the closest gas 
station, the driver of the future will rely on a voice-activated video display. 
According to car designers, the car of the future will have many such gadgets 
to ease driver stress and bolster highway safety. Among the high-tech features 
in development or under consideration: 
</P>
<P>
 1. All-aluminum six-cylinder engine runs on gasoline. To increase fuel 
efficiency, it shuts down one bank of cylinders for more-efficient, 
three-cylinder city driving. Optional: a hybrid engine that runs on natural gas 
or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Sensors installed on roads will provide a variety of navigation tips. Is 
the Golden State or the Hollywood Freeway your best route north? Check out the 
navigation display for the latest driving times or Sig-alerts. Are there 
parking spots available near the mall? The system will show you. Also, 
available, a CD-ROM library filled with maps of the area. Need a new stereo? 
Call out your destination and the voice-activated library will display the 
closest electronics dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 3. You're not alone out there. A system of satellites helps the navigation 
display determine your exact location. A red dot moves on the display as you 
move. A blue line shows the shortest route to your destination. Such 
technology, known as Global Positioning Systems, uses triangulation to pinpoint 
your position, bouncing the ground signal off of three satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Solar panels on the vehicle's roof help recharge batteries on your car, 
making them last longer. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Collision-avoidance systems located near the rear license plate will detect 
suprises, such as cars in your blind spot as you back out of the driveway. 
Using lasers, such systems will alert you to everything from a kid's bike in 
the driveway to an 18-wheeler bearing down too quickly. Video cameras may also 
be incorporated into such systems. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Sensors in the door alert you to danger approaching from the right or left. 
Or, as you try to fit into a tight parking spot, the sensors can tell you how 
far you are from the curb, the distance to the car behind you, even when to 
turn the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Laser beams scan the road ahead for pedestrians, cars and any another 
potential hazard. The system determines whether the object is in the way by 
calculating your car's speed and direction. If an object enters your "caution 
zone" and you do not respond to a warning buzzer, the car's computer may 
activate an emergency braking system.

COUNTY IS STILL AMONG STATE'S MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Despite the real estate downturn, Orange County remains one of the state's 
most expensive housing markets and its home buyers are generally richer than 
their counterparts elsewhere in California, according to a newly released 
survey by Chicago Title & Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The median home price in 1993 for first-time Orange County buyers was 
$172,200, according to the study, called "Who's Buying Homes in California." 
The only two markets in the state more expensive than Orange County were San 
Francisco, where first-time buyers spent $234,300, and Ventura, where the 
median was $183,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Among repeat buyers -- those who have previously owned a home -- the median 
price of an Orange County residence in 1993 was the second highest in the state 
at $252,600. San Francisco had the most expensive homes for repeat buyers, with 
a reported $267,700. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County residents are better able than most Californians to afford 
such pricey homes. The study found that Orange County had the highest reported 
median household income in the state, $77,500. San Francisco was second with 
$71,900 median income. 
</P>
<P>
 The national study randomly surveyed 1993 home buyers in eight California 
markets: San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, the San Francisco area and the Central Valley. Conducted every year 
since 1976 by Chicago Title, the nation's largest title insurer, the study 
surveys new-home and repeat buyers by telephone and analyzes buying trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a diverse suburban community (but it is) still a bedroom 
community of Los Angeles. You can get houses on a hill, houses in a valley, 
houses near the ocean -- you can get anything you want. But it's geared 
primarily for families, especially move-up families," said John Pfister, 
manager of marketing research for Chicago Title. "You've got mostly upscale 
housing, and as a result it's one of the most expensive markets in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Orange County had the lowest percentage, 34.3, of first-time 
buyers in all of California. In Los Angeles, 57.4% of buyers were first-timers, 
the highest percentage in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pfister cautioned that these figures could be misleading, as Los Angeles 
County could have fewer repeat buyers than Orange County, which would boost the 
percentage figures for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally in a recession, the first-time home buyers would be in the market, 
but Orange (County) had the lowest percentage, which is kind of odd," Pfister 
said. "But that may not be indicative of anything more than that in Orange 
County, first-time buyers bought in 1992, and repeat buyers are coming back in 
the market stronger there than other areas in California." The 1993 Orange 
County Home Buyer

 Both first-time and repeat buyers preferred resale, single-family homes over 
new homes or condos. Repeat buyers tended to scout the market longer, shopping 
an average of five months and viewing an average of 14.6 houses. A statistical
