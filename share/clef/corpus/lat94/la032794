By Michael S. Kimmel, Michael S. Kimmel, a sociology professor at the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook, is the author of the forthcoming 
Manhood: The American Quest (HarperCollins). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Moore rides the crest of the New Age's second wave. There's nothing 
glamorous or seductive in his books, no channelers with crystals counting up 
past lives, no mythopoeic male drummers off bonding in the woods, no 
Birkenstock-footed purveyors of herbal elixirs as conduits to cosmic 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore promises less -- much less. His books may tap into that same hunger for 
meaning, but his table is set with much simpler fare. His recipe for soul food 
offers contemporary seekers a turn inward, a groping toward something deeper 
and more authentic, a way to ground experience in ways less tangible and 
material, and yet deeply fulfilling and satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has certainly struck a chord with the American book-buying public. 
"Care of the Soul," which dispensed such everyday wisdom, has spent half a year 
on the bestseller list, and sold a quarter-million hardcover copies; the 
just-published "Soul Mates" offers a steadier focus on relationships. If, as 
Hillary Rodham Clinton observed, America "suffers from sleeping sickness of the 
soul," Moore wants to be our national wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 A scholar, therapist and theologian -- he spent several years in a Catholic 
monastery, leaving just before taking vows -- Moore answers a difficult call, 
to minister to the loss of soul in contemporary life (he calls this "the 
greatest malady of the 20th Century") and to do it in a style that is 
immediately accessible for mass readers, and instantly usable in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the soul isn't all that complicated. It "has a strong desire and need 
for intimacy, and it loves vernacular life -- the particular place, family, 
friends, and neighborhood that are part of our daily lives," he writes. "The 
soul doesn't thrive on grand schemes of salvation or on smooth, uncluttered 
principles." And soul doesn't need elaborate choreography. It's the "small 
things," the "ordinary things," those quotidian moments of intimacy and of 
deep, nurturing solitude that feed a hunger Wolfgang Puck can never satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
 What the soul does thrive on is connection. Drawing on Jungian archetypes, 
ancient mythologies and folksy philosophy, Moore's books are prose-poems of 
compassion and tenderness. His soothingly graceful prose is a balm for egos 
battered by hostile takeovers, anguished divorces and 
do-it-to-them-before-they-do-it-to-you public philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 So forget those Reaganomic adages about looking out for No. 1 and having the 
most toys when you die. Soul needs other people. Deeply. Self versus others is 
a false polarity to the soul, Moore wisely insists. To Moore, the only form of 
self-help is the self-acceptance that comes from engaging more deeply in the 
details of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a kindness in Moore's books that is sorely lacking in public policy 
and interpersonal relations. Who could be so callously critical of books that 
speak to our deeply human needs to belong, to feel heard, to be loved, to love? 
It's something like being in favor of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there is something facile about Moore's revitalization of the soul, 
something about this search for depth that only skims the surface. Moore offers 
neither the promise nor the peril of psychoanalysis, confronting the darkest 
and murkiest parts of the unconscious. Instead, his is a practical guide to a 
subcutaneous layer of experience, the realm of self-acceptance and self-esteem 
without the hard work that some of us believe is necessary to clear away the 
layers of defensive armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore shares this problem with the entire genre (especially Robert Fulghum and 
M. Scott Peck). Practical spirituality almost invariably sounds trivial, 
especially when the search for the cosmic is scaled back to paying attention to 
everyday detail. Want to make contact with the soul, you might ask? Take a 
walk, listen to music, keep a diary. Write a letter. "Letters offer the 
opportunity to express our feelings," Moore offers in "Soul Mates." (How about 
E-mail?) Talk with a friend. "To the soul, there is hardly anything more 
healing than friendship." Remember birthdays and anniversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, caring for the soul sounds a lot like having good manners, 
especially when it comes to the family, that seat of soul, its literal and 
symbolic home base. Moore enumerates ways to "honor and celebrate" the family 
-- "parties, conversations, cards and letters, visits to grave sites, journeys 
to see family members, honoring family homesteads and possessions, handing 
furniture and clothing down from generation to generation." This is soul work 
for the "Little House on the Prairie" crowd. I wonder if my younger sister will 
be moved to read that wearing my outgrown overalls was an index of soulful 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The retreat to homespun virtues of the hearth indicates the deeply 
conservative nature of works like Moore's. Though he accepts a liberal's 
embrace of diversity and celebration of difference -- he treats women and men 
with equal dignity and believes that other family forms besides the nuclear can 
be equally nurturing of soul -- he also is deeply suspicious of change. Soul 
expresses itself, in fact, through "resistance to change," he writes. "A 
particularly soulful person might turn down a good job offer, for example, 
because he doesn't want to move from his home town." 
</P>
<P>
 The life of the mind is equally suspect here. "There is some wisdom in retreat 
from intellectual conquest," Moore writes. Soul work "doesn't require grand 
revelations, superior interpretations, or ultimate conclusions" -- as if that's 
what intellectual engagement promises. Excessive reading may even take us away 
from soul work. "The soul is not meant to be understood," is his sage advice. 
"The heart has its own reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. Moore's counsel to return to homespun verities does not mean 
having to go without. Moore's soul floats weightlessly on a sea of consumerism. 
"The products of our work are like the image in the pond -- a means of loving 
ourselves," he writes in "Care of the Soul." No hair shirts or Spartan 
undecorated rooms for these post-modern soul cultivators. 
</P>
<P>
 But no Trump Towers either. Moore's is a philosophy for a scaled back 1990s, a 
decade of recovery from the excesses of Reaganism. Here's a set of moral tenets 
for the downwardly mobile, who seek solace and reassurance in home and family, 
in part because the rewards of wealth and power are no longer available, and in 
part because they didn't work. Why would all those yuppie fast-trackers wear 
power ties and eat power lunches if they truly felt powerful? (When the going 
gets tough, accessorize.) But power isn't something you consume, Moore might 
say, it's something you feel from being grounded in time and place. And he has 
a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath such reassuring platitudes, though, lies a more profoundly 
conservative impulse. Like other works that employ Jungian archetypes, Moore 
offers a definition of soul that can look only backward. He taps a nostalgic 
yearning for Rousseauian innocence that was possible only in a mythic past, 
when people felt both rooted in place and connected to one another. 
History-as-myth filters the history of real people through the rosiest of 
lenses. Oh, for the simple, soulful life of the medieval peasant! 
</P>
<P>
 I confess to being occasionally swept away by such nostalgic longings myself, 
but surely no one in his or her right mind would make out of it a philosophy of 
relationships -- or "relationship" as Moore calls it portentously (and 
gratingly) in "Soul Mates." Our medieval peasant, so connected to kith and kin, 
was also the bottom link of an intractable hierarchy, with no moral, political 
or emotional choices. Quotidian violence and brutality was hardly nourishing of 
the soul. Only in such a world could a philosophic tenet like the Great Chain 
of Being feel soothing. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not raiding pre-Enlightenment manors for meaning, Moore borrows 
liberally from other cultures' mythic warehouses. Or, at least he borrows those 
myths he likes, conveniently ignoring the less soulful ones. It's as if one 
could glide effortlessly down the aisles of a giant cosmic cultural shopping 
mall, where the world's cultures and archetypes were neatly arrayed by 
category. To take myths out of their cultural contexts, though, because those 
contexts might not be so conducive to soul work, is, in my view, an act of 
appropriation, a cultural imperialism far more insidious than the Tomahawk 
Chop. No wonder Native Americans are wary of New Age interlopers. 
</P>
<P>
 To make this mythologized, fictional past the guidebook for future 
relationships is to depoliticize everyday life. I don't mean the politics of 
the electoral college, but a vision of politics as the promise of collective 
action to transform the world. Moore wants us to feel well, not to do good. 
"Getting to know and love yourself means accepting who you are, complete with 
your inadequacies and irrationalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Why strive toward virtue when you experience the pleasure of self-acceptance? 
Why earn self-respect when you can have self-esteem? Why try to move when 
you're already there? Why struggle to create new possibilities when, in the 
end, there's no place like home? Right, Dorothy?

AN EVOLUTIONARY JUNGLE; THE GREAT DIVORCE, BY VALERIE MARTIN (DOUBLEDAY: 
$22.50; 340 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Francine Prose, Francine Prose's most recent book is the story collection, A 
Peaceable Kingdom. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valerie Martin's "The Great Divorce" is the kind of fiction that can briefly 
refocus and broaden the scope of what we notice about the world. Not long after 
finishing the novel, I found myself paying rapt attention to a TV advertisement 
for a collection of videotapes that seemed made up of scenes of snarling jungle 
creatures ripping each other to shreds. "Find out why we call them animals," 
droned the portentous voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who we are to call them animals, of what distinguishes us from 
our near neighbors on the evolutionary ladder, is one that has frequently 
engaged Valerie Martin -- in her story collection, "The Consolation of Nature," 
and also in her novels, most recently, "Mary Reilly," whose heroine was the 
servant of the all-too-human Dr. Jekyll and the beastly Mr. Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
 In her intellectually ambitious and readable new book, she employs three 
distinct, interlocking and thematically related narratives as a prism with 
which to refract and study the laser-thin bands of light and darkness that 
divide supposedly socialized humans from purely instinctive, ravening beasts. 
The three plots form a sort of triptych with the central and most fully drawn 
panel depicting a succession of upheavals in the life of Ellen Clayton, a 
dedicated veterinarian employed by the New Orleans zoo, with a tolerably 
troubled marriage and two spirited young daughters. As Ellen struggles to 
combat a deadly viral infection threatening the zoo population, she fails to 
notice, until it's too late, that her marriage is in serious jeopardy, and that 
her daughters are less resilient than she had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening out from this pivotal drama (again, like the panels of a triptych) are 
two less conventional narratives, both of which concern young women with 
mysterious and somewhat less than healthy psychic connections to cats -- and 
feline violence. Like Ellen, 19-year-old Camille also works at the zoo; she 
takes care of the lions, leopards and tigers. Unsurprisingly, Camille feels 
closer to the animals in her charge than to her nasty, destructive mother and 
to the disheartening array of men with whom Camille engages in alienated and 
degrading sex. The third and final story line involves a figure from the last 
century, Elizabeth Schlaeger, the so-called "catwoman of St. Francisville" -- 
convicted and executed in the 1840s for the murder of her husband. In the 
course of his historical research, Ellen's husband Paul gradually uncovers the 
disturbing events of Elizabeth's brief, tragic life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the actual weather in the novel is typical of hot, humid New Orleans, 
we feel somehow that the book's main events are all occurring under darkening 
thunderclouds and over the ominous rumble of a violent, gathering storm. This 
aura of mounting tension helps connect the three interwoven plots, as does the 
wide-ranging curiosity and considerable intelligence of Ellen, the book's most 
accessible and sympathetic character. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen's meditations on our progressively attenuated relationship to the 
natural world provide a unifying philosophic dimension to these cautionary 
tales of women pushed to the point at which the thin cloak of civilization 
drops, with dire result, from their shoulders. "The Great Divorce" of the title 
does not refer solely to its heroine's unraveling marriage but also to the 
"breakup between the human species and the rest of nature, which like all 
divorces was causing pain in many quarters." Some of the most incisive sections 
of the book concern the evolution -- or de-evolution -- of our attitude toward 
wildness and our efforts to keep it at bay: 
</P>
<P>
 "How ironic that the only animal capable of appreciating natural beauty is the 
one bent on destroying it, the one capable of actually creating ugliness." 
</P>
<P>
 It's to Valerie Martin's credit that she has been able to write this nervy, 
risk-taking novel -- so fraught with all the trappings of High Gothic 
heartbreak and violence, with cat women prowling antebellum plantations and the 
decadent New Orleans art scene -- without ever descending into the sort of 
purple, overwrought heavy-breathing that Anne Rice has unleashed upon the 
world. "The Great Divorce" is impressively controlled and restrained, and it 
seems as if the writer is having fun with amusing (and unattributed) quotes 
from the cinematic versions of "Cat People," the original Jacques Tourneur film 
and Paul Schrader's more recent homage. 
</P>
<P>
 Only near the very end does a hint of murkiness cloud these otherwise clear 
waters, as Ellen's reflections (and the book's sentence structure) grow more 
convoluted, until they require more effort to disentangle than, we fear, they 
may repay. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are minor failings in an otherwise fine novel that most often 
engages our sympathy -- as well as out intellect. "The Great Divorce" provides 
the immediate pleasures of a literary page-turner, but also has a more lasting 
influence, an effect that we know has stayed with us as we suddenly sit up to 
watch the tiger tearing its prey on our flickering TV screen.

DOING THE DIRTY WORK; THE COMMANDOS: THE INSIDE STORY OF AMERICA'S SECRET 
SOLDIERS, BY DOUGLAS C. WALLER (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $23; 399 PP.) ; WARRIOR 
DREAMS: PARAMILITARY CULTURE IN POST-VIETNAM AMERICA, BY JAMES WILLIAM GIBSON 
(HILL & WANG: $23; 357 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred Schruers, Fred Schruers most recently reviewed Hardball in these pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We speak of military culture, as we do of military justice or music, only 
warily. Neither warfare's brute force nor its daunting precision seems to 
qualify it for such elevation. Yet we as a nation are fascinated by it. For one 
thing, America is good at making war -- methodically, reassuringly (or for 
some, frighteningly) good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek correspondent Douglas Waller is among the reassured. He has written 
an up-to-date, strikingly well-informed recent history of the nation's 
increasingly essential "secret soldiers," its commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 The very word commando (which came out of late 18th-Century Afrikaans via 
Portuguese) is almost cornily evocative, with its instant image of a 
grease-painted, brush-hatted jungle trooper. Nowadays we might envision a 
black-suited, masked and armored SWAT-team type with a machine pistol and a 
trained killer's sang-froid. The Army Green Berets, Navy SEALs and Air Force 
special ops helicopter pilots (sometimes banded together as Delta Force teams) 
get his admiring but close scrutiny in "The Commandos." Hiding by desert roads 
behind Iraqi lines, speeding along the enemy's coast in rubber boats, hopping 
over sand dunes in their "Pave Low" choppers, Waller's special forces are the 
ne plus ultra of can-do soldiery. They emerge as prime examples of the American 
ideal of manhood -- snake-eating tough but ultimately chivalrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are behavioral chameleons," a combat-tested Navy SEAL tells Waller. 
"When you're on an operation, that's the violent mission side of you. It's 
totally different from the loving father side of you, who takes his kids to 
church and says hi to his neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness for such "compartmentalizing" (as the service doctors call it), 
because the news from James William Gibson, who takes a keen look at 
paramilitary wanna-bes in "Warrior Dreams," is that the streets are already 
rife with gun-obsessed civilians. They confuse themselves not only with Rambo 
or the Terminator or the Commie-killing teens of Hollywood ideologue John 
Milius' "Red Dawn," but with the real thing -- Waller's secret soldiers, with 
their war paint, weaponry, secrecy and (to Gibson) jingoist, John Wayne agenda. 
Not only are such wanna-bes dangerous, as witnessed by the paramilitary-style 
mass murders we've seen over the past decades, in Gibson's view they also 
deplete our definition of manhood: "For all the power the warrior seems to 
have, he is left stunted and diminished inside his hardened boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson has not shied away from field research, although some of his stories 
are a bit musty. In a long central section called "Better Than Disneyland," he 
devotes a chapter each to the devotees of "Paintball as Combat Sport" (a 1988 
visit to a California war-game park), "Partying With the Soldiers of Fortune" 
(a 1987 visit to Soldier of Fortune magazine's Las Vegas convention) and 
finally to "Becoming the Armed Man: Combat Pistol Shooting at Gunsite Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding his field vignettes are sections that read as traditional though 
animated and lucid academic sociology. In one, he looks at American culture via 
movies and a host of adventure novels (from the pulpy Mack Bolan "Executioner" 
series to techno-thrillers of the Tom Clancy/Stephen Coonts genre) and depicts 
the model warrior: 
</P>
<P>
 "Freed from the ambivalence and restraints of deep emotional relationships, 
freed from the boring tasks and burdensome responsibilities of everyday life, 
he is reborn into the mythical world of primeval chaos, where he can develop 
his full powers of destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 The closing section looks at the real carnage wrought by those who act out 
such warrior dreams, from several murder-for-hire mercenaries who came straight 
off the classified pages of Soldier of Fortune to racist ideologues. Ultimately 
he turns polemical with "Paramilitarism as State Policy in the Reagan-Bush 
Era." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson is aghast not only at the mythic punch of Lt. Col. Oliver North (who 
got 150,000 telegrams the week he vaingloriously testified before a 
Congressional committee) but also at the lionization of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 
following Desert Storm. "Despite all the killing in Kuwait," he notes, "Saddam 
Hussein remained in control of Iraq after the war ended." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson's book contains a goodly amount of such received wisdom -- it's both 
slimmer and less pithy than his landmark "The Perfect War," which cast a clear, 
cold eye on our military brass' misplaced faith in "technowar" in Vietnam. 
"Warrior Dreams" has both passion for its argument and oases of dry wit, but it 
waxes tendentious. Gibson is at heart so much the reformer that he suggests 
such pursuits as mountaineering and scuba diving as handy replacements for our 
deadlier, macho pursuits that leave a soldier class vulnerable to manipulation 
by a warmongering government. In the end, Gibson warns, "the paramilitary 
warriors of the 1980s were not much different from the other men who went to 
Vietnam, and in their experiences of war, found that they had been seduced by 
warrior myths and used by the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Waller, a sometime aide to former Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), 
evidently used the bona fides he established in covering Desert Storm to gain 
his unprecedented access to training regimes for the Green Berets, SEALs and 
Air Force special ops chopper pilots. He also, in effect, peeks over the wall 
of the highly secret Delta Force's compound at Ft. Bragg, N.C. We see the 
commandos learning their trade in Part I, and witness them practicing it, with 
plenty of compelling and often hair-raising detail, in Part II. (Part III, "The 
Future," is doomed to read like the most ordinary news-weekly fare, given the 
action-packed scenarios that precede it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Waller is no friend to the paramilitary breed, mocking "the beer-bellied 
motorcycle drivers who turn up at Soldier of Fortune conventions bragging about 
commando exploits they never had," but he does celebrate the real thing. He 
avidly delivers their generally absorbing mini-dramas and unashamedly carries 
water for the special ops types the Pentagon chiefs tend to undervalue. He 
allows only a few, terse, naysaying sentences ("Green Berets and Navy SEALs 
tortured prisoners and assassinated Viet Cong leaders for the CIA," runs one), 
and admits to being "just as guilty" as other reporters of romanticizing the 
commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Waller has brought back the stories. He leads with the most striking one, 
about Green Beret officer Chad Balwanz and his seven-man "A team," dug in 
behind Iraqi lines to monitor troop movements. In stark contrast to Gibson's 
bloodthirsty warriors, they refrain from killing a pair of civilians who happen 
upon them -- and must fight their way out in Waller's wonderfully detailed 
account, a military procedural that recalls James Michener's "The Bridges at 
Toko-Ri." 
</P>
<P>
 At some levels, these are stories for boys, with the playacting of the Army's 
guerrilla warfare training, the primitive abusiveness of the SEALs' Hell Week, 
the predictable transformation of the gruff Schwarzkopf into an admirer of 
special forces' effectiveness. But they do fight and die for real, and Waller's 
sturdy prose and dogged research shows us how commandos do their work, and also 
why that work matters. In the not-too-distant future, Waller concludes, 
"regular armies will shrink," and the battlefields of "low-intensity conflicts 
. . . insurgencies, counterinsurgencies, coups d'etat, terrorism, short 
conflicts, economic and psychological warfare" will increasingly require the 
skills of specially trained soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without discarding the cautionary examples proffered by Gibson -- there are 
indeed virtual madmen out there, bewitched and somehow inspired by the doings 
of Waller's heroes -- only the most doctrinaire pacifist can read "The 
Commandos" and not be grateful that someone is willing, even eager, to do the 
often dirty work they do.

A CORPSE AND A BOXER; DOGS OF GOD, BY PINCKNEY BENEDICT (NAN A. 
TALESE/DOUBLEDAY: $21; 354 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Goodrich, Chris Goodrich is a regular reviewer in View.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When one of Graham Greene's novels had less literary weight, or at least 
proved more comic, than he had initially intended, he called it an 
"entertainment." Even so labeled, however, Greene's low art can be hard to 
distinguish from his high. Some of his thrillers are frighteningly serious and 
often more effective than his more self-consciously literary works. It's no 
wonder that British critics invented a word to describe the tragicomic, morally 
charged locale of this author's novels: Greeneland.  
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to say whether critics will someday refer to Benedictland -- 
one hopes not, given the dissonance of the coinage -- but with the publication 
of this young writer's first novel, "Dogs of God," it's a distinct possibility. 
Benedictland is neither a particularly comic nor a particularly tragic place 
but it brims with odd characters and creatures driven by primal, irrefutable 
urges. These desires regularly fail to make sense to the reader, but part of 
this novel's magnetic attraction is a logic both alien and commonplace, a logic 
that doesn't so much defy analysis as render it irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 When Goody, the novel's protagonist, tells his landlord, Inchcape, he has 
found a corpse near the farmhouse he rents, Inchcape's reaction is both 
preposterous and completely in character: "You keep talking about a dead man," 
he says, "but you don't say what it is that you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinckney Benedict earned accolades for his two previous books, the short 
fiction collections "Town Smokes" (1987) and "The Wrecking Yard" (1992), but 
the stories don't prepare you for the strength of this novel. "Dogs of God" 
drives forward without letup, as a thriller should, but what keeps the reader 
enthralled is the novel's characters, the rural and small-town originals of 
Benedict's native West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Goody, a semipro boxer of uncertain history, usually keeps to himself, but his 
discovery of that corpse leads, in the roundabout way that marks so many 
happenings in this book, to a backwoods boxing match. It's a terrible, 
bare-fisted fight, beautifully described, and results in Goody's brief 
imprisonment in an isolated hilltop encampment where his opponent lives and 
works. The name of the place, El Dorado, is significant: Once a resort hotel, 
for a time a women's prison, then a hippie commune, El Dorado is now home to 
the work gang of a heavily armed, drug-lord wanna-be, Tannhauser, a man whose 
dreams far exceed his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tannhauser could well be a dim, more cynical Kurtz; Goody, an ingenuous, less 
thoughtful Marlow. But what really gives "Dogs of God" the feel of Conrad's 
"Heart of Darkness" is Benedict's evocation of the wild West Virginia terrain, 
which seems as lush and exotic and dangerous as a West African jungle. It 
contains a half-crazed anchorite, the book's moral lodestar; packs of feral 
dogs and herds of native pigs who shed blood at every opportunity; an extensive 
network of underground caves that kill or save, injure or redeem, depending on 
luck and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the police raid El Dorado, forced into action by a federal drug agent, 
the place might as well be Vietnam; the subsequent firefight involves mines, 
flares, assault rifles, machine guns, aircraft and rocket launchers. For many 
people, reading "Dogs of God" will bring to mind "Apocalypse Now," the Francis 
Ford Coppola film explicitly based on "Heart of Darkness." Like "Apocalypse," 
"Dogs of God" succeeds in large measure by pairing things never found together 
in nature but whose coupling seems plausible, even inevitable, in a world gone 
wrong. Coppola staged a Hollywood-style USO production in the fetid jungle, 
water-skiing on an enemy-controlled waterway, Wagner blasting from attack 
helicopters; Benedict gives us a small-time businessman interred in a tourist 
cavern, Goody trapped in his wrecked car by a wild malamute, a boxing match in 
the middle of a drug deal -- and within that match, a leather-clad biker asking 
Goody whether he should stick around, in case the fight gets interesting. 
Touches like that make "Dogs of God" brilliantly surreal at times, and about as 
fine a first novel as one could want.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1930 a young Romanian came to Calcutta to live and study with a renowned 
Indian philosopher. He fell passionately in love with the philosopher's 
16-year-old daughter, Maitreyi, herself a poet and disciple of Rabindranath 
Tagore. Eventually their love was discovered and the young man was thrown out 
of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later Mircea Eliade -- who was to become widely known as a writer, 
philosopher and historian of religions -- published a highly charged novel 
about his experience. He barely altered the external facts: The narrator, also 
named Mircea, is a young draftsman; his host and mentor is a senior engineer 
and the daughter retains her first name and her poetry. But he turned what 
evidently were fervent but limited caresses into a lavishly sexual affair, with 
Maitreyi paying nightly bedroom visits as a kind of mystically inflamed Hindu 
goddess of love. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years after that, Maitreyi Devi, now a grandmother and known at home and 
abroad as a social reformer and Tagore scholar, was told the details of the 
book whose contents she had only been vaguely aware of. She was horrified that 
her adolescent love story, strung tightly between desire and inhibition, had 
been turned into a full-fledged sexual romance and that she was so plainly 
identified in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the pain and anger, there was something else: a need to fill in a 
silence in her life and make a better ending to what had been so abruptly 
broken off. In the days after her father banned Eliade from the house and 
forbade him to communicate, the young man had ignored the desperate messages 
Maitreyi contrived to send him. Many years later, he had failed to respond to 
two or three brief friendly notes she wrote after meeting people who knew him. 
Now, in a turmoil of feelings, she resolved to seek him out. Taking advantage 
of a paid invitation to visit America, she tracked Eliade to the University of 
Chicago, where he was a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between the eminent and determined Maitreyi, in her 50s, and the 
even more eminent and utterly panicked Mircea, in his 60s, is the extraordinary 
climax of the book she wrote upon her return to India. "It Does Not Die" 
answers a fiction with a memoir. It tells of the painful romance, of the life 
she lived after it and of her pilgrimage to confront the past over a 
book-strewn library table. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after Eliade's death and three years after Maitreyi Devi's, the 
University of Chicago Press has published the novel and the memoir together -- 
something between a reunion and a duel. The former is in a fluent translation 
by Catherine Spencer, the latter in Devi's faintly stiff but expressive 
English. Each book is remarkable in its own very different way but by itself 
each would be something of a curiosity. Together they set off a brilliant, 
often astonishing detonation of the classic bipolarities: East-West, life-art, 
woman-man. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliade's brief novel blazes with what is not so much discovery as conversion. 
The young Central European is intoxicated with India: the light, colors, 
smells, rituals and passions, and the religious and philosophical sense of life 
that underlies them. India is his love affair -- as it was the author's, whose 
life of reflection evolved out of the encounter -- and the imperious, fragile, 
poetic and utterly alluring Maitreyi stands not just for a particular 
enchantment but for one that is universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliade was an artist as well as a thinker. His novel portrays a young man who 
stumbles into a magic kingdom: a household whose every detail and custom are a 
mystery that conceals a treasure. Its master, Narendra Sen -- in real life he 
was the philosopher Surendranath Das Gupta -- is a kind, solicitous man whose 
love for the West leads him to open his home to Mircea; later, with an age-old 
taboo violated, he will take harsh and implacable steps while avoiding personal 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maitreyi's sensual presence strikes the young man, at first, as too much. "I 
thought her ugly, with eyes that were too black, thick and curling lips and the 
powerful chest of a Bengali maiden who had developed too quickly." Suddenly he 
glimpses a bare arm, "matte brown, an alloy of clay and wax" and it is as if 
the light had shifted to disclose a new landscape. Physically overwhelming, she 
is elusive, shy and bold by turns, easily brought to tears and absorbed in the 
poetry for which her mentor, Tagore, has praised her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mircea, a romantic Western male, thinks troubadour thoughts of siege and 
conquest. He is jealous of Tagore, so the fictional Maitreyi, half-conquered, 
brings him a lock of the sage's hair to destroy. Wholly conquered, she sneaks 
in at night for vividly depicted sexual feasts. A little sister sees them in a 
minor embrace, but this is enough for banishment. The book has Maitreyi 
brutally beaten; it has Mircea accepting the banishment and going to the 
Himalayas to rage and recover. The artist ends, bittersweet, the lover's story. 
</P>
<P>
 For Maitreyi it never was a story. Her account of the real Indian girl and her 
real European lover is more diffuse, more veiled and less dramatic. Art is 
total revelation; life can never entirely figure itself out. There were kisses 
and perhaps a little more, but not a lot more. The father was neither as kind 
-- fairly awful, in fact -- nor as harsh as the novel depicts. Maitreyi's 
isolation was not as severe -- she was not beaten -- and perhaps if Eliade had 
been less of an artist and more of a lover he might have breached it. When a 
Romanian disciple of Eliade visited her in 1972 and told her what was in the 
book, her first reaction, after fury over its distortions, was to demand: 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was really so much in love with me why did he run away after one 
snubbing by my father." 
</P>
<P>
 A whole middle section of her memoir tells of her subsequent life, married to 
a humorous and saintly compatriot, living on a tea plantation and acting as 
hostess for the aged Tagore, who would go there for refuge -- one regularly 
interrupted by such admirers as Henri Bergson, Romain Rolland and Bernard Shaw. 
It is an enchanting account. Still, there is an unsatisfied void. Stories end, 
and Eliade ended his; for this admirable Indian woman all of life is always 
present. Eliade's fictional account of their youthful upstream poisons her 
downstream old age. It is necessary to go see him. 
</P>
<P>
 She enters the reading room. He gives a cry, stands and turns his back; he 
knew she was coming but cannot face her. Eyes to the wall, he says he had never 
forgotten her. So why did he never answer her notes? 
</P>
<P>
 "That experience was so sacred that I never thought I could touch it again," 
he replies. "So I put you out of time and space." Having traveled 11 1/2 time 
zones to get to his, and standing in his space, the elderly Maitreyi tells him 
to look at her. "How can I see you?" the old man protests. "Did Dante ever 
think he would see Beatrice with eyes of flesh?" Why did he write what was not 
true? "I wanted to make you a mysterious being, a goddess -- like Kali." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly this Pirandello-like scene -- character calls author to account -- 
falls, comically and touchingly, into humanity. Kali? The goddess's name stirs 
a mortal woman's grievance. There was Eliade's fictional description of their 
first meeting; there was that word ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nonsense," she retorts. "Don't compare me with Kali. I am not that dark. . . 
. You always belittle my looks." Then he does turn to face her but she still 
feels unseen -- Mona Lisa's anonymous model calling out to Leonardo through the 
painted mouth of his masterpiece -- and she retreats. He will meet her someday 
by the holy Ganges, he calls out as she goes.

COVER STORY: ALEXANDER'S BIG-TIME BAND OF CHARACTERS; WHAT GEORGE COSTANZA, A 
PRETZEL PUSHER AND THE DUCKMAN HAVE IN COMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the world loves a clown. And the world seems to love Jason Alexander, who 
has become one of TV's most popular funny guys, thanks to his role as George 
Costanza, stand-up comic Jerry Seinfeld's nebbish, Angst- ridden friend, on 
"Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last four years, fans of the hit NBC sitcom have watched George get 
fired from his job as a real estate agent, go from one hopeless job interview 
to another, move back home with his neurotic, overbearing parents and even lose 
his girlfriends to women. Seinfeld often calls him "Biff," referring to 
salesman Willy Loman's hapless son from Arthur Miller's play "Death of a 
Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Seinfeld" premiered, Alexander has received two Emmy and Golden Globe 
nominations, won an American Television Award and two American Comedy Awards 
for his work on the series. He even nabbed a prestigious Directors Guild Award 
nomination last year for stepping behind the camera to direct an episode. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander never dreamed of TV stardom. Growing up in Livingston, N.J., 
visions of singing and dancing on Broadway filled his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater was everything," Alexander, 34, says emphatically. His love 
affair with the stage began nearly 30 years ago when he saw his first Broadway 
musical, "Fiddler on the Roof," starring Zero Mostel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all I ever wanted to do. I never thought about film or television. It 
didn't seem like a possibility. But if I could work in New York or Broadway, 
specifically, I thought that was the be all and end all. I still do. I don't 
think there is anything more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years ago, Alexander saw the musical that changed his life -- Bob 
Fosse's landmark "Pippin," which made star Ben Vereen the toast of Broadway. " 
'Pippin' changed my life because I was so into magic as a kid," Alexander 
explains. "It was something I almost pursued very seriously. I was really into 
musicals. I went to this show, and from the minute it started to the minute it 
ended, it was choreographed within an inch of its life. You didn't know where 
to look next. I just thought, 'My God. This is what I wanted to do forever and 
forever and ever.' I wanted to be Ben Vereen. I started taking tap lessons 
right after I saw that show thinking somehow I would be Ben Vereen." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, Alexander became a Broadway star in his own right, starring in 
Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound" and in Stephen Sondheim's musical "Merrily We 
Roll Along." He also appeared opposite Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli in Kander 
and Ebb's "The Rink." Five years ago, Alexander won the Tony Award for best 
actor in a musical for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." And just like his idol 
Vereen, Alexander became the toast of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to re-evaluate my entire fantasy life after that," Alexander 
acknowledges with a smile. "I thought if I was very lucky, that by the time I 
was 60 I would get into a Broadway show that maybe would be worthy of winning a 
Tony. The Tony was the end point. At 29, I said, 'Gee. Now what?' I had to 
reassess my ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is sitting in a booth in the back room of Jerry's Famous Deli in 
Studio City, not far from where "Seinfeld" tapes. It's his lunch break from a 
"Seinfeld" rehearsal, and Alexander is munching on lox and a bagel. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, one realizes what a great acting job Alexander does on the series. 
The actor and his TV alter ego couldn't be more dissimilar, both physically and 
personality-wise. Unlike George, Alexander doesn't wear glasses. He looks 
younger and thinner. George is full of self-doubt, but Alexander is 
self-assured and brimming with confidence. While his small-screen self can't 
keep a girlfriend, Alexander is happily married to actress-writer Daena Title; 
they have a 2 year-old son, Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go anywhere and not be recognized," Alexander acknowledges. "I can go 
places and not be bothered, but that's limited to New York and L.A. The rest of 
the country has seemed to notch up their interest (in the series). At first it 
was glancing waves or, 'I like the show,' but then they would move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's all changed since NBC moved the Emmy Award-winning series early 
last year from Wednesdays opposite "Home Improvement" to Thursday nights after 
"Cheers." Suddenly, "Seinfeld" went from a cult series to a Top Five hit. The 
show is now the network's top-rated series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a vacation in Florida over the holidays and it got to where I was 
almost being rude to people. I am very interested in meeting people and 
responding to them. But I got my son screaming in my arms and people are 
saying, 'Can we take a picture?' People just stop seeing ... somehow it's not 
real. A lot of it can be very obtrusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander doesn't really know why George has become part of pop culture. 
"Everywhere I go somebody says, 'I am just like George' or 'I know someone like 
George.' You know, George is a very heroic loser. But I don't know why people 
gravitate to him so much. He seems to be the character everyone touchstones to. 
He seems the most realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Much more so than Michael Richards' crazy Kramer. "He is outlandish. Kramer 
has become the cult character. People will laugh at him, but they don't 
recognize him. George, still with everything, is in the realm of guys that we 
know. But why we have senior citizens responding to him, why we have little 
kids responding to him, why we have women in their 40s responding to him -- no 
one is more surprised than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Alexander enjoys playing George, he is making a concerted effort 
not to be typecast. Last year he became the commercial spokesperson for Frito 
Lay's Rold Gold Pretzel Chips. Viewers got the first glimpse of his new Rold 
Gold commercial during the Winter Olympics. The latest spot finds Alexander 
becoming a hero at a hockey game, thanks to eating the new Rold Gold Fat-Free 
Thins Pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got him re-signed for several spots this year," says Tod MacKenzie, vice 
president of advertising and public affairs for Frito Lay. "Two things 
attracted us to him. There is this enormous likability, kind of as an Everyman 
type that I think everyone can relate to. Then obviously, he is highly 
recognizable. In getting to know him, especially with the first spot we shot 
this year, we have learned that he's great at physical comedy. That obviously 
lent itself very well to the hockey spot. We think it will continue in some of 
the ideas we have got for further ads." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie says the company had a "fabulous" year for pretzels. "Certainly, 
advertising played an important part. The advertising with Jason played a key 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander also is the voice of "Duckman," the irascible private eye and family 
man on the new USA animated series. "It was a straight audition," Alexander 
says. "I had never even thought of animation. I sort of fell into a recurring 
character on the 'Aladdin' series coming up on the Disney Channel. 'Duckman' 
was a spur-of-the-moment audition. It has been unbelievable fun." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the series' co-executive producers and writers, Jeff Reno and Ron 
Osborn of "Moonlighting" fame, Alexander was the only one who fit the bill as 
Duckman. The casting director, Osborn says, listened to 350 audition tapes. "We 
narrowed that down to almost 100 auditions and that doesn't include actors Jeff 
and I contacted ourselves. It was fairly involved." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason just had a great combination of things," Reno says. "It's weird. It's 
kind of strange to say that someone walked in and completely embodied the role 
of an overbearing duck. The character is a kind of irascible character who 
likes to rant and rave against whatever inequalities he sees around him, but we 
wanted to maintain an emotional reality in the show. Jason came in and sort of 
had all of that. He just hit all of the bases for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander also was featured in the 1993 Oscar-nominated short "Down on the 
Waterfront" and has three feature films out this year, including Ron Howard's 
"The Paper," which opened March 18. In the newspaper drama, Alexander plays a 
beleaguered New York commissioner of parking who gets drunk in a bar with 
editor Robert Duvall. "That was a really fun thing," Alexander says. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Howard pursued Alexander to play an acerbic columnist. "Ron and I 
knew there was no way that we were going to work around 'Seinfeld,' " Alexander 
says. So Randy Quaid got the columnist role and Howard found a small but 
pivotal part for Alexander. "I had a one-week hiatus and we shot it in New York 
in four days." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander says he's glad he did the film. "It turned out to be one of the best 
film experiences I've had. I didn't know Duvall was in the movie. I literally 
got on the set and looked at the end of the bar and went, 'Is that Robert 
Duvall?' " 
</P>
<P>
 During his summer hiatus last year, Alexander filmed Rob Reiner's new comedy 
"North," which is due out in July. Ironically, he plays the husband of 
"Seinfeld" regular Julia Louis-Dreyfus. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can imagine, working with Rob is a lot of fun," he says. "He has a 
very lighthearted set. I laughed a lot. I don't love making movies, because 
they are so damn tedious to do, but one day I am working with Jon Lovitz, the 
next day I am working with Alan Arkin and I am always working with Julia. This 
is not bad. I learned 500 new jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander doesn't really know what to make of his other summer release, Damon 
Wayan's "Blankman," in which he has a cameo as a crusty TV producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say about 'Blankman,' " he states diplomatically. "I 
came into it very late. It crosses into many different styles. I was not able 
to discern what style we were doing. The character was rather extreme. It 
seemed funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his TV and movie career are going gangbusters, Alexander craves the 
roar of the greasepaint and the smell of the crowd. "I miss the stage," he 
laments. "I miss musicals because they are just joyous to do. I miss the 
autonomy of the stage. Invariably, I don't think there's been a single 
performance of 'Seinfeld' which was actually the way I did it. They take a 
piece of something here and a piece of something there. We always tape long and 
it's necessary to cut anywhere from two to nine minutes. It's frustrating after 
a long time if you care about what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 His dream is to go back to New York and direct musicals. And eventually 
movies. "I just saw Steve (Sondheim) again at the Kennedy Center. I told him it 
was my one desire to direct the film of 'Sweeney Todd.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander pauses and breaks into a wide grin. "I am going to have to badger 
him until he gives it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Seinfeld" airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC; "Duckman" airs Saturdays at 10:30 
p.m. on USA.

SEX AND THE SINGLE HUMAN; THE RED QUEEN: SEX AND THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN NATURE, 
BY MATT RIDLEY (MACMILLAN: $25; 405 PP.) ; THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE: STRATEGIES 
OF HUMAN MATING, BY DAVID M. BUSS (BASIC: $22; 262 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Beryl Lieff Benderly, Beryl Lieff Benderly's books include The Myth of Two 
Minds: What Gender Means and Doesn't Mean. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What does a woman want?" 
</P>
<P>
 Freud despaired of finding out, but Matt Ridley and David Buss think they 
know: A woman wants a stable, generous, high-status, devoted, older man to help 
her raise her kids. They're also pretty sure of why: because eons of evolution 
have shaped her genes to those desires. And what does a man want? They know 
that, too: as many young, nubile, shapely sex partners as he can deceive, 
wheedle or cajole. And for the same reason: evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the guise of exploring the origin and nature of human sexuality, Ridley and 
Buss reprise a body of writings and assumptions that has, over the past couple 
of decades, argued for a genetic basis to such complex and highly varied human 
institutions as courtship and marriage. Ridley, a journalist trained in 
zoology, presents the latest theories of evolutionary biology. Buss, a 
University of Michigan psychologist, more ponderously introduces us to a hybrid 
discipline called evolutionary psychology. Both accept the sociobiological 
notion, most prominently associated with the name of Donald Symons, that a 
difference in "parental investment," the amount of resources and effort an 
individual must put into producing a child, provides an evolutionary -- and 
thus a genetic -- basis for la difference.  
</P>
<P>
 Since a man can impregnate in an instant, Symons reasons, but a woman must 
gestate for nine months, the sexes must necessarily pursue divergent strategies 
for seeking mates. From a strictly mathematical standpoint, a man seeking to 
"maximize his fitness" (jargon for producing the largest possible number of 
descendants) should therefore strive for sex with as many women (but as few 
strings) as possible. A woman seeking the same goal should do her darndest to 
get some guy (preferably but not necessarily the actual father) to stick around 
and help her raise the much smaller number of children she can bear in her 
lifetime. Human males, this argument goes, are thus genetically suited to 
promiscuity, or at least polygamy; human females, to faithful monogamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Why any reasonable adult would pursue the goal of maximal fecundity in the 
first place is a question supposedly answered by the theory of the "selfish 
gene," which forms the foundation of an intellectual edifice too complicated to 
diagram in this space. Suffice it to say that the Symons school sees human 
beings as creatures whose behavior evolution has programmed uniformly and in 
detail. "It is the assumption of this book that there is . . . a typical human 
nature," Ridley states on his first page. And Buss, who expounds at length on 
humanity's "evolved preferences" for doing this or that, apparently doesn't 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "A psychiatrist can make all sorts of basic assumptions when a patient lies 
down on the couch," Ridley continues. "He can assume that the patient knows 
what it means to love, to envy, to trust, to think, to speak, to remember, to 
sing, to quarrel, to lie." This is news indeed to the research psychiatrists 
just now mapping the mechanisms that babies use to learn, through intimate 
relationships with caring adults, such decidedly non-innate features of the 
human spirit as love, trust, devotion and reason. But because Ridely and Buss 
both postulate at the outset what they claim to be investigating, neither can 
convincingly explain the profusion of family types, gender roles and property 
arrangements that cover the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley, at least, is frank -- and oddly proud -- about why. "The stuff of 
anthropology -- the traditions, the myths, the crafts, the language, the 
rituals -- is to me but froth on the surface," he proclaims, dismissing 
generations of scholarship by people who know a great deal of about human 
behavior. If his and Buss' bibliographies accurately reflect the reading that 
informs their books, neither has bothered to consider the vast literature 
arguing the elegant and at least equally persuasive proposition that culture, 
the great evolutionary adaptation of the human species, exerts an immensely 
powerful influence over what we do. Buss does report at length on a large, 
cross-cultural study of mating habits and desires that he organized but still 
takes for granted that similarities across cultures reflect inborn tendencies, 
not similar conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthropologists insist that a Western urban man is far different in his 
habits and thoughts from a bushman tribesman than either is from his wife," 
Ridley writes, leading this reader, at least, to speculate uncharitably about 
whom Ridley might be married to. "Indeed," he goes on, "it is the foundation of 
their discipline that this is so, for anthropology consists of studying the 
differences between peoples. But this has led anthropologists to exaggerate the 
motes of racial difference and to ignore the beams of similarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropologists, in fact, have not investigated racial differences in behavior 
since the Nazis' nefarious promotion of eugenics in World War II. What they do 
study is how human beings use symbols, ideology, social structure, technology 
and their own biology to achieve the goals that their culture teaches them to 
seek. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that humans mate is biological, of course, just like the facts that 
we eat and talk. But whether we eat with forks or chopsticks, whether we speak 
English or Urdu, and whether we raise our kids as monogamous couples on the 
Arctic tundra, as polygamous families on the Arabian desert, or as single 
mothers in urban housing projects, surely depends on where and how we live our 
lives. And equally clearly, as scholars such as Ruth Bleier, Peggy Reeves 
Sanday and David Gilmore have amply shown, what defines us as men and women 
varies enough around the globe that genes cannot be the sole, or even the main, 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, assuming a single, uniform, inborn human nature leads an intelligent 
man like Ridley into such absurdities as offering stereotypes in lieu of 
intellectual arguments. Concerning the ongoing scientific dispute about whether 
males have innately superior spatial skills, he comments, for example, "When a 
family in a car gets lost, the woman wants to stop and ask the way, while the 
man persists in trying to find his way by map or landmarks. So pervasive is 
this cliche that there must be some truth to it." Then how about the cliche -- 
equally prevalent among women -- that men are clueless about human nature? 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does either Eidley or Buss consider the views of biological scientists who 
dissent from the Symons orthodoxy. More than a decade ago, for example, 
biologists like Philip Darlington scathingly criticized the whole idea that 
differential reproductive success can guide evolution in a world where the 
great majority of creatures -- and, until an evolutionary moment ago, a 
substantial majority of humans -- never live long enough, regardless of how 
evolution might have sorted their sex genes, to reproduce in the first place. 
If most of the beings ever born, spawned, hatched or sprouted have succumbed to 
disease, predators, hunger or accident long before they could bestow their 
genes on the next generation, adaptations can never be as perfect as computer 
simulations would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all their bias, both books offer material that merits interest. In 
lucid, witty prose, Ridley provides illuminating discussions of non-human 
animals. Buss, in more a pedestrian style, presents lots of intriguing 
information from his huge survey. And in his final chapter, Buss even recants 
the evolutionary dogma. "A central message of human sexual strategies is that 
mating behavior is enormously flexible an sensitive to social context," he 
acknowledges. "Thus, in the sexual arena, no behavior is inevitable or 
genetically preordained -- neither infidelity nor monogamy, neither sexual 
violence nor sexual tranquility, neither jealous guarding nor sexual 
indifference." 
</P>
<P>
 And even Ridley, on his penultimate page, finally admits, with admirable 
though belated humility, "Half the theories in this book are probably wrong." 
My bet is on the ones that deny the power of our species' unique and most truly 
human attribute, the ability through culture, to invest our lives with meaning 
and then shape our actions to express it.

A PUBLIC SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I applaud Henry Cisneros' decision to stay at his post rather than seek 
elective office ("The Reluctant Warrior," by Marcelo Rodriguez, Feb. 27). 
Cisneros, from all accounts, is a very capable individual who can make a 
difference as secretary of HUD. He has the confidence of the White House. Let's 
focus on his results as secretary rather than inject him in nebulous scenarios 
for '96 or '98. It's Cisneros' business if he chooses to put family before 
political ambition.

<P>
 The ultimate destiny for a person committed to public service need not be the 
pursuit of higher elected office. To assume otherwise, as Rodriguez does for 
HUD Secretary Cisneros, puts one pursuit over another and undervalues the 
contributions of public administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez sees a paradox in Cisneros as the politician turned bureaucrat. Yet 
we've had many Presidents who were far better Cabinet members than they were 
chief executives: James Madison, John Quincy Adams and James Buchanan among 
them. The best example is Herbert Hoover, who served with distinction as U.S. 
food and relief administrator during World War I and as secretary of commerce 
before becoming an abysmal President. America has also been blessed to have had 
the services of many other capable politicians who had neither the need nor the 
fire to seek the presidency. Alexander Hamilton, Henry Morgenthau Jr. and Henry 
Kissinger are prime examples. 
</P>
<P>
 America needs more politicians willing to settle into the less glamorous, but 
equally necessary and possibly more consequential work of public 
administration.

 If Cisneros can make HUD into a force to deal successfully with what he called 
"today's potential killer -- gangs, loss of our youth, central city problems, 
race and class divisions" -- the "reluctant warrior" will become an American 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
 We need better space in neighborhoods and communities for people to come 
together and make for themselves, and for all society, an environment built on 
the value of family life, commitment to high ideals and opportunities to make 
these ideals a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy, nor can it be done without heavy investment from both the 
private and public sectors, along with strong, dedicated leadership that 
believes in the democratic system.

<P>
 To HUD clients: "We'll contribute to your ladder of opportunity, but meet us 
halfway with initiative. When we tell you the waiting list for housing 
assistance lasts five to 10 years, we hope you won't need it by then." 
</P>
<P>
 To HUD hierarchy: "Deflate procedures and deliver the goods. Protect the 
taxpayers, but don't expect rewards for creating mazes that only enhance your 
internal status and budget requests." 
</P>
<P>
 To HUD employees: "Your jobs are not an entitlement. We'll give you a sense of 
purpose; you give us an honest work effort instead of copping to burnout."

FEMALE LIKE ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deanne Stillman's "The Trouble with Male-Bashing" (Feb. 27) says exactly what 
I've been trying to get a female friend to understand for some time. Yes, much 
of the ill feeling against men is based on experience, and men do many things 
to reinforce the stereotypes that have led to the tension between men and 
women. But that does not mean that all men are evil, ill-mannered chauvinists. 
Just some of them. Well, maybe even a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 As an attractive, intelligent female, I have often been the victim of the 
unfair assumptions men make about me: I am apparently not supposed to have 
strong opinions or a brain in my head. Many men have made it clear to me that 
they are not interested in someone who is unwilling to bow to their supposedly 
better judgment. This is just as unfair as saying that all men are jerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been a long time since there has been a man in my life who 
appreciates and accepts me for who I am, I have not lost hope that I will find 
him. And if I don't, I'd rather be alone than waste my time on one of the 
aforementioned jerks.

 Here is a presumably successful, intelligent and articulate woman coming to 
the defense of men at the expense of the members of her own gender. Stillman 
ridicules women, portraying them all as hostile and aggressive. She demeans the 
"gender difference" theorists. I realize she intended her article to be 
entertaining, but speaking as a woman and a staunch feminist, my reaction to 
her premise was: "With friends like this, who needs enemies?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of comedy, she presents a one-sided argument, overlooking many of 
the reasons why women are angry. Working women earn 25% less than men. And 
while it's true that more women are succeeding professionally, how far have we 
really come? Women compose more than 50% of the population, but as of this year 
there are only seven women in the U.S. Senate and 47 in the House of 
Representatives. Is this equality? 
</P>
<P>
 Women like Stillman and Phyllis Schlafly do other women a great disservice. If 
we are ever going to achieve equality, it will require unity and support from 
all members of our gender. Let's not bash men, but let's not bash women either.

 Most cultures encourage their males to female-bash virtually from birth. Now, 
thanks to daytime television, women have become more aware of the repressive 
techniques that men use to devalue women. While I do not sanction mutilation of 
any kind, I do believe it's perfectly OK to bash men. It's the only thing that 
seems to get through their thick skulls.

 Good old "gal" Deanne, who is obviously a member of the Good Old Boys Club, 
has some valid points to make. Unfortunately, the patronizing and patriarchal 
style in which she writes speaks volumes on how little she values her gender. 
She may believe she is humorous or cute; she is just plain demeaning.

 The question isn't "Why can't a woman be more like a man?" nor, in the current 
version, "Why can't a man be more like a woman?" The question is: "Can we 
recognize our many differences and live with them?" 
</P>
<P>
 As I commented to a male friend during the height of Bobbitt-mania, "If all 
women were to follow her behavior, wouldn't it be kind of like cutting off your 
nose to spite your face?"

 Now I know how Nancy Kerrigan feels. Oh sure, Stillman's cheap shot about me 
in her article, "Stephanie Miller, the painfully not-funny KFI gabfest host," 
hurt a little. But what I really object to is her complete misrepresentation of 
me and my radio show. First, I completely condemned Lorena Bobbitt's action on 
the air several times, and second, I never had as a topic on my show whether 
Bobbitt should have cut off her husband's penis. It's interesting in an article 
on male-bashing that Stillman would stoop to such blatant female-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, forget Nancy; now I know how John Bobbitt felt. And at 
least Nancy got to go to Disneyland afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 STEPHANIE MILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stillman responds: According to my notes, on Nov. 13, 1993, Miller 
lightheartedly asked the listeners to phone in and discuss the question of 
whether or not Lorena Bobbitt should have cut off her husband's penis. It is 
irrelevant to me whether or not she condemned the act; the point was that she 
trivialized a profound moment in the battle of the sexes by presenting the 
question in a superficial way during what she herself had billed -- supposedly 
humorously -- the "men are slime hour." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the second point -- that my criticism of Miller constitutes 
"female-bashing" -- she fails to note that I also criticized Rush Limbaugh, 
among others. In other words, if a woman expresses a negative opinion about 
another (very public) woman, it carries a political agenda; if the opinion is 
about a man, it's not worth mentioning.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; SPIELBERG'S 'TINY TOONS' BREAK FOR 
PRIME TIME AND THE RITES OF SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even ACME Looniversity students need a break. A full-on, wild-style spring 
break. And what better place to take it than Sunday on prime time, when the 
cartoon creation of producer Steven Spielberg, who's gotten a bit of attention 
for his other entertainment projects this past year, will air. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox nighttime special came about, says story editor Peter Hastings, 
because Spielberg wanted to do a spring break story and, more important, 
because "we wanted to make sure that the audience knew that 'Tiny Toons' was 
alive and living. More of an audience will get to see the show at night." 
Usually, "Tiny Toons" airs weekday afternoons on KTTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toons Spring Break promises the same 
irreverence that characterizes the afternoon program, plus surprise celebrity 
cameos. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Fox's "The Simpsons," the producers hope the episode will engage and 
attract an adult audience, because "the writers write to make each other 
laugh," says Hastings. "Consequently, adults can enjoy the show as much as 
their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be tuning into tiny toons Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, 
Hampton the Pig, Almira and their buddies chartering a bus south for that 
Florida hot spot, Fort Lauderdale. The toons, now in their fifth season, are 
fashioned in the tradition of Bugs, Daffy, Porky et al. "Buster is the sort of 
guy every kid can relate to, since he's always in search of fun," Hastings 
says. Babs -- "no relation" -- Bunny is "one of the very few animated female 
characters who has a strong personality," Hastings notes. "She's often leading 
Buster." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday night's story, little Almira, the human toon, hasn't forgotten it's 
Easter. Though her unattuned friends, Buster and Babs included, opt for optimum 
fun in the sun, she goes on an obsessive search for the Easter Bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring break special, as all "Tiny Toons" episodes, features original 
music. "Tiny Toons" and "Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs" are the only 
animated television shows that now use a live 30-piece orchestra for each 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toons Spring Break Special" airs Sunday 7-8 
p.m. on Fox. "Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toons Adventures" airs weekdays at 
3:30-4 p.m. on KTTV. For ages 2 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Many classics have been updated for contemporary audiences. One recent -- and 
notable -- success is Disney's live-action feature Homeward Bound: The 
Incredible Journey (Sunday 7-9 p.m. Disney Channel). The movie, based on Shelia 
Burnford's novel "The Incredible Journey," premieres this week. Disney's 
original version of the tale, about two dogs and a cat making their way home, 
was made in 1963. This time around, instead of voice-over narration, each 
animal has its own voice, provided by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late 
Don Ameche. The update also expands the pets' relationship with their family. 
For ages 4 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Still in search of a good meal and a full "pic-a-nic" basket, Jellystone 
Park's lovable, green-hatted bear returns in Yogi, the Easter Bear (Friday 
5:05-6:05 p.m. TBS and next Sunday 3-4 p.m. KCAL). Disguised as the Easter 
Bunny, Yogi pigs out on the park's entire Easter candy stash. When Ranger Smith 
finds out, he makes plans to send Yogi to the Siberian circus. When he learns 
the Supreme Commissioner (of rangers) will attend Easter festivities with his 
grandchildren, the ranger goes ballistic. Yogi decides that the only way he can 
avert the Siberian plan -- and help Ranger Smith -- is to find the real Easter 
Bunny. With the help of his pal Boo-Boo, Yogi sets off on an adventure. And 
yes, he does save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Jonathan Winters lends his voice to two characters: the Ranger's 
goofy assistant Mortimer and the Grand Grizzly, a wizened bear. For ages 2 to 
8.

 LOST LOVE: A True Story of Passion, Murder, and Justice in Old New York by 
George Cooper (Pantheon Books: $23; 272 pp.). George Cooper, a former law 
professor at Columbia University, had a choice to make in telling the story of 
the fatal, post-Civil War love triangle formed by renowned journalist Albert 
Deane Richardson, actress/writer Abby Sage and Sage's ne'er-do-well husband, 
Daniel McFarland. He could take the traditional approach -- re-create the tale, 
which culminates in McFarland's 1869 murder trial, from library and archival 
research -- or he could take excerpts from contemporary documents and weave 
them together with bridging background and commentary. Cooper adopted the 
latter route, and it works remarkably well, light-years better than the 
document-based textbooks that "Lost Love" superficially resembles: only a 
lawyer, perhaps, would recognize that direct testimony by the various figures 
involved -- in letters, court statements, newspaper accounts -- tells the story 
better than any interpretive historian. The public favored McFarland, aggrieved 
husband, at the time of the trial, but Cooper makes clear that Richardson and 
Sage were grossly maligned by McFarland, his attorneys and the scandal-seeking 
press: in their own writings they come through as brave, patient, articulate, 
even altruistic. The Richardson-Sage-McFarland affair is not particularly 
unusual as love triangles go, but Cooper's fresh, self-effacing approach 
elevates it to a much more interesting level.

 GO FIGURE! by Patrick O'Connor (Moyer Bell: $18.95; 140 pp.). How's this for a 
career path -- press agent, poet, book editor and finally ski instructor.It 
sounds like a life imagined by Danielle Steele, but in truth it's been led by 
Patrick O'Connor, who can move in any social circle, it seems, without missing 
a beat (must be the Irish blood). As a press agent, he squired Marlene Dietrich 
about New York, and reports she really did dress up as a nanny when taking her 
grandchildren to the park; as an editor, he called Ayn Rand "the best writer of 
young adult books in America" (she wasn't overly insulted, even though O'Connor 
was her editor at the time); as a ski instructor in Vermont he specializes in 
"the klutzes, the fatties, the uncoordinated and the fearful," for he pretty 
much fits that description himself. The nearly 50 pieces in this collection 
were originally written for O'Connor's New York radio show, and many of them 
are hilarious. What does a press agent do when a client calls for emergency 
baby-sitting? Calls up another, child-loving client who lives nearby -- in this 
case Frankenstein himself, Boris Karloff. How does one editor persuade another 
to publish a literary title? He lies baldfacedly, saying that E. F. Benson's 
"Lucia" novels have been tapped for Masterpiece Theater. (Benson's novels were 
indeed adapted for television following their unexpected commercial success in 
the U.S., leading one of O'Connor's friends to define lies as "truths that 
haven't happened yet". The barrier between truth and fiction is porous in "Go 
Figure!" -- Leonard Maltin, who was hired by O'Connor to write a film 
encyclopedia at the age of 17, acknowledges as much in his blurb -- but 
O'Connor's stories are so uncommonly charming the reader can't disapprove.

<P>
 Hangin' With the Homeboys (KCAL Sunday at 10 p.m.) is a pure joy, a sweet and 
funny 1991 take on life in the South Bronx. Written and directed by Joseph B. 
Vasquez, the film focuses on four young men on a long, hectic Friday night. The 
result is a contemporary "Marty," timeless in its observations of human nature 
and charged with high energy and humor. This semi-autobiographical film rings 
true from start to finish, and shows off Vasquez's considerable storytelling 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-directed by the late Tony Richardson, the 1982 The Border (KTLA Monday at 
8 p.m.) is one of the unjustly neglected pictures of Jack Nicholson's career. 
It is a compassionate look at the plight of illegal immigrants along the 
U.S.-Mexican border. Nicholson plays a border patrolman increasingly 
disaffected with his job of forcing Mexicans back to their side of the Rio 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Africa (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m., concluding Friday at 8 p.m.), Sydney 
Pollack's lush 1985 production, centers on Danish aristocrat Karen Blixen, who 
became a storyteller of the first order under her pen name Isak Dinesen. 
There's much that's wonderful about the film, set in 1914 Keyna, starting with 
Meryl Streep's usual impeccable performance as the extraordinarily gifted and 
complex Dinesen and the film's glorious authentic settings. The focal point of 
the film -- the baroness' romance with the dashing hunter and aviator Denys 
Finch-Hatten -- is seriously weakened by a miscast Robert Redford, who doesn't 
even attempt a British accent. Still, it's an elegant and intelligent film, 
enlivened by Streep and by all-too-brief appearances by Klaus Maria Brandauer 
as her aristocratic husband. 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA presents a Saturday night Sally Field double feature: 1984's Places in 
the Heart (6 p.m.), a deeply felt variation on "Norma Rae," which won Field a 
second Oscar, and the enjoyable 1981 Back Roads (8 p.m.), which finds Field's 
hooker crossing paths with Tommy Lee Jones' drifter. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Wes Craven is in an unexpectedly sentimental mood with the 1986 
Deadly Friend (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.), in which a heartsick young man 
(Matthew Laborteaux) revives his lost love (Kristy Swanson) from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1985 Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird (KCOP at 8 p.m.) is an 
ingratiating children's film in which the popular "Sesame Street" character 
winds up in a foster home.

 STRAIGHTJACKET & TIE by Eugene Stein (Ticknor & Fields: $19.95; 277 pp.). Bert 
Rosenbaum, late in this first novel, sees the police arrive at his parents' 
apartment to transport his older brother, Philip, to the Bronx State 
Psychiatric Center.Philip, a diagnosed schizophrenic, has been acting more and 
more demented, to the point that Philip has finally agreed, at his family's 
urging, to voluntary commitment. Bert, who over the previous year has become 
friends with three green aliens from the planet Debbie, finally articulates, 
silently, the idea that lies at the core of this novel: "Philip went crazy so I 
wouldn't have to." "Straightjacket & Tie" is a heartfelt book, apparently 
drawing heavily on the real lives of Eugene Stein and his brother, but it isn't 
much more than that; the subplots, involving Bert's homosexual coming-of-age 
and his interactions with aliens, are conventional and strained, respectively. 
Philip is by far the most interesting character in the book, especially when 
he's writing his nonsense poetry or thinking about baseball. He's ready to 
admit to emotional difficulties, but believes they would disappear if the 
Yankees and Mets were in the World Series -- meaning that his parents shouldn't 
be pressuring him to go to a psychiatrist but Met management to get decent 
pitching.

 ANCESTRAL TRUTHS by Sara Maitland (Henry Holt: 22.50; 295 pp.). Although Sara 
Maitland has made a mark in her native Britain, in this country she is at 
present little known."Ancestral Truths," one hopes, will change all that: This 
is truly accomplished and thoroughly literate storytelling, accessible yet 
intricate, comical yet contemplative, shrewd yet deeply empathetic. Clare 
Kerslake, a photographer, has returned to Scotland for the annual family 
vacation at her uncle's estate, and she brings with her a secret, unknown even 
to her: how she lost her right hand, and her lover his life, on Zimbabwe's 
highest mountain, Nyangani. That mystery is a minor one in this book, however, 
for Maitland's concerns are more profound: why people become what they become, 
do what they do, fear what they fear. Clare gradually regains her memory in the 
course of this summer sojourn, and her account of the fatal hike at the end of 
the book is mesmerizing, but it's Maitland's ability to capture the complexity 
of family relations that makes "Ancestral Truths" so compelling. All seven of 
the Kerslake children have their moments in the sun, and each seems essential 
to the family pattern: Joseph the dutiful eldest, Tom the trouble-free joker, 
Ceci the Carmelite nun, Ben the soon-to-be-defrocked gay priest, Anni the 
scientist, Felicity the pressured mother of a 5-year-old who cannot hear. Early 
on one wonders whether "Ancestral Truths" will fall into melodrama, given that 
the novel begins with Clare's accident and acquisition of a newfangled 
prosthetic hand, but Maitland's tone and language is in fact unerring. 
"Ancestral Truths" at first seems to be about loss, but ultimately it's about 
the need for risk and the inevitability of change.

 The child asks about earth

<P>
 The earth is a school. It is a waiting room, a

 foyer giving onto emptiness 
</P>
<P>
 It is for desires, small but beautifully done 
</P>
<P>
 The earth is wrapped in weather, and the

 weather in risen words

<P>
 The child is awake, singing to himself, 
</P>
<P>
 speaking in a language ending with the

<P>
 Unaware of the sea entering, of the eternal

 A sudden gust of yellow tickets, a cold blue

 HERE WE ARE IN PARADISE: Stories by Tony Earley (Little, Brown: $19.95; 232 
pp.). There are a number of arresting stories in this first collection by Tony 
Earley, many of them dealing with the McBride clan of Aliceville, N.C. 
"Charlotte" deserves special mention, though, because it's terrific, describing 
the changes that overcome a town when it opts for the big time -- or as the 
chamber of commerce would put it, "comes of age."Earley views the change 
through the arrival of a pro basketball team, the Hornets, which effectively 
displaces Charlotte's professional wrestling circuit. The story is a 
beautifully melancholic elegy: "In the old days," says the narrator, manager of 
a fern-bar called PJ's, "our heroes were as superficial as were as superficial 
as we were -- but we knew that -- and their struggles were exaggerated versions 
of our own. Now we have the Hornets. They wear uniforms designed by Alexander 
Julian, and play hard and loose, and make us look into our souls. Now . . . we 
have to think about the things that are true: Everyone in Charlotte is from 
somewhere else." Pro wrestling, here, becomes improbably transcendent, for 
something vital seems at stake when Lord Poetry confronts Bob Noxious over 
fellow wrestler Darling Donnis during the sport's last stand in Charlotte, 
dubbed "The Final Battle . . . for Love." The fight is pure camp -- Donnis hard 
put to choose between Noxious' undulating pectorals and Lord Poetry's 
recitation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 -- but Earley gives it grace and weight. 
With wrestling gone, there will no longer be baying at the moon when Rockin' 
Robbie stops at PJ's, or respectful attention when Lord Poetry auditions a new 
sonnet; the city knows there's a vacuum the Hornets can't fill, for Charlotte 
natives "now have to live with ourselves."

 Regarding "Rubble-Rousing" (Three on the Town, by Jonathan Gold, Feb. 27), I 
too was out of town when the earthquake hit.And I'm not upset that a bunch of 
freeways and buildings collapsed. What I can't stand is that everywhere I go, 
people can't stop talking about their stupid little earthquake experiences. 
Fine. The first one or two times I heard these stories, they were interesting. 
Now they're just boring. I'm sorry that people lost their homes and their 
lives, but I wish the rest of you would just stop yammering about your petty 
seismic run-ins and get on with your lives.

<P>
 I see the clothing in "A Designer Portfolio: Fashion, Anti-Fashion" (Style, by 
Michael Eisenhower and Troy House, Feb. 27) as having little purpose, and poor 
design being touted as "style" when truly what designers are hoping for is that 
it will become fashionable long enough to make them money. Whom are you trying 
to fool? And why are you working hand in hand with designers selling things 
that people should know better than to buy?

 Day for Night (Bravo Thursday at 7 p.m.; Friday at midnight) is Francois 
Truffaut's delightful, compassionate 1973 insider's look at those involved in 
trying to make a foolish movie.

<P>
 Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet (Showtime Friday at 8 a.m.) is a tremendously 
intelligent and engaging 1940 film biography of the 19th-Century scientist -- 
superbly played by Edward G. Robinson -- who developed a cure for syphilis.

 Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.): 
To watch Marcel Ophuls' Oscar-winning 1988 documentary on the late, sadistic

novel and a real-life detective story.

NICE 'ADVENTURE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Adventures of Brisco Country Jr. (Friday nights on Fox): I have 
seen just one episode, but I find it to be hilarious. It is that by virtue of 
being such a hodgepodge of stereotypes, and departures of stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mystery to me how "nice" all the characters can be, involved, as they 
are, in trying to run someone in for a bounty. But that's great, isn't it? 
Shouldn't we all try to be nice no matter how nasty the situation is? Or is 
that being phony? 
</P>
<P>
 Alan J. Sweeney, St. Louis The Turnoff 'Point' 
</P>
<P>
 We were very disappointed in the premiere of "Turning Point" (ABC) and with 
Diane Sawyer. There must be more interesting people to interview than the 
Manson followers. As they say, if you don't like the program, turn to another 
station -- which I did. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Harvey, Arcadia 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding ABC's "Turning Point": Wouldn't it make for a more perfect melding 
of journalism and jurisprudence if Diane Sawyer could move the process up a bit 
and interview murderers still in the act? 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Andres, Santa Barbara 'Love' Had Class 
</P>
<P>
 "This Can't Be Love" (CBS, March 13) with superstars Katharine Hepburn and 
Anthony Quinn kept me glued to the screen for two hours. Every aspect of it was 
superb -- a rare treat. It had class.

 Ruth Bryan, Los Angeles Zapata Correction 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to your description of the great Mexican revolutionary Zapata in your 
sidebar on "The Mighty Quinn" ("Viva Zapata," TV Times, March 13), he was never 
president of Mexico. And his first name was Emiliano, not Emilio, as you had 
it.

THREE ON THE TOWN: THE LAST LAUGH; WHAT MADE COMEDY A YUK A MINUTE IN THE '70S 
HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH '90S MEDIOCRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The post-recession '70s crushed in on me. I jumped behind the wheel, desperate 
for release if not escape. I headed for L.A.'s hottest comedy stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Free parking was a cinch. My eyes scanned the marquee. I wanted a whiff of the 
newcomers. Unknowns took chances, and even when bad, usually proved 
fascinating. Besides, talent nights and off nights were all I could afford. And 
management didn't complain if I nursed my one-and-only drink through the set. 
</P>
<P>
 I breezed through the door after the pro forma ID check and teensy cover 
charge. In the main room, my eyes swept the wide crescent for a cozy squat. To 
sit up front was to risk being foil to somebody's shtick, being coaxed onstage 
for major embarrassment, or getting an unexpected cleaning bill. So I'd sit 
mid-room, or snare an unreserved booth. Wrapping myself around my increasingly 
watery Cuba libre , I lost my private worries in the public personas of the 
laugh-makers.  
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Ray Moore was forbidden fruit and Lenny Bruce overdosed before I lost my 
baby fat, but catching Mort Sahl live at the hungry i, on San Francisco's North 
Beach, a decade after the beatnik heyday, jump-started my love affair with 
laugh houses. But as they mushroomed in the '80s, intimacy gave way to trend, 
and then to a new wave of non-traditional comics. In these barely 
post-recession '90s, as rampant greed breeds self-censorship, the guffaws are 
fewer and further between. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrive on time. Parking is terrible and expensive. I have reservations for 
my daughter's birthday, certain we are going to catch Bobcat Goldthwait's act. 
Then, while paying for our tickets, we discover Bobcat isn't on the bill. But 
it's a special evening so we stay, mollified by one recognizable name, a young 
black comic starring in his first movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, we discover seating is first come, first served. Then why did we have 
to stand in line for an hour when we had reservations and there was no earlier 
show? Reservations, we're told, are the management's body count. Not enough? 
Then the show is canceled. As for the line, customers double as involuntary 
shills, a draw for walk-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 There are barely 30 people in a room that'll seat 150. We're sandwiched into 
the far right corner, making for uncomfortable neck craning. My husband points 
out that the joint isn't exactly jumping, but he's forced to ask for our money 
back before we're seated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 We're invited to play the raffle. Prizes will be awarded over the phone, we're 
told. Patiently we fill out our little red raffle tickets. As we chew on 
pasteboard-flavored munchables and slurp overpriced drinks, the show begins. 
</P>
<P>
 From beyond the stale -- out trots one retread after another. A couple have 
mined news headlines for source material but instead of caustic, witty asides 
or imaginative sendups, we're fed high-school-level pap -- not even as good as 
elephant jokes. No risks taken here and (gasp!) no four-letter words. Two are 
so unoriginal they manage to tell the same joke in the same set. I manage to 
get off a couple of solid boos despite my husband's disparaging elbow and my 
daughter's chastising "Mom!" 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, for the caustic smarts of a Sahl, the imagination of a Jay Leno, the savvy 
wit of a Steve Allen, the razor tongue of an Eddie Murphy, even the rude 
nastiness of an Andrew Dice Clay. Our evening is barely saved by the young 
comic, who skirts Pryor-like slams at white folk for funny, poignant and rare 
glimpses into the black psyche, and one hard-drinking holdover from the 
Smothers Brothers era. But even they fail to dispel the blatant pathos of 
mediocrity dying to be discovered by TV sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations! You took part in our club's door-prize lottery! You're a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great. What did I win?" 
</P>
<P>
 "A free evening of fun at our club with a maximum of 15 guests." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmmm. Uh -- well, thanks, but no thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want your prize?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some other time." I hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 Twasn't a bit funny, McGee.

 WHERE THE RIVERS FLOW NORTH by Howard Frank Mosher (Penguin: $10.95; 205 pp.). 
The stories in this collection are set in a fictional county in northern 
Vermont where life retains some of its old savor: satellite dishes and 
fast-food franchises have yet to subsume its individuality.Mosher draws clear, 
understated portraits of farmers, haulers and hunters who live close to the 
land that supports them. In the title novella, Noel Lord, the last scion of a 
once-wealthy family, and Bangor, his aging, Amerindian housekeeper, struggle to 
eke out a living amid the ruins of his estate. When a rare mountain lion begins 
to prey on the neighbors stock, Noel realizes he, the big cat and a grove of 
ancient pines have all become anachronisms, "vestigal accessories to the 
vanished wilderness."

 DEATH BY CHEESEBURGER: High School Journalism in the 1990s and Beyond edited 
by Carol Knopes (The Freedom Forum, 1101 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22209: 
$14.95; 181 pp., illustrated, paperback original). The contributors to this 
perky, well-intentioned volume attempt to plot trends in high school 
journalism, especially issues concerning freedom of press.But the many graphs, 
illustrations and mini-profiles echo the look of USA Today, the bane of serious 
journalists. The text reveals that teen-agers who try to cover critical issues 
-- AIDS, drug abuse, pregnancy, violence -- often find themselves at odds with 
administrators who want them to stick to sports and pep rallies. Many of the 
writers seem more interested in pursuing their own PC agendas than in 
showcasing noteworthy student writing.

 THE KWINKAN by Mudrooroo (Angus & Robertson/HarperCollins: $10; 130 pp., 
paperback original). The latest novel by Aboriginal writer Mudrooroo takes the 
form of a series of depositions by a would-be big-shot.The narrator's failure 
as a businessman and political candidate in Queensland puts him at the mercy of 
the party bosses, who send him to investigate a Pacific island group that's 
about to become an independent state. The inept fixer wastes his time pursuing 
the heiress of the island's de facto ruling family, whom he compares to a 
Kwinkan, a siren in Aboriginal myths. Despite his dreams of glory, the narrator 
remains a pawn in a game waged by the heiress, a Japanese businesswoman and an 
Aboriginal undercover agent, in a stinging portrait of intransigent, 
post-colonial racism.

 THE REVENGE OF GOD: The Resurgence of Islam, Christianity and Judaism in the 
Modern World by Gilles Kepel, translated from the French by Alan Braley (The 
Pennsylvania State University Press: $14.95.; 215 pp., paperback original). 
Kepel's well-researched study examines religious revival movements in Islam, 
Judaism and Christianity (both American evangelical Protestantism and European 
Catholicism). Followers of each movement seek to remold society by repudiating 
"Godless" rationalism, which they blame for the erosion of some traditional 
values in the modern world. Kepel carefully notes differences, as well as 
similarities (Orthodox Jewish activists don't seek converts, as evangelical 
Christians do) in this intelligent, often disturbing look at an increasingly 
widespread phenomenon.

 TREES FOR TOMORROW by Frank Lockyear & Robert Gray (WRS Publishing: $12.95; 
226 pp., illustrated, paperback original). In this conversational memoir, the 
80-year-old founder of ReTree recalls how he helped to plant more than 3 
million trees around the world. ReTree is an environmental organization 
dedicated to planting forests on idle lands wherever they will grow, involving 
young people in tree-planting and supporting forestry research. Lockyear 
combines his personal reminiscences with information about trees: how they lift 
water to branches hundreds of feet above ground, how many seeds a single tree 
may produce, etc. Although not a great prose stylist, he emerges as a warm, 
humane man readers may want to adopt as a substitute grandfather.

 FLOWERING INFERNO: Tales of Sinking Hearts by Rima de Vallbona, translated 
from the Spanish by Lillian Lorca de Tagle (Latin American Literary Review 
Press: $ ?? ; 92 pp., paperback original). These extremely brief short stories 
depict a world of magical realism in which reality grows tenuous. A student 
discovers Circe lurking in a modern university; a 90-year-old grandmother gives 
up tyrannizing to become a bowling champion. Intriguing, if uneven, work from a 
noted Costa Rican writer.

 CIA SPECIAL WEAPONS & EQUIPMENT: Spy Devices of the Cold War by H. Keith 
Melton (Sterling Publishing: $10.95; 127 pp., illustrated). Melton's collection 
of weapons and listening devices reads like a catalogue of props for a James 
Bond movie. The equipment includes a homing beacon hidden in a fake dog turd, a 
mechanical pencil that conceals a murderous steel needle and explosive flour 
that can be mixed with water and molded into any shape or even baked into 
muffins without losing its destructive capabilities. Many Americans prefer to 
think U.S. agents never really used this kind of espionage equipment, but the 
Ames case suggests they still do.

 THE LONGEVITY FACTOR by Lydia Bronte (Harper Collins: $20) . AGELESS BODY, 
TIMELESS MIND by Deepak Chopra (Harmony Books: $22). Boomers weary of corporate 
downsizing, the youth culture and other pressures of the clock (biological or 
work site) often ease their Angst by consulting a career guru or splurging on 
the latest fruit-acid anti-wrinkle cream. What would probably help even more, 
two recent books suggest, is a new attitude toward both work and aging. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Longevity Factor," Lydia Bronte shows via case histories how long 
careers -- which are becoming the norm with expanded life-spans -- can lead to 
richer, healthier lives. She's discovered five basic career models. In "Ageless 
Body, Timeless Mind," holistic medicine doc Deepak Chopra suggests our 
attitudes age us very prematurely and that the power to turn back the clock is 
indeed in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte (ironically a cousin of the literary Bronte sisters, two of whom passed 
in their 20s) traces the career paths of 150 people, ages 65 to 101, in her 
Long Careers Study. From 1987 to 1992, she conducted personal interviews, 
collecting 9,000 pages of raw transcripts and some surprising revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent is the stereotype that most older workers all stay at one job, their 
eye on the gold watch and retirement party. The workers Bronte calls 
homesteaders (such as Actress Jessica Tandy) do remain in the same field but 
are endlessly fascinated, never experiencing the twangs of midlife crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, transformer types (Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, Julia Child) 
required a major career change before finding their life's work. Explorers 
(Studs Terkel, Robert McNamara) changed careers often throughout their work 
lives, while late bloomers (Frances Lear) and long growth curve folks 
(management consultant Dr. W. Edwards Deming) reached their peaks of success 
later in their careers. Then there are the retirers and returners (Sam Goody), 
who left work but soon returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte's information will be invaluable as the work force comes to terms with 
the reality of expanded life-spans and the realization that there's no single 
"right" career model. But her participants' list, which reads like a hybrid of 
a social register and "Who's Who," can leave the reader wondering why there 
aren't more interesting "everyday" folks featured, such as Ollie Thompson, the 
Alabama farmer-turned-maintenance-man and then chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the mind-set toward work has improved, why not tune up that ageist, 
self-defeating attitude? And what better guide than Chopra, the mind-body guru 
whose other bestsellers include "Perfect Health" and "Quantum Healing." 
</P>
<P>
 The human body, Chopra points out, is in constant renewal -- in a single year, 
98% of the body's atoms are replaced with new ones. Put another way, only a 
tiny percent of aging can be blamed on birthday-related changes. The rest of 
that downhill slide known as middle and old age is due to society's attitudes 
and personal bad habits like smoking and lack of exercise. Change personal 
perceptions (along with some habits) and one can change not just one's own body 
but the world, Chopra insists. Reprogram the mind to remain youthful and it 
will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof that much of what is termed inevitable aging is hooey, Chopra relies 
on both establishment research and new-age techniques. He cites a well-known 
Tufts University study, respected by exercise experts, that found men 60 to 72 
who pumped iron boosted their muscle mass and could lift heavier boxes than 
some 25-year-olds. But he also includes more avant-garde techniques such as how 
to improve time "metabolism" and how to develop an awareness that is timeless 
rather than time-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapters end with practical exercises, teaching readers such techniques as 
body breathing. The quizzes ("How Do You Metabolize Time?") are pretty 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Both books are quick and inspiring reads. At the very least, readers will hear 
a new spin on how to handle the stress of jobs and birthdays. Ponder the points 
further and the feeling can be one of boundless energy -- if not invincibility.

YES, LET'S HAVE MORE BANANAS; NP, BY BANANA YOSHIMOTO (GROVE/ATLANTIC: $18; 194 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Todd Grimson, Todd Grimson is a free-lance writer based in Oregon. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "NP" is an eerie, marvelous novel of Japanese "Generation X" youth caught in 
baroquely tangled emotional webs. Banana Yoshimoto proves herself worthy of all 
the hype and attention she received for her first novel, "Kitchen." In "NP," 
she has created an unforgettable portrait of Sui, a kind of female James Dean, 
suffering and confused but sincere, seemingly doomed and fatalistic, yet full 
of spunk and fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the basic relationships among the characters are twisted and crazy, 
they seem to arise naturally within the logic of the narrative: lurid material 
treated with subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 "NP" is the title of a book within the book, a collection of stories written 
by Sarao Takase. He lived in the United States for many years, composed the 97 
stories in English and committed suicide before they were translated into his 
native Japanese. There is also a legendary 98th story, dealing with 
father-daughter incest, and it is this story that haunts everyone in the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Our narrator, Kazami, a translator, had an affair with another translator, 
Shoji Toda, while she was still in high school. He was working on "NP" when, 
unable to get the 98th story quite right, he too committed suicide; so had 
another translator (with his assistant) before him. All of this has taken place 
offstage, before the main action of the story takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazami, now 22, attempted to translate the book into Japanese before giving 
up: "Quitting was a sign of a healthy mind -- I think. . . . What would be an 
appropriate metaphor to explain my feelings when I was doing the translation? 
An endless meadow of golden pampas grass swaying in the wind, or a coral reef 
beneath a deep, brilliant blue ocean. That utter stillness you feel when you 
see a whole bunch of tropical fish swimming by, all in bright colors, and they 
don't even look like living creatures. . . . You're not going to live long with 
that kind of world in your head." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kazami becomes friends with Sarao Takase's daughter, Saki, she wonders 
about that 98th story, in which the main character "gets divorced and starts 
leading the wild singles life. Then he falls in love with a teen-age girl he 
meets in a bar on the outskirts of town. Only after he has slept with her 
several times does he discover that she is his own daughter." Is this Saki? 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, this story is based on fact; however, it was not about Saki, 
but rather about Sui, a step-sister, who is now living with Otohiko, her 
half-brother. Sui seems so unstable, and the relationship so doomed, that both 
Kazami and Saki are afraid that a "love suicide" is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazami becomes fascinated by Sui and, to her own surprise, falls in love with 
her; she says she has never had lesbian feelings before. Sui is tormented, and 
has that fatal mix of innocence and just enough wildness to evoke the hero of 
"Rebel Without a Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Banana Yoshimoto achieves some extraordinary effects here with her 
semi-ingenuous narrator. Nuance and the space between thoughts create 
irresistible tension here in a situation that might in other hands be 
melodramatic. Yoshimoto hits some of the same notes that a previous 
generation's literary masters (say, Kawabata or Tanizaki) might sound, and yet 
the effect seems artless, spontaneous and wonderfully fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshimoto's first novel, "Kitchen," was about omnipresent grief and a kind of 
pre-sexual adolescent love. It appeared in Japan when the author was 24, and 
"Bananamania" struck: She was a sensation. Her work evidently played on some 
deep cultural chord. I confess I read it with high hopes (for a review in these 
pages) but remained unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
 "NP" is on another level entirely. It is nearly flawless, and shows that 
Banana Yoshimoto is fit to stand alongside Haruki Murakami, who, at his best, 
is as good as anyone writing today. 
</P>
<P>
 Banana Yoshimoto is for real.

PALM LATITUDES: ON RAMP; NO-POLLUTE COMMUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The lowly bicycle commuter, windblown, his Hugo Boss suit branded with chain 
marks, has a benefactor. Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises, which makes RVs 
and manufactured housing, touts a bicycle commuter program that has about 12% 
of its 600-plus employees cycling to work an average of three times per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other L.A.-area firms offer showers and bike racks as incentives, but 
Fleetwood provides much more: loaner bikes, equipment such as helmets, 
reflective vests and headlamps, bike lockers, showers, a maintenance facility 
and a shuttle service for stranded cyclists. And it's company policy to forgive 
tardiness caused by cycling. "It's a fantastic program, the best I'm aware of," 
says Ryan Snyder of the Los Angeles Transportation Commission. "They've done 
just about everything you can do for a bicyclist." 
</P>
<P>
 The program started in 1989 after the Air Quality Management District ordered 
companies to try to increase occupancy rates of employee vehicles to 1.5 
commuters per car. Fleetwood found that 21% of its workers were interested in 
bicycle commuting, and a successful program was born. "A few people cycle in 
from 16 miles," says Roberta Holden, Fleetwood's employee transportation 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the stars when I start out in the morning -- something you just 
don't notice in a car," says senior program analyst Cliff Luchsinger, who 
cycles five miles to work and is president of the company's bike club, Mud, 
Sweat & Gears. "It's better than coffee." R. Daniel Foster

PALM LATITUDES: BOTTOM LINE; REDEFINING THE DOGGIE BAG

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Look, there goes one of my clients," says Chris Crosson excitedly, pointing 
at the tail end of a golden retriever as we sit in a Balboa Island coffee shop. 
"Yea for dogs!" he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosson has good reason to rejoice: He's president of Doggie Walk Bags, which 
has sold 250,000 of the pooper-scoopers-in-a-capsule that are a hot item among 
Orange County dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became fed up with having to avoid dog nuisances whenever I walked around 
my neighborhood," says the Irvine resident, who does not own a dog. ("I 
replaced my dog with a 1-year-old son.") So Crosson began experimenting with 
alternatives to the shovel and brown bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his first invention, a cumbersome lunch box-type device, was 
unsuccessful, he persisted. In 1991, Crosson, who is also a life insurance 
executive, made a hit with his one-inch plastic capsules. 
</P>
<P>
 The capsules, which contain blue polyethylene bags, are sold in several Orange 
County pet stores as well as in dispensers at some parks and other public 
lands. (PetCare in Redondo Beach is the only L.A. County outlet.) In Laguna 
Beach, for example, Doggie Walk Bag dispensers have been installed in several 
parks and along the boardwalk. The seaside resort is very serious about canine 
fanciers who shirk their doggie duties -- 11 people were cited on a recent 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kellogg walks his yellow Labrador, Buddy, on Laguna's boardwalk about 
once a week. The quarter he drops in the Doggie Walk Bag vending machine at the 
beginning of each trek is well spent, Kellogg says. "It's a small price to pay 
for keeping this area clean," Kellogg says. "Besides, Buddy is a big dog and I 
wouldn't want to come upon his mess in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Crosson has solved one problem only to discover another. His Laguna 
Beach dispensers have become favorite resting spots for sea gulls, who 
frequently drop and fly. Sharon Tetrault

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; DRIVING AMBITION

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Margie Smith-Haas, 1993 went by much too quickly. Maybe that's because she 
spent much of it behind the wheel of her Super Sports 2000-class race car, 
which can take her to 165 m.p.h. Last year, Smith-Haas drove it to second place 
in the drivers' championship of the American City Racing League, which pits 
teams from eight cities against one another. Her Team San Diego finished third 
in the league competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my most successful year," she says, and this year looks just as 
promising: Smith-Haas, one of only 15 female professional road racers in the 
country, has taken second place in her first two ACRL races, missing first each 
time by under two-tenths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Haas says she didn't plan on a racing career. "But during college I 
helped my boyfriend with his slalom racing," she says. "I'd pull the car in 
line for him, but he got to get in and do the fun stuff."

 She decided to get in on the fun stuff one day in 1971 when her folks were out 
of town. "I borrowed the family Buick Electra, made some minor modifications 
and drove 60 miles to enter the drag races." That did it. Two years later, 
after teaching P.E. and moonlighting as a coach and restaurant hostess, 
Smith-Haas had saved enough money to buy her first race car -- a Porsche 914. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she's competed in races throughout North America, Europe and 
Australia. In 1983, she raced in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and in 1984 and '85 
she was the only woman to compete in the 24-hour race at Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has had the expected run-ins with sexism on the track (she once 
had to endure 90 minutes of the throttle's sticking to the floor at Daytona 
because mechanics refused to take her complaints seriously), she says "male 
drivers in general have been very supportive. You can prove yourself on the 
track because that's something they can measure."  
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't keep other people from commenting on her choice of profession. 
"People are always surprised when they meet me," says Smith-Haas. " 'You do 
what ?' they say. 'You don't look like a race-car driver!' " And, as Smith-Haas 
points out, the danger factor is relative. "Driving on a racetrack is far less 
dangerous than driving on our Southern California freeways." Sharon Whitley

 You wouldn't expect to find Wonderland in the scrubby hills east of downtown 
San Diego, but a little slice of it hides behind an innocuous galvanized metal, 
glass and concrete-block facade. Cross the wooden footbridge, open the door, 
and suddenly an immense space opens up below, tumbling downward in a succession 
of stairs and platforms. At the bottom lies a lofty room dominated by a giant 
mural lashed to a "floating" glass-and-wood-stud wall. Alice doesn't live here, 
but this architectural fantasy is home to muralist Linda Churchill and her 
husband, Nicholas Weiss. Together, they make up Muralizing, the 8-year-old 
company responsible for the painted images behind the scoreboard at Jack Murphy 
Stadium and over the new bars at Del Mar racetrack. "She does the painting and 
I do the rigging," says the British-born Weiss, a former yacht captain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, in the community of Encanto, Churchill and Weiss discovered a place 
where they wanted to both live and work. Unfortunately, it featured only a 
small bungalow that stood below street level. So they asked architect Jeanne 
McCallum to build an addition: "Design one huge open room in which anything can 
happen." Weiss, a fan of the English TV series "Dr. Who," also suggested that 
an entrance tower could resemble the program's time machine. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, McCallum, a young designer of small homes, crafted a building 
inspired by the steep but ample site. A metal roof and terraced floors mimic 
the slope of the hill; between them is wide-open space. A solid concrete-block 
wall screens out neighbors, and a lattice of glass and fir frames the views. 
The new loft-like space is not function-specific, though cooking and dining 
tend to take place on the cantilevered top deck, office chores are performed at 
mid-level and the lowest level is "either a living room or a studio, depending 
on the projects we're working on," Churchill says. To complement the new space, 
the couple are renovating the original house to serve as a more conventional 
living area. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall feeling is one of rough-and-ready flexibility, in which planned 
uses give way to many different activities. "In this space," Churchill says, 
"we can just be kids. We can do whatever we want. We never have to grow up. 
It's a space that lends itself to an easy kind of energy, and it's much more 
than we ever imagined possible." AARON BETSKY

 Early in this century, architect Irving Gill discovered that if he stripped 
decoration from the walls of Spanish Colonial houses and simplified the floor 
plan, an architecture of pure form and abstraction resulted. The line between 
hacienda architecture and Modernism was thin, and he erased it. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lubowicki and Susan Lanier, two young architects with a practice in El 
Segundo, recently reiterated the discovery in a 1,300-square-foot 
bedroom-and-gallery addition at the back of a sleepy Spanish revival house in 
Brentwood. From the front, the two-story, L-shaped home, designed by 1920s 
traditionalist John Byers, is a Romantic classic worthy of a Ramona pageant, 
with an oak balcony overlooking a walled entry court. At the rear, the simple 
and serene Modernist addition grows out of the old house as if by Darwinian 
evolution, the plain new walls emerging from those from 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Before hiring the architects, the owner of the house, Susan Stringfellow -- an 
interior designer and associate at the Angles gallery in Santa Monica -- had 
already created a Minimalist interior that echoed the rudiments of old Spanish 
farmhouses in its aesthetic austerity. She had painted walls inside and out 
white to contrast with the dark, stained wood trim. She had bleached the floor, 
and in the emptiness placed a few good pieces of country furniture, the natural 
woods waxed with a dark stain.  
</P>
<P>
 Stringfellow wanted the addition to have the same spirit. "I wanted harmony 
between old and new, but I didn't want the new to imitate the old: that would 
be Disneyland," she says. "To bring about the harmony, we worked to keep the 
addition from overwhelming the old house, and we used materials with a sense of 
authenticity. I'm passionate about steel and concrete. It's somehow rewarding 
to use things that aren't easy but are beautiful when finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Lubowicki and Lanier designed an L-shaped addition that mirrors the 
configuration of the original house. Alongside the existing living room, they 
paired the new gallery, doubling the living area, and then extended the bedroom 
wing back into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Stringfellow, the architects emphasized the character of the 
materials, as in the serene gray-green limestone floors and the luminous 
honey-colored, vertical-grain Douglas fir doors. A long, poured-in-place 
concrete wall retains a swirling grain imprinted by the board forms of the 
mold; the unpainted plaster walls inside have the translucency of skin, 
revealing variations in color and depth. Stringfellow allows the materials and 
spaces to breathe by furnishing the rooms with the same simplicity as in the 
original house. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Byers (and even Gill), Lubowicki and Lanier did not think of the 
addition as a grouping of boxlike rooms but broke it into parts that they 
telescoped into the yard. At the garden end of the bedroom, a small sitting 
room projects into the garden, brushed by lavender, and at its end, an 
elegantly blunt and square concrete fireplace projects even farther, engaging a 
narrow reflecting pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Light washes all the surfaces through clerestory and side windows as forms 
slip by each other allowing views outside -- especially in the large shower 
stall, where white free-standing walls devoid of tile face a plate-glass view 
of a side garden. Meanwhile, a thick beam runs the length of the interior, 
uniting the different spaces and collage of materials. "It's a traditional 
gabled house with all the elements expressed," says Lanier. "We don't like 
things that look over-designed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the artistic circles in which Stringfellow works and socializes, light has 
been a subject and medium of particular interest since the time when artists of 
the 1960s went beyond painting to use it to create atmospheric effects. 
Similarly, Lubowicki and Lanier bring light inside to create sun paintings that 
shift by the hour. By breaking the bedroom addition into its architectural 
parts, placing windows in spaces that would normally be corners, the designers 
not only open the addition to the garden. They also create interiors that are 
catchments of light, in which change is the order of the day and serenity the 
revelation. JOSEPH GIOVANNINI

 With its vibrant colors and rich, organic materials, architect Steven 
Ehrlich's recent renovation for Hannah Hempstead, who directs television 
commercials, is a home in harmony with its environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Located on a quiet street in Venice, the stucco box was transformed with 
maple, Douglas fir, copper and Idaho flagstone into an expansive two-story 
structure of bold spaces and planes. On the outside, in the tradition of 
warm-weather architecture, Ehrlich's modern California-Mediterranean-style home 
has thick walls and recessed doors and windows to provide protection from the 
sun. Inside, the two-foot walls cradle a series of closets, shelves and 
cabinets. Hempstead never uses her air conditioning. "I open all the front and 
back windows to take advantage of the tropical breezes and to listen to the 
rustle of the palm trees," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrlich's architecture, such as in the Sony building and the Broadway Deli in 
Santa Monica, frequently features exterior spaces that become seamless 
extensions of the indoors, creating outdoor rooms for living. Here, casement 
windows directly above the French doors in the 12-foot-ceiling living room help 
to connect the inside with the outside, while the flagstone traverses the front 
enclosed patio area and extends out to the back yard. A lap pool sits within 
diving distance of the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 So like the colors of Italy's Positano, the burnt sienna and ocher on the 
exterior were achieved through mixing pigments into the stucco, then hand 
troweling and burnishing for a mottled, handcrafted quality. Repeated on the 
interior living room and bedroom fireplaces, and on a wall adjacent to the 
stairwell, the colors bring warmth to the modern interior by repeating the 
connection with the earth. Ehrlich's goal: "To create a place of tranquillity 
in connection with the natural environment that is simple, light-filled and 
protective. As our society becomes more urban, our homes must become our 
pockets of repose." BARBARA THORNBURG

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savvy restaurant-goers who like wine with their dinner eschew Chardonnay and 
Cabernet; they choose wines from other grapes, with flavors that better match 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 Since so many restaurants offer wine lists containing only endless columns of 
the C and C wines, the 150-wine list at Pascal is a treat to see.It has many 
wines from grapes that actually marry with food, and prices are within reason. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the list has the wonderful, unavailable 1985 Trimbach 
"Ribeaupierre" Gewurztraminer at $38 and a slew of red Rhones, including the 
excellent, hearty 1989 St. Joseph from Jaboulet, $25. 
</P>
<P>
 The list also offers 13 nice Bordeaux, including older selections, seven good 
white Burgundies and six intriguing dessert wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the California section of the list is by region, so the "Napa Valley 
White" section includes everything from Chardonnay to white Zinfandel. In that 
section, however, are a number of good values, including 1991 Mondavi Fume 
Blanc Reserve, $28; 1991 Shafer Chardonnay, $25; 1989 Marlstone from Clos du 
Bois, $34, and 1990 Arrowood Merlot, $36 (just $8 above retail). Dan Berger

ON THE RECORD: CHAMBER GROUPS: LOOK AND SOUND OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the rest of the classical music world continues to wallow in its problems, 
those of finding audiences and finding money, chamber music seems more viable 
than ever -- for at least two obvious reasons: It's relatively inexpensive to 
produce, and there is an inexhaustible supply of talented young artists willing 
to try their hands at a form of music-making that is neither as demanding nor 
chancy as pursuing a solo career or as anonymous as membership in an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 As some of the old chamber-music guard wanes and inevitably leaves the scene, 
the newcomers proliferate and are recorded, with the guessing as to who will 
still be around in a decade as widespread as the new recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the Artis Quartet would seem to be assured. The playing of these 
four young Viennese -- all are in their early 30s -- on several Sony releases 
over the past three years has been consistently admirable. Their latest effort, 
however, a pairing (on Sony 53282) of Dvorak's sublime last quartet, in A-flat, 
Opus 105, and Smetana's "From My Life," is the stuff of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing even faintly Vienna-cute about their playing: no overemphasis 
on sweetness of tone, no coy little decorative (as distinct from organic) 
portamentos. Rather, we are given playing that is big and bold in sound, at 
once songfully expressive, sensitively shaded and rhythmically propulsive. Just 
what these folk-inspired Czech masterpieces require and deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Two likewise extravagantly gifted, young but already experienced ensembles 
offer new recordings: Berlin's Vogler Quartet, and from Salzburg the three 
siblings and a friend who make up the Hagen Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, the Vogler, whose members seem never even to have to overcome a 
technical problem -- which may, ironically, be their main problem -- are for 
the most part too fast, too furious, too unwilling to explore the shadows and 
nuances of Debussy's Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Vogler Debussy is hit and miss, the remainder of their imaginatively 
constructed program (RCA Victor 61816) represents their best recorded work to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 The players balance the extreme agitation of Janacek's "Kreutzer Sonata" 
Quartet (after the Tolstoy story which inspired it) with its moments of dark, 
but still edgy, introspection while bringing welcome energy and contrast to the 
seemingly enervated, in less perceptive hands, pages of Shostakovich's 11th 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hagens likewise offer the Debussy, this time with its usual discmate, the 
Ravel Quartet, and a third work, the roughly contemporaneous but 
ever-so-different 1905 Quartet of Anton Webern (Deutsche Grammophon 437 836). 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the Webern, which is given a fittingly ripe, delirious reading, 
this is not one of the Hagens' more imposing outings. Both French works are 
short on atmosphere, with the group's usually tight ensemble and lithe energy 
inconsistently on display. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some even trickier repertory, the maligned piano trios of Robert Schumann, are 
accorded grandly convincing interpretations by the members of the Copenhagen 
Trio, who are in their late-20s: pianist Morten Mogensen, violinist Soren 
Elbaek and cellist Svane Hermansen (Kontrapunkt 321767/8, two CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 While the first trio, in D minor, has its champions -- and fairly strong 
recorded representation -- the other two approach obscurity. In the case of the 
exceedingly disheveled No. 3, that is largely merited. All No. 2 needs, 
however, is performers like the Copenhagen Trio, who appreciate its fine-spun 
lyricism and possess the smarts to allow that quality to take precedence over 
its less viable aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 What is of value in the other two trios is nonetheless apparent in the fluent, 
warm-toned but never miniaturizing approach of these young Danes. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly accomplished are the two sets of character pieces, the Opus 88 
"Fantasiestucke" and the blissful "Marchenerzahlungen," Opus 132, the latter 
with pianist Mogensen joined by violist Tim Frederiksen and clarinetist 
Ron-Chen Zion to round out a set that is as lustrously recorded as it is 
performed (Kontrapunkt 32167/8).

 The saxophone has been called the "instrument of jazz innovation" and with 
good reason: five of the music's most noted trailblazers -- Lester Young, 
Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman -- were 
saxophonists. There are many who think that Joe Lovano, with his incantatory 
blend of unbridled spontaneity and be-bop roots, is the jazz tenor innovator of 
our day; his new album, featuring Joshua Redman, goes to further that belief. 
</P>
<P>
 This vibrant, vital recording is no let-'em-rip blowing date. In fact, there's 
not even a blues -- the classic vehicle for a two-horn mock conflagration -- on 
the most satisfying program. Instead, the intriguing fare includes Monk's 
rarely heard "Introspection," Booker Little's driving "Rounder's Mood," and 
five Lovano originals, by turns cooking and exploratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovano and Redman complement each other. They have similar sounds -- each 
going with fat, puffy bottom tones and knife-thin top tones -- and distinct 
solo approaches. Lovano is purposefully rambunctious, playing a sultry, 
swinging phrase one moment, a wild, free-jazz bent burst the next. Redman, in 
like manner, is cohesive then startling, though he's more of a traditionalist 
than his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Several instances where the pair trade phrases creates a wealth of excitement. 
A crack rhythm team -- Mulgrew Miller, piano; Christian McBride, bass; Lewis 
Nash, drums; Don Alias, congas -- bolsters the tenorman and fleshes out this 
dandy session.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent). ZAN

 **** Steve Coleman and Five Elements, "The Tao of Mad Phat/Fringe Zones," 
Novus/RCA. Chalk it up to new drummer Oliver Gene Lake Jr., or the informal 
ambience of the live-with-studio-audience format, but this album is a quantum 
leap for saxophonist/composer Coleman.The density of his previous Five Elements 
albums required several listens to connect with the rhythmically based 
improvisation but the light, limber physicality of the funk here creates 
immediate contact. Coleman literally teaches Lake the groove to "Laid Back 
Schematics" on the spot and the cohesive ensemble interaction and variety of 
moods evoked by the music makes "Tao of Mad Phat" the best introduction yet to 
Coleman's concept.

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; ** 1/2 WYNTON MARSALIS, "IN THIS HOUSE ON THIS MORNING"; 
COLUMBIA

 Enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynton Marsalis' contribution to jazz is indisputable -- he has been a central 
factor in any resurgence this art form is now experiencing.But to call him the 
greatest trumpeter in the last 30 years, as his crony critic Stanley Crouch 
does in these liner notes, is to propagate an opinion that is both fallacious 
and laughable. And this is an era that has produced such masters as Freddie 
Hubbard, Woody Shaw, Lee Morgan and Tom Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
 On this album -- a two-CD, two-hour, blues-tinged recording that loftily aims 
to instrumentally portray the many varities of the Afro-American church service 
-- Marsalis reveals, as he has for some time, admirable strengths and puzzling 
weaknesses. His strengths remain his commanding technique, his round, burry 
sound. But he still falters as a swinging soloist by, say, unwittingly stopping 
a smooth flowing statement with an illogical leap to a higher note that 
shimmies oddly. 
</P>
<P>
 As a composer, Marsalis still works in the shadow of Duke Ellington, and 
there's a strong Ellington flavor to this piece. Many of the selections, such 
as "Call to Prayer," have a nice, modern swing feeling, while others, such as 
"Processional," have a '30s and '40s air, sounding dated and, at times, just 
plain corny. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are moments that provide plenty of pleasure. Among them: Todd 
Williams' raucous tenor crackling over a snappy 7/4 beat on "Recessional," Eric 
Reed's propulsive, gospel-based piano on "Holy Ghost" and guest vocalist Marion 
Williams' robust tones on "In This House." But by and large, the entire 
recording seems too intellectual for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

 On 1992's remarkable "Kiko," Los Lobos employed a vast array of sonic 
surprises to give its songs a magic realism twist. This side project teaming 
Lobos' David Hidalgo and Louie Perez with keyboardist Mitchell Froom and 
guitarist Tchad Blake -- the producer and engineer of "Kiko" -- is all 
twist.Yet it too is quite magical. 
</P>
<P>
 If short on actual songs, the album is full of bracing sonic vignettes, with a 
variety of instruments and found sounds used to paint pictures of street 
celebrations or Mexican villages or Chinese landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the numbers take more traditional song structure, Perez's lyrics are 
almost haiku-like in their spare imagery, and Hidalgo's soulfully serene vocals 
are as effective as on Los Lobos' more concrete material. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of the celebratory, rootsy foundation separates this from full Los 
Lobos projects. But seen as a one-off project, it makes a fine complement to 
the band's catalogue -- a chance to examine more closely one of the band's 
multiple facets. And seen as a continuation of "Kiko," it represents ambition 
and growth on par with that shown by U2 in its '90s albums. Stunning.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 "BACKBEAT", MUSIC FROM THE MOTION PICTURE; VIRGIN

 Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), Dave Pirner (Soul Asylum), Dave Grohl (Nirvana), 
Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) and Don Fleming (Gumball) may 
be superstars of grunge or alternative darlings, but they're no Beatles. Which 
was, apparently, precisely the point in casting them for this movie soundtrack: 
spirit uber imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the drama documenting the Beatles' early-'60s days as a Hamburg bar band, 
producer Don Was filled the audio roles to suggest the band's presumed generic 
pre-punk thrashiness, rather than the pop prodigies the world would soon know. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing special for Beatles nuts, but a swell party tape on its own 
extra-Fab terms. The 12 hectic songs here -- all familiar tunes like "Long Tall 
Sally" (no Lennon-McCartney titles) -- were recorded in single sweaty takes 
with maximum vim. 
</P>
<P>
 If, in the context of the film's mix, the recording sounds a little too clean 
and contemporary to suddenly be emanating from the amps of the Star Club, as 
CDs go the album does come off appropriately primitive. That the Beatles 
started off brash shouldn't come as a revelation to any but the very young; 
that this loose homage is good, disposable fun shouldn't surprise any but the 
most curmudgeonly.

RECORD RACK: *** MOTLEY CRUE, "MOTLEY CRUE"; ELEKTRA

By KATHERINE TURMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it a kinder, gentler Motley Crue that's entering its second decade? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly, but this album does suggest that the Crue may grow old gracefully, 
unlike many of the other L.A. metal bands that came of age in the '80s and 
later crashed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to say whether the addition of new singer John Corabi, whose 
voice is meatier and more appealing than predecessor Vince Neil's, is 
responsible for the shift in focus. But whatever the reason, there's less flash 
and more substance. Producer Bob Rock usually tends to turn out too-slick 
results, but in the Crue's case there's increased rhythmic muscle and visceral 
energy without overproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 A welcome retreat from misogyny in the lyrics and a more low-key image are the 
earmarks of a plausible, not-too-drastic permutation for the once crass and 
glittery outfit. At this crucial juncture in its career, the new and improved 
Crue has come through with some solid ballads and aggressive, chunky rock 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 This basic power metal is far from the music du jour, but if the band keeps 
making albums like this, it just might last another 10 years.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: POPULAR ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe we should find a new name for alternative rock. How alternative can it 
be if it's dominating the mainstream charts? The top three albums on The Times' 
Southern California pop chart--and parts of No. 4, the "Reality Bites" 
soundtrack--fall into this category. Shaquille O'Neal is crashing the pop chart 
the way he crashes the boards in the NBA: His rap single "I'm Outstanding" 
debuted at No. 17, and his album, "Shaq Diesel," has sold more than 500,000 
copies. Though Hammer's new "Funky Headhunter" isn't doing as well as expected 
on the pop chart, it's still No. 3 on the Southern California rap chart. TOP 10

 Only someone with a heart of granite would not be moved or angered on some 
level by HBO's ambitious, cameo-studded 1993 movie of the late Randy Shilts' 
chronicling of the government's public-health policy regarding the AIDS 
epidemic. Like the book, this newsreel-woven movie, written by Arnold Schulman 
and directed by Roger Spottiswoode, focuses on the band of pioneering anti-AIDS 
researchers and activists. There is a lot of material to draw together, and the 
complexities of Shilts' book would challenge almost any scenarist. U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control researcher Don Francis (Matthew Modine, center, with Ian 
McKellen and Lily Tomlin) and his underfunded colleagues slowly pull back the 
sheet, inch by inch, revealing the full cadaver (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.). Howard

 Almost sent directly to TV, this bleakly amusing and truly moving film by 
director Carl Franklin proved to be the sleeper of 1992.Dramatic and 
suspenseful, it charts a collision course involving three losers on the run. 
They include Billy Bob Thornton, who also wrote the script with Bob Epperson, 
Cynda Williams and Michael Beach. Jim Metzler and Earl Billings play two Los 
Angeles cops in pursuit and Bill Paxton (pictured) portrays a naive Arkansas 
sheriff. Be warned: The film opens with a blood bath that communicates the 
reality of violence without exploiting it (TMC Tuesday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 With this 1990 hit, independent filmmaker Henry Jaglom continues his intimate, 
spontaneous, but always compassionate observations of compulsively neurotic 
human behavior -- and reveals his ongoing fascination with women. In essence, 
"Eating" is "The Women" of the '90s: An attractive Hancock Park matron (Lisa 
Blake Richards, center) throws a 40th birthday party for herself and for a 
friend turning 30 (Mary Crosby, left) and one turning 50 (Marlena Giovi, 
right). The only woman among 38 not obsessed with food and dieting is played 
with radiance and wit by Frances Bergen, one of Hollywood's enduring beauties 
(and mother of Candice) (Lifetime Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

ALBUM REVIEW; *** MORRISSEY, "VAUXHALL AND I"; SIRE/REPRISE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Morrissey surfaced with the Smiths in the early '80s, his tales of 
alienation and crushed idealism made him an underdog hero for legions of 
sensitive and suppressed fans. On his fifth solo album, the Englishman still 
delivers ironic romanticism and subtle humor, but on more accessible terms than 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 After experimenting with rockabilly tunes on his last album, Morrissey returns 
to his original love for pretty pop ballads, catchy hooks and substantial 
melodies. His vocals gracefully climb from sad, defeated whispers to rich, 
hope-filled harmonies as he jokes about his own misery and analyzes why he's 
bashed by the fickle British music press. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's poetic, frank lyrics and cultured, despairing croons seem less 
inhibited than in his previous solo works. With its more fluid music, 
"Vauxhall" may prove compelling enough to reach beyond his cult-fan base, but 
it's not obvious enough to compete in the Whitney-ruled mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LORRAINE ALI

 *** Ted Hawkins, "The Next Hundred Years," DGC/Geffen. From the Venice 
boardwalk to this major-label debut, Hawkins brings a sweet soulfulness that at 
times recalls Sam Cooke.Producer Tony Berg rightfully keeps it simple, adding 
just the necessary touches to flesh out the folk-gospel (and occasionally 
country) undercurrents of the heartfelt, direct songs. Hawkins comes off as a 
charmingly unrefined natural, but his personal, spiritual writing and 
performance lack the kind of groundbreaking or revealed secrets to make him 
seem like more.

sold 15 million copies worldwide, this white pop rapper suffered career 
meltdown.Now he's back, still doing pop rap, but with tougher content to fit 
today's gangsta-ized climate. He's also whining about being victimized by media 
lies. As a rapper he's as lame as ever, still sounding like a preppie wannabe. 
And that new dread hairdo -- he's gotta be kidding.

 Can stratospheric high finance, which appears so tedious and complicated on 
paper, really be this much of a hoot? You can't imagine a more deliciously 
entertaining movie about the $25-billion leveraged buyout of R.J.R. Nabisco Co. 
The script by Larry Gelbart, based on a bestseller by Bryan Burrough and John 
Helyar, demonstrates that the former "MASH" head writer is as acutely clever 
and witty as ever. Former Nabisco president F. Ross Johnson (James Garner, 
pictured) delivers one-liners, double-entendres and sight gags in a 
wheeling-dealing Wall Street atmosphere polluted by greed, deception and 
tobacco smoke (HBO Saturday at 10:30 p.m.). Howard Rosenberg

 ON THE RACK: Don't think you've got a bootleg if you pick up a copy of 
Nirvana's "In Utero" at Kmart or Wal-Mart and find the song "Rape Me" retitled 
"Waif Me" on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores, which have long resisted what they consider offensive material, 
reportedly refused to carry the album unless Geffen Records' DGC label changed 
the song title.While that has been done, the song itself -- which is about 
media intrusions into privacy, not physical rape -- remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 But DGC did make some content changes on another of its albums, Beck's "Mellow 
Gold," electronically blurring some four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Smith, Geffen's head of marketing, says that the changes -- made only 
on copies of the albums destined for the stores that won't carry the original 
versions -- do nothing to alter the messages of the artists, and that the 
compromises are more than compensated for by the access to a wider audience. 
</P>

 These stores, referred to in the trade as rack jobbers , represent about 10% 
of the music retail business, and many of them are in rural areas that have no 
other music stores.

 "Both Beck and Nirvana as artists are dealing with the anguish of living in 
the world today, so the spelling of a word or the use of a word doesn't really 
change that," Smith says. "It's much more important to give kids access to 
these messages." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nirvana) wants the record in K mart," says Janet Billig of Gold Mountain 
Management, which handles both Beck and Nirvana. "That's the kind of store 
where they got records growing up. They didn't have cool record stores in 
Aberdeen, (Wash.)." Steve Hochman

 FREE FALLIN': What can a pop act do for an encore after it's played to adoring 
crowds at 55,000-seat Dodger Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer for most is not dropping down to the 1,200-capacity Palace or the 
850-capacity Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what happened to New Kids on the Block -- or as they now bill 
themselves, NKOTB. 
</P>
<P>
 Longevity is always a big concern when the average age of your fans is 12, but 
the drop-off for these Kids seems particularly dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Dodger Stadium show was part of one of the most remarkable tours any 
pop group has ever had. It grossed $74.1 million -- a figure believed by 
Pollstar magazine, which covers the concert business, to be exceeded only by 
the $98 million raked in by the Rolling Stones in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Palace and Ventura dates next month aren't isolated down spots for 
NKOTB. They're part of a monthlong tour of 1,000- to 2,000-seat venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of diminished interest were obvious last month with the release of the 
group's first studio album in four years. While two of the Kids' previous 
collections shot to No. 1, "Face the Music" entered the charts at a tepid No. 
37 and quickly plummeted from sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any hope for NKOTB at this point? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they make the right record, they can go from being uncool to cool in a 
matter of 30 days," says KPWR-FM program director Rick Cummings, whose Top 40 
station was a champion of the group. He blames much of their slide on what he 
feels is a weak new album. "The next record has to be better or they'll really 
be dead," he says. Dennis Hunt

 IN THE HEART OF TEXAS: For the past seven years, musicians, record executives 
and music journalists have headed for Austin, Tex., each spring to see the 
latest in new, cutting-edge rock acts at the annual "South by Southwest" music 
and media conference. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, it was some old names that got most of the attention from 
the 4,200 in attendance at the recent four-day convention: Johnny Cash, Lucinda 
Williams, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and the re-formed Sir Douglas Quintet.Cash pulled 
the biggest response with an unannounced show on a small, outdoor stage at the 
unassuming club Emo's. His stark acoustic guitar and dark, baritone 
storytelling proved that the Man in Black is a resurgent pop-music icon. His 
Rick Rubin-produced album is due late next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Respected country-folk singer Gilmore played a show at the City Coliseum tent 
and was notable for his jams with members of pioneer Seattle grunge group 
Mudhoney (they've recorded some of each other's songs) and folkie Michelle 
Shocked. Lorraine Ali

 AND ONE MORE THING: John Lydon (formerly Johnny Rotten) has written an 
autobiography and, as might be expected, the title alone should raise plenty of 
eyebrows: "Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs." Those groups, though, 
shouldn't take too much offense -- excerpts of the book, which is due in stores 
Friday, confirm the well-known fact that Lydon isn't really fond of too many 
people.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the targets are the late Sex Pistol Sid Vicious ("He was so embarrassing 
that I kept as far away from him as I could") and the band's manager, Malcolm 
McLaren ("poxy scum").

 A Smashing Pumpkins B-sides and rarities album is in the works, probably to be 
released in the fall following the group's expected gig on the "Lollapalooza 
'94" tour. The collection will include several songs that were released only in 
Europe, plus one of the band's first singles, originally released by Seattle's 
Sub Pop Records. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Part two of Depeche Mode's world tour is set to begin in May, with dates being 
planned late that month at both the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Ferry is working on a new album with Robin Trower co-producing. Unlike 
last year's "Taxi," a collection of suave versions of old pop and soul songs, 
this will be all original material. Trower also has completed his own album, 
"20th Century Blues," due from his own V12 label in May. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Both Spanish and English versions of a new Jon Secada album will be released 
simultaneously at the end of May. The singer's last album broke new ground for 
bilingual pop, scoring hits in both languages. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Having switched labels, Huey Lewis & the News are making their Elektra debut 
with an album of '50s and '60s R&B favorites. Among the songs the band recorded 
are "Some Kind of Wonderful," "Shake, Rattle and Roll," "Your Cash Ain't 
Nothin' but Trash" and "Little Bitty Pretty One." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Touted noise-rock duo Royal Trux has signed with Virgin Records after a stint 
on the independent Drag City label. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Great White, dropped by Capitol Records in last year's roster purge, is now on 
Zoo Records with a new album, "Sail Away," due May 10. The collection is said 
to be a more blues-rock approach from the pop-metal band and will be packaged 
with a free live greatest-hits CD. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rev. Horton Heat has recruited Ministry's Al Jourgensen to produce his next 
album, "Liquor in the Front." This joint release from Interscope and Sub Pop is 
the first major-label album for the wild-man rocker. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lloyd, formerly of Nashville country-rock duo Foster & Lloyd, has a rock 
album, "Set to Pop," due next month. His guests include Marshall Crenshaw, Jody 
Stephens of Big Star, Al Kooper and former E Streeter Garry Tallent. Lloyd is 
also in a new, yet-unnamed band with former Doobie Brother Pat Simmons, Poco 
co-founder Rusty Young and John Cowan, formerly of New Grass Revival. They'll 
be recording for Warner Nashville.

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE PHENOMENAL THINGS PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ANGELA 
GOETHALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angela Goethals' story reads like a show-business fable: Famous producer sees 
kid in small play and gives her a big break. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer James Brooks ("The Simpsons," "The Tracey Ullman Show," "Taxi," "The 
Mary Tyler Moore Show") first saw Goethals in the off-Broadway play "Coastal 
Disturbances." It was 1989 and she was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was extraordinary," Brooks says simply. "She was so convincing. Then we 
put her in sketches in 'The Tracey Ullman Show.' We were working at a breakneck 
pace, overwhelmed by work. And the only times that the show would slow down is 
when we would just stop and be in admiration of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Goethals' natural ability convinced the producer that she deserved her own 
show. "She can't act a false moment," Brooks says. 
</P>
<P>
 While he wanted to create a show for her, he wasn't quite sure how to frame 
it. Eventually, a friend gave him the idea of making her character, Angela 
Doolin, a tennis player who lives with her mother (Judith Light), her little 
sister (Ashley Johnson) and her bewildered older brother (Todd Louiso). Her 
tennis coach, the abrasive Lou Del Le Rosa, is played by former "Knot's 
Landing" star William Devane. Goethals, who hadn't even picked up a racket 
before the show, now takes tennis lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The fictional Angela Doolin is not unlike the real acting phenomenon. 'She's 
definitely a lot like me," Goethals, 16, says from her New York home. "She's 
doing something that she loves. For her, it's tennis, and for me, it's acting. 
She's good at it and continues a normal life with her family." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the show has evolved, the TV Angela has become less like the real one. 
Goethals has matured in a way her character hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago I would have said that we're exactly alike. But this 
experience has taught me a lot about responsibility and independence. I've had 
to be away from home, miss my friends, grow up more," says Goethals. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Phenom" star got her start in theater at 9. Her starring role in "The 
Good Times Are Killing Me" earned her an Obie Award and a Drama Desk 
nomination. The Times' Sylvie Drake singled Goethals out for her 1992 role in 
John Guare's "Crashing Symbols" at New York's Lincoln Center, calling her 
"terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-stars are equally adulatory. From a Toronto movie set, Judith Light, 
who plays Goethals' TV mom, says, "She is probably one of the most 
extraordinary actors I've ever worked with, and her age really has nothing to 
do with the quality of who she is and what she brings to the show. Personally, 
we have a wonderful relationship. If I could have a daughter, she would be the 
daughter I would want." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her theater and TV roles, Goethals' credits also extend to 
feature films, including "Rocket Gilbraltar," "Heartbreak Hotel," "Home Alone" 
and "V.I. Warshawski." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the praise she is getting, Goethal says: "Acting is very comfortable 
for me right now, but I don't know if I want it for my career." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks sees acting in her future: "I always see her future with her at 80 
doing Jessica Tandy-types of roles. She's really a gifted actress." 
</P>
<P>
 "Phenom" airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.

ON VIEW; CHALLENGING THE SYSTEM; PARENTING RIGHTS FOR A MENTALLY DISABLED 
MOTHER ARE AT STAKE IN 'YARN PRINCESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jean Smart is shooting a pivotal scene for her new ABC movie "The Yarn 
Princess" inside the stuffy Don Carlos Studios in downtown Los Angeles. Sitting 
in the witness stand on the crowded courtroom set, Smart cries her eyes out 
explaining to the judge that she's a good mother. The actress is so touching 
that the other actors and crew, oblivious to the lights and the camera, begin 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone yells, "Cut!" Smart dries her eyes and gets ready to shoot the scene 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yarn Princess" chronicles the true, four-hankie story of Margaret 
(Smart), a developmentally slow woman who still manages to marry and raise a 
family. When her husband Jake (Robert Pastorelli) is diagnosed as schizophrenic 
and can no longer work, Margaret goes to court to prove she is competent to 
retain custody of her six sons, ages 2 through 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a grand love story unlike any other love story," says Pastorelli of 
the movie whose title comes from a fairy tale that Margaret tells her children 
at bedtime. Pastrorelli's portrayal of factory worker Jake is 180 degrees 
removed from his sitcom role as the funky housepainter/nanny Eldin on "Murphy 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people who are normal and fall in love and have a family -- that can be 
hard enough," explains Pastorelli, relaxing between scenes in his trailer. 
"Maintaining love is hard enough in itself. But for these two people, the love 
is very special. It's a bond. Their souls are intertwined. They are soul mates. 
Then outside forces come in and start to pull them apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorelli says he and Smart clicked as soon as they met. "We are really 
close, especially as far as the work. We both work very much in the moment, not 
playing the scene, but letting the scene play us. It's like when two people 
just finish one another's thoughts. We just bonded like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Smart and director Tom McLoughlin visited various homes for people who are 
developmentally disabled. "I met a couple of women who were in this woman's 
position, who had lost their children and were trying to get them back," Smart 
says via phone, months after production is completed. Smart wouldn't do any 
on-set interviews during the arduous filming. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman Smart spent most of her time with didn't have a husband, but had 
seven children, who, at different stages, had been taken away from her by the 
state. "I spoke to her attorney who was doing whatever he could for her. Some 
people are not capable of taking care of their children. The thing is, it's not 
necessarily because their IQ falls below a line that has been drawn that is 
considered normal. It's for a variety of reasons, mostly poverty or inability 
to get work or keep work. God knows, we have seen evidence of people who have 
normal and more-than-normal intelligence who could never be parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorelli also spent a lot of time researching schizophrenia. "I thought it 
was sort of like split personalties," he acknowledges. "But it's not. It's a 
brain disease. Different things happen, and you have to be able to play that. I 
mean, can you imagine having people shouting at you? Voices in your head? 
People speaking to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The actor won't discuss why he thinks Jake would marry a woman with the 
mentality of a 13-year-old. "That gets real touchy," he says. "I was asking 
myself those questions and I came up with the answers, but I think the answers 
to that are possibly something that I really can't share." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smart will. "He's a nice working-class Joe. Here is a woman who, first of 
all, adores him. She will never leave him and she is very, very sweet and very, 
very trusting. You know he probably met a lot of women more jaded than her and 
it didn't appeal to him." 
</P>
<P>
 After Jake's illness, she says, Margaret "did need a little extra help, but 
she had the ability to learn and wanted to learn because the only thing she 
lived for was being a mother. She just wasn't prepared for all the details and 
responsibilities she was going to take on when he became ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Smart says that she never cried so much in one film, the emotional 
aspect of playing Margaret wasn't difficult. "It was finding a quality, a 
physical and vocal quality for her that I was happy with and the director was 
happy with," she says. "That terrified me because if people can't buy this 
right away, then it will be difficult to take them through this story." 
</P>
<P>
 Smart also worked hard to create a specific look for Margaret. "Sometimes when 
you look different than yourself, it helps you to keep the image of the 
character in your head," she says. So, she darkened her blond hair and wore 
outfits that "were things that she would have gotten at a thrift shop. Things 
that would appeal to her were things that she wore when she was little. And I 
had to wear ankle socks. It's comfortable to have socks on." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yarn Princess" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC.

PROFILE; ELLEN & FRIENDS; DEGENERES' STAND-UP PERSONA TAKES ON A NEW LIFE OF 
ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Ellen DeGeneres has been deliberately keeping a low profile while in 
production on her new sitcom "These Friends of Mine," which premieres Tuesday 
on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't want to saturate the media market. "Even if I like somebody, if I 
read too much about them, or see too much about them, I'm sick of hearing about 
them," explains DeGeneres, who was named best female stand-up comedian at the 
1991 American Comedy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres realizes, though, some of her fans don't know what's happened to 
her. "People in the business know I have something going on," says DeGeneres, 
sitting on the sofa at her publicist's Beverly Hills office on an overcast 
afternoon. "But to those people who don't know what's going on, it's like, 'We 
haven't seen Ellen on TV for a year, maybe she is not doing well. Maybe 
something is wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Taping a series that TV audiences have not yet seen has been challenging for 
DeGeneres. "It's shooting in a vacuum," she says. "You have these (studio) 
audiences who are bused in -- whomever we can get, whomever is on the street at 
the time. It's hard to get an audience when they don't know what the show is 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends of Mine" follows the life and adventures of Ellen Morgan 
(DeGeneres), who manages a popular bookstore-cafe in San Francisco. Her good 
friends are the flighty Holly (Holly Fulger of "Anything but Love") and her 
platonic roommate Adam (Arye Gross). Neal Marlens and Carol Black of "Growing 
Pains" and "The Wonder Years" are the creators and co-executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before "These Friends of Mine," DeGeneres had supporting roles on two TV 
series. She played the wacky receptionist Margo in the 1990 Fox series "Open 
House" and nurse Nancy McIntire on Black and Marlens' short-lived 1992 ABC 
series "Laurie Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the pilot of 'Laurie Hill' I had maybe two lines," says DeGeneres, 
who has been described by critics as "the spiritual daughter of Bob Newhart ... 
a distaff George Carlin and a female Jerry Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real frustrating," she says. "It was a show that I took because it was 
Black and Marlens. They are so powerful. I thought maybe they would see 
something in me and start writing for me, but the show was about Dr. Laurie 
Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Black and Marlens did write an episode that revolved around 
DeGeneres' Nancy. ABC, though, axed the series before it aired. After the 
cancellation, Black and Marlens gave DeGeneres an offer she couldn't refuse: A 
sitcom created for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To create a show for me is a huge compliment," DeGeneres, 35, says with a 
smile. "It's an opportunity for me to succeed." And also one to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "But wherever there's an opportunity, there's going to be risk involved," she 
explains. "I'm taking a big chance and a lot is resting on me. But it's not 
like it's just me on stage. There are a lot of other actors who are involved. 
There are producers involved. There are networks and studios. There are so many 
people making decisions. It isn't all on my shoulders. The good thing about 
what I do is that I have my stand-up to go back to." 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres feels comfortable playing Ellen because she's so close to her own 
life. "I'm not married. I don't have kids. This is something that is going to 
be a weekly thing, so I wanted to play something that was really close to what 
I created for 12 years as a stand-up." 
</P>
<P>
 That creation, she says, is someone who goes through life and tries to fit in 
because it's easier to fit in. "But at the same time, I don't care if I fit in 
or not. If I want to make a joke at something and the person behind the counter 
at Bullock's doesn't understand my joke, I look like an idiot. But it's 
something I choose to do. A lot of people don't get my humor. I am pretty dry 
and I don't make a face after doing (a joke)." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in New Orleans, DeGeneres had no idea she would become a comedian. 
Her idols were naturalists Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall. "I was obsessed with 
animals and I really thought I'd join the Peace Corps or go to Africa and study 
apes. Then I started getting older and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was 
funny, but I never thought it was a career option. It just fell into my lap." 
</P>
<P>
 Her life and career changed when a friend asked her to perform at a benefit. 
"I couldn't think of anything funny," she explains. "So I went on stage and 
said, 'I am so excited to be here and I have to tell you the funniest thing 
happened to me today, but I am starving and if I don't eat I am going to pass 
out.' " DeGeneres proceeded to eat a Whopper, fries and a shake. "When I 
finished everything, I realized my time was up and I had to go. I never said 
anything. It was a huge chance." 
</P>
<P>
 But it paid off. After her performance, DeGeneres was approached about 
performing at a coffeehouse at the University of New Orleans. "I just wrote 
really outrageous stuff, kind of Steve Martin, and then I mixed it in with 
Woody Allen and Bob Newhart. I was very confused, because half it was Gallagher 
and half of it was Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends of Mine" premieres Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. on ABC; it moves to its 
regular time slot Wednesday at 9:30 p.m.

RETRO; FAMILY CHANNEL'S PILGRIMAGE; CABLE NETWORK AIRS THE '77 MINISERIES 
'JESUS OF NAZARETH' FOR EASTER WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In observance of Easter Week, the Family Channel repeats the acclaimed 1977 
miniseries "Jesus of Nazareth." The six-hour, 37-minute epic on the life of 
Jesus was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, best known to moviegoers for his 
popular adaptations of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1967 and 
"Romeo and Juliet" in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot on location in the Holy Land, "Jesus of Nazareth" was an enormous success 
when NBC originally aired it on Palm Sunday and Easter. The film, which was 
made for approximately $18 million, drew a 50 share both nights and had a 
cumulative audience of 90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Literate and inspiring, the miniseries was written by Anthony Burgess, Suso 
Cecchi D'Amico and Zeffirelli. Much of the success of the drama also was due to 
the sensitive, mesmerizing performance of British actor Robert Powell in the 
title role. Before "Jesus," Powell had been featured in Ken Russell's 
outrageous movies "Tommy" and "Mahler." 
</P>
<P>
 The huge supporting cast featured Olivia Hussey as the Virgin Mary, Peter 
Ustinov as Herod, Michael York as John the Baptist and James Farentino as Simon 
Peter. Also featured in smaller parts were Claudia Cardinale, Anthony Quinn, 
James Earl Jones, Donald Pleasence, Laurence Olivier, James Mason, Christopher 
Plummer, Rod Steiger and Ernest Borgnine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus of Nazareth" stirred up controversy even before it aired. In 1974, 
General Motors bought the U.S. rights to air the Italian and British 
co-production for about $3 million. Before the miniseries premiere, however, GM 
withdrew its sponsorship after a campaign by evangelical religious groups 
objecting to Christ's being portrayed on screen as an ordinary human being. 
None of the protesters, though, had ever seen the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Procter & Gamble purchased sponsorship for the premiere showing, 
though GM retained the rights for subsequent airings on NBC. By the time it 
premiered, the film had been screened to religious leaders of many faiths who 
endorsed and praised the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus of Nazareth" airs Monday-Thursday at 8 p.m. on the Family Channel.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: USUAL MENUS, UNUSUAL VENUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the usual office building restaurant, sometimes a brightly lit 
bad-sandwich place, just as often a thinly disguised bar: If you're lucky, you 
might get a good Bloody Mary with your guacamole burger. Recently, the owners 
of Chopstix and the Locanda Veneta team of Jean-Louis de Mori and Antonio 
Tomassi (yes, them again) have separately opened new restaurants tucked away in 
odd corners of steel-and-glass behemoths -- Canyon in Studio City and Il Moro 
in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, as of last week still using the menu devised by quickly departed La 
Veranda chef David Slay (see Restaurant News), mines the basic 
pizza-pasta/American grill lode.Slay's signature toasted ravioli is 
cocktail-party snacking. The pork loin comes with a mountain of mashed potatoes 
capped by a caramelized onion sauce. Dessert can be a pure American 
biscuit-topped fruit cobbler. 
</P>
<P>
 When you try to find Il Moro -- so far, the better of the two places -- you 
might accidentally stumble into a glass-walled gym instead. (The art-strewn 
fitness center looks almost as much like a restaurant as the restaurant 
itself.) Once past Il Moro's deli cases and long-hall entryway, however, you 
find yourself in a modern cafe. The menu, sort of a Locanda/Ca' Brea greatest 
hits thing, has lots of salads, light Venetian-style appetizers, thin-crusted 
pizza, good house-made pasta. There's an excellent version of tagliata -- rare, 
sliced steak arranged around a heap of arugula with shavings of Parmesan. For 
dessert, check out the crema di vaniglia , vanilla cream, which is like cre me 
bru le e without the annoying burnt-sugar crust. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyon, 12001 Ventura Place, Studio City, (818) 508-1177. Pizza, pasta and 
entrees $7.95 - $14.95.  
</P>
<P>
 * Il Moro, 11400 W. Olympic Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 575-3530. Pizza, 
pasta and entrees $6.50 - $12.95. LAURIE OCHOA

RESTAURANT NEWS: YOU'LL NEVER EAT LUNCH IN THIS CITY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Restaurant has been sold. No closing date has been set, but co-owners 
Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger estimate that City will stay open at least 
another 6 weeks. New owner Ron Salisbury plans to relocate his 
Southwestern-style Sonora Cafe to the La Brea Avenue address. 
</P>
<P>
 After unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a new lease a few months ago with his 
downtown landlord, Salisbury began scouting for a new place. "(City) is a great 
location and the building is simple and clean," he says. "There's not a lot of 
decor to tear out." 
</P>
<P>
 Milliken and Feniger first opened City Cafe 11 years ago in a tiny storefront 
on Melrose. Despite the fact that the place only seated 35 at a counter, the 
restaurant developed a cult-like following. Soon the chefs outgrew the 
postage-stamp-sized kitchen, renamed the restaurant Border Grill and opened 
City on La Brea. While City Cafe was cozy and intimate, City Restaurant was 
super-modern and huge. What came out of the kitchen was an expanded version of 
the eclectic blend the chefs perfected at the cafe: spicy Indian chicken, Thai 
melon salad, Portuguese mussel-and-cockle stew.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the last few years have been difficult for Los Angeles 
restaurants and City is no exception. "I wish I could say we are going to be 
around for 25 years," says Feniger, "but that just wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Feniger and Milliken plan to put a lot of energy into their remaining 
restaurant, Border Grill 2 in Santa Monica. "It's good and strong and current," 
says Feniger.  
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out beautifully," says Salisbury, who also owns El Cholo and two 
other Los Angeles-area restaurants. "We are moving among friends, and I can 
walk to work for the first time in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 SHORT-ORDER CHEF: Last month Santo Pietro restaurant closed for six days and 
reopened as Canyon with a new look and a new menu by David Slay, chef/owner of 
La Veranda in Beverly Hills. A week later, the consulting chef walked out of 
the Studio City restaurant, across from CBS Studio Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "The original plan was to break away completely from Santo Pietro and that's 
what I went there to do," says Slay. "Then the two partners and a wife got 
involved. . . . It was pointless." 
</P>
<P>
 "David is used to working in his own restaurant in his own little world," says 
Canyon co-owner Steven Sukman. "We tend to approach decision making from a 
teamwork perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Slay, Sukman and his partner Frank Monteleone couldn't make up 
their minds what they wanted to be. "They were trying to be accommodating to 
the studio grips who wear muscleman T-shirts and drink beer out of a bottle and 
to my La Veranda customers. The two clienteles are not a good mix." 
</P>
<P>
 "We service the studio in its entirety," responds Sukman, "from executives in 
suits to guys who may sit at the bar. The fact remains that David created the 
entire menu -- except for one chicken sandwich -- and trained the staff. That's 
what he was hired to do." 
</P>
<P>
 CARD TRICKS: When Visa struck a deal with Wolfgang Puck to stop accepting the 
American Express card at his Spago and Granita restaurants, American Express 
took out full-page ads in Los Angeles and San Francisco in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to get you not to leave home without it, American Express is paying its 
most frequent restaurant-goers a one-time $25 reward if they use the card in a 
local restaurant. "As you know, there are many fine restaurants in your area 
that warmly welcome the Card," writes American Express President Thomas O. 
Ryder in a letter to selected cardholders. "The next time you dine at one . . . 
I invite you to send me your American Express receipt and I'll see that you 
receive a $25 American Express Gift Cheque." 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter is not something punitive against Wolfgang Puck," says American 
Express spokesman Marcos Rada. "It's to reward our card members for their 
loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Rada refuse to say how many letters were sent out. "We are pretty tight-lipped 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAST SUPPERS: Trattoria Angeli hosts its final Passover dinner Monday and 
Tuesday. The prix - fixe dinner at $28 a head includes charoset, braised 
artichokes, beef and leek croquettes or white fish, egg-drop soup with Passover 
pasta, lamb with vegetables, green salad, and macaroons for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, on April 8 and 9, it's an all-you-can-eat B.Y.O.B. buffet for $20 per 
person at the West L.A. restaurant. "It will be like coming to a party," says 
chef/owner Evan Kleiman. "All our regulars can come and say goodby and we can 
encourage them to come to our other places." It's business as usual at Angeli 
Caffe and Angeli Mare.

GANG STAGE FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We applaud Tim Robbins and his ambitious Actors' Gang. But after reading about 
the opening attraction, we worry if it isn't as pretentious as the 
strategically torn jeans he wears in the accompanying photo ("A Gang of His 
Own," by Barbara Isenberg, March 13). 
</P>
<P>
 How wonderful if this talented group were to perform classical theater -- a 
treat rarely available to L.A. audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, however, to rethink the classic plays with such "amusing" 
anachronisms as Electra receiving astrological advice by phone sounds exactly 
like the sort of precious "genius thinking" found in Hollywood development 
meetings. Do the classics need such adornments? If so adorned, are they 
classics anymore or simply dressed-up skits from "Saturday Night Live"? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a classical Greek play without all the "improvements"? It's 
ultimately a braver move.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Is It Theater? Is It Radio? Does It Matter?" by Sean Mitchell 
(March 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Mitchell is unaware of yet another radio drama production -- second 
and fourth Sundays every month at 2:30 p.m. on KCSN-FM (88.5).As one of the 
founders (and announcer and sometimes actor) of "30 Minutes to Curtain," I'm 
proud to say we have been doing new radio with very talented actors, writers 
and directors since August, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "30 Minutes" has produced such classics as "Oedipus," Norman Corwin's "Plot to 
Overthrow Christmas," Steve Allen's "Meeting of Minds," a new "Sherlock Holmes" 
series and more, including new romance, science fiction, Western and mystery 
stories -- all done on a volunteer, no-grant basis. 
</P>
<P>
 As host-producer of "The Old-Time Radio Show," I'm also very interested in the 
future of new-time radio, and very honored to be a part of "30 Minutes to 
Curtain."

VEDDY VEDDY BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his March 6 profile "Hugh Grant Is Veddy Veddy Busy," Chris Willman states 
that "Four Weddings and a Funeral" offers the talented actor "his first . . . 
film that has any likelihood of breaking out beyond the art-house circuit." 
It's worth noting that Grant previously starred in a film that made its mark on 
a mainstream audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Grant joined Julie Andrews, Ann-Margret, Tony Roberts and Zeljko 
Ivanek in Robert Greenwald Productions' groundbreaking AIDS television movie 
"Our Sons." In it, Grant and Ivanek play a couple facing the final stages of 
the disease whose mothers are drawn together as they confront the illness and 
their children's lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Having received critical praise (including mentions about U.S. television 
newcomer Grant) and solid ratings for its May, 1991, premiere, "Our Sons" ranks 
among the prestigious -- and, regrettably, short -- list of powerful dramas 
about this tragedy.

WAYNE'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hope Rodney Grant is a better actor than he is a film historian. His 
comments regarding John Wayne and how he treated the Indians in the films he 
made in Durango, Mexico, are completely baseless (Film Clips, Feb. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Grant says that the reason John Wayne made his films in Durango was apparently 
so that he could treat the Indians badly. Get the facts straight, pal. John 
Wayne made fewer than 10 pictures in Durango. Of those films, only four 
featured any character that was an Indian, and, with one exception, they were 
not shot by Wayne! 
</P>
<P>
 I submit the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hondo" (1953): Wayne's character respected the Apaches and had an Indian 
wife. While he was forced to do battle with them, Vittoro, the Apache leader, 
respected him. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Chisum" (1970): When an Army officer speaks roughly to an Indian chief, who 
is a friend of Wayne's, he threatens the officer with bodily harm if he 
continues to mistreat the Indian chief. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Big Jake" (1971): When Wayne sets out to find his kidnaped grandson, he is 
accompanied by his old friend Sam Sharpnose, an Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cahill, U.S. Marshal" (1973): Wayne again relies on the help of a friend 
named Lightfoot, an Indian.

'PROXY' VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "They Never Come in From the Cold" (Film Comment, March 13): 
</P>
<P>
 I took Peter Rainer's brutal attack on the films of Joel and Ethan Coen more 
than personally. I was outright disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a great admirer of their work, naturally, I have to disagree with Rainer on 
his ridiculous psychobabble analysis of their films to date (he neglected to 
include the slapstick comedy "Crimewave," which the Coens wrote for director 
Sam Raimi and even featured a Hudsucker State Penitentiary in it). 
</P>
<P>
 True, their films are as perfectly crafted as a Swiss watch, but that is no 
reason to condemn them to a "cynical android's paradise," to rework Rainer's 
harsh words. Much as in the films of Stanley Kubrick, beneath that cold, 
precise surface lies a wonderful sense of humor and horror. It had been quite 
some time since I laughed as hard as I did when I saw "The Hudsucker Proxy." In 
fact, I've already seen it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer might want to try his hand at actually making a film even a fraction as 
good as a Coen brothers production. Perhaps he can upgrade the audience 
response to those Los Angeles Times theatrical spots from the usual chorus of 
boos and hisses to an apathetic yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES DE LAUZIRIKA 
</P>
<P>
 Altadena 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Rainer, do you know the definition of the word dramatist ? 
</P>
<P>
 Before you answer, please also consider this secondary but no less important 
question: Have you read the book "The Art of Dramatic Writing," by Lajos Egri? 
</P>
<P>
 If you could say yes to either or both of these, you would probably be lauding 
the Coens for their unique ability to juxtapose metaphorical characters and 
situations while creating profound conflict leading to a resolution that 
illuminates belief. 
</P>
<P>
 Your petty carping about the emotional void at the center of their work 
strikes me as uninformed and irrelevant. As artists, the Coens choose to 
dramatize our societal weaknesses in order to correct them. I believe they do 
so in a brilliant and original fashion. Watch Aaron Spelling if you want to 
feel fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, do your readers and yourself a favor: Read Egri, watch "Miller's 
Crossing" (a film displaced in the theaters by the heady "Home Alone") one more 
time, and let me know if the Coens have hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a hint: They may be busted up into little pieces, but they are there. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID LOOMSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Though I agree with the content if not the virulent tone of Rainer's article 
on the interesting but obtuse Coen brothers, I point out to him that corpses 
cannot be buried alive.

RIORDAN LOOKS A SPENDTHRIFT BY NOT KEEPING THRIFTY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I cannot begin to express my disappointment in Mayor Riordan relative to the 
announcement that Thrifty Drug Stores intends to move its corporate offices out 
of Los Angeles and up to Wilsonville, Ore. ("Thrifty Likely to Move From L.A. 
to Oregon, Riordan Says," March 18), following the merger of Payless and 
Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when rumor had it that Thrifty was going to move to Orange County? 
Wasn't that Mayor Riordan, arm in arm with Thrifty executives, proudly 
announcing that Thrifty was dedicated to the city of Los Angeles and would not 
be moving their headquarters from Los Angeles to Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't that Mayor Riordan at the press conference -- the very public press 
conference -- when, shortly after the Los Angeles riots, Thrifty announced 
their commitment to the city of Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all such ancient history that the Mayor now meekly accepts the 
decision of Leonard Green to move the headquarters to Oregon?  
</P>

 How would the city replace an employer who provides approximately 800 jobs at 
one location? How would the city replace a business that represents a payroll 
of $40 million? How would the city replace the tax revenue Thrifty provides our 
great city? 
</P>
<P>
 I might recommend that it would be far less expensive to find out what it 
would take to keep Thrifty in Los Angeles now, and negotiate toward that end, 
than to wait and try to replace everything that Thrifty represents to Los 
Angeles later.

 Dear Mayor Riordan, 
</P>
<P>
 Re: Thrifty Drug moving to Oregon, can the city afford to lose a chain drug 
store who's very birth was in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Your comment "unfortunately, this is the way that the corporate world goes" 
does not sound like a passionate mayoral candidate who promised to create and 
keep jobs in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, Your Honor. Get the creative sales techniques in gear. Convince 
Leonard Green to keep jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 While you're at it, can you check the pulse of the City Council? Get them 
involved! 
</P>
<P>
 How about you Gov. Wilson? It's a campaign year. Talk to Mr. Green, make him a 
deal.

COMPUTER LITERACY AS OFFICE LEVELER

<TEXT>
<P>
 About the top chief executives who are computer illiterate ("Top Execs Visit a 
World That's Alien to Them," March 11), maybe they have a case of "mental 
block" about using computers, since they are glorified typewriters -- relegated 
to secretaries. 
</P>

 What a great leveler!

HMO IS CHEAPER WITHOUT MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your article "The Graying of HMOs" (Feb. 27), I couldn't help but think 
there was something wrong.The article states that "the government ... spends an 
average of $400 a month for each Medicare patient enrolled in an HMO." 
</P>
<P>
 In my rather casual survey of HMO prices, I found two HMOs in Southern 
California that would have enrolled me (age 70) as an individual member for 
under $200 a month. I cannot figure out why it costs the government twice as 
much as it would if I subscribed individually. Can you?

ROBIN ABCARIAN: CAN BEING OBNOXIOUS SAVE LIVES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No great surprise, I suppose, that my interests coincide with my gender. I 
write about children because I am a mother; I write about sexual harassment 
because I am a woman. But some subjects of inordinate interest to women leave 
me cold. I feel I should pursue them but shy away. Denial, maybe? 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer is one of those. 
</P>
<P>
 I confess: Sitting around with a group of women on a brilliant weekday 
afternoon talking about this disease, the second-leading cause of death among 
American women, was not my idea of a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a panel discussion at Santa Monica College, actually, and coincided 
with the opening of a campus art show called "One in Eight: Women & Breast 
Cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The big draw was UCLA's Dr. Susan Love, who has become to breast cancer what 
Loyola law professor Laurie evinson has become to high-profile criminal trials: 
a bona fide media star. 
</P>
<P>
 (After stories broke about the Montreal doctor who falsified data in a 
lumpectomy study, Love says she was paged more often by ABC, NBC and CBS than 
by her patients.) 
</P>
<P>
 When this woman talks, people listen. She is a renowned surgeon and author of 
a popular book on breast cancer. She is a co-founder of the National Breast 
Cancer Coalition, which has screamed and yelled its way to huge increases in 
funding for breast cancer research. She is the founding director of the UCLA 
Breast Center. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the infectious passion of a woman like Love will do more for this 
disease than 10 movies of the week. (Although her story would certainly make a 
good one. Producers?) 
</P>
<P>
 Panelist P.J. Viviansales, 44, whose bare brown skull was wrapped like a gift 
in a brilliant headband, is undergoing treatment for a second bout with breast 
cancer. Viviansales founded the Women of Color Breast Cancer Survivors Project. 
Just that morning, she said, she had received a phone call from a woman in need 
of advice: 
</P>
<P>
 "She has long hair. She called me up and said, 'I have been putting off 
chemotherapy and radiation because I was told that my hair would fall out.' And 
she had her lumpectomy two years ago. Two years ago! No treatment! Did she get 
a bone scan? Did she get a liver scan? Did she do any of those things? We are 
not being told that these processes need to be done. It is up to us to make 
women -- especially African American women -- aware. Every day we hear serious 
horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Viviansales' goal -- and that of every woman on the panel -- is to bring an 
end to the horror stories by bringing an end to breast cancer. But until breast 
cancer is eradicated, until a cure is found, a prevention discovered, the only 
way to combat the horror is through empowerment -- that deliciously freighted 
expression that conveys education, resources, support and, in the case of these 
women, a whole lot of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some things about breast cancer you should know: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mammography is an excellent diagnostic tool for women over 50. For women 
under 50, who have denser breast tissue, it is unreliable. Seventy percent of 
women under 50 have mammograms; only 30% of women over 50 have them. That is 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in not recommending mammograms to women under 50 is not that we 
don't think women under 50 get breast cancer; they do," Love said  
</P>
<P>
 "And women under 40 and women under 30 get it, too. The question is whether 
mammography is a good tool for finding it and whether the (radiation) risks of 
mammogram outweigh the benefits. . . . We are not saying, 'Oh, younger women 
should just die of breast cancer and we'll focus on older women.' It's just 
that this isn't necessarily the right tool to do it. So women say to me, 'Well, 
what do you recommend for women younger than 50?' And the only answer I have 
is: political action." 
</P>
<P>
 * The recent news about falsified data in the lumpectomy study has not changed 
the outcome of that study (which has been supported by others). Lumpectomy is 
an effective treatment for women in early stages of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tamoxifen, an estrogen blocker used to treat breast cancer, causes uterine 
cancer. But, Love said, it is not clear that the amount of uterine cancer it 
does cause is high enough to counteract the good it does in fighting breast 
cancer. A large study now under way should answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
 * We cannot have our cake and eat it too, Love said. If we want answers on 
women's health issues, we need studies; if we want studies, we need to 
volunteer for them.  
</P>
<P>
 (If your doctor cannot tell you what cancer studies you are eligible for, call 
(800) 4-CANCER.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Screaming and yelling works. "So I invite you to join me in becoming 
obnoxious," Love said, "so obnoxious that they solve this problem just to shut 
us up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollis Sigler, a painter, was the last panelist. In 1985, at 37, she was found 
to have breast cancer. She felt a lump under her arm; a mammogram confirmed the 
presence of cancer. In 1990, she had a recurrence, and in 1992, discovered that 
the cancer had spread to her spine. At that point, she began a series of 
paintings about the disease, some of which are included in the Santa Monica 
College show. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fanciful paintings have such titles as: "What Does a Lady Do With Her 
Rage?" And "Maybe It Was Something I Ate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sigler was moved, she said, by poet Audre Lorde's vision of "an army of 
one-breasted women" and her hope that, "if the world could see all these women, 
they would know there are just so many of us out there and that something would 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we begin by getting obnoxious?

THE BUZZ: BLOWING SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people watch the Academy Awards and post-awards parties to see what the 
stars wear, hear what they say and watch who they show up with. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's another tidbit to look out for: which stars smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The air at Morton's, the site of the Vanity Fair/Steve Tisch party, was a hazy 
gray by midnight as guests puffed away, unencumbered by no-smoking laws. This 
was a private party and cigarettes were not verboten in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 So who belongs to the smoking club? We spotted Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, 
Ellen Barkin, Jeremy Irons, Nicole Kidman and Anjelica Huston. But not everyone 
seemed to exhibit unhealthy habits. REM's Michael Stipe ordered a vegetarian 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the Time: Actors anxious to become stars now have a guide that takes 
the planets into consideration. The Astro Caster, "The Actor's Edge for Getting 
the Job," is an 88-page listing of local casting directors based on their 
astrological signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become such an aggressive business," says author Taaffe O'Connell, a 
Taurus with Gemini rising and a Leo moon, "if you know something about a 
casting director, you feel more comfortable going into a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides giving the casting directors' signs, the Astro Caster lists TV shows 
with the name and sign of whoever casts it. As an example, "Days of Our Lives" 
is done by a Scorpio, while the actors in "Star Trek: The Next Generation" are 
picked by a Gemini. No mention is made of what sign's shows get better ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlet also offers advice on the overall astrological feel of a studio's 
casting department. As an example, Paramount has "lots of creativity, grounded 
in support and balance." And Universal Television is "innovative, but 
organized. Caring, but pragmatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming soon from O'Connell is the Astro Executive featuring the astrological 
signs of studio execs. Presumably this would include who's in conjunction, 
rising and what projects are about to go into retrograde. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Bites: In a world of sound bites, these are bits of true-life dialogue 
that came our way:  
</P>
<P>
 * A woman speaking about a friend at a fashion designer's cocktail party: "She 
flunked out of dominatrix school. It was devastating. Everyone thought she'd be 
a natural." 
</P>
<P>
 * A cable television entertainer talking about her trip to Las Vegas where a 
UFO convention was taking place: "I arrived on abductee day. It was fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 * A publicist at last week's Hollywood-political party at Spago for Dee Dee 
Myers, Diane and Paul Begala, James Carville and Mary Matalin: "The Republicans 
having Al D'Amato as their ethics cop is like making Bill Clinton the spokesman 
for Lean Cuisine."

UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON: CANTER'S STRIKES RIGHT NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canter's has always been an up-all-night spot, the place to end a party in the 
gentle company of waitresses who call you "dearie" and matzo balls the size of 
grapefruit. It's a family place, where three or four Canters are on duty at any 
of the 24 hours it's open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the bar -- the Kibitz Room -- has become a thriving 
music venue thanks to a waiter's inspiration. "About six years ago, one of our 
waiters, Eric Gold, asked if his jazz band could play in the Kibitz Room on 
Monday nights," says Marc Canter, whose grandparents founded the delicatessen. 
"We said sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gold has been waiting tables at Canter's for 10 years. He is an unassuming 
fellow -- the name tag on his brown apron says, "Yo, Waiter!" The original plan 
was modest. "When we started, the idea was to come off Monday Night Football 
and hold the bar crowd," Gold says. "It didn't turn out quite like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of local musicians came in to listen, hang out, and drink $1.30 beers," 
Canter says. "It was a 22-, 23-year-old crowd, a lot of people who grew up in 
the neighborhood, like Rami Jaffee and Jakob Dylan of the Wallflowers. Some of 
them asked if they could come in on a Tuesday to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first Tuesday night, a hundred people showed up. There were no fights 
and everyone had a good time. The crowd was the kind of guys who wear chains on 
their wallets -- biker types, but mellow. Anthony Keidis of the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers came and Lenny Kravitz." The Tuesday Jam Session now takes over the bar 
and adjacent dining room, with 300 to 400 people in attendance. Joe Simon, 
Tuesday night's music director, says: "I invite people I like, from street 
musicians to Slash from Guns N' Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd is welcome here. "A third of the people who come don't spend a dime. 
We don't care, because they make the scene what it is," Canter says. Now there 
is something going on in the Kibitz every night of the week. Wednesday through 
Sunday may be the nights when the mood best approaches that of the good old 
days the neighborhood boys remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a living-room atmosphere," Canter says. "Every night turns into a jam 
session by 1 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabaret singer Tina Stevens presides on Wednesdays with jazz and pop tunes. 
Keyboard musician Joe Simon is "trying to establish a beachhead for jazz, acid 
jazz, blues, all that" on Fridays, Canter says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to play with a band," Simon says. "That idea of 'this is the 
drummer, this is the singer' -- let those old structures go. When five people 
get together and throw what they've got into the pot and something new comes 
out -- that's the future of music, and we have to move on into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon laughs. "Listen to me. And here I am playing be-bop. But 'round about 
midnight, I mutate like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 'Round about 11:30, Simon and assembled company are midway through a Herbie 
Hancock number when Eric Gold comes in from the dining room and dashes off a 
few Schoenberg-inspired 12-tone riffs on the tenor sax before hurrying back to 
deliver platters of brisket and gefilte fish to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will last forever," Marc Canter says, "because nothing ever changes 
here. Look around -- it's Canter's. Something new may go up, but nothing old 
ever comes down." 
</P>

SLOW BOAT THROUGH CHINA; CRUISING UPSTREAM IN THE THREE GORGES REGION OF THE 
FABLED YANGTZE RIVER, PAST MISTY SCENERY THAT MAY BE DOOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this river ran past nothing but 3,900 miles of low, lumpy hills and muddy 
banks, it would still be an unsurpassed wonder. It stretches farther than any 
others but the Nile and the Amazon, and lies so wide in some stretches that 
Marco Polo lost credibility when he reported to the Europeans that a man could 
stand on one shore and not see the opposing bank. On or near the Yangtze's 
edges, more than 350 million people reside -- a third of China's population 
and, roughly, one in every 15 human beings on the planet. The river's tortured, 
silt-brown path is strewn with sampans, barges and ferries carrying coal, 
fruit, rocks, cows and people in very nearly unthinkable volumes. It's the 
world's longest Main Street. In the slow lanes, amid litter, swim rare 
dolphins. On the shoulders perch ancient pagodas. At one end lies the East 
China Sea; at the other, Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Yangtze's banks do not stay low and lumpy for long. Follow the river 
upstream from its wide, commerce-choked mouth near Shanghai, and it rises from 
broad plains to terraced hills dotted with straw-hatted peasants whose farms 
tilt at what seem like 45-degree angles. Then come dense, grimy towns and a 
rusting, overloaded ferry. The sound of chisels breaking rock on shore rings 
across the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the Yangtze's middle reaches, a mist descends. When it thins, the 
river has evolved again and the brown currents now mediate a staring match 
between stone-faced canyon walls. A thousand feet high. Two thousand, with 
ancient inscriptions etched in the rock and 2,000-year-old coffins wedged into 
caves 1,000 feet up. Throughout a 125-mile stretch known as Three Gorges, the 
Yangtze gathers gaping Westerners in ant-like congregations on the Astroturf 
decks of their cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, however, is where the trouble starts. Over the next two decades, if 
China's leaders have their way, a 600-foot-high dam will rise amid the Three 
Gorges. The river's currents, newly harnessed, are to generate more 
hydro-electric power than any dam in history, reducing the dependence on 
inefficient coal-burning that has cursed much of China with abysmal air 
quality. For more than 350 miles above the dam, water levels will rise as much 
as 300 feet, forcing an estimated 1.2 million villagers to relocate, putting 
countless ancient villages and landmarks under water. 
</P>
<P>
 These plans have set off a round of international debate over environmental 
risk, energy policy and the right of industrialized nations such as the United 
States to meddle in China's affairs. The pleasant irony here for Chinese 
tourism officials is that while those arguments resound and the earthmovers 
begin their scraping, a trickle of Western tourism on the Yangtze is growing 
into something like a torrent: Show us thirsty Americans a jeopardized natural 
wonder and a deadline, and we'll come running. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, the story goes, there was one fancy cruise ship here, and 
Chairman Mao Tse Tungwas its only customer. By last year, 19 cruise ships were 
catering to international travelers, most of the ships operating from early 
spring to late fall, carrying passengers on journeys of three to five days 
through the Three Gorges between Wuhan and Chongqing. This year, Chinese 
officials say, there are 35. By most accounts, the conditions aboard even the 
most luxurious of these cruise vessels are suited more to adventurers than 
comfort-seekers. But the dam deadline seems to have done more for tourism than 
any ad campaign could have, and these days the Yangtze stands alongside 
Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Guilin as among the top stops on Chinese 
itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
 I booked onto one of the last departures of the fall 1993 season, a four-night 
October excursion that would run westward against the river's current. 
(Downstream voyages usually take a day less and cost a bit more.) I flew to 
Tokyo, then to Hong Kong, and then to the industrial city of Wuhan, about 700 
miles upriver from Shanghai, where my prearranged guide never materialized and 
I spent my first two hours staring through a taxi window at the back end of a 
blue dump truck. For miles we crawled past gray, huddled buildings and gray, 
huddled people. That night in the bar of the Yangtze Hotel, two British 
engineers asked my mission and then advised me to expect, as I made my way 
upriver, the occasional floating human corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus briefed, I rose early the next morning, inched by cab to the waterfront 
and climbed aboard the Yangtze Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The first pleasure of a westbound Yangtze cruise is that no matter what else 
might happen, you're out of Wuhan. The next pleasure, for me, was realizing I 
was the first passenger aboard, free to snoop. While crew members mopped and 
scrubbed the halls of the 285-foot-long ship -- then tossed the trash overboard 
into the river their customers had come to admire -- I wandered. 
</P>
<P>
 Though just 2 1/2 years old, the ship looked at least 10. My single cabin was 
a tidy cubicle with a 180-degree view of the river, a private balcony, a 
rust-stained and wrinkled carpet, a tiny desk, a toilet and shower. The 
swimming pool on the top deck was dry, and remained so for the next five days. 
A few paces to the fore, someone had laid out a mini-golf course, which also 
remained idle. 
</P>
<P>
 It fell to the cruise director, an earnest, adept, multilingual 25-year-old 
named Ben Chen, to reconcile 63 American passengers, and 67 others from points 
all around Asia, to these circumstances. He did quite well, considering. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's dining room offered Western breakfasts to those of us who wanted 
them, but otherwise stuck to a satisfying range of Chinese fare: fried shrimp, 
sweet-and-sour pork, mushrooms, cucumbers, various greens, dumplings, cabbage, 
rolls. In the bar, a karaoke video machine had been installed. In the playroom 
stood a massive billiards table, balls subject to rearrangement with every 
strong swell of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The river: Barges and sampans, sliding past low on the water. No corpses. 
Apartment buildings and industrial sites towering and groaning on the banks. 
The dense order of green row crops. And haze, enduring even through the warm 
midday hours. Later, when clouds crowded in, the sky seemed murky as the silty 
water below. Even for a fresh pair of eyes, the boatmen in straw hats and the 
yellow-green pallor of barge-top orange shipments all resolved into workaday 
melancholy. An hour on the Yangtze here, and a stranger can take it for 
granted. But it's all a matter of luck -- the same stranger might then glance 
to shore and glimpse the outline of two men with a water buffalo and acres to 
plow before they sleep, a 1,000-year-old profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just the river," said veteran China tour guide Johanna 
Koeleman-Walk a few minutes later on the observation deck. "This is really the 
only way most tourists can get out to see the countryside." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Day two. In a chill wind on the top deck, Ben Chen led a dozen hardy Americans 
in a beginners' round of tai chi chuan. Three-and-a-half hours later, we docked 
at Shashi, a bustling, muddy, textile-producing town of 400,000, which is 
immediately neighbored by a 2,100-year-old canal and the smaller historic town 
of Jingzhou. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shashi's regional museum, we filed through dimly lit rooms and peered at 
ancient jade carvings, pre-Christian enamel work, a 2,300-year-old example of 
silk brocade work and a remarkably well-preserved corpse, now pickled in 
formaldehyde, believe to have been buried in 167 BC. We prowled beneath the 
tiled roofs of a calligraphy museum. We climbed the Jingzhou City Wall, which 
historians believe was built about 700 BC. And we evaded "the artistic 
waxworks" -- a new tourist attraction that announced itself with a boombox 
blaring Asian rock. China's changes have already reached far beyond its 
principal cities. 
</P>
<P>
 We also ate lunch, with varying degrees of satisfaction, at local restaurants. 
Dining in ignorance, I was perfectly happy with my pork, vegetables, rolls and 
rice. Fellow traveler Terry Halberg, who works for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture in Washington, D.C., peeked into the kitchen and returned to his 
table reluctant to eat anything but the steaming soup. He resolved to do no 
more kitchen inspections for the rest of the cruise, and was fine. (Others 
among the American cruisers proved less adaptable. When dining out in the 
province of Sichuan, home of one of the most famously spicy cuisines on the 
planet, several Americans loudly complained that their dishes were entirely too 
hot. The Chinese were too polite to throw them in the river.) 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m. on the second night, almost all the Americans were asleep in their 
cabins, and a tour group from Taiwan had taken over the karaoke machine in the 
lounge. One of the ship's employees stepped up to croon a note-perfect version 
of Frank Sinatra's "My Way." Several couples danced the cha-cha. Outside, the 
crew played spotlights along the water's edge, rough contours began to rise, 
and a new riverscape took shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the dark, misty and early hours of Day Three, steep slopes began to rise on 
either side of the ship, some rock-faced, others sculpted into terraced crops. 
Then, directly ahead, our spotlights fixed on a wall of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first lock of the Gezhouba Dam, completed about five years ago as 
a sort of smaller-scale dress rehearsal for the Three Gorges dam. Local 
authorities say the Gezhouba project forced relocation of 200,000 local 
residents and has raised water levels 70 feet in some areas, providing power, 
smoothing navigation in formerly perilous passages of the river and stabilizing 
river flows. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour or two after our arrival there, having waited our turn among a dozen 
large and small vessels and then edged our way through the locks into the 
higher water, we came to the beginning of the river's marquee attractions: 
Xiling Gorge, 47 miles long, 1,000 or so feet deep near its eastern end, and 
until the opening of Gezhouba Dam, the gorge most feared by boatmen. 
</P>
<P>
 While we glided beneath the rocky green-and-gray slopes and the morning light 
slowly gained strength, a hawk tracked us from above. The scene was reminiscent 
of Yosemite, robed in mist, robbed of its waterfalls, the symmetry of Half Dome 
scrambled, the valley half-flooded. At a bend in the river, the wooden skeleton 
of an unlucky old ship lay lodged and splintered between sharp rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all that, the site of the new dam project a few miles upstream seemed 
downright piddling. On an island called Zhongbao, heavy equipment had dragged 
the ground bare, and a neighboring town teemed with workers facing a profoundly 
odd job: If they do their work properly, their town will disappear forever 
beneath about 300 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese leaders, who formally embraced the project in 1992, say thousands of 
rural residents have been relocated already. The government forecasts that the 
dam's power potential could mean 40 million fewer tons of coal to burn each 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 But realistically, the future of the project is no easier to see than the 
misty peaks of gorges on a gray day. Cost estimates reach as high as $30 
billion. Financing from the World Bank, thought by some to be vital for the 
project, is far from assured. The death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, said 
to be 89 and ailing, could radically change the nation's political landscape, 
as could the country's hurtling economic expansion and liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Badong, beyond Xiling Gorge, we debarked, scrambled onto buses, then found 
ourselves prisoners in the chase scene of an IMAX movie. Outside the windows of 
our careening bus lay 2,500-foot slopes, terraced and planted in rich green 
crops from top to bottom. A stone house here, a curl of smoke from a chimney 
there. Three children up the road, straggling home from their country school. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt road, 30 miles long, had only been cut two years before. It led 
through one-lane passages, across deep puddles, around blind corners and down 
steep hills. Sitting up front, I watched the driver kill the ignition on the 
downhill stretches, presumably to save gas. I never asked; I didn't want to 
distract him. At the end of the road came a 400-step descent to Shennong 
Stream, a deep, narrow Yangtze tributary that, until the building of the road, 
was the principal commuter artery among the hamlets of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains a commuter artery, but it's also a stop for fortunate foreigners on 
the Yangtze. Down I stepped, while those uninterested in negotiating the 400 
steps paid $6 or so to be carried in thrones by pairs of local young men. At 
the bottom, the boatmen of Shennong stood smoking in the shallows. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the sampans held 17 travelers and was propelled by four or five 
boatmen who pushed, pulled and poled the vessel across stones in shallow water, 
delicately guiding us between narrow gorges, through emerald pools, past 
delicately balanced boulders. Soon the only sound was rushing water, panting 
boatmen and racing motor-driven camera mechanisms. The boatmen brandished 
steel-tipped bamboo poles, wore Speedo-style briefs and wrung out their shirts 
and sweaters during calm passages. 
</P>
<P>
 The sampan voyage covered eight miles and about three hours and brought even 
the laziest throne occupant into an intimacy with the landscape that was 
impossible from the ship. By the time the Shennong emptied into the Yangtze and 
we returned to ship, light was fading. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cruises for foreigners now offer either the Shennong side trip or a small 
boat trip up "Lesser Three Gorges" of the Daning River a few miles west, and 
the occasion is often a highlight. On the morning after our small-craft 
excursion, 74-year-old Paul Bergquist of Saddle River, N.J., a traveler who has 
seen Alaska, Europe, Australia, Africa and South America, pronounced the sampan 
journey "one of the best days of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second gorge on the upriver route is Wu, also known as Witches Gorge. We 
reached it early on Day 4, and stood squinting on deck, trying to distinguish 
among the dozen peaks that tower over its 25-mile length. Goddess Peak. 
Ascending Dragon. Wise Man Springs. Congregated Immortals. Reaching more than 
2,000 feet above us, some amounted to faint lines in the mist. The last gorge, 
Qutang, slipped past later that day, the narrowest of the three and the 
shortest, at about five miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look one direction, and you're in Bryce," said Rod Zook, an amateur 
photographer from Seattle. "Look another, you're in Yosemite. Another, you're 
in the Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 The gorges were certainly spectacular enough for me, and they seemed to be 
enough for those who stood alongside me craning their necks, juggling their 
still and video cameras and gently cursing the same dim, misty light that gave 
the scenes such gravity. But these gorges, I gather, don't do it for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Lonely Planet guidebook: "Don't expect to be dwarfed by mile-high 
cliffs! A lot of people find the trip quite boring, possibly because of 
over-anticipation." Another newspaper correspondent, who took the same ship 
five months before I did, found the Three Gorges region "certainly scenic, but 
not so spectacular that I would advise someone to travel halfway around the 
world to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the problem here is people. For all its epic dimensions, the Yangtze 
River is not one of those natural wonders, like the Grand Canyon, that seem 
impervious to human presence. Country hovels and filthy cities intrude at its 
edges. Farmers traipse up the slopes. Cruise ships ply and pollute the water. 
For strictly aesthetic appeal, a traveler is probably better off about 500 
miles to the south, among the curvaceous peaks along the Li River near Guilin. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say, entirely accurately, that the middle Yangtze is an impure, 
melancholy place. You could also say it's the place where, right now, the 
planet's most populous nation is confronting, for better or worse, its premier 
natural resource. Decide which of those observations you'd make first, and 
perhaps you've decided whether the Yangtze is for you. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we'd cleared the last of the gorges, Qutang, the cruise had 
covered more than 600 miles and we had entered Sichuan province. In Wanxian, a 
city of 300,000, about half of whom are to be relocated as part of the dam 
project, we ate a local dinner and browsed through an evening marketplace. In 
Fengdu, fabled as a "ghost city" and disquietingly self-conscious of itself as 
a tourist stop, some visitors boarded a tramway, viewed torture instruments in 
aged temples and peered down from a scenic bridge between peaks. Others sampled 
the city's free market, a free-for-all of geese, chickens, eels, produce, 
bright colors, pungent odors, grinning butchers and haggling farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually we came to Chongqing, our final port, and it emphatically finished 
the job of delivering us from landscape to cityscape. Greater Chongqing 
straddles the river and houses about 15 million people amid traffic, grit and 
closely built, cloud-covered hills. We debarked in late evening, five days and 
840-odd miles after we'd begun, and were immediately absorbed by local traffic 
and delivered to a lavish, five-year-old Holiday Inn for our last night. 
Nearby, a massive concrete bridge, opened to much fanfare in 1980, spans the 
river.  
</P>
<P>
 My last look at the Yangtze, through the window of an airport-bound van, was 
from atop that bridge. The river moved slowly, obscured by mist, clogged by 
idle boats, conquered by the city. But that's not the way I intend to remember 
it. GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Yin and Yangtze of China 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a tour: Unless you speak Chinese or have a companion who does, a 
guided group tour is the most sensible way to get around China. Three veteran 
operators in China, each of whom offers Yangtze cruises, are Pacific Delight 
Tours (132 Madison Ave., New York 10016; telephone 800-221-7179 or 
212-684-7707), InterPacific Tours International (111 East 15th St. at Park 
Avenue South, New York 10003; tel. 800-221-3594 or 212-684-7707), and 
Abercrombie & Kent International (1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521; 
tel. 800-323-7308 or 708-954-2944. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Delight's 1994 prices give an idea of overall cost: A 24-day tour 
including a four-day Yangtze River cruise, fully escorted by an American tour 
manager, visiting 16 cities, ranges from $3,990 in mid-March to $4,720 in late 
September-mid-October (prices are per person based on double occupancy, and 
include air fare from the West Coast, most meals). Best times to visit are 
spring and fall, avoiding the steamy summer and cold, wet winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: United Airlines offers Los Angeles-Shanghai connections via San 
Francisco or Tokyo. Northwest Airlines offers a connection through Tokyo. Both 
carriers charge restricted fares beginning at $1,532-$1,660, depending on the 
season. China Eastern (tel. 213-384-2703) offers a one-stop direct Los 
Angeles-Shanghai flight twice weekly for a restricted economy fares of 
$1,332.95 (tax included), depending on the season. Discount fares may be 
available (tel. 800-423-7777). 
</P>
<P>
 China Eastern, China Southern and China Southwest airlines offer flights 
between Shanghai and interior Chinese cities. (Travelers should note that the 
International Airline Passengers Assn. has warned of maintenance, management 
and piracy problems in the Chinese aviation system.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yangtze cruises: For those who assemble their own itineraries instead of 
relying on a tour operator, Yangtze Paradise quotes the following 1994 rates: 
In peak season (April 16-June 17 and Sept. 5-Oct. 25), a four-day downstream 
cruise from Chongqing to Wuhan runs $820-$1,200 per person, double occupancy, 
depending on the cabin; for the five-day upstream trip, $720- $1,080. In 
shoulder season (March 21-April 15, June 18-Sept 2 and Oct. 27-Dec. 6), 
downstream fares run $620-$980; upstream fares, $560-$900. Further details: 
Hubei Yangtze Cruise Corp., 110 Qintai Road, Hangyang, Wuhan, P.R. China 
430050; tel. 011-86-27-484-6940, fax 011-86-27- 484-6914. A list of several 
other cruise companies is available from the China National Tourist Office.

TRAVEL INSIDER: GOT A SPECIAL TRAVEL INTEREST? THERE'S A NEWSLETTER FOR YOU; 
PUBLISHING: SMALL PERIODICALS CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR READERS WHO 
BEAR IN MIND POTENTIAL BIASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER; Reynolds travels anonymously at 
the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been reading travel newsletters, and because I have, I can pass along the 
following intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 USAir, hoping to attract more business from undertakers, is offering them a 
free round-trip ticket for every 30 corpses they ship with the airline. In 
Paris, The Factory Bar, a trendy nightspot on rue Quincampoix, is dominated by 
twin neon Studebaker signs and inspired by Andy Warhol.  
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is vitally interested in all these things, but for the reading 
traveler with a particular curiosity, travel newsletters can be a valuable 
source of information, and their numbers continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 By the count of the 1994 Oxbridge Directory of Newsletters, 192 travel 
newsletters are now doing business in North America, up from 187 in 1992 and 
140 in 1991. Their specialties run from Mexico to Germany, gay travel to 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Most newsletters are 8 1/2-by-11 inches and tend to use graphics and line 
drawings but not photography. The most serious are long on phone numbers, 
addresses and prices and relatively short on colorful descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several newsletters, including the Consumer Reports Travel Letter and Andrew 
Harper's Hideaway Report, accept no under-writing or freebies from the hotels, 
restaurants and transportation-providers they write about. But some other 
publishers frequently accept free and specially discounted service. Their 
publications may still include valuable information, but travelers should keep 
possible built-in biases in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the high mortality rate among young newsletters, I've limited this 
short list to special-interest publications (that is, those built on ideas such 
as budget travel or train travel, rather than specific geographic destinations) 
that have been printing since at least 1992. There are many other newsletters 
of merit not included here. The best place for a reader to browse among titles 
and get further information is the Oxbridge Directory of Newsletters, which is 
available in the reference department of most large public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer Reports Travel Letter (P.O. Box 53629, Boulder, Colo. 80322; tel. 
800-234-1970). The foremost travel newsletter in the country. Veteran editor Ed 
Perkins carefully appraises bargain opportunities and freely criticizes major 
players, concentrating more on ways and means than on specific destinations. 
The prose is quantitative, not descriptive, and the traveler who spends $75 per 
night on hotels gets much more attention than the one who drops $200. Twelve 
issues yearly. Typical issue: 24 pages. Circulation: a bit over 100,000. 
One-year subscription: $39; two years, $59. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inside Flyer (4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80916; tel. 
719-597-8889). For the fanatically frequent flyer, this is the bible. Publisher 
Randy Petersen explains how to exploit frequent-traveler offerings of the 
airlines, hotels and rental car companies, and so on. Accepts advertising but 
known for editorial independence. No coverage of destinations. Twelve issues 
yearly. Typical issue: 36 pages. Circulation: 79,000. One-year subscription: 
$33; 2 years, $55. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report (P.O. Box 50, Sun Valley, Ida. 83353; tel. 
406-862-3480) Got too much money? This 15-year-old publication, which prides 
itself on the many top executives among its subscribers, will tell you some of 
the best places to spend it. Readers are unlikely to find mention of a hotel 
charging less than $150 nightly, but they will find critical judgments. (The 
Caribbean isle of St. Martin, for instance, was dismissed in January as "an 
overpriced construction site with beaches and bistros.") Twelve issues yearly. 
Typical issue: 8 pages. Circulation: 17,900. One-year subscription: $100. 
</P>
<P>
 * The International Railway Traveler (P.O. Box 3000, Dept. IRT, Denville, N.J. 
07834; tel. or fax 502-454-0277). The publication, about 11 years old, features 
glossy white paper and black-and-white photos of trains, train stations, train 
tracks and train workers. The January-February issue includes detailed articles 
on a tram in Oslo, commuter lines of Manila and St. Louis (no, they're not 
connected) and a winter scheduling update on Israel Railways. Six issues 
yearly. Typical issue: 16 pages. Circulation: about 3,500. One-year 
subscription: $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passport Newsletter (350 W. Hubbard St., Suite 440, Chicago, Ill. 60610; 
tel. 800-542-6670). Founded in 1965, this has been called "the grandaddy" of 
travel newsletters. Concentrates on upscale destinations and is usually rich in 
information on hotels, restaurants and shopping. Twelve issues yearly. Typical 
issue: 20-24 pages. Circulation: the owners won't say. One-year subscription: 
$65. 
</P>
<P>
 * Out & About (542 Chapel St., New Haven, Conn. 06511; tel. 800-929-2268). The 
subtitle, "essential information for the gay & lesbian traveler," says it all. 
Though they only started publishing in September, 1992, O & A publisher David 
Alport and editor Billy Kolber, both formerly of American Express Travel 
Services, have built a thorough, handsome and rapidly growing newsletter. Ten 
issues yearly. Typical issue: 16 pages. Circulation: 6,500. One-year 
subscription: $49. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: a sampling of newsletters that concentrate on specific 
destinations.

TAKING THE KIDS: EXPLORING D-DAY FROM THE BRITISH SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rain didn't slow my son Matt down a bit. He was too busy playing World War 
II, clambering up and down the huge battle cruiser's seven decks, inspecting 
the six-inch gun turret, imagining himself in command on the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet it was cool to fight on this ship," he decided after we listened to a 
simulated battle, complete with flashing lights, sirens and gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 We were aboard the HMS Belfast, one of the largest cruisers ever built for the 
British Royal Navy and now Europe's last surviving World War II warship. On 
D-day she was among the first to open fire on the Germans in Normandy, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Now permanently anchored in the Pool of London near London Bridge and the 
Tower of London, she's part of the Imperial War Museum and is visited by 
thousands each year, including many school children who inspect the galley and 
sick bay, the boilers and engines -- everything it took to carry a ship with 
850 men into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other World War II sites, the Belfast is gearing up for an influx of 
visitors this year because of the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion, which 
signaled the beginning of the end of the war. It's an excellent time to give 
children a dose of World War II history with a visit to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to share history with the generation that experienced it," said 
Helena Koenig, about children taking such a trip with their grandparents. 
Koenig is founder of GrandTravel, a Maryland-based travel agency that 
specializes in grandparent-grandchildren trips, and this summer her company is 
offering a special 15-day "Dover to Calais -- World War II Remembered" trip, 
with stops at Omaha Beach and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's D-day headquarters, 
as well as visits to Paris and London. (Land portion of the tour is more than 
$4,000 a person. Call 800-247-7651 for a brochure.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the months before the invasion, thousands of American troops were stationed 
in southern England for training. To welcome them and their families, hundreds 
of special exhibits and celebrations are planned -- from official commemorative 
events the week of D-day in June, to local parties at pubs, to museum 
offerings. The D-day Museum and Overlord Tapestry in Portsmouth, on the English 
Channel, is the only museum in Britain devoted to D-day. North of Portsmouth is 
Southwick House, where Eisenhower made the decision to go ahead with the 
invasion. In London, the Imperial War Museum has mounted an extensive "D-day to 
Victory" exhibit that will run through May, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhower's top secret planning documents are in the exhibit, as are uniforms 
worn by British and American soldiers who landed on the Normandy beaches and 
sabotage equipment used by Allied agents behind German lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt loved the Imperial War Museum -- especially the tanks and the section 
called The Blitz Experience. In it, we walked into a reconstructed London air 
raid shelter and felt what it was like to get caught in a bombing raid on a 
London street as sirens went off and fires ignited. I was shaking when it was 
over. Meanwhile, Matt couldn't stop staring at the fighter planes suspended 
from the ceiling of the huge atrium, imagining himself in the cockpit. "They're 
so small!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Matt couldn't get his fill of planes, we also visited Duxford Airfield 
near Cambridge. Now a center for historic aircraft restoration and also part of 
the Imperial War Museum, Duxford houses one of the best collections of military 
and civil aircraft in Europe -- from a World War I Bristol Fighter to World War 
II Spitfires to a supersonic Concorde you can climb aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II Duxford was an important Royal Air Force Base. Spitfires 
were tested there and you can see the reconstruction of the Operations Room 
used during the 1940 Battle of Britain. Duxford also served as a fighter base 
for American pilots. Matt was reluctant to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't have to coax Matt to visit these World War II exhibits. He led me, 
telling me the stories his grandfather had told him about the war years. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, we toured Winston Churchill's underground Cabinet War Rooms, 10 
feet below ground in the heart of London. They were hurriedly converted to 
emergency underground accommodations to protect government officials from air 
attack. They became the vital nerve center for Britain's war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw the cramped quarters where Churchill and his aides worked and slept, 
the Cabinet Room and the Map Room, where up-to-the minute information about 
operations was collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps in use during the last months of the war are still in place. I couldn't 
have asked for a better history lesson for Matt . . . or for me.

 More travel guides for the MTV generation (or at least its more educated and 
intellectually curious members), these new volumes, which bear no bylines (but 
carry long lists of contributors) are English translations of a series 
originally published last year by Editions Nouveaux-Loisirs in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Long and slender, with dust jackets over durable black plastic-coated 
bindings, they're visual delights full of photographs, maps, architectural 
details, paintings and more. The slant is heavily historical and cultural (in 
other words, French), with sections on each city "As Seen by Painters" and "As 
Seen by Writers," and with precious little space wasted on mindless amusements 
-- though there are sections of practical information, with smart 
recommendations for hotels and restaurants, museum addresses and hours and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of "sound bites," these are books full of travel bites, quick and 
memorable. They're no substitute for detailed guidebooks and background reading 
(for which, incidentally, they offer extensive bibliographies), but they are 
undeniably great fun, and an effective preliminary means of immersing oneself 
in the spirit of a place. Volumes devoted to Venice and San Francisco are due 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 CAIRO: Tales of the City and VENICE: Tales of the City, both edited by John 
and Kirsten Miller (Chronicle Books, $12.95 each hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 These small volumes of diverse writings (most quite brief) -- the first in a 
series dubbed Chronicles Abroad -- are a few months late: They would have made 
perfect stocking-stuffers at Christmastime. Handsome little things, not much 
bigger than a large man's palm, they're simply mini-anthologies of evocations 
of their subject cities, mostly by famous writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these are letters or journal entries; others are excerpts from longer 
works. The authors are something of an odd lot: They include Rudyard Kipling, 
Naguib Mahfouz, William Burroughs and Monty Python's Michael Palin for Cairo; 
Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Casanova and Orson Welles (an anecdote about 
encountering Churchill) for Venice. As serious literary compendia, they're 
pretty lightweight, but they're diverting enough and are small and inexpensive 
enough to make great casual gifts, even though it isn't Christmas.

<P>
 CHOCOLATES FOR THE PILLOWS, NIGHTMARES FOR THE GUESTS by Kenneth Lane Prestia 
(Bartleby Press, $12.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Hotel guests sometimes get robbed, raped, even burned to death in their rooms. 
In many instances (as law courts have agreed), the hotel itself was negligent 
in permitting the circumstances under which these things could occur. Kenneth 
Prestia, who has worked the security detail for the Hilton, Hyatt, Western 
International and Howard Johnson hotel chains, argues in this admonitory volume 
that all too many hoteliers concentrate on guest amenities while neglecting 
basic measures to protect their clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 There are horror stories aplenty here (don't read this book late on a stormy 
night in a cheap motel room without a deadbolt on the door), and a measure of 
good advice for travelers. Prestia probably could have made his point in far 
fewer words, though -- in a magazine article, say.

 Quick trips:

<P>
 CRUISES '94 by Antoinette DeLand and Anne Campbell (Fielding Worldwide, Inc., 
$16.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Which ships cruise which waters, what to see and do along popular cruise 
routes, how the major cruise ships (as well as smaller craft -- river boats, 
charter yachts, hotel barges, etc.) stack up against one another, general tips 
for pleasant sailing and more. A standard for the water-bound vacationer. 
</P>
<P>
 EXPLORING EUROPE BY BOAT by Barbara Radcliffe Rogers and Stillman Rogers 
(Globe Pequot Press, $12.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 This little guidebook is full of information on such things as river barges 
along the Seine through Normandy, icebreaker jaunts in Finland and steamers on 
the lakes of northern Italy -- ways of seeing Europe that many travelers miss. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW MEXICO: Discover the Land of Enchantment, revised second edition by Dave 
DeWitt (Gulf Publishing Company, $15.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 An updated version of one of the more comprehensive guides to this state, in 
the Texas Monthly Guidebook series. As the sub-title suggests, the book is 
often phrased in tourist-bureau-sounding prose, but it covers a lot of ground 
and does it well. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BEST HOTELS OF GREAT BRITAIN 1994, compiled by the Association for 
Consumer Research, edited by Patricia Yates (Globe Pequot Press, $19.95 paper). 
 
</P>
<P>
 A thick, invaluable volume for anyone planning to travel in England, Scotland 
and/or Wales -- especially in the countryside. Originally published in the U.K. 
itself as "The Which? Hotel Guide 1994" ("Which?" being the British equivalent 
of our "Consumer Reports"), this is a serious, responsible guide, with much 
frank description, pro and con, and lots of very specific and up-to-date 
factual information.

<P>
 Israel and the Territories: The U.S. State Department warned Americans 
traveling in Israel to stay out of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip after the Feb. 25 massacre of more than two dozen Muslim worshipers at a 
mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron. Within Israel itself, Americans were 
advised not to use public transportation and to avoid bus stops, crowds and 
demonstrations. Israel stepped up security, closing the plaza in front of the 
Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City and restricting access to the nearby Al 
Aqsa mosque. Americans traveling anywhere in the Middle East or Europe should 
be "particularly aware of their surroundings, avoiding all crowds and 
demonstrations and maintaining a low profile," the State Department cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Egypt: The tremors from the Hebron killings were particularly felt 
in these two countries. In Jordan, the State Department advised Americans to be 
careful and to avoid two parts of the capital -- east Amman and the downtown 
souk area -- plus any refugee camp. Although there apparently have been no 
specific threats against Americans in Jordan, the department noted two recent 
attacks on foreigners in Amman: A British citizen and a German citizen were 
stabbed in separate incidents, both left with superficial wounds. In Egypt, 
already troubled by terrorist attacks on tourism facilities, the government 
tightened security around the Israeli Embassy, synagogues and diplomats' homes 
after the massacre. Israeli tourists were being discouraged from visiting 
Egypt, according to the Reuters news service. A previously unknown group 
threatened Americans and Israelis in Egypt to avenge the Hebron attack, Reuters 
said. Europe 
</P>
<P>
 Great Britain: London air traffic was disrupted when Irish Republican Army 
terrorists, over a five-day period, lobbed three series of mortars into 
Heathrow Airport early this month. None of the dozen shells exploded, leading 
to speculation that they may have been dummy rounds intended simply to 
demonstrate the IRA's attack capabilities. Most shells landed on runways or in 
parking lots; one struck the roof of Terminal 4, causing its evacuation. 
Airport security was intensified, with hundreds of officers patrolling Heathrow 
and its perimeter. Describing the attacks as evidence of a new "IRA tactical 
audacity," one American analyst said they were intended "to disrupt air 
traffic, attract publicity, embarrass the security forces and pressure the 
government" during negotiations over Northern Ireland. Russia 
</P>
<P>
 A London-based consulting firm says there were 7,000 reported crimes against 
foreigners, mostly extortion, in Russia during the first half of 1993. In a 
report quoted by Reuters, the Control Risks Group estimates that there are 
about 3,000 organized crime groups (the Russian Interior Ministry estimates 
5,700) engaged in racketeering, extortion and kidnaping in the former Soviet 
Union. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide: The March 4 conviction of followers of Sheik Omar Abdurrahman in 
the World Trade Center bombing trial "may precipitate strong reactions from 
Islamic extremists" in Egypt and other countries, the State Department warned. 
Americans overseas, especially in the Middle East, South Asia or North Africa, 
should be alert to continuing developments, the department advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Spots: State Department travel warnings are in effect for Afghanistan, 
Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Congo, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, 
Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Peru, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, 
Somalia, Sudan and Tajikistan, and also for East Jerusalem and the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

HIKING: SAN DIEGO COUNTY: THE WAY AROUND LAKE POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The city in the country" is the official civic motto of Poway, a city of 
50,000 northeast of San Diego. Poway's "country" is an extensive system of 
parks, preserves and greenbelts -- a collection of greenery that cities many 
times its size would be proud to possess. 
</P>
<P>
 Poway also has an impressive trail network. Paths connect neighborhoods with 
city parks with surrounding wildlands. In all, Poway has 60 miles of trail and 
is in the process of constructing 20 more miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail system's hub is Lake Poway, a 60-acre reservoir with playgrounds and 
picnic areas. Boating and fishing are popular activities on the lake, while 
horseback riding, mountain biking and hiking are the favorite pastimes on 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Poway Trail circles the lake; other trails lead off it into more remote 
regions of the recreation area. The well-constructed path is also a fitness 
trail complete with exercise stations, and a nature trail with numbered stops 
keyed to an interpretive brochure (available at the park entry station). 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers looking for a challenge can tackle the Mt. Woodson Trail, which ascends 
the steep slopes above Lake Poway. The rugged trail, 10 miles round trip, 
climbs through the high chaparral and serves up fine views of San Diego and the 
blue Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 A much easier family outing, Green Valley Truck Trail (three miles round 
trip), visits Blue Sky Ecological Reserve. The reserve, managed by the 
California Department of Fish and Game, includes a seasonal creek and a lovely 
oak woodland. You can hike to the reserve from Lake Poway or from a trail head 
on the east side of Espola Road, just half a mile from the turnoff to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Poway Trail can be a jumping-off place to all kinds of adventure, or 
simply enjoyed by itself. Note that the trail, with its hill climbs and steep 
switchbacks, will not be the easiest 2 1/2 miles you ever walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 15 in Rancho Bernardo, exit on 
Rancho Bernardo Road and travel east. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bit more than three miles, the road bends south and continues as 
Espola Road. Half a mile after the bend, turn left on Lake Poway Road and 
continue to road's end at Lake Poway Recreation Area. Parking is free for Poway 
residents; other pay $4 on weekends, $3 weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Join the trail to the right of the marina and begin your 
counter-clockwise circuit of the lake. Blue ceanothus blossoms brighten the 
path in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 On the east side of the lake, you'll pass the signed junction with Mt. Woodson 
Trail. Lake Poway Trail heads north, leaving the lake shore and dropping into a 
steep canyon behind the lake's rock-fill dam. Lake Poway Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Lake Poway Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 miles round trip, with 400-foot elevation gain; longer options 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Boulder-strewn hills around lake; oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Inviting parks and preserves at the edge of fast-growing area. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR MORE INFORMATION: Conctact the Lake Poway Recreation Area, P.O. Box 789, 
Poway, Calif. 92074 (619) 679-4397; Blue Sky Ecological Reserve, (619)

CAMP CRUISE: AN INAUGURAL VOYAGE ON THE AMERICAN FAMILY CRUISES SHIP PROVED A 
BUMPY RIDE FOR PARENTS, BUT THE KIDS HAD A BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM DWYER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The moment we boarded the American Adventure cruise ship, a grizzled Italian 
seaman, pushing by, stopped short at the sight of our 15-month-old baby girl.  
</P>
<P>
 "Che bella!" he exclaimed. "Ciao, bambina, ciao!"  
</P>
<P>
 Of course. This was the new American Family Cruises line, where even the guys 
working in the boiler room behave like Italian grandmothers when they see 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, it was a match made in the Caribbean: a family cruise ship that was on 
just its second voyage last December, and the Dwyers, who had been on one prior 
cruise -- so it was the Staten Island Ferry, whattaya, a snob or something? -- 
but never had considered taking another. 
</P>
<P>
 We are -- sigh -- past the moony-couples-phase of life. We have -- shriek -- 
young kids. Leisure is someone else's job. We travel only to places where 
tables have no sharp corners and where we are supervised by other kids and 
parents. A cruise? On a boat? In the water? No, not really. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, I didn't think so until someone started counting noses and realized 
that people who have kids want to go somewhere. American Family Cruises rolled 
up a giant demographic wave and announced that it would take everyone away to 
sea and sun for seven days. The kids could do computers or roller-blade or make 
videos, they could eat themselves sick on pizza and ice cream, and the parents 
could Take It Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A vacation is no vacation if it neglects the needs of a very important part 
of the family -- parents. . . . You need time to be you," coos the brochure. 
"To relax and recharge. At AFC, we provide just the right balance of time for 
kids, time for families together and all-important time for parents." 
</P>
<P>
 I grew faint upon reading this. For months, we kept the cruise literature next 
to the bed and eagerly thumbed it when the hands of the parental clock were 
pointing to High Anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, our trip must be graded on two curves -- one for the kids, another 
for the parents. The trip was a miracle of inefficiency and joyful charm, of 
sailors and waiters tickling babies and of things that did not work. We could 
not wait to get off the ship at the end of the trip. The parties on board were 
dazzling fun, full of laughs and dancing. Not a single clock gave anything like 
the right time. Our older girl had a wonderful "dolphin encounter." But she 
could not get a pair of in-line skates because this cruise line -- dedicated to 
kids -- had none smaller than size four.  
</P>
<P>
 We were, after all, on only the second sailing of the 1,500-passenger American 
Adventure since it was refitted for family cruising. Formerly the Costariviera, 
which sailed in the Caribbean, the vessel is more than 30 years old. As a 
family cruise operation, the American Adventure travels from the Port of Miami 
through the eastern Caribbean, calling at Nassau in the Bahamas, a lovely 
deserted island off the Dominican Republic and Key West in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise line, the first dedicated entirely to family cruising, was 
inaugurated Dec. 18, when four kids broke a giant bottle of Coke on the hull of 
the American Adventure. By the third day of our trip a week later, the ship had 
run dry on Coca-Cola -- and Sprite, and just about everything except ginger ale 
-- and somehow was not able to replenish its supply in the ports. A minor 
matter, but quite an accomplishment on a cruise that caters to kids and charged 
$1.50 for a can of pop.  
</P>
<P>
 I think it was right around the time the soda ran out that my wife Cathy said: 
"I have never seen so many broken machines in my life." The soda, popcorn and 
candy machines didn't work. Neither did the elevator at our end of the ship. 
The coin laundries were out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, none of this bothered the kids. Seven hundred of them on the boat. 
Most of them, right up to age 17, seemed to have a spectacular time. The cruise 
is calibrated to please the Youth of America: the quiet and the rambunctious, 
the kids who are happy dragging a computer mouse and the ones who are thrilled 
to sing in the karaoke lounge, the children who want to tie-dye T-shirts and 
those who think bliss is shooting hoops.  
</P>
<P>
 In the dining room, we were assigned to a table with the Bell family of 
Florida. Our older daughter Maura, 7, table mate Taraya Bell and Taraya's pal 
Harriet Fletcher were near peers and became instant pals. They barely made a 
move without each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the entertainment deck is devoted to well-designed recreation 
space for kids and is parceled out by age group. The preteens had a room full 
of Macintosh computers. Maura and pals hung out there and in a clubhouse called 
"Sea Haunt" for the 8-to-12 set that is stocked with videos, game tables and a 
giant aquarium. (Since our trip, the ship has grouped the 8- to 10-year-olds 
and 11- to 13-year-olds separately.) The teens are on another deck, where they 
can indulge in such inscrutable teen things as hair and make-over classes and 
MTV, as well as produce news broadcasts for the ship's TV stations.  
</P>
<P>
 From breakfast until after midnight, the kids' programs are abundant, decently 
organized and engaging. Children age 2 to 4 and 5 to 7 are heavily supervised 
in an enclosed play area -- Fuzzy Wuzzy and Rockasaurus -- with camp-style 
activities. The kids made pizza, took trips to the captain's bridge, painted 
their faces and ran a Wizard of Oz show.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents are not allowed into these areas, but can watch their kids on TV 
monitors. The young ones are given an ID bracelet, for the duration, and they 
must be signed in or out of the clubhouses -- although there seemed to be 
little attention paid to the identity of the adult doing the writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Children older than 8 also have structured activities, but the supervision is 
light. These kids basically have the run of the ship. They can go for a snack 
or stick with the program, which included organized scavenger hunts, T-shirt 
tie-dying and musical productions. Retired baseball players Tug McGraw and 
Manny Sanguillen were on board for a batting cage clinic, a big hit with the 
older kids.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Toter, an engineer from Park Ridge, Ill., and his wife brought their six 
kids. "The 18-hour pizza and ice cream is a great idea," Toter said. "My 
12-year-old son is in heaven with the baseball players. We let them all go, and 
they had a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a ball," said New Yorker Pedro Perez of his son, 10, and daughter, 
15. "My daughter -- I lost her to the ship. She met so many friends. She did 
what she couldn't do in the city -- be on her own. The best part of the cruise 
was the kids. All the kids were friendly. They say hello to you; they're funny. 
They feel free, devoid of any danger. And the carnival -- that was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure was. One night the ship ran a Mardi Gras with a ring toss and dunk the 
clown games, a friendly magician twisting balloon animals and lots of music, 
including a jamming steel band. Another day, on a shore excursion to Nassau, 
Maura had her "dolphin encounter" -- a dip in a dolphin pool and a chance to 
pet them. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner -- casual dress -- the waiters and busboys, all male, star in theme 
nights. On "Gags and Giggles" night, the maitre d' opened the dining-room doors 
dressed as Groucho Marx, and out blared the theme song to the old TV cartoon, 
"Top Cat." Antonio, the Spaniard who was our waiter, jitter-bugged with Maura 
all the way across the room to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant service was very good. The busboy at our table, Sinisa Kucar, a 
sweet soul from Croatia, cleaned our baby's bottles with boiling water at every 
meal and refilled them with juice or milk. 
</P>
<P>
 You did not have to commit "diet-cide" on this ship. Fish and pasta were on 
the menu every night, along with a beef or meat entree. (A utilitarian gym 
featured step climbers, a few stationary bikes and a treadmill.) The kids had 
their own menus of the chicken-nuggets ilk. A cafeteria-style buffet in another 
room was open for informal meals, but the food was tired-looking and the 
surroundings unpleasant. (The company recently announced an overhaul of the 
buffet menu.) Shore excursions in Nassau and the Dominican Republic featured 
massive barbecues with chicken, beef, pork chops and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 As for accommodations, our cabin was small -- two sets of bunk beds, a stall 
shower just about big enough for an adult -- but well-tended by a friendly 
stewardess who, every night when she turned down the covers, left a gift on the 
pillow.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what about that curve for grown-ups?  
</P>
<P>
 "If the kids were not here, we'd have gotten off at Nassau," said Chip 
Strassberg of Boynton, Fla., the patriarch of a family of a dozen or so sons, 
daughters and grandchildren who suffered a string of plumbing problems in 
successive cabins. "They do seem to be making an effort to accommodate us, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed that they needed another month or two to fix up the ship, but they 
ran out of time," said Lou Kratter of Huntington Station, N.Y., who was in the 
Strassberg entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was an inaugural sailing," said Bill Toter, the father of six. 
"Serving people is the toughest job in the world -- they get angry about 
something, and then they get on a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 This certainly was true. I was surprised at two things: First, the number of 
silly minor aggravations, most involving standing in line to register kids for 
programs or to go ashore. And second, the level of hair-trigger irritability 
among some passengers. Many complained loudly at the slightest provocation, and 
upon hearing genuine grievances of other passengers, adopted them as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after we boarded, rumors flew that the first sailing had been a major 
disaster. Toilets had backed up and drowned nearly everyone. The survivors had 
been given a voucher for a free cruise. As our trip was the second sailing, 
many people put their noses in the air and smelled trouble, like terriers 
sniffing for rain and a voucher for another cruise. But we quickly found that 
most people were enjoying themselves and were happy with the trip. The weather 
and beaches were lovely. The kids were so happy and noisy I felt I could float 
away.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people, it turned out, did have serious complaints: After the trip, at 
least six passengers in four states were diagnosed with a particularly nasty 
form of diarrhea, called Shigellosis. After local health departments reported 
this, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent 
questionnaires to everyone in the U.S. who took the trip. The results of the 
investigation are not yet available. The ship did pass a federal inspection of 
its sanitary conditions on Jan. 8, and no additional confirmed cases of 
Shigellosis have been reported on the dozen or so cruises that have sailed 
since ours, according to Steve Blackwell, environmental health officer for the 
Vessel Sanitation Program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the diarrhea outbreak was a freak event, would I recommend this 
cruise? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to anyone with kids under 2. Since that includes us, let me dwell on this 
for a minute. Naturally, parents of babies expect to do most of the minding, 
but to make the vacation work, they need a few hours a day off. The ship 
brochure says that in-cabin baby-sitting for the little ones "may be 
available," and the cruise line president told me it is guaranteed. None was 
available on our ship -- and there were 22 babies on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty much the only space on board for the baby set was the Playpen, a big, 
carpeted room with a good supply of toys for toddlers. Our Catherine had a fine 
time there. But with no windows, it felt as if we were breathing mall air. And 
while the older kids are likely to have a great time, what was really needed 
was some outdoor space for the babies and the younger kids who were intimidated 
by the six-foot-deep pool and ended up spending most of their time in those 
outdoor Jacuzzi-whirlpool things. The cruise promised parents -- but didn't 
deliver -- a special evening alone together in the restaurant, gazing into each 
other's eyes while swirling wine glasses of fine Cabernet. "What about that 
picture of the chateaubriand they were promising the grown-ups?" asked John 
Zadrazil of Queens, N.Y. "Where is the nice dining room where you have a nice, 
quiet dinner without the kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, what about the chateaubriand ? "That picture in the brochure was a 
mistake," said Bruce Nierenberg, president of the cruise line. However, the 
cruise line does have an area in the main dining room where adults can dine 
without children, he said. Children can eat in a separate area, or if they are 
over 2, be fed first and dropped off at the recreation areas to play while 
parents eat.

CAN MEXICO'S RULING POLITICAL PARTY SAVE THE STATE, AND ITSELF, FROM 
BALKANIZATION?

 The assassination of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's presidential 
candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, last Wednesday is the third major shock to 
Mexico's institutions since the assassination, last May, of Guadala jara's 
cardinal. Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, in an apparent case of mistaken identity 
that recalled the drug wars in Colombia, was cut down at the city's airport. 
The next major jolt came Jan. 1, with the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, which 
struck at the heart of Mexico's bid for first-world economic and political 
status, via the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination of Colosio, the hand-picked candidate of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, strikes at the PRI's hallowed tradition of presidential 
succession. Colosio, a self-made, 44-year-old economist from the northern state 
of Sonora, was named the PRI's candidate over his archrival, the ex-foreign 
minister Luis Camacho Solis, who represented the official party's left flank. 
</P>
<P>
 The recourse to violence as an instru-ment of political and social change 
recalls the first two decades of the Mexican Revolution. Between 1913 and 1928, 
three Mexican presidents -- Francisco I. Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Alvaro 
Obregon -- as well as two revolutionary leaders, Emiliano Zapata and Pancho 
Villa, were cut down by assassins. The year after the murder of Obregon, in 
1928, saw the rise of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has 
dominated Mexican politics for 65 years and has named all its presidents. The 
assassination of Colosio by a 23-year-old mechanic and self-styled pacifist 
with a handgun bought in the United States poses the most crucial test yet to 
the PRI's ability to shepherd Mexico into the next stage of its still unfolding 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's murder in the northern-border city of Tijuana dramatized the great 
chasm that separates the two Mexicos, the Mexico of poor agrarian states, such 
as Guerrero, Oaxaca, Hidalgo and Chiapas, and the Mexico of the industrial 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 In his efforts to bridge this chasm, Colosio increasingly invoked the rhetoric 
of Mexico's 1910 revolutionaries: "The hour has come," he declared in his swing 
through the north, "to combat inequality, to overcome extreme poverty and 
guarantee for everyone the right to education, health and dignified housing." 
In Monterrey, the capital of Mexico's industrial white upper class, Colosio was 
presented with a doll dressed in Indian clothes, wearing a baseball cap with 
the name "Colosio" printed across it. The symbolism could not have been lost on 
baseball-loving Colosio, a stalwart of northern Mexico's private sector, who 
was gambling all in repackaging himself as a "president of all the people" 
bringing the PRI and the country back to its 1910 revolutionary founding 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 The enormous impact of the Zapatista uprising was predicated on its timing, 
the week following the ratification of NAFTA. The revolt served to remind 
Salinas that he could not drag the country into the First World while millions 
of its peasant farmers lived in a pre-revolutionary state of poverty and 
exploitation. The outrage generated by the Zapatistas, and by their articulate 
spokesman, Subcomandante Marcos, sparked protests and demonstrations in other 
poor regions of Mexico, protests that are being fanned anew by Colosio's 
assassination. The violence at the opposite border states of the Mexican 
republic cannot help but invite comparison to the breakup of the former Iron 
Curtain states of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs are not encouraging that the PRI can contain the country's deepening 
rifts and contradictions without undertaking radical structural reforms. The 
enraged and frustrated Mexican poor will no longer settle for a technocrat 
president along the lines of Miguel de la Madrid, Salinas or the pre-Zapatista 
Colosio, who had just begun to gain credibility with Mexico's poor when he was 
cut down. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the hard-line industrialists, bankers and landowners who 
dominate the PRI's right are on the march -- both in Chiapas and in the 
industrial north. Two-thousand "authentic citizens" of San Cristobal de las 
Casas gathered two weeks ago to denounce Camacho and the Zapatista rebels and 
to call for the ouster of Samuel Ruiz Garcia, Chiapas' liberation-theologian 
bishop who was the chief mediator between the government and the Zapatistas. 
Their hard-line counterparts in Salinas' Cabinet and inner council are 
agitating for a candidate who represents their economic and political 
interests. If the violence accelerates, these hard-liners will seek an 
authoritarian leader after the mold strongman Obregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing backlash is matched by a popular revulsion against the 
back-room deals that have produced Mexico's presidents for the better part of 
seven decades. As events in the northernmost and southernmost states tug at 
Mexico's center, Salinas will need all his political skills to prevent the 
polarization of his party and the start of a regional fracturing and 
balkanization that could turn Mexico into a North American Yugoslavia. The PRI 
is fighting for its soul, as well as for the right to continue directing the 
destiny of 92 million Mexicans.*

OBSESSED WITH THE HUNT; WITH MEDIA IN UNBRIDLED PURSUIT, COULD ANYONE GET OUT 
ALIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Post during the Watergate investigation, is author of Citizen Cohn, a life of 
Roy Cohn, and Capitalist Fools (Doubleday). He is now writing a play.

<P>
 The mass media is into its binge-purge cycle again. The Whitewater scandal, 
such as it may be, has got the hacks, both print and electronic, in paroxysms 
of investigative fury and fits of exaggerated reportage. Hare and hounds we go, 
over the Arkansas countryside, in unbridled pursuit of the presidential couple. 
</P>
<P>
 In due course, this excess will be followed by a great trooping to the 
journalistic wailing wall, where we shall see editors and reporters look at 
their handiwork and cry out, "Forgive us, we have sinned!" There will be 
remorseful seminars at the Schools of Journalism and those horrid Centers for 
the Study of God Knows What, where the men and women of the media will disport 
in self-recrimination as they delight themselves analyzing their professional 
faults and playing the guilt game. 
</P>
<P>
 Binge-purge. No sooner have we recovered from the maniacally silly coverage of 
that dysfunctional couple of the year, John Wayne and Lorena Bobbitt, than the 
media hoses down the nation with White- water. Without missing a beat, we've 
gone from round-table discussions about whether family newspapers should print 
the word for the male member to the great Arkansas fox hunt. Until the Pulitzer 
committee meets, we won't know who will be awarded the ears and brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending the switch to the purge phase, it remains for the rest of us to dope 
out why the no-longer-quite-so-august New York Times would run a front-page 
story telling its readers that many years ago Hillary Rodham Clinton made 
herself and her old man a small pile ($100,000) speculating in pork bellies. 
Actually, it was cattle futures, but pork bellies sound better and are more in 
keeping with patronizing evocations of razorbacks, Ozark music and barefoot 
hillbillies in bib overalls calling, "Sooooeeeee!" 
</P>
<P>
 These are the fancies that reinforce the mass media's cliche image of the 
Clintons' origins in a small, ignorantly corrupt Southern state, where the 
politicians and the lawyers don't know enough not to do each other favors of 
doubtful legality and questionable ethics. Well, pardon me! Nothing like that 
goes on in Sacramento, Calif., or Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The gratuitous story about Hillary Clinton's investments was nothing compared 
with CNN's wacky report taken from a right-wing newsletter, to the effect that 
the body of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the White House aide who killed himself, had 
been moved. That idea seems to have been scotched for the nonce, but in the 
overly excited air of scoop-happy big-time journalism, you can find more than 
one person in the pressroom who wonders if the poor man wasn't murdered and is 
ready, at the drop of the slightest of clues, to suggest the same on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabloid journalism is not an affliction specific to our times. In 1924, the 
New York Graphic -- the tabloidest tab there ever was -- ran a fake picture of 
the lady in the scandalous "Peaches" and "Daddy" Browning annulment case 
standing nude in front of the jury. The great unwashed loved it, and 
circulation jumped by a quarter-million. 
</P>
<P>
 But if mass journalism is much as it has been throughout the 20th Century, 
class journalism isn't. Why are the once tonier mass-media precincts leering 
and smearing with the best or worst of the tabs? 
</P>
<P>
 In part, it's due to the change in the character of media ownership. The 
single owners of the past often, though by no means always, put their 
principles ahead of profits. It's problematic, for instance, if the Washington 
Post of today -- a publicly held enterprise -- would have taken the risk of 
going ahead with the Watergate investigations after the Nixon people had 
signaled they would be going after the company's TV station licenses. But owner 
Katharine Graham and editor Benjamin C. Bradlee prized a certain kind of 
journalism more than money. They had a moral-vocational compass by which to set 
the newspaper's course. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't have to convene a focus group to tell them what to print or, at 
least as important, what not to print. It's questionable whether a swashbuckler 
like Bradlee would be appointed to the editor's chair of a major newspaper 
today. Those jobs now go to suits with blank faces, people without internal 
gyroscopes who don't care what the public ought to know -- only what they will 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo, television, publicly owned and commercially driven, puts on whatever is 
thought will snag viewers, and print journalism, even the elite dailies, still 
unable to accept that it is no longer a mass medium, apes TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The monkey-see-monkey-do decline of the quality press can be seen not only in 
the smarmalade with which it slathers its pages, but in vocabulary and syntax. 
Compared with the up-market newspapers of 75 years ago, the better journals of 
our era carry less serious news and often present it in the threadbare language 
of a high-school English book report. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was that even the better-educated reading public is debased by 
the standard of Nation's Work, or some other of the magazines that Theodore 
Roosevelt wrote for without benefit of ghost writers. We live and read in a 
time when dippy celebrity profiles, 10-best lists, low-IQ, hotel-room 
interviews and health hints constitute the brain food of millions. Of course, 
they're going to be fed tidbits about the sex lives of the only 50 names and 
faces they know and recognize. Bottled Whitewater is about all there's a market 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers and magazines of 100 years ago differed from each other not only in 
the social class and educational level they appealed to, but also in party 
affiliation and ideological slant. Were this 1890, at least you wouldn't get 
doused with Whitewater foam in newspapers aligned with the Democrats -- so you 
could flee that particular kind of scandal-mongering if you wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 Under other circumstances, an unconscionable mass media is held in check by 
what it assumes is the outer limits of public tolerance. That tolerance, as far 
as politicians go, is now limitless. Since our nation's earliest days, 
Americans have had misgivings about people who practice the political craft. In 
the last generation, however, the public has been inundated with books and 
shows depicting politicians as craven, corrupt, scheming, criminal parasites. 
The aggregate effect is to destroy the barriers that once restrained an 
all-too-venal press from saying anything that comes into its head about the 
occupants of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Bill Clinton hasn't helped his own cause. His and Hillary's spoof of the 
insurance industry's ad was mildly funny, but surely there were two others in 
the White House who could do it if they were going to release it to TV. A 
President who clowns for home videos invites derision. It's one thing to be a 
man of the people, another to be the slob next door. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that when the 350-pound William Howard 
Taft moved into the White House, he asked Theodore Roosevelt, who was moving 
out, if he had any advice. "Yes," Roosevelt replied, "don't let them take a 
photograph of you playing tennis, Willie." Politicians who do may drown in 
their own Whitewater.*

HOW COLOSIO CAN BE HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carlos Fuentes, Carlos Fuentes' most recent book is The Orange Tree (Farrar, 
Straus & Giroux). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico is bleeding at both extremes, on the border with Central America in 
Chiapas and on the border with the United States in Tijuana. The solution to 
violence in both places is democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, there is widespread revulsion against violence as a result of the 
assassination, in Tijuana, of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate 
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. A unanimity of opinion rarely seen in 
Mexico has condemned this act. The nation feels wounded by what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also heightened pressure to conclude the pact, agreed to in principle 
on Jan. 25 by Colosio and the leaders of the other parties, that would, for the 
first time, establish an impartial electoral authority free of the government 
and the PRI. This is the top priority for the country right now. Even before 
Colosio's assassination, this mechanism of establishing the credibility of 
elections was key to resolving the issues raised in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prickly problem of all is how to choose the PRI's new candidate. As a 
result of the assassination, the PRI, at least in the short run, has regained 
strength as the "party of stability." But the sacrifice of Colosio must mean 
some- thing. It cannot just assure the continuation of authoritarian politics, 
the politics of el dedazo , the "big finger" of the president who alone points 
to his heir. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another way, no matter how nervous it might make the financial 
markets, that must now be tried. In the PRI's statutes, it says that in the 
event the anointed candidate is unable to perform his duties because of 
sickness or death, the party should go to an open-nominating convention to 
choose a replacement. This is the PRI's big chance to pay homage to Colosio by 
democratizing the nomination process. 
</P>
<P>
 All the currents of the party should be able to openly present their programs 
and name their candidates. If this were to occur in the next two to three 
weeks, it would be a big boost for the democratic future of Mexico. Then 
Colosio's sacrifice will not have been in vain.*

OBSESSED WITH THE HUNT; ONLY THE WORD 'WATER' MAKES THESE TWO SCANDALS SIMILAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whitewater scandal is a crisis for the Clinton presidency -- and the 
country. In his first year in office, despite some well-publicized missteps, 
Bill Clinton got more major legislation through Congress than any President 
since Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his second year, the President and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton succeeded in placing health care on the national agenda, 
changing the question from whether all Americans deserved decent health care to 
how to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the President has no choice but to try to face down an angry 
press corps, the First Lady has lowered her profile almost out of view and 
health-care reform is on the endangered list. The reason is a "scandal" that 
even the President's most ardent critics acknowledge is likely much ado about 
not much. To quote one attacker, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), there may be 
"little if anything" at the core of Whitewater. "I never said I expected any 
substantial wrongdoing or any at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans believe the President and Hillary Clinton must be hiding 
something important about Whitewater. That belief is understandable, given the 
misjudgments and poor handling of the issue to date by the President's 
advisers. But hundreds of reporters working thousands of hours have found no 
smoking guns, no criminal violations, no abuse of power, nothing that would 
justify the crisis that Whitewater has become. That is both the irony and the 
tragedy of the so-called Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, President and Mrs. Clinton invested money in a real-estate 
partnership with James B. McDougal, who later headed Madison Guaranty Savings 
and Loan, an S&L that ultimately failed at taxpayer expense. Hillary Clinton, 
as an attorney in private practice, represented Madison before regulators 
appointed by her husband, the governor. Later, her law firm represented the 
government in a suit against Madison Guaranty's auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been allegations that Madison funds may have found their way into 
Whitewater, or even into the 1984 Clinton gubernatorial campaign. There have 
also been allegations the Clintons may owe taxes because their Whitewater 
losses were overstated. None of these allegations have been substantiated -- 
notwithstanding the work of hundreds of reporters. Even if they were, there has 
been no allegation that Clinton or his wife were themselves involved, or even 
aware, of any misappropriation of funds or that they intended to evade taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. James A. Leach of Iowa, ranking Republican on the House Banking 
Committee, has charged that federal regulators in Kansas City blocked further 
investigations into Madison. But, as he himself has admitted, there is no proof 
that any Clinton appointees were involved in this -- and the President has 
specifically denied they were. There are also some who have argued that Hillary 
Clinton's representation of Madison, or her firm's later representation of the 
federal government, raises ethical questions, and that the close relationships 
among Arkansas business leaders, lawyers and politicians give rise at least to 
an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas pays its governor less than California pays its prison guards. Its 
speaker of the house was, for most of his tenure, on the payroll of a poultry 
company that is one of the state's largest employers. For those who value 
ethics in politics, there is much to criticize in the way business is routinely 
done in many of the smaller -- and larger -- state capitols around the country. 
George Bush tried to make Arkansas an issue in the election. Americans chose 
Clinton, notwithstanding the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues involving the Whitewater investment and Hillary Clinton's law firm 
-- the subject of the special counsel's probe -- should not be enough to put a 
presidency in crisis. They do not involve abuse of presidential power. They do 
not involve criminal wrongdoing. They are not "high crimes" that would, under 
any circumstances, support impeachment. Unlike Watergate, unlike Iran-Contra, 
even if the President's harshest critics are justified, no claim has been 
raised of abuse of power or criminal wrongdoing by a sitting President. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be no cloud over this presidency -- at least as a matter of law. 
Indeed, it is hard to imagine what the President or Hillary Clinton could even 
be hiding with respect to these transactions that would be more damaging than 
damage they've already suffered to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who recognize that Whitewater itself is neither big enough nor important 
enough to paralyze a presidency -- and a country -- argue it is the "cover-up" 
of Whitewater, like the cover-up called Watergate, that raises questions about 
White House integrity. But there is simply no parallel between President 
Richard M. Nixon's efforts to use the CIA to thwart the investigation of the 
FBI, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman's meetings with White House 
staffers on Whitewater, or former White House Counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum's 
efforts to limit disclosure of White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altman meetings, which helped ignite the feeding frenzy that is the 
greatest scandal here, certainly created an appearance of conflict of interest, 
that the White House should always seek to avoid. But the substance of these 
meetings, unlike Watergate, had nothing to do with using one agency against 
another to protect the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman has repeatedly stated that he did no more than brief White House 
officials on the procedural rules relating to the statute of limitations on the 
Madison probe, and seek their advice as to whether he should recuse himself 
from any decisions dealing with Madison -- as he ultimately did. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has challenged Altman's version, nor his integrity. Indeed, the ethics 
officer at Treasury approved the Altman meeting -- precisely because no 
confidential information was being disclosed, no decision-making being shared, 
no influence being sought. Altman may have made an error in judgment in having 
the meetings -- but it is a far cry from the abuse of presidential power at the 
core of Watergate.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Nussbaum, his sins were political rather than legal, and he has paid 
dearly for them. The bottom line, however, is that the files have been 
disclosed, the Foster death is being excruciatingly re-investigated, and it 
remains the case -- New York tabloid wars notwithstanding -- that there is no 
basis for believing it was anything other than a tragic suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the job of the media to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by public 
officials -- particularly the most powerful leaders in our country. It is the 
job of the opposition party to police the ethics of the majority. But there is 
a difference between doing your job and just doing in a presidency for the 
rating points, or for the partisan advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the last two months, the public has been smart enough to recognize 
that health care and the economy are far more important to America than the way 
business was done in Little Rock a decade or two ago. But the constant drumbeat 
is hard to ignore. Whitewater is taking its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 If Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s investigation provides the basis for 
more serious charges against the Clintons, then they will be forced, as they 
should be, to face the consequences. But until and unless more serious charges 
are substantiated, Clinton ought to be free to pursue his substantive agenda. 
If the GOP and the press, and White House aides who have created more damage 
than they have controlled, succeed in creating enough smoke to engulf the 
Clinton presidency, then all Americans will lose.*

THERE'S MORE TO U.S.-CHINA TIES THAN HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate evoked by Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher's visit to 
Beijing has been too concerned with whether his mission had "failed" to promote 
human rights. The issue is not whether the United States should abandon its 
pursuit of human rights altogether, but how to pursue its values in balance 
with other aspects of the U.S.-China relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental motivation of U.S. human-rights policy rests deep within 
American tradition. No other nation has been so explicitly founded to vindicate 
liberty or been populated as extensively by refugees. This experience has 
infused U.S. foreign policy with a missionary quality. Other nations need to 
take this attitude seriously; to most Americans, the national interest cannot 
be separated from some concern for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, America's perception of itself as the defender of global human rights 
is so ingrained that we too often forget how unique this perspective is 
compared with the way other nations view foreign policy. Every other major 
country conceives foreign policy as the balancing of risks and rewards to 
affect the actions of others. What Americans call human rights has generally 
been deemed to fall within domestic jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 While the State Department insists that it is only pressing the Chinese 
government to live up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the fact 
remains that no other signatory of that document has invoked it in its China 
policy. In short, the U.S. human-rights approach to China elicits next to no 
support from most other governments. Not a single Asian nation supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 A prickly insistence on sovereignty is a particular attribute of the Chinese 
government. In China, Western intervention is perceived as an uninterrupted 
humiliation since the Opium Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 To base Sino-American relations entirely on Chinese progress toward human 
rights will thus mortgage both the underlying relationship as well as progress 
on human rights. It is also a distortion of reality, since U.S. objectives go 
beyond human-rights promotion. It has become commonplace to point out that 
China has the world's fastest-growing economy and that its population of more 
than 1 billion represents the single largest market. To exclude the United 
States from these prospects is not a trivial decision. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Asia is both the most dynamic region of the world and the one 
with the greatest potential to threaten world peace. Its nations have not 
developed the patterns of cooperation that emerged in Europe after World War 
II. Fostering an Asian equilibrium is therefore central to world peace and must 
be a key objective of U.S. diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and China have a parallel interest in equilibrium. China 
wants the United States to help balance its relationships with powerful 
neighbors -- Japan, Russia and India -- until it is strong enough to do so on 
its own. The United States needs Chinese cooperation on these matters and on a 
peaceful evolution of the future of Taiwan, on nuclear proliferation in North 
Korea and on the transfer of weapons technology. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the sort of issues that should be key elements of the Sino-American 
dialogue. If they moved to the center of Sino-American relationships, they 
would facilitate human-rights issues by providing a strategic context. In the 
course of their history, China's leaders have frequently taken account of the 
special needs of their counterparts provided such an action also served Chinese 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic challenge remains: If the United States' interest in China is 
primarily human rights, the tactic of public pressures is appropriate. And it 
may even work. There is, however, a high risk of trapping both sides in a 
choice between capitulation and confrontation. The Administration may be 
tempted to continue watering down its demands and its penalties until its 
apparent victories are largely public-relations exercises. The Chinese may 
repeat their self-inflicted wounds of the 1950s, when they expelled all Soviet 
advisers for being too intrusive. The victim of such a process will be the 
American-Chinese political relationship that is key to Asian stability. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative approach would not require the United States to abandon its 
reduced list of human-rights objectives, though some may have to be modified in 
the course of negotiations. It does, however, call for clear presidential 
leadership outlining U.S. purposes and strategy with respect to China. Such a 
statement needs to set forth the importance attached to U.S.-China cooperation 
in specific areas and on specific topics; it cannot merely be a shopping list 
of U.S. priorities. At the same time, such a document could emphasize the need 
for each side to take into account the special concerns of the other -- a 
phrase Beijing will surely understand as referring to U.S. human-rights 
concerns. A reduction of public pressures and a broadening of the dialogue will 
produce a solution compatible with the self-respect of both sides. 
Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 * China should understand that a concern for human rights in some form is not 
an Administration idiosyncrasy but inherent in the American value system as 
expressed in congressional pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Administration should recognize that China's interest in U.S. relations 
is based on its expectation of cooperation on global or at least Asian 
strategy. For that objective, it may well be prepared to make human-rights 
concessions, provided they can be presented as having emerged from its own 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Congress should understand that, beyond a certain point, public pressures 
tend to produce the opposite of what is intended. Congressional concern has 
been clearly demonstrated; the Administration should be permitted to pursue it 
quietly on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * The short-term objective of a renewed Sino-American dialogue should be to 
achieve sufficient progress to enable the Administration to de-link human 
rights from most-favored-nation trading status, once and for all. Afterward, 
the United States would pursue human-rights objectives in a manner compatible 
with Chinese dignity and via normal diplomatic processes within the context of 
an overall political and strategic dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 These goals are within reach provided the focus remains on fundamentals, 
especially on the importance of a constructive, long-term Sino-American 
relationship for both countries.*

WASHINGTON IS BEST CHANCE FOR PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard R. Teicher, Howard R. Teicher, author of Twin Pillars to Desert 
Storm: America's Flawed Vision in the Middle East from Nixon to Bush (Morrow), 
served on the staff of the National Security Council from 1982-87.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the face of extremist violence and undisciplined international diplomacy 
following the Hebron massacre, President Bill Clinton should be commended for 
his low-key efforts to advance peace talks in the Middle East by resisting 
pressure to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians. His diplomatic strategy seeks 
to achieve two fundamental and related goals: to work closely with Israelis and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization to implement their declaration of 
principles at the earliest possible date, and to reinvigorate Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis and Palestinians must regain their confidence in each other's desire 
to make peace in order for the U.S. strategy to succeed. To rebuild Israeli 
confidence, the PLO must live up to the commitments it made last September when 
it accepted the Declaration of Principles. It must exercise leadership in the 
occupied territories to reduce the violence against Israelis and other 
Palestinians. However much the PLO might now want to deviate from the agreed-on 
principles to gain political advantage, this would only undermine Yitzhak 
Rabin's negotiating mandate. External pressures on Jerusalem would force the 
prime minister, for domestic political reasons, to adopt a less conciliatory 
posture to avoid the appearance of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally important to rebuild Palestinian confidence, as well as Yasser 
Arafat's political strength, by beginning Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. This will enhance security and transform the psychology of 
the Palestinian people, which will help propel the process forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Once these confidence-building steps are taken, U.S. diplomacy can steer 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward resolving those issues that threaten to 
block implementation of the principles by the April 13 deadline. Though it may 
prove difficult to achieve full implementation by this date, it is important 
that the negotiating be completed and the process well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 How two symbolic issues were being negotiated before the Hebron massacre gives 
a flavor of how formal talks could proceed once resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis worry that the uncontrolled movement of people and goods across the 
Allenby Bridge, which links the West Bank to Jordan, could threaten their 
security or economy. The Palestinians argue that some control over such 
movement would demonstrate they were taking charge of their lives. To resolve 
this issue, negotiators were close to agreeing on a formula that would place a 
modest Palestinian presence on this and other bridges and at border-crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nearly resolved symbolic issue with practical implications is the size 
of the Jericho district the Palestinians would control. As a result of 
Clinton's prodding, both parties had moved toward a compromise that would leave 
more land under Palestinian control than Israel had hoped to cede. In the end, 
Rabin and Arafat will have to sign off on any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Security issues will remain the most vexing problem. Although agreement had 
been reached on the establishment of a 10,000-man Palestinian police force in 
Jericho and Gaza, its command structure, liaison arrangements and 
responsibility for protecting Israelis, as well as Palestinians, were still to 
be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 To restart formal negotiations, a change in Israeli policy on Hebron is 
crucial. A number of Jerusalem's proposals to restore civil order in the West 
Bank city are being discussed in Tunis and Cairo. Among them are the 
establishment of a municipal Palestinian police force and joint 
Israeli-Palestinian patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the best of intentions, outside intervention cannot resolve these 
issues. Although pressure on Israel to accept a Bosnia-like international force 
to protect Palestinians continues, Washington opposes the idea. Israel has 
agreed to a temporary presence of lightly armed international observers, which 
would enhance security and bolster the confidence of Palestinians. Talks are 
under way to determine who should be invited, how many, and what would be their 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 More difficult for Rabin is what to do about the settlers in Hebron. Outlawing 
extremist settler groups was a necessary first step. But more decisive actions 
are required. Rabin has asserted that imposing a curfew on 110,000 Arabs to 
protect 450 Israelis has produced violence and civil unrest, not stability. 
Accordingly, the Israeli prime minister is trying to build domestic support for 
the more drastic measure of removing the settlers. A pledge from him to do so 
down the road may satisfy Arafat's need for an Israeli concession on this 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The second goal of U.S. diplomacy -- promoting negotiations between Israel and 
its other Arab negotiating partners, most notably Syria -- also must clear many 
diplomatic hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Declaration of Principles, Rabin told Clinton that the Israeli 
public could not accommodate the psychological strains that parallel 
negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights would produce. But during his 
meeting with Clinton on March 15, Rabin signaled that he is now ready to engage 
in serious negotiations with the Syrians. U.S. diplomats have passed along 
Rabin's remarks to their Syrian counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 During their recent meeting, Syrian President Hafez Assad went a long way 
toward persuading Clinton that his country is ready to negotiate and conclude a 
full treaty with Israel. But Assad's continuing acquiescence to Hezbollah's 
attacks against Israeli positions in southern Lebanon raises questions about 
Syria's true intentions. The United States is trying to persuade Damascus that 
its statements and behavior are key to creating a political atmosphere in 
Israel supportive of a trade of land for peace in the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 If implementation of the Declaration of Principles helps restore stability and 
calm in the occupied territories, Israel's propensity for risk-taking in 
negotiations with Syria will increase. Conversely, failure could easily lead to 
the fall of the Israeli government. In such circumstances, the only winners 
would be the opponents of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this outcome, Washington must work to preserve the process that began 
in Madrid and lead the parties back to the negotiating table. This policy, 
which Clinton is pursuing, offers the best hope for achieving a lasting 
resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict.*

AMES AFFAIR BLURS THE CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCLES OF INTELLIGENCE; SPIES: A SOVIET 
AGENT OPERATING WITHIN THE CIA NOW FORCES ANALYSTS TO RETRACE MANY TREACHEROUS 
PASSAGES DOWN THE HALL OF MIRRORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Powers, Thomas Powers, a contributing editor to Opinion, is the 
author of The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA (Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Soviet fears of a U.S. first strike in the early 1980s that apparently 
led to their recruitment of Aldrich Hazen Ames, a 30-year veteran of the CIA's 
clandestine services, nearly a decade ago. The arrest of Ames and his 
Columbian-born wife, Maria del Rosario Casas, in February revealed a long 
hemorrhage of secrets -- the worst by far, if allegations are true, in the 
agency's 45-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive buildup of U.S. nuclear arms early in President Ronald Reagan's 
first term, combined with Reagan's characterization of the Soviet Union as an 
"evil empire," evidently convinced the KGB that "the threat of outbreak of a 
nuclear war has reached dangerous proportions." The result was a blizzard of 
top-secret memos from Moscow to agents in the field -- to gather information on 
U.S. military preparations and, above all, to recruit well-placed spies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructions to field officers in November, 1983, from Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, 
who was later KGB chief from 1988 until the failed hard-line coup attempt of 
1991, ended the Soviet intelligence agency's long-fabled parsimony in rewarding 
agents. He urged "bolder use of material incentives." The new policy, described 
in a collection of documents published by the KBG defector Oleg A. Gordievsky 
and his British co-author, helps explain the unprecedented sums allegedly paid 
to Ames beginning in May, 1985 -- more than $2.5 million, according to FBI and 
CIA investigators. By way of contrast, the KGB paid only $3,000 for the 
super-secret technical manual describing the KH-11 spy satellite, purchased 
from William Kampiles, a disgruntled former CIA officer, in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The KH-11 was a mainstay of the CIA's system of reconnaissance satellites, 
used to keep track of Soviet missile deployments and other military 
preparations. The KGB's possession of the manual for more than a year before 
the CIA even discovered it was missing told the Soviets just what the Americans 
could see from space -- and, therefore, how to hide whatever they wanted to 
keep secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of the satellite manual, among other things, convinced some U.S. 
intelligence analysts that the Soviets had embarked on a major, long-term 
effort to deceive the United States about the capabilities, and especially the 
accuracy, of its missile force. 
</P>
<P>
 This, in turn, helped prompt Reagan and his national-security advisers to 
embark on the strategic buildup that so alarmed the KGB in the early 1980s and 
led to the agent-recruiting frenzy that eventually landed Ames. He has been 
charged with betraying more secrets of greater importance than any other spy in 
U.S. history -- with the possible exception of Benedict Arnold, who attempted 
to betray the fortress at West Point to the British during the Revolutionary 
War. This tortured circle of action and reaction is characteristic of the 
eternal intelligence war that is business-as-usual in relations among sovereign 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Ames worth $2.5 million, when the KH-11 manual commanded only 
$3,000? The answer again comes from one of the documents spirited off by the 
KGB defector Gordievsky. "It must always be remembered," said a report of a 
January, 1984, meeting of leading KGB officials in Moscow, "that the chief 
means of ensuring that the security of intelligence operations is protected is, 
and has always been, agent penetration of the other side's intelligence and 
counterintelligence agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 This was no sudden enthusiasm of the KGB but a guiding principle of Soviet 
intelligence efforts since the Russian Revolution in 1917. The arrest of Ames 
simply made the CIA the most recent in a long line of red-faced Western 
intelligence agencies to suffer the public humiliation of penetration in the 
inner-most of inner sanctums. Ames' most sensitive post was chief of the 
counterintelligence branch of the Central Intelligence Agency's Soviet-East 
European division, from 1983 through 1985. The British in the 1950s, with the 
Harold Kim Philby case, and the West Germans in the 1960s, with the Hans Felfe 
case, both experienced the same shock: discovery that a chief of 
counterintelligence for operations targeting the Soviet Union had been working 
for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Soviets got from Ames was a list of names -- at least 10, according 
to an FBI affidavit -- of Soviet agents working for the CIA between 1985 and 
1990. Five had been assigned to the Soviet Embassy or consular offices in the 
United States, where they had been recruited by the FBI -- a fact that helps 
explain the current Washington rumor about smoldering resentment between the 
FBI and the CIA. One, code-named "Prologue," was himself a counterintelligence 
officer for the KGB's Second Chief Directorate, allegedly betrayed by Ames in 
December, 1990. Another, code-named "Motorboat," was an officer of an East 
European security service said to have been betrayed by Ames in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorboat may have played a more central role in the Ames case than as yet 
confirmed by officials. According to news accounts, soon after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall in November, 1989, the CIA obtained a roster of intelligence agents 
run against the West by the Stasi, the East German intelligence agency. 
Analysis of the roster revealed a disturbing fact: All the agents recruited 
among Stasi officers by the CIA over the years were, in fact, double agents -- 
working for the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
 This fact, combined with the immediate disappearance of Motorboat, who appears 
to have been the CIA source for the roster, was a classic example of what 
counterintelligence analysts call "interference" -- evidence the other side 
knows things it is not supposed to know. In any event, the Stasi case prompted 
a combined FBI-CIA investigation that finally zeroed in on Ames in the spring 
of 1993, and led to his arrest in February because authorities found reason to 
fear that he and his wife were planning to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Ames case are the outlines of a compelling human drama. 
Ames' father, a former history professor and an alcoholic who often disappeared 
on binges, also worked for the CIA. Like his son, he left little impression 
behind him. Carleton Ames, a onetime case officer in Burma, also worked in 
counterintelligence -- as a historian of Soviet intelligence for the CIA's 
central counterintelligence staff run by James J. Angleton. Angleton was a 
legend (depending on whom you ask) for keeping Soviet penetrations out of the 
agency during his watch as Central Intelligence chief (1954-1974), or for his 
crazy suspicions that the Soviets were manipulating Western intelligence 
operations worldwide with the help of a mole (never found) in the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich Ames is certainly not the mole Angleton sought, with sometimes 
disastrous result, for so many years. It is also unlikely (but not 100% 
impossible) that Carleton Ames' brief stint on the CI staff would have given 
him access to the information Angleton was sure was leaking to the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you finding this difficult to follow? Imagine the chore facing security 
analysts who must now re-examine the loyalty of every CIA official who ever 
knew Ames or sent him a memo over a nine-year period. Meanwhile, 
counterintelligence analysts must painstakingly parse old cases to determine if 
things really happened the way we once thought they did. One additional case 
may suggest the dimensions of this task. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1985, the KGB officer Vitaly A. Yurchenko defected to the 
United States. The CIA was so thrilled with his information that it even 
arranged a meeting for Yurchenko with William J. Casey, Reagan's first director 
of the CIA. Among the nuggets of pure gold provided by Yurchenko were the names 
of two KGB agents in the United States: Ronald W. Pelton, working for the 
code-breakers at the National Security Agency, and Edward Lee Howard, a former 
CIA officer who soon bolted for the Soviet Union. Howard was a great discovery; 
it explained the disappearance of several Soviet agents working for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Yurchenko changed his mind, walked out of a Georgetown restaurant, 
where he was dining with a CIA handler, and redefected to the Soviet Embassy. 
Yurchenko said he'd been drugged and kidnaped; he soon returned to Moscow with 
a Russian embassy officer, Valery Martynov. The CIA said it had been a case of 
two genuine defections, and Yurchenko's "pure gold," as it was called at the 
time, was genuine. Now we learn that: a) Martynov was a spy for the Americans, 
recruited by the FBI, and that he was never seen again; and b) one of 
Yurchenko's debriefers at CIA headquarters was the CI branch chief, Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 The real significance of the Yurchenko case is only one of many mysteries 
raised by the Ames affair. Another is the meaning, if any, of Ames' visit to 
the former Soviet republic of Georgia last spring, allegedly to investigate the 
international narcotics traffic. Soon after, a high-ranking CIA official was 
murdered along a Georgia road. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders sometimes wonder, understandably, if the circles within circles of 
counterintelligence are worth the time and trouble of grown men -- especially 
now, after the end of the Cold War. The answer, taken as gospel by intelligence 
officers, is that an intelligence service is more danger than help if it is not 
known to be secure; and that the security of an intelligence service can never 
be protected by guards, fences and locks. That can be established only by the 
close embrace of an opposing service -- ideally by placing one of your men at 
the heart of the enemy effort to do the same to yourself. The sad case of 
Prologue proves the Americans can do this. Now the Ames case suggests the 
Russians do it better.*

UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE FOR AMERICA? DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE IT; POLITICAL 
FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If and when a health-care reform bill is passed, will it contain universal 
coverage? The Times asked health-care analysts, economists and politicians. 
Alain C. Enthoven 
</P>
<P>
 Professor, Stanford University Graduate School of Business. It will put us on 
a path that will eventually -- in six to eight years -- get to universal 
coverage, provided we define universal coverage reasonably. By that, I mean 
something like 95%. There will always be some people whose lifestyles and 
behavior do not fit in with enrollment in a health plan -- the homeless and 
some young people who never believe they ever will be sick. There will always 
have to be a public-provider system of last resort. I presume undocumented 
aliens will not be covered by this plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The political forecast was compiled by Therese K. Lee. Peter C. Goldmark, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 President, Rockefeller Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, because that's the political imperative everybody agrees on. Whatever 
passes, there will be a conspiracy among Democrats and Republicans not to plot 
out its costs honestly.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be passed with some salami-like phases, and that will make the 
political victory for everyone a lot more diminished. During the 1990s, we'll 
be in an almost continuous agony of health reform. It was served up like an 
Epiphany, but it will be dragged out like a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew E. Altman 
</P>
<P>
 President, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation It will be said that it does 
offer universal coverage, and the country will have a big debate about whether 
it does. We are heading for the great health-care reform finesse that will 
phase in universal coverage. This will allow the President to claim victory. It 
will also allow his critics to claim they dramatically modified the President's 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The questions are: What are the details? How long to phase it in? Will the 
phases be written into the statute or left to future actions? 
</P>
<P>
 Warren B. Rudman 
</P>
<P>
 Former GOP senator, New Hampshire, and co-chair of the Concord Coalition Not 
now. The cost is higher than anybody is willing to assume. You cannot pick up 
costs of coverage for 35 million people and figure they will be absorbed by 
osmosis. Without any new taxes, I don't see how you're going to fund universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Helms 
</P>
<P>
 Director of health-policy studies, American Enterprise Institute. No. But 
there are lots of ways that people will make it look like we are getting 
universal coverage. We will not be able to pass universal coverage because of 
economics. You've got to pass tax increases or hide taxes through some kind of 
mandates, such as employer mandates. You would have to have huge government 
subsidies to get universal coverage, and I don't think Congress can afford it.  
</P>
<P>
 Steven A. Schroeder 
</P>
<P>
 A physician, president of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. I think we'll get 
there eventually, but whether it's in 1994 is not clear to me. Most political 
leaders support universal care, yet everybody seems to find problems with 
specific ways to get there and it adds up to implicitly favoring the status 
quo. But this issue is something that's not going to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Eddy 
</P>
<P>
 Former Duke University professor and informal member of the Jackson Hole 
Group, he served on Hillary Rodham Clinton's health-care task force. I think it 
will be universal in some form. However, it's impossible to say at this time 
exactly how comprehensive and how universal it truly will be and how long it 
will take to phase in. There's a basic desire to have everyone covered, but it 
will be very expensive. It's a political question. And the process is very 
difficult to predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hadley 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Center for Health Policy Studies, Georgetown University School of 
Medicine. I would like to believe that the President's promise to veto a bill 
that doesn't have real universal care is a real promise. But he seems to be a 
compromiser. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be hard to pass a bill that has strong cost-control elements in it. The 
way the process will get around that is by phasing in cost controls and then 
universal coverage at a later date.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; MANUEL CAMACHO; THE NEGOTIATOR ON CHIAPAS 
NAVIGATES MEXICO'S DANGEROUS SHOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sergio Munoz, Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo, The Times' 
weekly Spanish-language edition. He interviewed Manuel Camacho Solis in his 
office near the Mexican White House. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan. 1, shots were fired in Chiapas, in southern Mexico. The grandchildren of 
Emiliano Zapata -- Indians, peasants, the dispossessed -- had taken up arms, 
demanding land, liberty and justice. Surprised by this military action, 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari responded in kind. Yet, the Zapatistas held 
the moral high ground, and public opinion turned in their favor. So two shrewd 
political minds -- Salinas and his old friend, Manuel Camacho Solis -- combined 
to shift the battle from its military context to the political realm. 
</P>
<P>
 But political violence broke out again Wednesday, when Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
the leading presidential candidate, was assassinated in Tijuana. This left 
Mexico's ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, with the task of 
selecting a new candidate. It is not expected to be Camacho, who had already 
been passed over for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Salinas had asked Camacho to deal with the situation in Chiapas. 
He valued his friend's astute political instincts and his smooth negotiating 
skills and, in early January, appointed him peace commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 While working toward an agreement, Camacho's political star has been rising. 
For a while, it looked as if he would challenge his party's official candidate 
in the Aug. 21 national elections. But early last week, Camacho, 47, ended the 
speculation -- declaring he would not run for the presidency this year. He 
pointed out, during an interview several days before Colosio was shot, that 
with the conflict in Chiapas unresolved, he still has a job to do. Asked to 
choose between a candidacy for the presidency and working toward a dignified 
peace, Camacho said he would always choose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho, a widower, graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of 
International Affairs. An acknowledged political scholar, he has written 
extensively on the need to modernize the PRI. He has a cool, analytical mind 
and acts in a self-assured manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to forgo the presidency now does not mean Camacho's political career 
is over. In fact, by waiting six years, he cannot be seen as capitalizing on 
the tragedy of Colosio's death. For Camacho is sowing the seeds for Mexico's 
political future -- one that includes democratic procedures and viable parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Has there been an agreement to end the conflict in Chiapas, as some 
people in the government have said, or is Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos 
right when he says that is not the case? Have you reached an agreement with the 
Zapatistas?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Subcommander Marcos is right. We must make a clear distinction between 
an agreement and a negotiation. In San Cristobal, we exchanged a list of 
demands and proposed an answer that could establish the foundations for a 
series of political commitments toward a dignified peace. Until this is 
approved by their constituency, we cannot move on to the next issue -- the 
agreements. In Mexico City, the solution is on the right track because there is 
political agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe this conflict can be solved politically?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I not only believe the issue can be solved politically, but I also believe 
that if it is not done politically, there will be no solution in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At the bottom of the Chiapas conflict lies a human-rights problem. 
Shouldn't Mexico address this by creating and enforcing a human-rights policy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the last few years, through the work of the church and local and 
international human-rights organizations, human rights in Mexico has become a 
cause for the civil society. There is also the work of the National Commission 
on Human Rights, which has helped to stop many abuses. It has been precisely 
the presence of all these forces that contributed to stopping the dynamics of 
conflict in Chiapas, and they play an important role in the political solution 
being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The ancestral inequalities that characterize Mexico can be seen most 
clearly in places like Chiapas. How much longer will it take until a 
substantial change occurs and the people's demands are met?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The list of demands that the EZLN (Zapatista Army of National Liberation) 
made were so tough they did not allow for compromise. It was an intellectual 
challenge to create a satisfactory public-policy response to the EZLN -- given 
their specific mind-set, social reality and tough political demands. We are 
facing the challenge of creating respect and equality for the indigenous 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 It touches on agrarian reform, because it seeks to satisfy the most urgent 
land demands in a place where there is not enough land to give away.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a matter of justice, because we must establish a procedure that 
allows the communities to participate in the selection of judges and the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 This issue changes reality in the communities, because the main reason for the 
outburst of violence were the abuses of the authorities against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your impression of Subcommander Marcos?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Up until now, he's followed through with everything he said he would do. 
And when you participate in a political-military organization like the EZLN, 
and you have that political sensibility and the responsibility to accomplish 
it, then, I think, you are facing a person with exceptional political 
attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Don Samuel is a man who has worked for the same cause for 32 years, and has 
never gotten tired. He is a man of proven convictions, exceptional intellect 
and sensitivity. His message is sometimes radical -- due to the contrast 
between the needs of the people and the realities they face in Chiapas. He's a 
traditional, 16th-Century bishop continuing in the defense of the Indians, and 
an efficient 20th-Century mediator in this conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In one speech, you said, "The democratic transition (in Mexico) should be 
guaranteed." What do you mean?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In every process of democratic change, the guarantee factor is a must if it 
is to succeed. If there are no guarantees, all the sectors that provided the 
past political equilibrium oppose change. Given these guarantees, change does 
not disrupt either the political stability or the economic one. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your critics say there are two Camachos. One who accepted the rules of the 
game after the announcement of Colosio's candidacy, and another that wants to 
change the rules after Chiapas. Is this criticism valid?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have always thought of politics as institutional. For 20 years, I have 
written about ways to reform the institutional life in Mexico. We have seen the 
great risks run when change does not come accompanied by institutional reform. 
We should reinforce the institutions so that they can respond better to the new 
political and social realities of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is a quote from Colosio, saying: "Camacho played according to the 
rules and all of us who want to be candidates must play by those rules." The 
criticism is that you are not following the rules.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Times are changing in Mexico! We must adapt the rules to the times that 
have already changed! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Give one example of the changes.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The legal and constitutional reforms of the Federal Electoral Institute, 
and the new autonomy it has, make an impartial election possible. That is a 
change of the rules! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Another change of the rules would be to admit international observers to 
monitor the elections. Do you like this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I believe we Mexicans should take care of the Mexican political processes. 
We have a civil society that is strong enough to guarantee it. We must 
reinforce the necessary institutions and be open to the world. The legitimacy 
of the process must come from the acceptance of the Mexican people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But there seems to be a problem of credibility in Mexican elections.  
</P>
<P>
 A: This problem must be understood at two levels: the political forces and the 
conscience of the citizens. The political forces must learn to accept the 
results of the elections to improve our democratic life. The citizens' 
conscience presents a profound cultural problem that has incubated for decades. 
The solution will come with time -- if it is accompanied by a process of civics 
formation and political participation that can really transform the citizens' 
conscience so they demand absolute cleanliness in the process and be able to 
recognize it when it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have spoken of "guaranteeing the possibilities of political 
competitiveness." What do you mean?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That means there should be no preference for any political force within the 
IFE, equal access to the media, limits to campaign financing. We should have a 
political regime that guarantees competitiveness and stability and allows 
society to have the representation it demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe you have to adapt the globalization of the economy to the 
realities of Mexican poverty?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Chiapas has shown us that the changes in the Mexican economy -- which were 
necessary, given the economic globalization -- have to take into account not 
only the effects they are having on the people, but also to register those 
sectors that have not been incorporated into the new dynamic of change and 
bring them in. Market forces won't solve this problem. We need to compensate 
this truly poor region of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But isn't that a return to the failed statist policies of the past?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Clearly, the subsidy policies of the old bureaucracies have failed. But 
simply fixing the macro will not bring about change. If we don't help those 
underdeveloped regions within the framework of NAFTA (the North American Free 
Trade Agreement) and the global economy, they will pay the costs of globalism 
without any of the benefits. But if we deliberately institute a policy of work 
creation -- small factories for 100 workers spread across 100 communities in 
Chiapas for which there is already a market through NAFTA -- well, that changes 
the economic condition of thousands and thousands of Indians. No investor will 
ever go by himself to these communities, and that is precisely the fundamental 
role the government can play. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what would that role be?  
</P>
<P>
 A: To ease the transition process, to fiscally support a part of the process, 
to build infrastructure, to retrain the workers, to assist with marketing and 
commercialization and provide counseling. The government has to offer 
incentives for the investor to venture there instead of into the 
already-developed cities. It also has to become a bridge, a promoter for 
investment where the private sector does not dare to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The government must open possibilities for the Indians to have their own 
businesses. Without a deliberate policy of job creation and improvement of the 
levels of productivity in the poorest regions of Mexico, the disparity will 
keep growing and this will lead to conflict and violence. Without properly 
functioning national states, there is no way to translate the global benefits 
into local benefits. Only a democratic government that can respond to the 
priorities established by society can re-establish equilibrium and prosperity 
in these societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe the confrontation with Colosio will force you to break away 
from your party?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The PRI is such a big political reality in Mexico that unless you take it 
into account, there can be no change. That enormous political organization has 
to have a way out, and I do not believe that the solution is simply to confront 
it or alienate it. No, we must establish new rules where the PRI and the 
opposition parties all have their own space. What we need is to build up a new 
order in the party system and stop the breakdown of the one in place now. In 
this sense I have no conflict with the PRI; I am looking for a scenario in 
which the PRI and all the other parties can fit.*

SUPERFUND CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As someone who was raised in El Monte and was constantly repulsed by the 
cloud swirling in every glass of tap water, I must thank Frank Clifford for his 
article on the EPA's Superfund "efforts" in the San Gabriel Valley (March 19). 
</P>
<P>
 The true tragedy is that the population of the area continues to surge as the 
EPA and local businesses fight over the cleanup costs.Although some small 
businesses may be unfairly burdened, surely most of those cited should accept a 
larger share of the blame than the average citizen. 
</P>

<P>
 * The difficulty of placing the blame for the contaminated San Gabriel Valley 
aquifer, assigning the costs of cleanup, and the burden this places on small 
businesses points up the need for a better way of dealing with this costly 
public health problem. One approach that reflects the realities of toxic 
chemical usage might be to fund Superfund and ongoing toxic waste disposal 
programs with a tax placed on the very chemicals that are the source of the 
problem. This would do two very positive things: It would give chemical 
manufacturers and their customers a strong incentive to develop less toxic 
alternatives, and it could make it less costly for small business to comply 
with proper disposal practices. While this might add to the cost of products 
and services that are dependent on these chemicals, in the long run it is far 
cheaper to society if we reduce the need for toxics at the source or pay for 
proper disposal rather than to try to clean them up once they are in the soil 
or aquifer.

SERIES ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gabriel Rotello's two-part article "Perspective on AIDS" (Commentary, March 
9-10) is a candid and rare departure on the grim realities of AIDS that the gay 
community has, for the large part, stubbornly chosen to ignore while publicly 
proclaiming otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of AIDS to gay men and lesbians have become too high.First, HIV, the 
spread of which gays have an enormous amount of control over if they so choose, 
has taken emotional and fund-raising precedence over the traditional civil 
rights issues of child custody, job/housing and partner rights. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS in the gay community does not just "happen" -- it is the predictable 
outcome of denial being practiced on the grandest of scales, co-opting the gay 
liberation movement into an AIDS movement and giving yet more fodder to 
right-wing religious hysteria. Finger-pointing at the government for not having 
discovered a cure for AIDS (unlikely no matter what anybody says) and clamoring 
for even more dollars make about as much sense as having alcoholics lobbying 
the government for a cure against cirrhosis so that they can continue to abuse 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we who argue for responsible sexuality, whether gay, lesbian or straight, 
the ones who are homophobic, or is it those whose rejection of moderation has 
resulted in a historically unique form of mass suicide?

LET'S LOOK AT THIS ONE MORE TIME, OK?; D.A.'S BUDGET LOOKS LIKE A WALKING 
TRAUMA UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti says he has no choice but to disband the 
special attorney team designed to aggressively attack workplace safety, 
environmental violations and major fraud, effectively ending local prosecutions 
of these crimes. This is Garcetti's latest attempt to cope with the combined 
effects of dwindling county funds and an expected jump in violent-felony 
prosecutions resulting from the state's new "three strikes and you're out" law, 
which mandates life imprisonment for repeat felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday county attorneys stopped filing new cases involving occupational 
safety and health violations and environmental crimes. In the coming months, 
the nine attorneys who have staffed this special unit will be reassigned to 
handle street crime cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both the city attorney and the state attorney general could take up 
the baton in this area, it is unlikely either will do so. Neither has the 
staff, expertise or budget. Most probably, felony prosecutions of these crimes 
largely will cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there really no other choice? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, prosecution of violent crimes, even without a "three strikes" law, 
must be a high priority for any district attorney. But this is true also for 
white-collar fraud and workplace and environmental safety violations. The L.A. 
County D.A.'s office has earned an impressive reputation for its aggressive 
prosecution of these crimes. The D.A.'s Environmental Crimes/OSHA Division 
(ECOD) was the first special unit of its kind in the nation to pursue felony 
prosecutions. It is now the nation's largest regional environmental crime unit, 
having handled more than 400 cases since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, these prosecutorial efforts have not only increased compliance with 
workplace and environmental safety laws but also generated $13 million for the 
state and county through fines and restitution. Last year, for example, oil 
companies paid a total of $900,000 as a result of ECOD prosecutions. The team 
has obtained felony convictions, carrying prison terms, for Smog Check fraud, 
asbestos exposure and exposure of many thousands of people to airborne lead. An 
industrial death or life-threatening injury occurs every three days in the 
county; the ECOD has investigated each accident to find whether criminal 
negligence was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti says that to meaningfully pursue these crimes he needs additional 
county funds to hold together this and other special units. But county 
supervisors, some of whom are annoyed with Garcetti for budget overruns and 
past threats to cease certain misdemeanor prosecutions, say that every county 
agency is suffering and that there are no additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 172, passed last November, made permanent a half-cent state sales 
tax and dedicated that revenue to public safety purposes. Garcetti says that 
although the Board of Supervisors duly has disbursed Proposition 172 revenues 
to his and other law enforcement agencies, it plans to withhold an equal amount 
of property tax revenue that in the past went to his office and give it to 
other strapped county departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Garcetti, like all department heads, must live within his budget. But 
surely there is room to maneuver here, especially when the unit at risk 
generates revenue and encourages broad compliance with vital health and safety 
laws.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday a promising proposal surfaced involving representatives of 
environmental and industry groups. The suggestion is that these groups work 
with Garcetti and other officials to seek solutions to this impasse. It's hard 
to believe that creative minds can't work something out soon.

DR. LUCILE JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the letter March 15 discussing Dr. Lucile Jones' testimony in 
Washington and the "missing" quakes: 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' comments on the normal aftershock series in the Northridge quake are 
not in conflict with comments regarding future quake risks in Southern 
California. Everything she has stated in regard to the "missing" quakes is 
quite consistent with her other public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing solely the existing and expected aftershock sequence of a 
particular quake in a particular locale in no way implies the level of seismic 
risk (or lack of it) for the entire Los Angeles Basin or on a distinctly 
different fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case too little knowledge apparently has confused the reader's 
understanding. The reader's confusion leads her to describe what she believes 
to be inconsistencies in Jones' statements. I disagree. Knowledge about the 
seismic risks in our area has advanced tremendously in the last 10 years, and 
what is known is readily available to those who are willing to relinquish their 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
 It particularly troubles me that an accusing finger has been pointed at such a 
dedicated, forthright and refreshingly honest scientist like Jones, who seems 
strikingly candid and is always quick to point out the limits of current 
knowledge in this growing scientific field of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that there is no hard evidence that stress has been increased or 
decreased along the San Andreas fault does not mean we should be reassured. It 
simply means we cannot conclusively prove what every working scientist and 
earthquake professional know is coming: more and bigger quakes.

A RAPE IN SACRAMENTO; ANTI-SMOKING BILL IS RAVAGED BY AMENDMENTS BACKED BY THE 
TOBACCO LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tobacco industry, working through some of its chums in the Legislature, 
had just a few modest amendments it wanted added to a bill by Assemblyman Terry 
B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) to ban smoking in almost all indoor workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, it favored a provision to forbid local governments from adopting 
anti-smoking laws stronger than those passed by the Legislature. That 
preemption would concentrate all legal controls over smoking in Sacramento, 
where the tobacco industry's big bucks can most easily buy favors, while 
killing scores of good, strong health-protecting municipal bans on smoking, 
including one in Los Angeles. A second change would let restaurants allow 
smoking in 25% of their space for at least two years while Cal/OSHA, which is 
supposed to concern itself with protecting the health and safety of workers, 
tried to figure out what standard to adopt to protect nonsmokers, restaurant 
employees and customers alike. Both amendments passed the Senate Judiciary 
Committee -- we'll tell you who voted for them below -- leading the lobbyist 
for the American Lung Assn. to remark, not inaccurately, that "this bill has 
just been raped." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friedman bill -- AB 13 -- is not just another idea for legislation about 
whose fate most Californians can afford to be indifferent. It addresses, quite 
literally, issues of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 To review the basics: Smoking causes cancer. It is a major contributor to 
heart disease and strokes. It kills close to half a million American smokers 
year in and year out. It kills thousands of others who have never smoked by 
exposing them to the carcinogens and toxins produced by people who do. Last 
month the Journal of the American Medical Assn. reported that secondhand smoke 
can affect fetuses. These are not obscure medical facts; all have been widely 
reported. They are known to the Legislature. Only the willfully obtuse or the 
cynically venal would ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of which, it is time to call the roll of supporters of the two 
destructive amendments added to AB 13. Sens. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) 
and Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) were sponsors of the amendments and each voted 
for both. On the state preemption provision they were joined by Bill Lockyer 
(R-Hayward) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). On restaurant smoking, they had 
help from Robert Presley (D-Riverside), Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), Rob 
Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and Wright. These are public officials with whom we 
often agree, but on this one they all ought to be ashamed of themselves. As it 
happens, Torres, Presley and Wright are candidates for statewide offices this 
year. At every campaign stop citizens should ask them to explain their 
appalling vote.

GUIDING STAR FOR ECONOMIC PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've heard the cliche many times: Whoever leaves last, would you please turn 
out the lights? Sometimes, one gets the impression that the last person to 
leave California for greener pastures surely will be the slowest-moving person 
on Earth, so massive and determined is the exodus from this almost biblically 
plagued state. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, of course, people always come and go from California, and if today 
the net balance favors, say, Colorado or Arizona, then just wait a few years 
down the road and the trendy national magazines will be writing about the "new" 
migration to California ("Golden Again: California's Astonishing Comeback"). 
However, measured perspective and balanced introspection are not qualities the 
American character is famous for. Which is all the more reason that a new 
study, "Project California: A Blueprint for Energizing California's Economic 
Recovery," is so welcome and powerfully timely. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1992, Project California -- a collaborative effort among the 
state's industrial, labor and academic leaders -- now has its second large 
statement. The document amounts to a model -- a sort of five- or 10-year plan, 
really -- for building economic development initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Project California posits, thematically, action agendas for six areas of 
economic development that, taken altogether, represent an economic survival kit 
for California. The points on the economic hexagon are (1) advanced 
telecommunications, (2) intelligent vehicle highway systems, (3) command, 
control and communications for public transit vehicles and systems, (4) 
electric vehicles and ultra-low-emission vehicles, (5) Maglev (high-speed rail) 
research, development and demonstration, (6) fuel-cell research and 
development. Project California maintains that the state's business and 
political leaders should put more of their effort into these six areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Headed by such experienced and successful captains of industry as former 
Lockheed Chairman Roy A. Anderson and former Hughes Aircraft Chairman Malcolm 
Currie, Project California flatly states that its detailed blueprint could, by 
the year 2010, create 400,000 new jobs in the field of advanced transportation 
alone. (Copies of the report are available from the California Council on 
Science and Technology, 100 Academy Drive, Irvine, Calif. 92715.) 
</P>
<P>
 The term industrial policy has, in some circles, the highly negative 
connotation of being all too government-centered. But when taken to mean making 
wise decisions now in order to create a stronger economy for our children, the 
term loses much of its devilish hue. This authoritative report is really an 
industrial policy for California -- in the best sense of that term.

MORE WOMEN IN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It's not enough to hire more women cops ("Why We Need More Women Cops," by 
Zev Yaroslavsky, Commentary, March 21). Police agencies need to adopt a 
zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and harassment. One with teeth. To 
reach that lofty goal requires a concrete commitment from the top, not mere lip 
service and promises of increased hiring goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Women officers have clearly demonstrated the capability to excel at law 
enforcement, yet still must face the formidable barrier created by a hostile 
working environment. Sheer numbers of women in the police force will not remedy 
the problem so long as management tacitly condones unacceptable behavior with a 
"wink and a nod." First we must correct the organizational roadblocks through 
education and discipline, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In my experience, women officers find it far easier (and more job-related) to 
scale a six-foot wall than to navigate the artificial hurdles erected within 
the law enforcement profession.

 * Females officers in the LAPD (March 17) and FBI (March 12) are filing 
lawsuits and crying in City Council hearings about male colleagues who sexually 
harassed them "for years." 
</P>
<P>
 These women don't get it. When someone shoves your face in his crotch or 
fondles you without permission, you need to do some damage. Otherwise word gets 
around that you're fair game. 
</P>
<P>
 As any parent of a bullied child can attest, the only permanent solution is to 
teach the child to stand up for himself. Similarly, the only permanent solution 
to sexual harassment is for females to start running their own interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect cannot be mandated, it must be earned. In law enforcement, where your 
life is on the line on a daily basis, respect boils down to "who can you trust 
to watch your back?" A man is never going to trust a female to watch his back 
if she can't even keep him from molesting her.

PERSPECTIVE ON EMPLOYMENT; MEET THE NIMBLE NEW MIDDLE CLASS; LIFETIME FACTORY 
JOBS MAY BE DEAD, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN KEEP TECHNOLOGY HUMMING ARE IN THE 
CATBIRD SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT B. REICH, Robert B. Reich is U.S. labor secretary.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A generation ago, most Americans could expect to find decent work right out of 
high school, and many could hold the same job until retirement. It helped to be 
white and male, of course, but the economic boom after World War II created 
millions of good jobs. And these jobs, in turn, created a huge market for the 
products made by the people in the good jobs. Mass production spawned the great 
American middle class; the middle class fueled mass production. 
</P>
<P>
 That old economy is disappearing and, as usual, Californians face the future 
first. The recession, corporate downsizing (like Pacific Telesis' recent 
decision to cut 10,000 jobs) and shrinking defense budgets have dominated the 
economic news, but they mask a deeper trend. High volume is giving way to high 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Low production costs no longer depend on large scale. Through computer-aided 
design, engineering and fabrication, products can be tailored to the wants of 
small groups of customers without much additional cost. Automobiles, magazines, 
even computer chips can be made to order. The real value comes in discovering 
who wants what and getting it to them quickly. Good jobs go to people who 
continuously identify unmet needs and then figure out profitable ways to meet 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 And as mass production disappears, the old middle class is following in its 
path. High-paying, low-skilled jobs are vanishing. Well-educated people are 
doing reasonably well. (Yes, it's true that platoons of engineers, scientist, 
advertising executives and management consultants are still out of work. But as 
the economy recovers from its recessionary blues, most of them will get back on 
their feet.) It is the less educated -- those with only a high-school diploma 
or less -- who are suffering most. Their real wages have been sinking for 
years, with no end in sight. High school graduates are three times more likely 
to be unemployed than people with college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the answer? We can't turn back the clock to the safe old world of 
mass production. Nor should we. Technology offers too many benefits. Nor can we 
guarantee that every American gets a college degree. That's unrealistic, even 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The real answer, and the cause for optimism, lies in a trend just emerging 
from the occupational statistics. Look closely and you'll find a growing demand 
for technicians -- people with the skills to test, repair, upgrade and sell 
complex products. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that jobs for 
technicians will increase 37% from 1990 to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 Technician jobs often defy the established categories of the old economy, 
where "white-collar" managers oversaw the efforts of "blue-collar" line 
workers. The distinctions between blue collar and white collar are blurring, 
and out of this blur is emerging an entirely new group. These workers often 
wear ties or dresses (as did their white-collar predecessors). But they also 
often work with their hands, use tools and monitor machinery (as did their 
blue-collar predecessors). 
</P>
<P>
 They sit behind computers in factories, laboratories and office towers, 
monitoring complex equipment. They integrate and test computer systems. They 
create customized office-phone networks. They fix or replace electronic devices 
in automobiles. They do legal research. They repair copy machines. They run 
hospital tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Technician jobs usually require some education beyond high school (although 
not necessarily at a four-year college). And technicians, like all American 
workers, will need to upgrade their skills as technology and competition 
regularly reshape markets. Unlike the old world of mass production, with its 
relatively secure jobs, the new economy will require frequent, sometimes 
painful, transitions -- from old jobs to new jobs, from obsolete occupations to 
cutting-edge trades. Security will be found not by burrowing into a single job, 
but through the flexibility that comes with up-to-date skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The old educational system, geared to a mass-production economy, sent forth 
large numbers of young people ready to follow directions and perform routine 
and highly structured tasks. When the economy cycled downward and they were 
laid off, unemployment insurance tided them over until they got their jobs 
back. Today, when most workers who lose their jobs lose them forever, the old 
structures must give way to a new system of lifelong learning. That is why this 
month President Clinton announced plans to transform the unemployment system 
into a re-employment system that launches workers into new jobs. And it's why 
measures like establishing tough standards for American schools and developing 
an effective school-to-work transition system form the core of the 
Administration's economic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Today more than ever (and in California more than most places), new questions 
are testing both our policies and our imaginations. What happened to the middle 
class? It's re-emerging in our midst -- a new work force mainstay of 
problem-solving technicians, armed with the flexible skills to prosper in the 
next century. The middle class is dead; long live the middle class.

A FABLE FOR OUR TROUBLED TIMES; REBIRTH: AFTER FIRE AND RAIN, RIOTS AND QUAKES, 
A NEW AGE DAWNETH FOR MALIBITES, BEVITES.

 And in the days before the Bobbitt and the Harding, whilst mad King Rodney 
careened with his chariots down the 210 past the towers of Megiddo to the 
Valley; before King Bradley banged his head against the city's Gates whilst 
gangbangers banged elsewhere; before Michael and the Men of Endez and Heidi 
were brought low, and Riordan, Feinstein and Boxer raised on high; lo, even 
then, the Lord hardened his heart against the City of Angels, against the 
Malibites and Bevites, the Westsiders and the Valleyites; yea, even unto the 
chariot makers of Orange County and Van Nuys, and there was a scourge upon the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lord said unto the denizens of the South, behold, though ye have waged 
my battles faithfully, I shall rust thy swords and diffuse thy lasers; neither 
shall thy patriots fly true nor thy spysats see straight. For thou hast become 
too proud in thy victory -- and this Bush that burns brightly without being 
consumed, neither by Irangate nor by the vision thing, is the worst offender. 
For this, thy weapons shall become as a glut upon the market. Neither shall 
thee make batteries for thy cars nor shall thee cobble chips for Nippon. And a 
smoggy pall fell upon the land, and the hammers became still, and home equity 
became as for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lord then said unto Daryl, stretch out thy Rod and smite this man of 
Cush in the kidneys, that he might feel the billy club of G-d. But an Evil Eye 
beheld this travesty, and the people rose up in anger, and the city burned and 
gave up its treasures. And Daryl's corporals stood silent and sullen, for their 
E-mail system worked not, and they knew not of any beating or mayhem and heard 
not of this Denny. And, as the judges pondered, there was a wailing from Sou' 
Central and Simi to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lord said unto a schizoid shepherd in the hills of Moab, rise up early 
in the morning and light thy campfire and cast its sparks upon the brush, and I 
will send swarms of Santa Anas to give them succor. And the land was ruined by 
fire whilst the Malibites gnashed their teeth. But when the smoke cleared, the 
Lord hardened their hearts. And though their sages said rebuild not, for 
neither man nor beast may dwell safely in these places, they flocked back 
through the Valley of Topanga unto the waters of the Dead Sea. And though their 
wells of Perrier were tainted with benzene, and tasted as of blood, they set up 
their tents and renewed their cable service. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lord spake unto the mountains and said, take to ye handfuls of mud and 
throw these upon the proud and stubborn Malibites, that muck might bury their 
tents and clog up their Porsches. And a great rain came, and it fell 40 days 
and 40 nights, and many a screenplay and treatment was blotted out. And the 
Malibites wailed, for lo, this was worse than the Writers Guild strike.  
</P>
<P>
 And the word of the Lord went out from the bowels of the Earth saying, "Son of 
man, try this on for size." And while babes and their mothers slept; lo, even 
before the joggers became as a pestilence in the streets, there came a roar 
from the Earth, and a great quaking, and though it wasn't the Big One, it was a 
real pisser. And the Malibites delivered up their firstborn for their Evian, 
and they said, "thus plagueth the Lord our land, verily as he smote Pharoah 
only 200 years ago," for they knew not history, though they quoteth box office 
unto the 10th decimal. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the pall upon the land seemed at its darkest, and all equity was 
lost, there came out of the East a host of legions. From the empire of the 
Beltway came the princes Fema and S'Ba and Irs. And they bore gifts of grants 
and loans and deductions, and said lo, though thy sins may not be forgiven, 
fear not the cracks in thy firmaments, for verily shall be thy debts.  
</P>
<P>
 And from the wasted reaches of Miami and St. Louis came the hosts of Aetna and 
Prudential and Farmers, each bearing a piece of the rock. And they brought glad 
tidings and big bundles too, for the PR opportunities were enormous. Unto the 
stricken they said, despair not of thy deductibles, for those who have paid 
tribute shall be rewarded. And as by magic, scratched kitchen tiles became as 
gaping maws, tiny dents in the garden furniture as great detonations. 
</P>
<P>
 And though most of the people had not paid tribute to these princes, and 
received not such heaps, these riches multiplied as the stars in the sky. And 
across the land, pundits spake of a New Age. Crystals and Powerbooks and 
surfboards and rollerblades and other goodies not seen since the days of the 
Garden appeared as though manna from Heaven. Some even beseeched the Home 
Shopping Network for bee bonnets and snowmobiles and inflatable life rafts. 
Because in California, thou never knowest.

THE LAW THAT BROUGHT THE CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ITS KNEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is former president of the Los 
Angeles County Criminal Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito sits in Department 100 on the 13th floor of 
the Criminal Courts Building. One suspects Ito knows full well that he doesn't 
have enough judges to call tomorrow's balls and strikes, much less the 
anticipated wave of "three-strikers." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Criminal Division's assistant supervising judge, Ito must find 
courtrooms for criminal jury trials. There are 33 in the Criminal Courts 
Building downtown. If he comes up empty there, he has to "go shopping." First, 
he'll look for any available criminal courtroom in Los Angeles County; next, 
for any available civil trial court, and, finally, for any courtroom that has a 
jury box, regardless of the judge's assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito knows that any prosecution attempt to broadly impose "three strikes you're 
out" will bring an already infirm criminal-justice system to its knees. Even 
before "three strikes" became law, the Superior Court was in the habit of 
desperately searching for courtrooms to move 40,000 felonies annually from one 
end of the criminal-justice system to the other, with just over 100 assigned 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this latest solution to the crime problem so irritating is that the 
politicians who passed "three strikes" knew it could never be meaningfully 
enforced. But, alas, we've traveled this road before in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1975, the presumed anti-crime panacea was a "use a gun, go to prison" 
bill, authored by then-Sen. George Deukmejian. It required judges to impose 
prison terms if a firearm was used in the commission of a felony. Now, nobody 
uses a gun to commit a crime, right? 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1978, the "Briggs Initiative" restored the death penalty. Since then, at 
a cost of a billion dollars, two people have been executed, one voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1982, the Mothers Against Drunk Driving -- MADD -- gave California the 
harshest driving-under-the-influence laws in the country. After a one-year dip, 
in 1983, drunk-driving arrests have continued to rise despite mandatory jail 
time for repeat offenders and draconian penalties for first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also in 1982, voters passed Proposition 8, the "Victim's Bill of Rights." It 
forbade plea bargaining on serious felonies, added five years of jail time for 
each previous felony conviction and boosted prison sentences for repeat 
offenders. Result: California's prison population grew from 18,000, in 1982, to 
126,000 today, with little or no decrease in the crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990 brought us the "Speedy Trial Initiative" which, in its execution, has 
provided neither speedy trials nor initiative. In fact, the number of felony 
criminal-jury trials has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the criminal-justice system as plumbing. The court system is a series 
of small pipes under enormous and constant pressure as a result of the large 
volume of defendants shoved into it by police and prosecution. One court pipe, 
called "plea bargaining," shunts the accused through the system with just a 
cursory look and sends them off to prison, jail or probation. The other pipe 
has a series of extremely expensive filters called "jury trials," and 
defendants moving through this pipe travel slowly, so that their guilt or 
innocence can be finely analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, and only the defendants, control the flow by saying not guilty 
at their arraignments. Under our current plumbing, 97% of them must pass 
through the plea-bargaining pipe. Only 3% elect the fine analysis of a jury 
trial. The capacity of the jury-trial pipe is already full; any added pressure 
will cause the system to rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Few defendants facing a 25-year-to-life "top" are going to plead guilty. They 
will choose the already backed-up jury-trial pipe, and the criminal-justice 
plumbing will break down. But not only criminal justice is affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, District Attorney Gilbert L. Garcetti announced he is jettisoning 
long-established sections of his office -- environment, consumer affairs and 
major frauds, among others -- to "free up" enough experienced deputies to try 
"three-strikes" cases, for which there are no courtrooms. Each of these 
sections was paid for by state or federal funding, so each deputy D.A. 
transferred back actually costs the D.A. money and reduces his operating 
budget. Garcetti is essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Garcetti moves a couple of dozen more prosecutors into "three strikes" 
prosecutions, they will become little more than legal Dutch boys with thumbs in 
the criminal dike, trying to hold back a tidal wave of new cases. Already, 
optional felony-misdemeanors, known as "wobblers," are being sent wholesale to 
the City Attorney's offices for misdemeanor prosecution. Assault with a deadly 
weapon and commercial burglary, for example, are wobblers. 
</P>
<P>
 A clue to just how rigorously "three strikes" will be enforced may be found in 
the experiences connected to Proposition 8. After several months of trying to 
live with the proposition's "no-plea-bargaining" provision, the system's 
players decided that ignoring it was better than watching the system collapse. 
The clause is now enforced, if at all, in the months -- say, four -- leading up 
to a contested district attorney's election. Of course, everything negotiable 
is continued until the week after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the pyramiding of five-year enhancements for prior convictions, when 
Judge Ito and his colleagues have no trial courts available on the statutory 
"last day" for trial, the D.A. can either negotiate or watch his case be 
dismissed for lack of a courtroom. The "priors" have a way of becoming 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has been accomplished by "three strikes" is to allow a frustrated 
citizenry vent its rage at government-directed targets, in this case, habitual 
criminals. But as George Orwell made clear, under Big Brother things always got 
worse, but the public felt better for having someone to blame.*

STUDENTS SUGGEST ART COULD TAME WILDERNESS OF VIOLENCE; PUGET SOUND: COLLEGE'S 
FORESTED CAMPUS WOULD BE DOTTED WITH ARTWORKS AFFIRMING THE POWER OF WOMEN AND 
EXTOLLING PEACE OVER AGGRESSION. BUT PAYING FOR IT IS A PROBLEM.

<P>
 The first time Dana Fickeisen went for a walk in the forest near Evergreen 
State College, she was seeking a pleasant escape from the world's worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she saw a man with no pants on, and she realized she hadn't escaped at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The flasher was standing by the trail, 30 feet away, naked except for a shirt. 
Fickeisen sprinted safely back to campus, and nothing more came of the 
encounter -- except that the more she thought about it, the madder she got. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shattered my whole illusion of the place," she said. "I've grown up around 
Puget Sound, and the forests here are very important to me, very comforting. To 
have this comfort violated was an intrusion, just as if someone had broken into 
my home." 
</P>
<P>
 As too many women can attest, Fickeisen's unease is nothing new. What's 
unusual is how she and other Evergreen students propose to discourage sexual 
assault. Their remedy? Art. 
</P>
<P>
 They envision the dark groves and quiet paths of Evergreen's wooded campus 
dotted with artworks affirming the power of women and extolling peace over 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptures of sticks and leaves would be hidden along forest trails, to 
balance hikers' fears with an air of playful discovery. An X-shaped footbridge 
over a 9-foot-high fence would symbolize options for those "blocked" by 
violence. A trail-side screaming hut complete with suggested yells -- "No!" and 
"I am fierce!" -- would offer a place for venting anger and practicing verbal 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Intriguing, yes, but can art really stop sexual abuse? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think art can do a lot more than the general public is willing to admit," 
said Katie Baldwin, one of Fickeisen's fellow artists. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly a more genial approach than the fear and loathing that 
accompany most discussions of sexual violence. Even at Evergreen, a small 
liberal-arts school proud of its political correctness, the war between the 
sexes regularly boils over. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, feminists angry at the college's handling of a rape case 
spray-painted "Rape Me And I Will Kill You" on campus buildings, then stormed 
an administration office when two of the graffiti artists were charged with 
vandalism. An anti-feminist backlash ensued, its own brutal graffiti gloating, 
"Dead Men Rape In Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 It was this kind of standoff that two Evergreen teachers, artist Jean 
Mandeberg and physicist Rob Knapp, hoped to break last November. They asked 
students in their sculpture and engineering classes to collaborate on ideas for 
improving safety on campus trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Although safety is a concern on campuses nationwide, there are special 
challenges at Evergreen, a state-funded college of 3,000 students on the rural 
fringe of Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings cover just one-fifth of the 1,000-acre campus. The rest is wild, a 
forest thick with ferns and evergreen trees. No sweeping vistas here; the 
campus exudes a lush, mysterious air. Belts of trees hide low-slung buildings 
that seem to melt into the rain-soaked earth, and the mystery thickens on 
trails that thread through the forest down to a half-mile beach on Puget Sound. 
Every turn can harbor a surprise -- pleasant or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 As campus security chief Gary Russell said, "The aesthetics are there, but 
it's a security nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, there have been 40 reports of sex offenses on the trails. Most 
were cases of indecent exposure; one was an acquaintance rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hardly big-city crime, the incidents have created a climate of fear. 
Trail-head signs warning of "problems with violence against women" have turned 
many women back from what they, like Fickeisen, had hoped would be a pleasant 
walk in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The college has tried a variety of conventional safety measures, adding lights 
near the dorms, installing emergency phones outside, putting officers on 
mountain bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in the sculpture project started off conventionally, as well. 
Early brainstorming sessions were heavy on weaponry: stun guns, tear gas, 
sirens, squirt guns filled with skunk scent. They soon dropped the most 
combative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't beat it into somebody that sexual assault is wrong," student Alicia 
Saltmarsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 More subtle themes emerged. Most of the sculpture proposals try to be 
inclusive, inspiring men and women to work together toward a safer society 
instead of falling into divisive stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than warn women away from the forest, many of the works would lure 
more people into it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a practical reason for that, the theory being that more people using a 
trail would make it harder for an attacker to find a victim alone. But, as 
Saltmarsh explained, there's a philosophical reason too. 
</P>
<P>
 She sees the forest more as metaphor than actual threat. After all, most 
sexual assaults are committed by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger on 
a darkened path. What needs taming is not the woods but the wilderness of the 
mind, Saltmarsh believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiding natural-material sculptures along the trails was her idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would bring people's peripheral vision back into tune, extend their 
awareness beyond their immediate surroundings," she said. "People would say, 
'I'm going out to the woods to have fun, to look for those things,' instead of, 
'I'm going out to the woods and I'm going to be scared.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture project touched a nerve on campus. The students' models and 
sketches filled a school gallery all of January, to an enthusiastic response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I WANT TO LIVE IN THE SCREAMING HUT!" one student wrote in the comment book.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some wonderful ideas!" wrote college President Jane Jervis. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Purce, Evergreen's executive vice president, is left to supply the "but." 
These sculptures would cost money, and he shakes his head at the prospect of 
asking legislators to fund sculptures when he's fighting just to prevent 
faculty layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Security chief Russell also is skeptical: "Some of them -- ah, how can I say 
this without getting into trouble? They're good ideas, but the practicality of 
application would be difficult in some instances." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if no sculptures are completed, the project will have succeeded in 
raising awareness on campus, especially among men, who often think sexual 
assault is not their problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think most men will ever know what it feels like to be a woman in our 
society, but it's good to try to think about it," said Michael Schmunk, one of 
the student artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltmarsh, for her part, would like more than just talk. She said she might 
sneak out to the woods and build a few creations on the sly, to see if anyone 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be the first time public art and personal safety intersected at 
Evergreen. Three years ago, next to a trail-head warning sign, an anonymous 
sculptor added an artistic statement -- the life-size figure of a woman, carved 
from a sheet of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture soon was smashed to pieces. And that, plain to all who passed 
the shattered woman in the weeds, was a statement too.

HOLY WHITE KNUCKLES, BATMAN!; COASTER RE-CREATES GOTHAM

<P>
 Holy white knuckler! There's a new roller coaster -- Batman the Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the two "Batman" movies, the two-minute ride is enough to make even 
the Caped Crusader queasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders at Six Flags Magic Mountain are strapped in from above, with their feet 
dangling, and taken on a dizzying, 2,700-foot journey at speeds up to 50 m.p.h. 
Five times during the ride, they're flipped upside-down and hurtled through 
loops and corkscrews. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride is the centerpiece of a 6.2-acre re-creation of Gotham City, and 
marks the first time the park has designed a complete movie theme area. 
</P>
<P>
 The new coaster, one of eight in the park, opened Saturday, Batman the Ride 
also can be found at Six Flags parks in Chicago and New Jersey, but without the 
surrounding Gotham City.

USING SAFETY AS TENET IN OCCUPANCY ISSUE; * SANTA ANA MUST PROVE STATE 
STANDARDS POSE FIRE HAZARD BEFORE MAKING LOCAL CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana is nothing if not persistent in its efforts to write its 
own local standards on the number of occupants allowed in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused of discrimination against the poor by critics, strongly rebuffed in 
court, the city is now back at it. State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
has introduced legislation that would essentially restore the city's earlier 
intention of restricting apartments to one occupant per 50 square feet, a far 
more restrictive requirement than a prevailing state standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time around, the city got blasted by the 4th District Court of Appeal, 
which considered its argument about a diminished quality of life and found that 
there was nothing so exceptional about Santa Ana that would warrant giving it 
reprieve from what the rest of the state abided by. This time, however, the 
city has raised an issue that cannot easily be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest legislative try in Sacramento hinges on the question of fire 
safety, and whether higher density residences are more prone to fire than those 
with fewer occupants. Santa Ana firefighter Jim Albers has conducted test burns 
to see if, in fact, apartments crammed with belongings burn faster and hotter, 
and therefore pose more of a hazard to occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, fire killed three people in a South Alder Street home in Santa 
Ana thought to be overcrowded. In Santa Ana, 13 fire deaths between the end of 
1991 and January were attributed by fire officials to overcrowding. The 
firefighters' data are still being studied, and more independent conclusions 
may be needed, but to date the inquiry has sparked interest and support in the 
League of California Cities and around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, housing activists continue to raise good questions about 
singling out poor tenants in Santa Ana and exposing them to the whims of 
slumlords when they may complain about conditions. There also continue to be 
important concerns about producing a new wave of homelessness in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Legitimate concerns about safety and local control are in collision here with 
chronic housing needs. The city's attempt to arrest a perceived deterioration 
of quality of life must be taken seriously. However, there is no compelling 
evidence to date that the state standard on housing occupancy per square foot 
poses an onerous burden on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Until there is conclusive evidence that the prevailing state square footage 
provision poses a safety hazard, which would be a finding with statewide 
implications, the state standard should prevail.

ARRESTED JUSTICE IN DEPUTY'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Well! What do you know? We have had another sappy decision a la Rodney King. 
This time by the Orange County Grand Jury. It smells. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing is not excusable. It is not a close call as stated by the county 
prosecutor. Officer (Brian) Scanlan is trained in the use of firearms. He must 
have learned as a private in the Army, as I did, that you: 1. Never point a gun 
at another person (unless you intend to kill) and 2. You never assume that a 
gun in your hand is not loaded. Again, al la King, we are told that we cannot 
know how the jury arrived at its decision without seeing or hearing the 
evidence presented to it. Baloney! Officer Scanlan knew better and should be 
charged with having committed a crime.

 * The expressed policy of the Orange County Sheriff's Department is that real 
guns are never to be employed in training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Day, 1993, in a public area, one of the minuscule number of black 
deputies on the Orange County Sheriff's Department was shot, point-blank, in 
the face by a white deputy. Yet, if one is to accept the veracity of the Orange 
County sheriff and the conspicuously racially homogenous grand jury, Deputy 
Brian Scanlan, described by his department as one of the most expert and 
professionally driven field exercise trainers, accidentally unholstered his 
weapon, accidentally released the safety, accidentally pointed his weapon 
point-blank at Deputy (Darryn) Robins' face, and accidentally pulled the 
trigger, mortally wounding Robins. This all transpired during what has been 
described as a "training exercise."  
</P>
<P>
 The legal authority of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, district 
attorney's office and grand jury has failed. Now is the time for the federal 
government to exercise its moral authority.

IMMIGRANTS BRINGING TUBERCULOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Fighting TB Will Require Both Short-, Long-Term Solutions" (Column, 
March 20): 
</P>
<P>
 Just another of the very obvious serious impacts on our state because of the 
continuing invasion of illegal (immigrants) who came here without medical 
inspection by an approved physician in their home country before entering the 
United States. This outbreak of (tuberculosis) in our county would not happen 
if we had control of our borders. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest Mrs. (Pearl) Jemison-Smith check out the 440 new TB cases in 1993 
and see how many are illegal (immigrants) or family members of illegal 
(immigrants). Also, the Orange County families that are hiring (illegal 
immigrants) to care for their children should have medical examinations of 
their nannies to determine if she is a TB carrier or not. Their children 
deserve this form of preventive medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration ain't free. It costs all of us taxpayers; the SOS call 
continues to go out to save our state from illegal immigration.

SPECIAL CASES REQUIRE A SPECIAL DOCTOR; * ANAHEIM HILLS DENTIST TREATS DISABLED 
PATIENTS; THERE'S A GROWING NEED FOR HIS TYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County is fortunate to have a number of facilities and programs helping 
the disabled, from Fairview State Hospital to groups dealing with specific 
afflictions such as cerebral palsy or Down's syndrome. But while it generally 
is not too difficult to find doctors specializing in treating patients with 
disabilities, finding a dentist is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the California Dental Assn. says it knows of only one dentist in 
Southern California with a clinic targeting people with severe disabilities 
such as autism or Parkinson's disease: Dr. Jerry Minsky of Anaheim Hills. As 
anyone who has a disabled member of the family knows, the county is lucky to 
have Minsky, particularly since he accepts Medi-Cal payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Minsky is a Cal State Fullerton graduate who studied dentistry at Georgetown 
University. His clinic is at the Los Cerritos Mall, but much of the time Minsky 
uses hospital operating rooms, including Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Anaheim, 
and treats patients sedated by general anesthesia. The reason is that many of 
his patients either are difficult to control or cannot hold their mouths open 
for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Thompson of Laguna Beach, who searched for someone to treat her 
25-year-old autistic son, said that were he not sedated he probably would kick 
or bite the dentist during even the most minor dental treatment. Said Thompson, 
"I applaud what (Minsky) does, because it is not easy to deal with someone like 
my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Minsky said he began seeing patients with disabilities on a regular basis 
after a nursing home with several mentally retarded patients contacted him. 
Word of mouth brought him other patients. 
</P>
<P>
 His patients range in age from 2 to 95; their disabilities include cerebral 
palsy, autism, Parkinson's disease, severe arthritis and mental retardation. 
When a patient is poor, payment comes via Medi-Cal, the government-funded 
program for low-income patients that dentists say pays only about one-quarter 
what private insurance pays. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for dentists like Minsky will increase as our population grows older 
and suffers aging's accompanying maladies. It takes a special type of nurse, 
therapist or doctor possessing extra skills and patience to treat the disabled 
or infirm. It also takes a special type of dentist.

WHY A NEW TEST? HERE ARE SOME ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a teacher responsible for training colleagues in the new CLAS assessment, 
I feel compelled to respond to Karen Eddy's misguided attack of the state's new 
testing program (letters, March 20). She asks some pointed questions I would 
like to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we need another state test? Because it is clear to many teachers that 
the traditional CTBS test is woefully inadequate in measuring student's ability 
to read, write and compute. Having students fill in bubbles on a 
multiple-choice exam is a shallow and unauthentic way to measure thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we test special-education students? Because we should assume that 
special education does not necessarily correlate with low thinking ability. 
Some students are in special education classes because of emotional problems or 
physical limitations, not because they can't be challenged intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we need a test that ignores basic skills such as spelling, math 
computation and reading vocabulary? Spelling is not ignored, it's included in 
the scoring rubric. In math, students not only have to compute, but now have to 
explain how they reached their conclusions. As far as vocabulary comprehension 
is concerned, the literature chosen for students to interpret is difficult. 
Clearly this test is more challenging and sets a higher standard for our 
students to shoot at. What's wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
 It should also be noted that this is the largest in-depth assessment ever 
attempted in this country. To expect the initial attempt to occur without 
"bugs" is unrealistic. Given a chance, the test will be phased in over a number 
of years, and will eventually report individual scores for all students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who complain about the cost of the assessment miss the bigger picture. 
The value in this assessment is not that students are asked once a year to 
demonstrate higher-level thinking skills. The real value is that many teachers 
will now be motivated by published results to upgrade their teaching. I have 
already seen this test improve the instructional practices of many teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, this improvement among teachers costs the state nothing. In 
other words, this test is beginning to drive the curriculum in ways that 
countless other expensive reform movements have failed. Viewed in that light, 
maybe the test is worth every penny.

COSTLY CODES WON'T SAVE HOMES IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As Canyon Acres residents and victims of the October Laguna Beach firestorm, 
we take issue with your editorial (Laguna's Lingering Fire Trouble, March 3), 
which chastised the Laguna Beach City Council for not approving a new, 
restrictive and costly fire code for those rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 We remind The Times that the kind of building materials in homes had nothing 
at all to do with them burning in the raging inferno.Structures made of stucco 
and aluminum siding burned just as quickly as those make of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Acres residents have nicely survived some six normal fires since 1972, 
but we couldn't withstand a blazing, wind-swept firestorm. Buildings built with 
stringent, fire-resistant regulations will also quickly succumb to a future 
firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The overriding concern, however, is that several fire victims cannot rebuild 
at all if saddled with high-cost restrictions. The little guys, with no extra 
money for expensive code upgrades, would become victims again, this time of 
well-meaning but unnecessary bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The city should focus on hillside fuel modification and a more efficient 
defense plan for the Fire Department to combat any future inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach City Council is to be highly commended for responding to the 
personal and financial needs of devastated fire victims rather than penalizing 
them with costly and burdensome regulations.

ALTERNATIVE SITE FOR DISNEY'S WESTCOT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Congratulations to Stephen Smith on his splendid idea ("Golden Idea for 
Disney," March 16). 
</P>
<P>
 Building Disney's Westcot at the Golden Triangle in Irvine -- connected to 
Disneyland and Anaheim by a modern monorail -- is brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a blend of visionary idealism and enterprise. I just hope the Disney Co. 
and the Irvine Co. are smart enough to see the possibilities in the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 LENA FRIEDMAN 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen C. Smith's suggestion ("Orange County Voices," March 16), that Disney 
build Westcot in the Golden Triangle instead of in Anaheim, misses several 
important considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 His main concern is that traffic will increase. If Westcot is built, there 
eventually will be two parking structures, not one: Each will open almost 
directly onto the Santa Ana Freeway, and each is designed so as to prevent 
traffic from backing up on the freeway. These two structures, by opening off 
the freeway, will reduce traffic on surface streets, as will the construction 
of the planned people mover and/or monorail connecting the parking structures 
with the area immediately adjacent to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, which is the subject of Smith's article, will also serve the 
arena and the stadium, as well as being a mass-transit center that will be 
needed whether or not Westcot is built and which was planned for the area 
before Westcot was announced. With or without Westcot, the center has to be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion for building Westcot in the Golden Triangle is based upon the 
assumption that the light rail will be constructed, even though this is not a 
sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 If the light rail is built, it is still many years away, and putting Westcot 
in the Golden Triangle would increase, not decrease, auto traffic for many 
years if not permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Westcot in the Golden Triangle would do nothing to upgrade the area 
around Disneyland, an area which is greatly in need of upgrading, with or 
without Westcot. With Westcot, there will be some return, in increased tax 
revenue, for the upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, at some time in the future, a third theme park between Disneyland and 
the projected Newport Coast Time Share condos, would make sense; for now a 
theme park, except close to Disneyland, is not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing: The $50 million for the parking structure is not a gift to 
Disney for expansion, because the revenues from this parking structure will go, 
not to Disney, but to a government body. The capital spent on the structure 
will be an investment, not a gift.

 It seems to me that Mr. Smith has a very original and innovative idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Our recent earthquake should make us think about the possibility of the 
world's largest parking garage -- proposed to be built in Disneyland's parking 
lot -- becoming a potential disaster area on its own. If I lived in Anaheim I 
would certainly favor getting this traffic away from the city, which this idea 
would encourage. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this idea should be given serious consideration.

 What a great article! I agree with this great idea!

<P>
 Why should the new "Westcot" be crammed into such an "itty-bitty living 
space?" 
</P>
<P>
 This suggestion for dispersing traffic congestion is an important issue and a 
vital necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like the Irvine Co. knows its business. The public gift of $50 
million can be greatly used elsewhere.

 In response to the article, "Golden Idea for Disney" (March 16), I couldn't 
agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many things interlinked to this issue. Some of which may not be as 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
 As stated, Anaheim is already overburdened with traffic as well as a lack of 
open land for the project. What this would most probably mean is that Anaheim 
would need to obtain the land for the project through eminent domain. Anyone 
familiar with this practice would certainly agree that almost any other 
alternative would be better. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we have all this land that will be available in the near future 
through the closing of the El Toro Marine base. This seems like a pretty good 
alternative to overcrowding, overtaxing and eminent domain so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the main proposal for the open land created by the closure of El Toro 
Marine base is to construct an airport there. We already have one! Not to 
mention the money that it would cost taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The article asked: "Is it ever too late for a good idea?" My only response to 
that is: I sure hope not.

2 TRI-CITIES DIRECTORS STILL DRAW BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the article "Past Grand Juries Gave Warning of Potential for Abuse at 
Water Districts" (March 22), a misleading statement was made with reference to 
the elimination of each director's approximate $500 monthly health benefits 
package by Tri-Cities Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in district policy to eliminate these benefits will become 
effective in January, 1995, and will apply to all newly elected or reelected 
directors (voted 3-2). To date, two of the current directors (Board President 
William Mecham and Treasurer Craig Strickland) continue to take full benefits 
-- Blue Cross, Delta Dental and Vision Care -- for themselves and families over 
the protests of most of the district's constituents.

KEEPING OPEN EAR FOR CALL TO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Nancy Nevins ("Group Shouldn't Snicker at Person's Pain," March 17) has my 
sympathy in her guilt for the peer pressure which prevented her from rushing to 
help a naked woman outside the store who was walking along Pacific Coast 
Highway. I hope these peers are likewise ashamed of their inaction upon 
learning the woman had been beaten and evicted by a boyfriend! I'm not sure 
what I would have done under similar circumstances, but my daughters worry 
about my safety because of my good Samaritan tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the "call to action" is not clear but equally disturbing, and this 
happened to me several days ago while I was in a local grocery store. It is 
normal for me to pay attention to children and smile at them, but I came to a 
halt at the sight of a little girl (perhaps 3 years old) in the "child seat" of 
a grocery cart being pushed by a woman. The child looked so frail and peaked 
that she captured my immediate concern. Just then, the child let out a whimper, 
and the woman said to her: "What is it with you?" and next repeated the 
question in a strained voice, this time cupping the child's chin in a grip so 
strong and an attitude so unloving that I expected abuse and prepared to take 
action. Instead, the woman saw my alarm and moved down the aisle as I watched 
and wondered what kind of a life this child lived. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is an abusive life, I have to hope family members or neighbors will 
contact the Child Abuse Registry. Violence done to adults with no one to come 
to their aid is bad enough; done to helpless children, inaction is criminal. To 
the tall, dark-haired woman in Albertson's on March 16, if you need help with 
your stress, I beg you to ask for it before a tragedy occurs. Ditto to the 
world out there: Enough harm can come to us from strangers, we need to be much 
more alert to the possibility of evil within family units.

SCRUTINIZING GARDEN GROVE'S MOVE TO LEAVE LEAGUE OF CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There's nothing at all "perplexing" about Garden Grove's decision to 
withdraw from the League of California Cities, notwithstanding the lamentations 
of Buena Park Council Member Rhonda J. McCune ("Gaining Political Clout in 
Numbers," March 18). Frankly, what's "perplexing" is that so many of 
California's 469 cities continue to be members of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the League provides benefits to all California cities on a non-exclusive 
and non-divisible basis it makes little sense for any individual city to 
actually join the league. League membership is not a prerequisite for nearly 
any of the benefits enumerated by McCune. Hence, it's entirely rational for 
individual cities to withdraw from the league, knowing full well that any of 
the league's achievements on behalf of California municipalities will come 
their way regardless of whether they remain members. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove's decision to withdraw from the league is classic example of what 
economists and political scientists call the "free rider" problem, wherein 
someone collects the benefits made possible by someone else's effort without 
paying for them. It's a problem each of us face in countless ways on a daily 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Garden Grove's secession from the league is little more than a tiny 
leak in the "lifeboat" keeping California's municipalities afloat in these 
"uncertain times," it could be a harbinger of mass departures to come. 
</P>
<P>
 To persuade Garden Grove to rejoin the league and to prevent other cities from 
jumping ship, the league must do more than merely tout the advantages of 
collective lobbying on behalf of California municipalities. Instead, the league 
must develop programs to provide benefits limited to league members only, a 
task not even begun by Council Member McCune's systematic accounting of league 
activities on behalf of all California municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK P. PETRACCA 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The current decision of Garden Grove to leave the League of California 
Cities demonstrates the current penny-wise, pound-foolish mentality that 
appears to be gripping many local governments in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The article by Rhonda J. McCune, president of the Orange County division of 
the league (Orange County Voices, March 18), provides some very appropriate 
reasons for Garden Grove to remain a member of the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not go far enough, however. For some time I have wondered why the 
leadership of the league has not considered the use of the ballot box to 
prevent further raiding of local revenue by a greedy and irresponsible state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment to return property taxes and the traditional share 
of sales taxes to local governmental entities should have widespread local 
support. The after-working hours volunteer resources of local government 
employees should provide more than enough impetus to get a ballot measure 
qualified quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 We have learned a valuable lesson during these troubling economic times in 
California. Don't count on sympathy and support from state government 
politicians just because they have come from the ranks of local government or 
because they have espoused local control before their election to state office. 
Orange County is an excellent example of the latter. Constituencies change and 
so do political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 This will certainly take some effort, but you can be sure that local revenue 
erosion by the state is far from complete. It will continue as long as it 
appears to be the easy way out for less than creative politicians, of both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly hope that local officials resort to more creative ways to assure 
substantial and viable government at the local level. Without it, we will all 
lose more than we ever believed possible.

 * Are you laughing yet? The Garden Grove City Council has decided to take 
matters into its own hands. They're not sure Garden Grove is getting its 
money's worth out of the California League of Cities or the Orange County 
League of Cities. Instead of working within each of those groups to have better 
representation for the interests of Garden Grove, their solution is to walk 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not yet been successful in its efforts to dethrone Hank Wedaa 
from the (Air Quality Management District) board; we're all frustrated, but why 
pout? Garden Grove City Council, you're embarrassing us. Using the question of 
finances is just a guise; we're not interested in your childish antics and 
anger. Don't handicap the city because of your personal vendettas.

USC FALLS SHORT IN CHASE FOR TITLE; WOMEN: LOUISIANA TECH USES PRESSURE DEFENSE 
TO OVERCOME TWO SEVEN-POINT LEADS IN 75-66 VICTORY. 
</P>

 USC led twice by seven points early in the second half Saturday, but 
eventually withered under Louisiana Tech's pressure defense in a 75-66 loss in 
the final of the women's Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Williams scored 26 points as fourth-seeded Louisiana Tech (30-3) earned 
a trip to the Final Four for the first time since since 1990. The Lady 
Techsters have won 24 in a row since a 34-point loss to Tennessee in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Cal (26-4), which hasn't been to the Final Four since 1986, suffered 
several turnovers and the Lady Techsters pulled even at 45 on consecutive 
baskets by LaShawn Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Brown's three-point play put Tech ahead to stay, 55-54, with 12:21 to 
play. Williams' rebound basket and three-pointer gave Tech some breathing room, 
64-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicky McCrimmon's driving layup cut it to 64-61, but Williams responded from 
the outside. Racquel Spurlock came up with a steal that resulted in a 
seven-point lead, and Southern Cal never got closer than five points the rest 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Cal appeared tired down the stretch. Lisa Leslie, the Pac-10's 
all-time leading scorer and rebounder, was short on a free throw, short from in 
close and missed badly on two three-pointer attempts in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished with 24 points, while Tina Thompson scored 17 and McCrimmon 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Thomas had 16 points for Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied 12 times in the first half, the last time at 27, before the 
Lady Techsters scored five consecutive points, the last two coming on Vickie 
Johnson's steal and basket. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern Cal scored the final six points of the half. Thompson's two free 
throws started the run, and then Tracy Atwater got loose inside. Jody Anton's 
15-footer with three seconds left gave Southern Cal a 37-34 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie and McCrimmon opened the second half with baskets to move Southern Cal 
out front 41-34.

BOYS ON THE BOAT; CRUISE HOSTS PLAY FRED ASTAIRE TO SOLO WOMEN WHO WANT TO 
DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH, Dash is a free-lance writer based in North Bergen, N.J. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While cruising the Panama Canal in 1982, Dick Revnes noticed groups of older 
solo women sitting around the ship's dance lounge wistfully watching couples 
glide by. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by his wife, Revnes asked one of the women to dance. As she waltzed 
in his arms, she started to cry. When Revnes quipped that he knew he was a bad 
dancer but hadn't thought he was bad enough to drive a partner to tears, the 
woman, about 70, told him he was the first man to ask her to dance since her 
husband died 10 years before. He had made her cruise, she said, and she would 
never forget him.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Revnes, the late president of Royal Cruise Lines, forget her. That 
night he decided to create a program that provided a core of dance partners for 
unattached women passengers who want to participate in couples' dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Revnes's "cruise hosts" would be single, retired and over 45 -- in effect, 
peers of the usually widowed or divorced mature women. In addition to Fred 
Astaire duties, the hosts would function as dinner companions to groups of 
women, assist them on shore excursions, and be available for couples shots when 
the ship's photographer took aim. The host would be a kind of nautical knight 
in shining dress shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 12 years after Revnes launched his host program, every cruise aboard 
Royal's three ships includes six to 12 hosts, who range in age from 50 to 80. 
At least seven other cruise lines have some form of host program: Royal Viking 
Line, Cunard, Regency Cruises, Delta Queen Steamboat Co., Crystal Cruises, 
Holland America Line and American Hawaii Cruises. The program is so popular 
with unattached women age 50-plus -- who make up 10% to 25% of many cruises, 
far outnumbering single older men aboard -- that more lines are contemplating 
adding hosts system-wide or to selected sailings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't think of booking a cruise on a ship that didn't have hosts," said 
Grace Pearl Adams, a 68-year-old widow who has been cruising for 10 years and 
tried her first hosted sailing two years ago aboard Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to dance, and the host program allows me to have a ready dance partner 
but otherwise be independent throughout my trip," said Adams, who usually takes 
at least one long cruise a year. "Before hosts came along, I had to just sit in 
the audience and watch everyone else dance. I felt so isolated, so frustrated. 
Now I can be a full participant in the dancing part of the cruise as well as 
all the other parts, and that's certainly added to the joy of cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 While hosted cruises are intended to serve active women who, but for a 
partner, could have danced all night, the program also is a boon for gregarious 
men who relish dancing and traveling. Recruited directly by the cruise line or 
booked through an outside agency (which generally charges the men a fee for 
each assignment), hosts are not paid for their services. Instead, they receive 
a free cruise, including accommodations (usually shared with another host), a 
bar and laundry allowance, and in most cases, round-trip air tickets to 
embarkation and disembarkation ports. They are expected to show up for duty 
with a tuxedo, white dinner jacket, natty sportswear and loads of energy -- 
since they could be dancing three to seven hours a day, with little time to sit 
out a dance if demand is strong from the women on board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hosting proved the perfect thing for me to do after retiring," said Ed 
Fanelli, a 70-year-old former telecommunications executive from Manhattan, N.Y. 
Just before he was about to retire in 1986, he read about Royal Cruise Lines' 
host program in an article in Modern Maturity magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could dance well enough, but I'm a bachelor, and I was nervous 
about all the social pressure to entertain all those women," he recalled. (On 
his debut assignment there were 180 solo women and six hosts.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The ladies turned out to be so appreciative. I got very comfortable very 
fast," said Fanelli, who has been a host on 60 Royal cruises. "I remember one 
woman, two weeks shy of her 80th birthday, who just couldn't believe all these 
guys were asking her to dance. At the end of the cruise she signed up then and 
there for another sailing, saying she had planned to give all her money to her 
children, but was having so much fun she'd decided to spend it on herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Laudari, 70, a retired banker from Santa Rosa, Calif., who has hosted 
aboard 100 Royal cruises, said he looks out for women with special needs. "On 
one cruise to Europe we had two elderly ladies in wheelchairs who wanted to 
explore Rome but couldn't do the regular shore excursion there because they 
couldn't keep up," he said. "They asked me to help them, and we rented a 
limousine and toured on our own, with the limousine driver and me wheeling them 
around the Vatican. It was so heart-wrenching to see how much pleasure they got 
and how grateful they were. We became great pals." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pals is the operative -- and imperative -- word when it comes to cruise 
hosting, where the unequivocal motto is: Dancing, not romancing. Hosts are 
expected to spread their attentions around to all the women in their realm, and 
gently brush aside any intimate advances. No entering ladies' cabins (even for 
the most chaste reasons), no rendezvous in the wee hours, no strolling off a 
deux during shore excursions. Any violations of the platonic code could see a 
host unceremoniously booted off the ship at the next port without even a plane 
ticket home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get pretty dicey with really aggressive women who want to monopolize 
all your dance time -- and sometimes more," said Fanelli. "On my last cruise, 
my phone rang at 4 a.m., and it was a woman saying the ship was rolling and she 
needed company. I had to say sorry, I just couldn't do it, and if she was 
feeling sick she needed to call the ship's doctor. You have to handle those 
situations with kid gloves, but be real firm about what's not OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the cruise staff isn't always vigilant for offenders, the women often 
are, said Laudari. "Some of those ladies go around with score cards, pointing 
out when you're dancing too much with one woman -- and not enough with them," 
he said. That's not to say that romances haven't been born at sea -- but the 
deal is, a host may only contact a woman (and only at her bidding) after the 
cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Centi, 68, of Palm Springs, met his wife Donna, 58, in 1989 when he was 
a host on a two-week South America cruise on Royal's Crown Odyssey. Donna was 
cruising with her sister, a travel agent, trying to put her life back together 
after the death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't looking for a mate, and Oscar and I didn't even click at first," she 
recalled. "I thought he was too standoffish and never gave him a second thought 
after the cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 The two met again on another Royal cruise, and this time Donna decided Oscar 
had really just been shy, and that he "was kind of cute." They exchanged phone 
numbers, but Centi lost Donna's number and didn't get in touch with her until a 
mutual cruising friend ran into him on yet another cruise and got them 
together. It was love at first fox trot, and they were married in 1992. The two 
now cruise together -- though of course Donna's is the only name on Oscar's 
dance card. 
</P>
<P>
 Such happy endings notwithstanding, women shouldn't expect romance to result 
from a cruise -- that kind of anticipation could sabotage their vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just go and have a good time and don't expect the Love Boat," said Lauretta 
Blake, whose Santa Clara, Calif., company, The Working Vacation, recruits and 
screens hosts for Cunard, Regency, Delta Queen and American Hawaii.. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake screens all applicants to get to the bottom of their intentions -- and 
determine their dancing abilities -- with an extensive application process of 
personal interviews, dance evaluations by selected instructors and references 
from community leaders. She charges the men $150 per cruising week for each 
placement she arranges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The G-word (for gigolo) was a dicey issue when cruise lines first started 
their host programs. "A lot of people worried that the concept would attract 
gold-diggers stalking wealthy elderly widows and divorcees," said Mimi Weisband 
of Royal Cruise Lines. "We had travel agents telling us, 'We're not putting our 
clients on with those geriatric gigolos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all just good fun," said Mary Kay Cole, a 67-year-old widow from San 
Jose, who shudders when recounting what she calls the "bad old days" before 
hosts came into her shipboard life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What stands out most in my mind is a New Year's cruise a few years back 
aboard the Pacific Princess," she said. "There were all those couples dancing 
to a wonderful band, wearing silly hats to ring in the New Year, and my woman 
traveling companion and I were just lumps in the lounge chairs, totally left 
out of the loop. We both loved to dance and had put on our nicest dresses, but 
what was the point? We were in our beds by 11:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve. We 
might as well have stayed home." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was then. Hearing about Cunard's host program last year, she booked a 
Caribbean cruise aboard the Vistafjord. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a different world. The men were all very charming, treated us 
with absolute respect and were both good dancers and interesting 
conversationalists," she said. "I danced my heart out and loved every minute of 
the cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that maiden hosted voyage, Cole has cruised exclusively on lines that 
have the program. Having traveled happily with Cunard and Royal, she's 
currently planning a Panama Canal cruise with Regency -- hosted, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm spoiled now, and will never go back to being a wallflower when the band 
strikes up," she said. "I'm no Ginger Rogers, but music is for everyone, and 
the hosts make sure we all get to enjoy it." GUIDEBOOK

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: KNOWING THE SCORE ON SHIP SANITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When travelers book a cruise, they ask about cabin accommodations, rates, 
ports of call, dinner seatings and, perhaps, captain's parties. But few inquire 
about the ship's sanitation score, according to travel agents who book cruises. 
One possible reason may be that many travelers have never heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 25% of people ask," said Bell Desouza, manager of Advantage Travel in 
Burbank, who often books cruises. The more upscale the clients and the more 
often they have taken a cruise, he said, the more likely they are to inquire. 
</P>
<P>
 While cruise ship sanitation scores -- based on regular inspections -- are not 
new, cruise ship inspections themselves have been part of the Vessel Sanitation 
Program since it was formally organized in 1975 by the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. The Sanitation Program was instituted to lower 
the risk of gastrointestinal disease outbreaks, which can spread rapidly in the 
close quarters of a cruise ship, and to improve the overall healthfulness of 
the environment by making sure equipment such as the cooling and heating 
systems is working properly, according to a CDC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerical scores of up to 100 have always been applied but until recently were 
not made public, said Tom O'Toole of the CDC's Center for Environmental Health, 
which administers the Vessel Sanitation Program. O'Toole said the center 
"(began) publishing actual scores, rather than simply pass or fail, in 1989 in 
our Green Sheet," a CDC publication widely distributed to media, travel agents 
and the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, every vessel that carries 13 or more passengers and has a 
foreign itinerary is subject to two inspections per year and, when needed, 
reinspections. Ships that sail only from foreign ports are not inspected under 
the program, said Donald W. Turner, deputy chief of the program, nor are ships 
in the American Hawaii line because they do not sail to foreign ports. 
(American Hawaii is monitored by the Hawaii Department of Health and the Food & 
Drug Admininstration, through inspections similar to those of CDC.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the unscheduled visits by officials from the Vessel Sanitation Program, 
inspectors evaluate the water supply, food preparation methods and temperature 
at which food is stored. Also evaluated are employee practices and personal 
hygiene, and general cleanliness of the vessel. Inspectors look closely at 
other areas of the ship, such as the bars, to be sure ice is not contaminated, 
Turner said. Cabins are inspected both for cleanliness and for excess moisture, 
which can spread disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also look at fan rooms, checking the air intake," Turner said. "Sometimes 
we recommend they change the filters." 
</P>
<P>
 The cleaner the filters, the less likely bacterial disease will spread. "A 
dirty filter is more likely to have bacteria," O'Toole said.  
</P>
<P>
 A score of 86 or higher is considered acceptable. Perfect scores of 100 are 
rare, said Turner. In his 5 1/2 years on the job, he recalls only three ships 
getting 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the score reflects food and equipment-related criteria, Turner 
said. The lower the score, the lower the sanitation level. But a low score does 
not automatically mean that the risk of gastrointestinal disease is imminent, 
according to CDC experts. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of factors and conditions can pull a score down below 86. It is a 
judgment call on whether, and at what score, inspectors decide to recommend a 
ship not sail. There is no set score at which a cruise ship should not leave 
port, Turner said. Rather, it depends on the kind of problems found and how 
quickly they can be reversed. A malfunctioning refrigeration unit, for example, 
might be replaced with a new unit in a matter of hours; other broken equipment 
might have to wait for ordered parts to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Vessel Sanitation Program can recommend that a ship not 
sail. They have done so about three or four times in the past five years, 
Turner said. Usually, this recommendation follows discovery of contaminated 
water supplies, inadequate water treatment or violations in food handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cruise lines readily comply with this recommendation, according to Turner 
and O'Toole and spokeswomen from two cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a cruise ship does not follow CDC's no-sail recommendation, we can ask the 
Coast Guard to enforce U.S. quarantine laws and detain the ship," O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (cruise lines) start to take corrective action even during the 
inspection," Turner said. But a reinspection can be scheduled within 30 to 60 
days or even as soon as a few weeks, should the cruise line request it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Free copies of the most recent sanitation inspection report on individual 
vessels are available by writing to the Chief, Vessel Sanitation Program, 
National Center for Environmental Health, 1015 North American Way, Suite 107, 
Miami, Fla. 33132. No self-addressed, stamped envelope is necessary. Travelers 
can also request a free copy of "The Summary of Sanitation Inspections of 
International Cruise Ships" from the same office. Those sailing on American 
Hawaii ships can request free inspection scores from the Hawaii Department of 
Health, Sanitation Branch, 591 Ala Moana Blvd., Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the CDC sanitation rating of a cruise ship before sailing "is a good 
way to compare on a relative basis how ships are doing," said Dr. Carter Hill, 
a Seattle emergency physician and chair of the Section of Cruise Ship and 
Maritime Medicine for The American College of Emergency Physicians. But he 
cautions that there is "day-to-day variability." The score a ship received 
during last week's inspection could change if it is inspected the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the industry is improving, said Carter, who also serves as medical 
director of Holland America and Windstar Cruise Lines. "Cruise ships are 
cleaner than most restaurants, in my opinion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even passengers sailing on a ship with a perfect sanitation score are at risk 
of certain ailments simply because of the closed spaces, Hill said. "It's like 
being in a day-care center," he said. "The quarters are closer than in some 
workplaces and homes." If a few passengers have colds, the germs are likely to 
spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner agreed that sanitation conditions on board cruise ships are improving, 
partly due to the training his program provides to crews. "We don't just mark 
an inspection sheet," he said. "We've done a lot of educating." 
</P>

 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

DANCE; THE SPICE IS RIGHT; WELCOME TO DAVID ROUSSEVE'S 'URBAN SCENES / CREOLE 
DREAMS,' A LIVELY MIX OF THEATER, PERFORMANCE ART, DANCE AND CUTTING-EDGE URBAN 
MUSIC THAT AIMS TO BRING ISSUES OF RACISM, MISOGYNY, HOMOPHOBIA AND AIDS TO THE 
UNCONVERTED

<P>
 A frumpy grandmother in a pink bathrobe stands by her rocking chair and 
laundry basket. "I didn't take my grandmother very seriously when I was growing 
up," says a man's voice. "She just seemed like so many other grannies, uh, 
mammies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the grandmother begins to shamble across the stage as a line of women 
and men in tank tops and shorts enters. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rousseve steps up to a microphone and begins a chatty, funny tale about 
the pet rat he had as a boy, until the story takes a turn that leaves his 
audience suddenly silent. 
</P>
<P>
 An a cappella voice begins to sing. Rousseve and a woman, in separate pools of 
light, begin to move. Clenched muscles and the body language of anger pour out 
of the two isolated dancers as a rap recording by Public Enemy blares. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts come fast and furious in Rousseve's world. One minute you're watching 
theater. Then, it flips to performance art and, within minutes, dance. 
Actually, "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams" is all three, sometimes at once, and 
with music. 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles audiences will see when that work is performed by Rousseve and 
his company REALITY at the Wadsworth Theater on April 8 and 9, it doesn't fit 
easily into any one category. Mixing mediums is essential to Rousseve's 
activist message. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseve isn't out only to dazzle but also to get his audiences thinking. He's 
political, and his eclectic approach is more than just style. It's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the best way he's found to speak to as wide a range of people as possible 
about racism, misogyny, homophobia and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't make a piece that was only dance to save my life at this point," 
Rousseve says. "I can't take just that vocabulary and speak about issues. It's 
just not my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet experimental as Rousseve may be, he's not elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 "My voice is a little more popish," he says. "(The mixing of styles) is an 
effort to keep the work accessible and to talk to as many different people in 
as many different languages as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The more ways you come at an issue, his logic goes, the more chances there are 
for people to relate to what you're saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather talk to . . . churchgoing African Americans, young gays and 
lesbians, middle class (people) and AIDS activists than just one (group). I 
want to preach to the unconverted too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late Thelma Arceneaux, a Creole descendant of a Louisiana slave who picked 
cotton for much of her life, was the basis for the grandmother character in 
Rousseve's "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Arceneaux's 34-year-old grandson, the charismatic New York-based Rousseve came 
to Los Angeles recently to discuss what he describes as his "middle-class 
'Sanford and Son'-watching black family in Houston." His "country" background, 
as he half-jokingly puts it, didn't include "any experimental theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he went on to study theater at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of the place, didn't know where New Jersey was, but they 
sent me an application because I had done well on national achievement testing 
for minority students," Rousseve says. "I actually went to Princeton because I 
thought I wanted to do musical theater. It wasn't for academics." 
</P>
<P>
 While there, Rousseve also took up dance, "just to complement the theater." 
Then, after graduating in 1981, he performed with several small New York modern 
dance companies, while acting on soap operas to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But something wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working with technically based modern dance companies and getting 
really frustrated with saying absolutely nothing with dance," he recalls. 
"That's when I started to do my own work, because I wanted to talk about issues 
of the heart, which also are political issues." 
</P>
<P>
 His first independent piece was a 1984 monologue about "African American 
self-hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of my work since then has been text-based, which is shocking," Rousseve 
says. "I just couldn't go on without talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseve first performed at New York's PS 122, a key downtown performance art 
venue, in 1987. "Then I switched from being a dancer who's choreographing a bit 
to being a choreographer who's dancing a bit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Rousseve launched REALITY, which consists of the 
choreographer-writer-performer himself and six dancers, most of whom are female 
and African American. They are Aziza, Renee Redding-Jones, Sondra Loring, Kyle 
Sheldon, Julie Tolentino Wood and Charmaine Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Rousseve and REALITY presented the first of what was to become 
a series of six works. These "Creole" works mesh the story of the grandmother 
with snapshots from contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Creole" series, events in the grandmother's life -- including an 
impoverished Southern childhood, the death of a husband and the rape of a 
sister -- are intercut with anecdotes from the artist's own experiences. He 
draws analogies between the lynching deaths of an earlier America and deaths 
from AIDS today. 
</P>
<P>
 The visuals in the series range from solo performance minimalism to spectacle 
theater's abstract collages. The dance blends hip-hop with modern. The music 
ranges from Marvin Gaye to Queen Latifah to gospel and "house." And it's all 
mixed together in a hip kaleidoscope of scenes that change quickly enough even 
for MTV-age attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
 The last work in the series, "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams," premiered in 
Chicago and has also been seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and 
the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, with local dancers and singers added in 
each city. The New York Times called it "initially exasperating but ultimately 
shattering." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Rousseve and REALITY will be joined in "Urban Scenes/Creole 
Dreams" by six guest L.A.-based dancers and a choir from L.A.'s Guidance Church 
of Religious Science. Ysaye Barnwell, known for her work with Sweet Honey in 
the Rock, composed gospel music for singer B. J. Crosby, who portrays the 
grandmother. The house music is by Don Meisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he performed in San Diego in 1992 as part of the "Black 
Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" series, this Los Angeles 
engagement will be Rousseve and REALITY's first here since 1991, when the 
artist was commissioned to create a work for the opening of downtown's 
then-newly restored Bradbury Building. The Times' Lewis Segal wrote that "Had 
Me Somebody but I Lost Her Very Young," set in the 1930s, exploring the history 
of Creole culture in Louisiana, "grounds the obvious novelty of site-specific 
dance-spectacle in profound historical and religious experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Creole" series was instrumental in helping Rousseve and REALITY hone 
their particular brand of dance theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we've been working with this series, we've also developed a form -- a 
fusion of text, movement and visual imagery," he says. "When I put all the 
elements together, we get a more powerful statement than any one on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 It's as current a look as you could ask for, at once avant-garde and pop, 
combining contemporary African American culture with postmodernism. Rousseve's 
work also bears a resemblance to the kind of hybrid fare enjoying a vogue in 
the United States and Europe during the past decade, typified by the work of 
such auteurs as David Gordon, Pina Bausch and Yuri Lyubimov. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rousseve is up to more than that. For though Gordon, Bausch and Lyubimov 
have a lot in common with Rousseve, they aren't, spiritually speaking, his 
artistic next of kin. To find them, you'd have to go back to the 1920s, and 
directors Vsevolod Meyerhold and Erwin Piscator, both of whom used 
then-revolutionary theater, music and media collages to speak to topical 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is also the precision of Rousseve's interdisciplinary craft -- and his 
awareness of the pratfalls of autobiographical and political art-making -- that 
sets this artist apart from many of his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some dance that is sincere gets really indulgent because it's lacking on a 
craft level," he says. "The more we try to speak on issues, the more tendency 
there is for melodrama, so I try to add more shape and structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Many may attempt to meld performing styles, but not all are as concerned about 
the written component as is Rousseve. He begins by zeroing in on the issues he 
wants to address: "That's what drives me. Then I take those ideas and develop a 
character and a text." 
</P>
<P>
 But not just any kind of text will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much text being used in dance work now, but it's not text that is 
written for actors: It's more for a dance piece," Rousseve says. "The text that 
we use is not text for dancers in a dance piece. It's informal. There are 
monologues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Child, everybody got somethin' in life they loves more than theyselves," says 
the grandmother's voice, spoken by Rousseve. "Me, I had two great loves . . . . 
When I lost them, seem like I los' my stars and my moon. . . . But let me jest 
go back and I'll tell you about how I lost them both so young. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Rousseve combines the text with dance, the two reinforce each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning we tried acting out the stories," he says. "Then we found 
that we could take the story or scene and say it and also have an abstract 
visual that deals with the subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 "By doing this fusion of dance and theater, it keeps people's attention. I get 
bored sitting in an evening of just dance or just musical theater. Also, I can 
speak more deeply on political issues without turning people off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rousseve, who speaks most of the text himself, pays so much attention 
to matters of expression partly because he knows he's treading on volatile 
ground. The issues, after all, aren't easy, and there are many startling 
images, including lynching and rape, in "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Experimental theater is challenging for a traditional audience," Rousseve 
says. "And a lot of the white audiences are challenged by the very blatant 
in-your-face use of African American pop culture. It's a little jarring, and it 
does have artistic repercussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the minefield end there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are issues of sexuality mixed in with issues of racism," Rousseve 
continues. "A lot of people are not used to nudity on the stage; it can be a 
major issue for African American audiences. Just the word AIDS and AIDS-related 
issues, especially in the beginning, were very challenging for the church 
choirs." 
</P>
<P>
 But because it's so important to Rousseve to speak to such topics, he pays 
particular attention to dramatic craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I came out right away saying, 'People are dying of AIDS; it's really 
heartbreaking,' there's no doubt that 99% of the audience would resist," 
Rousseve says. "But if you can have them being joyous, then catch them a little 
off-guard, they're more likely to be on the journey with you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this rat when I was young," Rousseve begins. "And it was just your 
normal white rat . . . except for my rat was 'flicted, which is black English 
for 'messed up real bad.' . . . And I would just stroke my rat and love my rat 
and I would just think, 'Everybody gots something in life they loves more than 
theyselves.' . . . But then the people started dyin . ' . . . And nobody cared 
because instead of 'flicted animals, this time it was 'flicted people: gay 
people and black people and drug users and poor people. . . . At first they 
were calling it gay cancer. And by the time they knew what it was, it was too 
late because everybody was gone."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each time Rousseve and REALITY set out into a new community for the two-week 
residencies that precede performances of "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams," there 
are trepidations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always scared to introduce 'Urban Scenes' to the new local dancers and 
choirs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been so inspiring so far is that in every city, there have been people 
from the widest range of backgrounds who I know have never stood next to each 
other on a stage before. The mixture of race and gender issues could have been 
a failure, but people have come together and made it a real celebration of what 
unites us. And that's been a real testament to what theater can do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Solo voice: "Did you know it make a sound when a gentle heart get broke? Oh 
yah, now it sure do. And if you stand all alone in the silent night breeze . . 
. you'll hear the callin' natural sounds of a thousand hearts that broke."  
</P>
<P>
 Gospel choir: "You know the troubles of the world fill our hearts with rage  
</P>
<P>
 "From Soweto to Stonewall, Birmingham and L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 You know we're searching for hope that lies within ourselves  
</P>
<P>
 As we fight against misogyny, race hatred and AIDS."

POP MUSIC; MORRISSEY, THE EVER MARKETABLE; FEELING NEGLECTED IN THE U.S., THE 
UNCOMPROMISING SINGER COURTS A LARGER AUDIENCE BUT VOWS TO STAY TRUE TO HIMSELF 
-- AND THOSE WHO'VE DEIFIED HIM

 "Can I ask you a direct question? You don't really like me, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a perfect Morrissey moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The English pop singer, detecting what he considers "cold, cynical" responses 
to his conversation, has set aside the protocol of the telephone interview to 
bare his true feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most artists would keep it to themselves and take care of business, but 
Morrissey has never been one to shy away from emotional display. And the 
question itself reinforces the classic, poignant Morrissey archetype: the 
insecure loner yearning for understanding but doomed to isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 These qualities have made the opinionated, outspoken artiste one of England's 
most visible and controversial figures for more than a decade -- first with the 
Smiths, one of the most vital forces in '80s British rock, then as a solo 
artist after the group's 1987 breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Morrissey, 34, commands a limited but fiercely loyal 
core of fans who publish fanzines to share lore and opinion about their hero, 
and scream and swoon at concerts that take on the charged air of a messiah's 
visitation. The more he's ridiculed by detractors as a self-absorbed 
depressive, the stronger the bond between artist and audience becomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, it turns out, this isn't enough for Morrissey. After all these years of 
watching unworthy acts climb over him to the top of the charts, he wants some 
real respect -- from mass audience and individual interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I apologize then," he says, after being assured by his questioner that 
any coldness of tone is due to the awkwardness of the telephone medium and the 
short time allotted for the interview. This is another component of the image 
-- he may be shy and uncomfortable with people, but he's also polite, 
straightforward and forthcoming when it suits him. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with his new album, "Vauxhall and I," just released (see review, Page 
73), he definitely wants to get this out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make music which I feel has been largely neglected," he says. "I have a 
reasonably good-sized audience, but the level of attention that I receive from 
the American media does not reflect that at all. I feel slightly undervalued." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A hint of wariness remains in Morrissey's voice as the interview proceeds, but 
he seems to get into the spirit of things when he is asked to describe his 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's drinking tea in the kitchen of his five-story Victorian house in 
London. "How flash is that?" he interjects, trying to support his contention 
that he's a simple man with an utterly dull personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is "extremely clean, reasonably sparse, very bright." There are some 
film posters, as well as original prints of heroes such as Billy Fury, the '50s 
English rock idol, and the New York Dolls. Before becoming a performer, 
Morrissey wrote books about that classic underground band and actor James Dean 
for a British publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop music of the mid-1960s had become Stephen Patrick Morrissey's solace 
and obsession when he was barely 6 years old, the grand emotions of the era's 
hit singles assuaging his loneliness. Later, glam-rock icons David Bowie, Marc 
Bolan and the Dolls preoccupied him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie reached out to his followers and urgently assured them that "you're not 
alone." Morrissey would assume that role in the '80s after teaming with 
guitarist Johnny Marr and the rhythm section of Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce in 
Manchester in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths' catchy pop-rock songs were an unusual blend of classicism and 
eccentricity, their bouncy tunes and ringing textures framing Morrissey's 
longing tone and odd, singsong phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The band released six albums on Sire Records (not counting posthumous 
greatest-hits collections), but didn't make much of a mark in the U.S. In 
England, though, fans and press elevated the band to deity status, especially 
its introspective, charismatic frontman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Booth, the singer for the band James, which began in Manchester about the 
same time, recalls those early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Smiths took us on tour, and the reaction was always, 'My God, look at 
this!' He's just one of those figures in history that excites that kind of 
reaction. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was partly his vulnerability as a man. He wasn't this arrogant, 
stiff male who is certain about life. He's this very confused individual who 
made no bones about it. I think that needed voicing at the time. And he voiced 
it with great wit and insight, and people responded to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, despite a broad range of subject matter in his music, the primary 
image of Morrissey has remained: a suffering soul who offers comfort and 
community to people who don't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's something that's a constant but very dismissive description of 
me," Morrissey says. "I think deep down in our hearts all of us at some point 
feel that we don't fit in. So I don't feel that I'm singing purely for people 
who are on Death Row. And I don't think the songs are particularly depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am aware (of that bond with the audience) and I'm very protective of it. . 
. . They know that I'm a real person, and they know that every grain of 
progression I've ever had within music has been authentic and has been genuine. 
I've never tried to fool people or rip people off or overcharge people. I've 
never presented myself as anything other than what I am, as a living, breathing 
human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey, whose new album title refers to an area of South London, has lived 
in the city's Regent's Park district for six months, enjoying both its select 
cachet and the "scuzziness" of nearby Camden Town, a hip, lively contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make life as peaceful as possible," he says. "I'm a familiar figure 
in Regent's Park, which is a beautiful park full of wildlife and strange 
people, and I enjoy that. I enjoy just walking around London. I enjoy the 
architecture of London and watching it fade away, which is quite sad, and 
watching the city change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circle of friends I have are not famous, so therefore I suppose I'm 
considered to be reasonably reclusive. The people that I'm with every day don't 
move in media circles, so any activity I do is not particularly reportable. I 
have a reasonably simple life. I'm not flash and have no intention of ever 
being so, and I don't court any degree of media attention whatsoever."  
</P>
<P>
 Says Arnold Stiefel, his new manager: "I always thought that he was clearly 
not happy, based on his lyrics. I was surprised when I first met him that he 
was much more up and plugged into life than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 But the image doesn't completely lie. As a spiritual heir of Oscar Wilde and 
James Dean, among others, Morrissey has built a career on the theme of the 
unattainability of intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I've never ever in my life had a 10-second relationship with man, 
woman or beast, and the likelihood of me ever doing so is nil today and I'm 
sure it will remain nil. But everybody unfortunately has a cross to bear, and 
you can't have everything in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been painful, but simply because it's painful it doesn't mean 
it's ever about to subside. And there's not really much I can do about it, 
unfortunately. I simply stand alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's remedy to his perceived neglect has been to hire the Los 
Angeles-based Stiefel, who with his partner Randy Phillips also handles Rod 
Stewart's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vauxhall and I" is the vehicle for his campaign, which will be launched in 
earnest with three "special event" concerts -- two at Carnegie Hall in New York 
on April 11 and 12, preceded by an April 8 show that will return rock music to 
downtown L.A.'s historic Olympic Auditorium, the recently reopened boxing 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take an artist who was selling somewhere around a half a million 
units here," Stiefel says, "and without betraying what was genuine about his 
alternative music, expose it to a more mass-market audience and infect them 
with the enthusiasm that the hard-core fans have for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiefel notes that the new "The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get" has 
already become Morrissey's first Top 100 chart single -- before it's even been 
officially released to radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's totally true to himself in the new album," Stiefel says. "He won't put 
off any of the people who have supported him and loved him and felt they were 
Morrissey-ites all these years. But it's something we can all like." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little more accessible, but I don't think it's a radical departure 
from what he's done before," says Scott Wright, program director at WEZB in New 
Orleans, one of the Top 40 format stations that's playing the single. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's not quite as dark and brooding and miserable and suicidal and all 
that," he adds. "It's a little more uplifting, which may make it more palatable 
to a wider audience. It's getting an initially good reaction. Not overwhelming, 
but good." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't, however, expect Morrissey to bow and scrape to the American public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important part of the procedure is that regardless of what surrounds 
me, I remain myself," the singer says. "I'm not pliable in any way. Nobody on 
this planet could turn me into the perfect star. Nobody on this planet could 
turn me into anything other than what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 That became obvious a few months ago when Morrissey abruptly returned to 
London from Los Angeles, standing up an interviewer from Rolling Stone magazine 
and a crew that was ready to shoot his new video. The press loved the incident, 
milking it for a "so much for the kinder, gentler Morrissey" laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the history of my life," Morrissey says. "In truth, in person I'm 
actually the most gentle and most peaceful character you could possibly come 
across. But for some strange reason I have this odd reputation that goes before 
me that I cause tantrums when tantrums are not due. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a strange character, and I suffer the burden of being somewhat unique. 
But Arnold seems to have tapped into that instantly, and made me not feel so 
problematic."

COMMENTARY; THESE ARE THE ONLY WOMEN RUNNING MAJOR ART MUSEUMS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?; DIRECTING MUSEUMS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MALE-DOMINATED 
OCCUPATION, AND ONLY THREE WOMEN HEAD MAJOR ART MUSEUMS IN THE U.S. TODAY. 
DESPITE THE CURRENT RATHER HIGH VACANCY RATE IN DIRECTORSHIPS, THE CORPORATE 
ESTABLISHMENT CAN'T SEEM TO SHAKE ITS ANTI-FEMALE BIAS IN THE ARTS FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In January, the Seattle Art Museum made a shocking announcement. Mary Gardner 
Neill had accepted the board of trustees' invitation to become director of the 
museum, a post she will assume in May. 
</P>
<P>
 What was shocking was not the nature of Neill's qualifications for so 
demanding a job. A respected scholar of Asian art, she has been director since 
1987 of the Yale University Art Gallery, one of the foremost university museums 
in the country. Furthermore, she has worked in the museum field for nearly 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 No, what took observers by stunned surprise was far simpler: Mary Gardner 
Neill is a woman. With her appointment in Seattle, she becomes one of just 
three women currently holding the job of director in a major art museum in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The glass in the glass ceiling for women in the museum profession remains 
stubbornly thick. Today, only two other women -- Anne d'Harnoncourt at the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art and Kathy Halbreich at Minneapolis' Walker Art 
Center -- hold directorships at museums that rank among what are generally 
considered the largest or most significant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions might of course vary as to which American museums should be described 
as major. Furthermore, a small number of women have directed significant 
museums in the past; Grace McCann Morley, for example, was the director of the 
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from 1935 to 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, when considering the field as a whole, women are clearly 
anomalies as museum directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 40 women currently direct smaller or more specialized 
institutions, including university galleries. That compares with about 120 
males, who are at the helm of museums of all shapes and sizes. The New 
York-based Assn. of Art Museum Directors, a professional organization that 
represents the leaders of art institutions with annual operating budgets of at 
least $1.4 million, says that roughly 75% of its 160 current members are men. 
</P>
<P>
 That high figure is in fact down substantially from as recently as 15 years 
ago, when virtually every art museum in the United States, large or small, had 
a male director. As in the business world, the trend is moving in a more 
equitable direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, plainly, it isn't moving very fast. It might even be said to be moving 
very slowly -- at least as slowly as in other sectors of American corporate 
culture, where as recently as 1993 a single woman headed a Fortune 500 company. 
The arts might have a muzzy reputation for progressive innovation, but the 
profile is based on the creative work of individual artists, not on the 
institutional branch of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most art museums in the United States are essentially conservative in 
their programming and operation, or else they tend toward a centrist middle 
ground. Because the political center of the United States shifted sharply 
rightward in the 1980s, even those museums that claim a centrist commitment are 
today noticeably more conservative than hitherto might have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 To some degree, museums are conservative simply because they are also 
corporations -- nonprofit corporations, to be sure, but corporations 
nonetheless. Institutions of any kind usually play it safe, which means they 
are reluctant to disturb the status quo. Don't expect them to take the lead in 
social movements, including movements toward social equity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate Establishment also dominates the boardrooms of our cultural 
institutions, and it is a museum's board that hires the director. Surely the 
glass ceiling for women in art museums is composed of many of the same stubborn 
ingredients as the one that intrudes in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless business studies have shown that, in order to advance, women 
managers are expected to have more strengths and fewer faults than their male 
counterparts. (The expectations are often unconsciously held.) They also must 
be tough without appearing macho. Overall, women are held back by a corporate 
Establishment that is simply not yet comfortable with their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some differences in the ceiling seem specific to museums. For instance, length 
of service is often cited in the business world as an explanation for why 
professional women do not now occupy more corner suites; however, that 
reasoning doesn't fit art museums. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, it takes about 35 years after college to become a corporate chief 
executive officer, and few women were in business school in 1959. Museum 
directors, by contrast, often move into the job while in their 40s. For years, 
at least as many women as men have been in the curatorial, administrative or 
even academic realms, from which museums traditionally recruit directors. 
</P>
<P>
 So it must be asked: If it is understandable (if unsatisfactory) that art 
museums are not in the forefront of corporate or institutional change, 
specifically in the matter of women occupying the top chairs, why do they 
actually seem to languish somewhere in the rear of the pack? 
</P>
<P>
 An answer to this paradox will be found in one peculiar feature of the 
discomfort felt by a corporate Establishment already uneasy with women as 
peers. The explanation lies in the specific place occupied by art in American 
culture: Generally, Americans consider the arts to be a feminine activity, not 
a masculine one. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the familiar comic image of the reluctant husband being dragged to an 
art museum -- or to an opera, a symphony, the theater or a ballet -- by his 
insistent (if slightly silly) wife. The image is a staple of our modern 
folklore. Therein lies the obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 In her dazzling 1977 book "The Feminization of American Culture," historian 
Ann Douglas persuasively located the source of this routine perception in a 
profound sociological transformation in American life. (Her focus was on 
literature, but it applies to the arts altogether.) In the second half of the 
19th Century, galloping industrialization dramatically transformed the historic 
roles of women and men, while it also shaped the role of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, women and men had been domestic co-producers within the home. 
The Industrial Revolution changed all that. Household tasks were definitively 
split. Men went into factories to produce goods, while women came to be 
consumers of those products. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, art was becoming a form of consumable leisure. Educated women, 
in their new role as consumer, began to emerge as the prime consumers of 
American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Often with the encouragement of the clergy, which also slid into 
insignificance in the male-dominated industrial society that arose in the late 
1800s, women had an increasingly pronounced effect on the only areas still open 
to their influence. Thus was drawn a loose equation between the arts and 
femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This equation is a core reason for the low station long since accorded the 
arts in American life. Our devaluation of the arts parallels our habitual 
devaluation of women's interests. It is largely why the arts fare so poorly in 
our public school curriculum, why our federal appropriation for the arts is the 
lowest in the developed world and why Americans typically see the arts as a 
social trophy, rather than as integral to a pleasurable life. 
</P>
<P>
 The equation between the arts and femininity is also an unacknowledged factor 
in the dearth of women among American museum directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Women might seem to be likely, even inevitable, candidates for a job 
associated with an activity Americans regard as feminine. The truth is quite 
the contrary. For in order to be taken seriously, the institutions of art have 
reacted to the feminization of culture by placing an outsize emphasis on 
masculinity. They overcompensate. 
</P>
<P>
 Art museums typically yearn to be a community's leading trophy case, in a 
society that privileges the productive work of men. However, they suffer in 
fulfilling that aspiration because the arts are an activity associated with the 
leisure pastime of women. The director, as an art institution's individual 
public face, can compensate -- if it's a man, preferably one with a wife and 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are welcome in the lower professional levels and certainly in the 
essential ranks of volunteers, where they in fact keep museums afloat. But the 
directorship is unique. A business might put a woman at the top, but it's still 
a business: She's succeeded in "a man's world." If a museum puts a woman at the 
top, however, culture's feminine aura is visibly -- and unproductively -- 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's how the usually unconscious social dynamic seems to have 
worked to date. Perhaps, on the evidence of Philadelphia, Minneapolis and now 
Seattle, the repressive structure is finally beginning to change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion in the number and prominence of art museums in the United States 
since the 1960s has coincided with the slowly changing status of women in 
American society. Maybe the two tributaries are starting to flow together. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the Assn. of Art Museum Directors lists a whopping 20 eligible 
member institutions in the United States that are in the market for directors. 
Many are smaller, but some are among the largest and most prestigious around. 
These include New York's eminent Museum of Modern Art, Boston's venerable 
Museum of Fine Arts and Baltimore's important Walters Art Gallery. It also 
includes the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which may have had its share of 
woes in the last 18 months or so but nonetheless ranks among the most important 
venues anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The high vacancy rate is explained in many ways, most commonly by the degree 
to which the job has become a grueling and unenviable task of nonstop 
fundraising, which wears directors down. Meanwhile, many grumble about a dearth 
of fresh talent available for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely one reason for the perception that the talent pool is small and hard to 
fill is that, when the all-important search for a director is launched, a 
significant proportion of potentially outstanding candidates just don't come to 
mind as viable. 
</P>
<P>
 The art museum's glass ceiling slides quietly into place.

MOVIES; THE MYSTICAL ISABEL ALLENDE; THE CHILEAN-BORN WRITER'S FIVE NOVELS HAVE 
INTRIGUED HOLLYWOOD, BUT SHE NEVER FELT THEY WERE DESTINED TO BE MOVIES. THEN 
SHE TOOK A CHANCE ON DIRECTOR BILLE AUGUST'S VISION FOR 'THE HOUSE OF THE 
SPIRITS' -- AND MADE PEACE WITH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAISE SIMPSON, Blaise Simpson is a free-lance writer based in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isabel Allende is in an enviable position. At 51, the Chilean-born novelist is 
internationally admired, with five bestsellers already published in 27 
languages and a sixth book on the way. And soon her audience will be even 
wider, thanks to the imminent release of two films based on her novels: "The 
House of the Spirits" (starring Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons and Winona Ryder, 
opening Friday) and "Of Love and Shadows" (which will open later this year). 
</P>
<P>
 But although Allende is poised for newfound cinematic fame, don't imagine that 
it is because she has courted Hollywood's attention. On the contrary, when the 
U.S. publication, in 1985, of "The House of the Spirits" created interest among 
agents and producers, Allende put the kibosh on the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not very impressed, to tell you the truth," she explains in an 
interview in her work studio here. "I had the feeling that most of the offers 
were from producers or directors who just wanted to get the option so that 
nobody else could make the movie, not because they had a vision of it or any 
interest in the story. It's a very complicated story, and I didn't think it was 
possible to make it into a comprehensible film." 
</P>
<P>
 And several years later, when Bille August, the Danish director of the Academy 
Award-winning "Pelle the Conqueror," approached Allende about making the film, 
she flatly turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't pay any attention," Allende says with a laugh. "He just came to San 
Francisco, rented a theater and showed me 'Pelle.' I was very impressed. 
Afterward we had a cup of coffee, and within 20 minutes I realized that he was 
totally in love with the story of 'The House of the Spirits.' He knew the book 
by heart, all the characters, everything. And he had a very clear vision of how 
that could be turned into a two-hour movie." 
</P>
<P>
 August's vision did not include much of the surrealist imagery that Allende's 
work is known for. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very clear about what could be done and what could not be done," she 
says. "He said that all the magic elements of the book would have to be 
eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 The director defends his decision as a way of making the film believable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a question of balance all the time because supernatural effects in a 
movie can look ridiculous, and it becomes a sort of special-effects story," 
August explains. "Since the story deals with such powerful realism as well, we 
decided to do it this way." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is nearly heretical, considering just how important magical realism 
-- the dreamlike Latin American literary style pioneered by Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez -- is to Allende's book and, in fact, to her own life. Her work space, 
in a former coach house just across a cobblestone alley from the law offices of 
her second husband, William Gordon, reflects the fantasy of her imagination. 
Antique embroidery, folk carvings and clay artifacts that look as if they were 
unearthed by Indiana Jones are mounted above doorways and the fireplace mantle. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of first editions of her books straddle long shelves on a wall behind her 
desk. Allende herself is petite and lovely, dressed like one of her heroines in 
a long green velvet gown with a wispy black vest thrown over it. Verdigris 
pendants in the shape of tiny tree frogs, moons and stars dangle from her 
earrings. Her warmth and good humor are infectious, but she is also intensely 
focused, a New Age earth mother with the mental acuity of a Harvard MBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The House of the Spirits" spans three generations of a mythic South American 
family, the Truebas, that closely resembles Allende's own. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins shortly after the turn of the century with a romance between the 
autocratic patriarch, Esteban Trueba, and Clara, his clairvoyant wife, then 
moves on through decades and innumerable plot twists into a disturbing present 
in which Esteban's leftist-leaning granddaughter is arrested and tortured by a 
right-wing dictatorship that threatens to destroy both the family and their 
country. The similarity between the story and its characters and Allende -- the 
niece of the former Marxist president of Chile, Salvador Allende Gossens, who 
was assassinated 21 years ago during a coup -- and her family is undeniable 
even if some of the details are quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is loosely based on my family," she acknowledges. "It started as a sort of 
a chronicle of the family, but in the very first paragraph I realized that 
fiction had taken over." 
</P>
<P>
 So Allende's great-aunt did not have green hair, as does Clara's sister, Rosa 
the Beautiful, in the book, and her grandfather was not a rapist and murderer 
like Esteban. Nor could her grandmother play the piano with the lid over the 
keys, as Clara does in the novel. 
</P>

 "But she could move the ashtray without touching it," Allende allows, warming 
to talk of her remarkable clan. "She practiced telepathy all her life and had 
premonitions in dreams. The Catholic Church was then very powerful and they did 
not approve of this. My grandfather, who was a very conservative Catholic, did 
not think it was dangerous or sinful; he just didn't like it very much, because 
it was not scientific. Then one day, my grandmother came up with the idea that 
maybe it was not the souls of the dead that moved the three-legged table -- it 
was the extraterrestrials. And then my grandfather approved, because that was 
scientific, and from then on he participated in the seances. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the kind of family I come from," she says, laughing. "I didn't have 
to invent anything." 
</P>
<P>
 As her book became more popular, Allende says, she noticed that members of her 
family became more and more like the characters in it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the fiction has replaced the real story of the family, and we live this 
sort of fantasy that these things happened. When I saw the movie, I realized 
immediately that the fiction of the film is 10 times bigger than the fiction of 
the book. Very soon we will have the photographs of Jeremy Irons and Meryl 
Streep on the piano. They will be my grandparents. I will have all these famous 
people as my relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Allende does have some other strong feelings seeing Streep, Irons, Ryder, 
Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave cast in such a quintessentially Latin story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that (August) chose such an Anglo-looking cast. Everybody is 
so blond ," she says with a shrug. "But it is true that in Latin America, the 
upper classes look very European." 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave, who plays the matriarch, Nivea, describes Allende's work as a story 
that is not related only and specifically to one country but to many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, after all, why have millions of people in every country read this 
book?" she asks. "The essence of what I have to do in this role is not 
connected with trying to convince anybody that I'm Latin American. It's to do 
with what kind of a person is this lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd Eichinger, head of Constantin Films and producer of "The House of the 
Spirits," says: "You need stars in this movie because the characters are bigger 
than life. The film is set in a realistic environment, but it is more in the 
tradition of the movies that we did with big stars in the '50s." Eichinger 
feels strongly that August's sensibilities were right for "The House of the 
Spirits" and has just begun another film project with the director, based on 
"Smilla's Sense of Snow," the best-selling novel by Peter Hoeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the differences in their backgrounds, Allende was comfortable passing 
the reins of the film to a Scandinavian director "because I like the restrained 
passion of the Scandinavians -- you know there is a lot going on, but you don't 
see it on the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do criticisms from some in the Latin American community about the European 
bent of the film and director disturb her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say this is not my movie; this is Bille August's movie," she says. "I write 
a book, and I feel that the book is mine as long as it is sitting on that desk. 
But then one day it is published, and the very moment you publish it, you give 
it away. It is gone! It is a creature that has its own life." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she adds, "I don't intend to write Latin American stories. I try to 
write universal stories. The way we are and the way we live and the great 
passions and dramas and tragedies are always the same. The fact that they are 
set in Chile or Venezuela or California doesn't mean much." 
</P>
<P>
 Allende is herself a film buff, with "Schindler's List" and "The Crying Game" 
among her recent favorite movies. She also admires the way books by Brazilian 
novelist Jorge Amado were made into the films "Gabriela" and "Dona Flor and Her 
Two Husbands" and the smooth translation that Laura Esquivel's "Like Water for 
Chocolate" made to the screen. While she likens "The House of the Spirits" to 
epic films like "Dr. Zhivago" and "Fanny and Alexander," she says "Of Love and 
Shadows" is more like a Costa-Gavras thriller.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like 'Missing' or 'The Official Story' -- it has that tone," she says. 
"One thing I have learned as a writer is that every story has a rhythm, a way 
of being told. My first novel ("House of Spirits") has the tone of old things, 
told and retold. The second story ("Of Love and Shadows") is based on a 
political crime that really happened in Chile in 1973, and the tone of the book 
is very journalistic." 
</P>
<P>
 She is also wise enough to realize that in film, the director has the last 
word: 
</P>
<P>
 "Films are dialogue and action; you don't use language as you do in a book. 
The wonderful part about literature is that you use the reader's imagination, 
experience and sensibility to create an atmosphere. In a movie, you are trapped 
in a chair and you watch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Of Love and Shadows," directed by Betty Kaplan and starring a mostly Latin 
cast, will be released by Miramax later this year. The story came from 
Allende's own experiences as a young journalist in Chile and in Venezuela, 
where she fled after her uncle was deposed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It represents a time after the military coup in 1973," she says. "I left 
Chile in 1975, so for a year and a half I lived in this state of terror, and I 
was a journalist and knew what was going on and I could not write about it 
because of the tremendous censorship. Later, when I was living in Venezuela, I 
heard about the bodies that had been found in an abandoned mine in Chile. Among 
the bodies were five members of the same family -- a father and four sons. And 
for five years the women of the family looked for them, asking in concentration 
camps and prisons and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day they were called to the morgue and they could identify some keys, a 
comb, hair, a piece of a blue sweater, some bones. They were lucky because most 
relatives of los desaparecidos (the disappeared) never find anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the political murders haunted Allende for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the time came to write my second novel I did not have to think about it; 
the thing was there," she says. "That's why when I saw the movie, I felt so 
rewarded. The movie conveys the emotions, the fear, the love, the lust. I was 
really touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Allende's own life has been marked by tragedy, most recently and terribly by 
the death, last year, of her 28-year-old daughter, Paula, of complications 
brought on by a rare hereditary disease, porphyria. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in a coma for a year and I brought her home and took care of her," 
Allende says, stifling tears. "That changed my life and my writing completely. 
It is as if one life stopped and another starts. A life quite different from 
the other one, and Paula is the guide. She's the guide because when she was 
like a doll in the bed, I could only communicate with her in dreams, 
spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 She is almost finished with a memoir in which her daughter figures strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back to every moment of that awful year and writing about it forces me 
to revise who I am," she says. "Why do I write? For whom do I write?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before, Allende says, her books seemed to have messages yet she never thought 
very intensely about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, for the first time, I know that it is the message that I have to tell, 
and I have to find a way of telling it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the memoir is finished, Allende wants to attempt a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the right time now, but I would like to learn the craft, because 
you can do with movies what you can never do with literature," she says. "You 
reach an audience that is a million times greater, and the impact that a movie 
has in one afternoon is so much greater than a book can have in a hundred 
years. And then in a movie you have elements that you never have in literature. 
You have music, you have the wonderful acting. If you have good actors, you 
have what they create for each character." 
</P>
<P>
 But wouldn't she miss the opportunity to layer her writing with the 
extraordinary descriptions and detail she is known for? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I wouldn't, because I am good at telling the story and all the rest is 
work," she states. "What I love is to spell out the story in the first draft 
and then afterward I spend years, sometimes, creating the atmosphere, working 
with every word, every adjective, to make it" -- she pauses, searching for the 
right adjective -- "efficient. That takes a lot of time and work, and sometimes 
it's not as interesting as just telling the story."

 In March, filming will begin on "Devil in a Blue Dress," a movie starring 
Denzel Washington, to be directed by Carl Franklin, who directed the critically 
acclaimed "One False Move." This news in and of itself is unremarkable, except 
when one considers the film's source. "Devil in a Blue Dress" was originally a 
book written by Walter Mosley, the first installment of a detective series 
featuring the character Easy Rawlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rawlins, a recently unemployed aircraft worker in post-World War II 
South-Central Los Angeles who stumbles into the world of murder, graft and 
seduction, presents an obviously inviting film role for any number of actors 
(Danny Glover and Laurence Fishburne both expressed early interest in the 
role), history shows that the chances of such novels becoming movies are about 
as likely as Sam Spade pouring himself a stiff Shirley Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles are sometimes practical ones, sometimes artistic. But if cult 
followers of such best-selling gumshoes as Kinsey Milhone, Dave Robicheaux, 
Jimmy Flannery and Kay Scarpetta are waiting hopefully for their heroes to hit 
the big screen, they may want to find a good book. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a long, happy history of popular mystery books becoming popular 
films; in fact, an entire cinematic genre, film noir, was based on literary 
antecedents. The novels and serialized detective stories known to French 
critics of the 1940s as "Fleuve Noir" and "Serie Noir" featured the work of 
such authors as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain and Horace 
McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several film noir classics were based on best-selling mysteries, including 
Cain's novels "Double Indemnity" (co-written for the screen by Chandler) and 
"The Postman Always Rings Twice"; Chandler's "Farewell, My Lovely" (released as 
"Murder My Sweet"), "Lady in the Lake," "The Long Goodbye" and "The Big Sleep" 
-- all featuring detective Philip Marlowe; Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon"; 
Mickey Spillane's "I, the Jury," "Kiss Me Deadly" and "The Long Wait"; Donald 
E. Westlake's "The Outfit," "Point Blank" and "The Split" (the latter two 
released as "The Hunter" and "The Seventh"), and Graham Greene's "Ministry of 
Fear" and "This Gun for Hire." 
</P>
<P>
 Although revisionists lament a dearth of modern-day noir novelists, a 
respectable number of authors have witnessed successful film adaptations of 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Jim Thompson, who wrote in the 1950s, was adapted for the screen 
in 1990 in Stephen Frears' "The Grifters" and most recently, if less 
spectacularly, in the remake of "The Getaway," starring Kim Basinger and Alec 
Baldwin; Ross MacDonald's detective Lew Archer was portrayed by Paul Newman and 
renamed in "Harper" (taken from the novel "The Moving Target") and "The 
Drowning Pool"; and Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter -- OK, he's not exactly a 
P.I. we root for -- appeared in Michael Mann's 1986 film "Manhunter" before his 
reprise in "The Silence of the Lambs."  
</P>
<P>
 Six Elmore Leonard novels have been adapted for the screen, among them "Stick" 
(starring Burt Reynolds), "Cat Chaser" (directed by Abel Ferrara) and "52 
Pick-Up" (directed by John Frankenheimer). And "The Big Clock," originally 
directed from Kenneth Fearing's novel by John Farrow in 1948, was remade in 
1987 as "No Way Out" starring Kevin Costner. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, studio floors are littered with books (make that treatments of synopses 
of adaptations of books) whose characters, plot lines, dialogue and hordes of 
faithful readers seemingly have the makings of an automatic green light but 
seem indefinitely stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alec Baldwin read "Heaven's Prisoners," published in 1988, he "fell in 
love with the character" of Dave Robicheaux, says Patricia Karlan, who 
represents author James Lee Burke. Robicheaux is a former New Orleans detective 
who now solves mysteries from his bayou bait shop. Baldwin optioned the book 
with Orion, but when the studio dissolved in 1991 the deal did too. (Only last 
month, after six years of development limbo, did the project finally get back 
on track; filming is expected to start later this spring for Savoy, with 
Baldwin starring.) 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Demi Moore was attracted to the character Kay Scarpetta, the 
Richmond, Va., chief medical examiner invented by Patricia Cornwell in the book 
"Cruel and Unusual." The author elected not to sign a contract with the 
actress, instead waiting for the fifth book of the Scarpetta series, "Body 
Farm," to come out in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Two books in the series starring Chicago ward heeler Jimmy Flannery by Robert 
Campbell -- both popular and critical successes -- have been optioned but not 
yet made. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are a slew of contemporary mystery writers whose names have so 
far been missing from the movie marquee, among them James Crumley, Ross Thomas, 
T. Jefferson Parker, Robert Ferrigno, Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller and James T. 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Which may be a blessing, considering the underwhelming film adaptations some 
novels have suffered. Tony Hillerman's "The Dark Wind" was made into a feature 
starring Lou Diamond Phillips and directed by Errol Morris in 1991. Although it 
was released theatrically in Europe, it went straight to video in this country, 
all but disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Redford still owns the rights to the rest of the Hillerman series, 
which features Navajo Police Lt. Jim Chee and Sgt. Joe Leaphorn. Redford has 
declared his intention to direct the next title, "A Thief of Time," for which a 
screenplay is still in development. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Why do so many detective series novels -- which would seem to have built-in 
audiences -- founder on the shoals of development or, worse, those of bad 
movies? One need only consider the fate of "V.I. Warshawski," the hapless film 
starring Kathleen Turner based on the popular series by Sara Paretsky, to 
understand just how many a slip there can be between a book and a script. While 
Paretsky's books consistently stay for weeks at the top of the book charts, the 
film grossed only an embarrassing $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lawrence Block, whose novels feature detective Matt Scudder, wrote "8 
Million Ways to Die" and "Burglar," both made into feature films. When asked if 
he was pleased with the film version of "8 Million Ways to Die," the author 
responded, "I can't say that I was. But I think it was a picture you could have 
disliked even if you didn't happen to have written the book." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the 1986 film, which starred Jeff Bridges and Andy Garcia, 
changed the story's location from New York to Los Angeles, "and the story was 
as much about New York as anything else," he said. New York was even the source 
for the title, which the filmmakers were going to change "until they fished 
around and decided that the population of L.A. County is somewhere around 8 
million, and no one knows or cares what it is anyway, so they can say that it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Locations were also switched in Block's "Burglar," from New York to San 
Francisco. But that wasn't as salient to Block as the fact that his lead 
character, Bernie Rhodenbarr, a white male in the book, was played by Whoopi 
Goldberg. "That gave one pause," he says. "It made the change of locale seem 
pretty minor, like a costume change." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admits "I haven't been knocked out by the movies that have been 
made" of his books, he says, "I have by no means been sorry that they have been 
made. I don't think there's any reason why pleasing the author should be the 
first order of priority for a film company." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Willeford has had better luck. Willeford created the Miami police 
detective Hoke Mosely, who first appeared in "Miami Blues." The book, which was 
published in 1984, was made into a movie produced by Jonathan Demme, written 
and directed by George Armitage, and starring Fred Ward, Alec Baldwin and 
Jennifer Jason Leigh, in 1990. Although not a box-office blockbuster, the film 
had a fast pace, quirky humor and stylistic flourish consistent with 
Willeford's books. (Although Willeford died before the movie was made, his 
widow was an adviser to the filmmakers.)  
</P>
<P>
 Asked why more pop detective novels don't become movies, the author's agent, 
Jim Trupin, said, "I'll leave that to the committee that puts together the 
scripts. With 'Miami Blues,' Armitage and Demme didn't tangle with the story 
line -- they really followed it. But often, the final shooting script bears 
almost no resemblance to the original story." 
</P>
<P>
 The other books of the Mosely series -- "New Hope for the Dead," "Sideswipe" 
and "The Way We Die Now" -- have not been optioned, says Trupin. "We've had 
offers that we rejected, because we didn't want to sell off the character 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Character rights are a crucial issue for series novelists considering film 
deals. Carolyn Heilbrun, who writes the Kate Fansler detective series under the 
name Amanda Cross, "cares a lot about how they treat her precious Kate," says 
the author's agent, Ellen Levine. "Who plays her is very important, because the 
books are very feminist." Although Dixie Carter had once optioned the books and 
"people have come forward from time to time," says Levine, the series is 
currently not under option. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, fictional detectives have a better chance of showing up on 
television than in feature films: Witness SpenserB. Fletcher -- even the Saint. 
And thanks to the redoubtable BBC, we now have televised analogues of Sherlock 
Holmes, Horace Rumpole, Adam Dalgliesh, George Smiley, Chief Inspector Morse, 
Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wariness of losing control of a character in perpetuity is chief, the 
petards on which these books have been hoist are often the same as for anything 
caught in the circle of hell reserved for projects in development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scripts don't turn out well, the actors you want aren't available, the 
budgets are too high," says Joel Gotler, president of Renaissance, a 
literary/talent agency. Gotler represents Michael Connelly, once a crime 
reporter for the Los Angeles Times, and Gar Haywood, whose Aaron Gunner book 
series was just optioned by Spike Lee.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like musical chairs," Gotler says. "The right book with the right script 
with the right actor at the right time will hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly's first two books, "The Black Echo" and "The Black Ice," were 
recently optioned by Robert Rehme and Mace Neufeld for Paramount. Although "The 
Black Echo," about Los Angeles policeman Hieronymus Bosch, was bought in 
manuscript form, most new books must be bestsellers or have large orders from 
bookstores and book clubs to be considered demographically viable, said Gotler. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that novels seem to be less popular material these days for screen 
adaptation "has to do with the fact that there really aren't the equivalents of 
people like Hammett and Chandler writing now," says Alain Silver, editor of 
"Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style." "It also has to 
do with the fact that buying underlying rights and options to the rights of 
novels is relatively more expensive than original scripts." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent filmmakers, looking to European markets to recoup economically, 
often make thriller and neo-noir movies they know will succeed on that 
continent, says Silver. And often, they will make a pastiche on a noir classic 
-- "Double Indemnity," say, or "The Postman Always Rings Twice" -- without 
bothering to obtain the rights first.  
</P>
<P>
 Ed Victor, a London-based agent who represents Raymond Chandler's literary 
estate, says, "It's a problem especially with the Chandler estate. Because he 
was so original and therefore so copied, people think it's in the public 
domain, as if all that hardboiled detective stuff came down from the mountain 
carved on tablets and not written by a living, breathing person who has 
relatives who make money from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor continues, "There's not much of Chandler's to sell -- they're all tied 
up," but some of Chandler's books will be available "in a couple of years" when 
their copyrights are recaptured by the estate. "So we will have an opportunity 
to make another version of, let's say, 'Farewell, My Lovely.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that all of Chandler's books have been made into films "except one, 
which started life as a screenplay, which is in the very center of development 
hell." He is referring to the shelved film version of "Poodle Springs," a novel 
written by Robert B. Parker based on a few chapters of "The Poodle Springs 
Story" that Chandler left when he died in 1959. "We sold the film rights for 
rather a lot of money to Universal," says Victor. 
</P>
<P>
 Five scripts later -- three by Academy Award winner Michael Blake and two by 
playwright Tom Stoppard -- the film, which was made by Australian director 
Jocelyn Moorehouse but shelved by Universal, is still unreleased.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's madness," says Victor. "Here's a terrific novel by Robert Parker, based 
on Raymond Chandler, with a fabulous script by Tom Stoppard. It's an undone 
Chandler; there are all kinds of people who could play a completely new Philip 
Marlowe -- Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner. Think of all the great Marlowes -- 
Robert Mitchum, Dick Powell. (Marlowe has also been played by Humphrey Bogart, 
Robert Montgomery, Elliott Gould and James Garner.) And they start screwing 
around with it. I give up." 
</P>

 Jesse Beaton, co-producer of "Devil in a Blue Dress," read the book in 1990, 
when it came out in hardcover. "I immediately called to see if the rights were 
available," she says, "and of course they had been snapped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaton, who produced "One False Move" for Carl Franklin, followed the 
property's progress assiduously, until it landed in a friend's hands at 
Universal. Coincidentally, when she and Franklin were filming the HBO series 
"Laurel Avenue" in St. Paul, Minn., Walter Mosley was in town for a book 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl and I got in a car and tore down to the store," she says. After standing 
in line to get books signed, they finally met the author and an "instant 
rapport" developed. The deal was sealed at TriStar after Universal gave up its 
rights to it. 
</P>
<P>
 As director, Franklin won't rely on such classic noir devices as "the femme 
fatale, the smoky sets and the light pouring through Venetian blinds," he says. 
Instead, says Franklin, who also wrote the script, "I want to go further into 
the story and flesh out the characters and the era. Instead of being derivative 
of a genre, I'd rather get into the history of 1948 Los Angeles and post-World 
War II America." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the deracinated heroes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, 
he says, Easy "is very specifically drawn. He's a black man overcoming fear in 
1948, in de jure segregated America -- and fear on many levels: Not just of 
racist society, but of compromising himself and becoming like his alter ego, of 
killing again after the war, of being in business for himself."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Easy's filmic potential was clear to Beaton and Franklin, in a city 
where the pitch is all, are books becoming obsolete? "The problem," says 
Patricia Karlan, James Lee Burke's film agent, "is that there are so many 
screenwriters in Hollywood who have ideas for movies that become sequels. 
There's a feeling of, 'Why do we need to be buying books when we can do "Lethal 
Weapon" without them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Saxon, who with Jonathan Demme produced "Miami Blues" and "The Silence 
of the Lambs" and is producing "Devil in a Blue Dress," points to the 
irreplaceable qualities of books and their authors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be phenomenal movie set-pieces," he says. "Think of those great 
interrogation scenes between Clarice and Hannibal Lecter. That's the great 
thing about great books -- they're often great blueprints for screenplays. You 
have great dialogue, great characters, fascinating situations, before the 
screenwriter sits down to apply that extra discipline that it takes to make a 
great screenplay. It can be tremendously additive to the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxon adds that because of this, the sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs" will 
happen only when Tom Harris finishes his next book "because we're not smart 
enough to think up those great things Hannibal Lecter says." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxon says that the potential for Clarice Sterling to become the female James 
Bond may be slim ("Tom seems to be sticking with his villain"). But there is 
always a chance that the next Bond of either gender is out there. And while 
Hollywood looks for him or her, it can be very good to some writers. Authors 
are typically paid anywhere between $1,000 to $25,000 for an option -- for 
which producers reserve the right to make a movie from one book and put a hold 
on the character for a certain period of time, usually three years -- and then 
10 times that amount if the movie is actually made. If an option runs out, the 
author gets the rights back, and is free to make another deal. In fact, 
Lawrence Block's first book made into a movie, "Deadly Honeymoon" (retitled 
"Nightmare Honeymoon"), stayed in what was for him development heaven for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody could option it, nobody could figure out how to make it," he says. 
"But it was making a living for me forever." It's a great deal for writers, he 
says, "as long as they don't make the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar signs make tempting stand-ins for the creative muse. Agent Timothy 
Knowlton at Curtis Brown Associates, who represents Tony Hillerman, says, "I'm 
constantly telling authors that they shouldn't be writing books as movies; they 
should be writing them as books. And if, somehow, it turns into a movie, all 
the better, perhaps. It might turn into a movie and leave a huge taste of 
disappointment in the author's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to avoid such an unpalatable result, James Lee Burke maintains a 
philosophical attitude. "It's one of those decisions you have to make about 
control, not simply in your art but in your life," said the author recently 
from his home in Louisiana. "The author has to make a commitment in terms of 
trust, let go of it, and not look back with regret." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley is confident that the artistic control he is surrendering is in good 
hands. "Carl Franklin is more of a storyteller than a filmmaker, in a way," he 
said from New York. "He's worried more about character development than he is 
about the gloss of the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he demurred from discussing the financial details of his movie deal 
(two other Easy Rawlins mysteries, "White Butterfly" and "A Red Death," were 
optioned along with the first book), he admitted, "I'm not unhappy. I'm not 
rich, either -- but I'm not unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter the price, there are those authors who will always be chary of 
the limits Hollywood puts on their work, whether in mangling story lines, 
pigeonholing characters forever, or otherwise alchemizing art and commerce into 
an unholy brew. Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley was played by Dennis Hopper in 
Wim Wenders' "The American Friend," a 1977 screen adaptation of the series' 
first novel, "The Talented Mr. Ripley." (Highsmith's novel "Strangers on a 
Train" was co-written for Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 film by Raymond Chandler.) 
But that was the last of Ripley we'll see on screen for now, says Knopf editor 
Gary Fisketjon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while I'll get a call from some nitwit out there all geared 
up saying, 'Can we have lunch at the Ivy and do a deal?' " he says. "But 
nothing ever comes of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Highsmith insists in her contracts that producers can't "say it's connected to 
her work just by giving her $500,000, and then make 'Sister Act 3' out of her 
book," said the editor, "which is a reasonable demand, except to the lawyers, 
to whom it is an unreasonable demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the author most adamant about keeping her novels purely on paper is 
Sue Grafton, writer of the phenomenally popular alphabet series starring Kinsey 
Milhone, the latest installment of which, "K Is for Killer," will be published 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is simply the result of the fact that I worked in Hollywood for 
15 years," said Grafton, who wrote screenplays for films and television 
including, with her husband, Steven Humphrey, movie-of-the-week adaptations of 
Agatha Christie's "A Caribbean Mystery" and "Sparkling Cyanide." "I created 
Kinsey Milhone as an escape hatch, so the idea of turning around and selling 
her back to them makes no sense."  
</P>
<P>
 Grafton adds that she would lose readers, "and rightly so," when an actress 
were cast because one person could never jibe with her fans' myriad ideas of 
who Kinsey is. "And here's how those contracts read," adds Grafton. "You sell a 
character 'in perpetuity, throughout the universe in technologies known and 
technologies yet to be invented.' That's serious stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 Will Kinsey be doing lunch at the Ivy once she has safely solved "Z Is for 
Zero"? "I've made my children sign a blood oath that they will never sell her 
to Hollywood, and I told them that if they ever try it, I will come back from 
the grave," Grafton says. "Which they know I can do."

THEIR FAVORITE MOVIES NO LONGER A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The dearth of current mystery movies notwithstanding, popular mystery authors 
had no trouble naming their favorite mystery movies of all time: 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Mosley, creator of detective Easy Rawlins, who appears in "Devil in a 
Blue Dress," among other books: "The Maltese Falcon" -- "Because it's the right 
blend of noir and comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Muller, creator of San Francisco gumshoe Sharon McCone, protagonist in 
"There's Nothing to Be Afraid Of" and other works: "The Big Sleep" (the 1946 
original) -- "It captured the spirit of the book so very well. The dialogue was 
practically taken word for word from the novel, and, of course, Chandler's 
dialogue was so wonderful to begin with. The characters were just like seeing 
the characters in the book. They came right off the page." 
</P>
<P>
 James Lee Burke, creator of Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux, who appears in 
"Heaven's Prisoners" and other books: "All the Presidents' Men" -- "That was an 
important film because it told the story of people who were in effect trying to 
steal the Constitution. . . . A film that is called a mystery film is probably 
not going to be a very good film. Even Hitchcock films, which were often called 
mysteries, were a lot more than that -- they were an investigation into 
psychological terror. Once you put labels on things, they're no good." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Cornwell, creator of medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, in "Body of 
Evidence" and other works: "The Silence of the Lambs" -- "Because it faithfully 
adhered to the novel, and because of the brilliant performances of Anthony 
Hopkins and Jodie Foster." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Hillerman, creator of Navajo policeman Jim Chee in novels including "The 
Dark Wind": "Presumed Innocent" -- "I got so totally caught up in both the 
characters and the plot that when I got to the end and the truth comes out, it 
just came as a complete surprise -- and that's what makes a good mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kellerman, creator of psychologist Alex Delaware, who appears in 
"Devil's Waltz" and other works: "D.O.A." (the 1949 original) -- "It was just a 
scary and bizarre movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Grafton, creator of detective Kinsey Milhone, star of the alphabetized 
series that includes "J Is for Judgment": "Blade Runner" -- "Because it is so 
atmospheric and has the same sort of 1940s tone that Raymond Chandler evokes in 
his books." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Rendell, British mystery writer and creator of the series featuring Chief 
Inspector Wexford: "Rosemary's Baby" -- "For strange reasons. I think it's very 
well acted; I think there are things in it that are very tantalizing and 
suspenseful. . . . I like the fact that it is in New York, and I think in a way 
I deplore it because it's a child they subject to this. It is so exciting, in a 
way so terrible and so exciting." MONICA YANT

FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF BRAZIL; IN A COUNTRY PLAGUED BY SCANDAL AND RULED BY 
THE ELITE, AN HONEST COMMON MAN THREATENS TO TURN POLITICS INSIDE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

magazine and is a frequent commentator on American culture for the BBC.

<P>
 There are places you only visit when you're running for office or writing 
about someone who is. Such a place is Roraima (pronounced Roe-RYE-mah ), the 
Brazilian state known to the outside world, if it is known at all, for being 
home to the last of the Stone Age tribes, most famously the Yanomani. Although 
its capital, Boa Vista, affects an elegant modernity -- wide, untrafficked 
boulevards shoot like rays from an arch-shaped city center -- it's still a 
rambunctious gold-boom town filled with bars, brothels and starving children 
whom the authorities don't bother their heads about. Boa Vista is so far off 
the beaten track that even people who live a thousand miles up the Amazon think 
of this city as the middle of nowhere. On a clear day, you can see Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
 During the flight in, I'd been talking about the city with an affable 
professor of tropical diseases, who said, "Its name means 'beautiful view.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "And is it beautiful?" 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed sadly. "If you don't look at the city." 
</P>
<P>
 A photographer broke in, shaking his head. "Roraima is a place for garimpeiros 
-- prospectors. There are hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of minerals 
here. Everybody who comes here is digging for something." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled, proud of his own little joke; just a few rows behind us sat Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva, known by everyone simply as Lula, the charismatic 
socialist who's favored to become Brazil's next president when the two-round 
elections begin in the fall. Lula was heading to Roraima as part of his 
nationwide Caravana da Cidadania, or Citizenship Caravan, a euphemistic term 
for pre-campaign swing; he was prospecting for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 And what was I looking for in following him to a backwater where miners still 
massacre Indians? Nothing less than the future of Latin American politics. 
Lula's rise from a peasant's shack to the threshold of the presidential palace 
is one of the great political stories of our time -- a personal odyssey every 
bit as brave and historic as those made by Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was coming up on midnight when we finally saw lights, gaudy as Vegas after 
the black canopy of rain forest that had stretched below us for the last hour. 
The landing gear touched down, and before the door swung open, a lovely, eerie 
singing rose from the night: 
</P>
<P>
 Lu-la-lahhh.  
</P>
<P>
 Lu-la-lahhh.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Lula's theme song, a musical phrase as famous in Brazil as any bossa 
nova. The second-floor observation deck was filled with hundreds of Lula 
supporters, nearly all of them under 25, singing and laughing, draped over the 
parapet, waving every kind of banner and sign. Four-letter placards exclaiming 
"Lula!" Red-and-white banners bearing the initials PT, for Partido dos 
Trabalhadores, the Workers' Party. And, of course, signs reading "Feliz 1994" 
-- happy, because 1994 is the year they will get to elect Lula. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lula emerged from the plane, he raised his fist and the crowd roared -- 
they smelled a winner. As the PT vans drove us to the hotel, the kids 
hot-rodded alongside, honking and waving banners and shrieking into the night. 
The air was thick with the scent of burning rubber, soon to be replaced by the 
scent of gunpowder as people set off one Roman candle after another, tinting 
the treetops pink. Lula shook dozens of hands, laughing and calling his 
admirers campanheiro before finally going inside. The petistas (as the PT's 
followers are known) lingered in the driveway, setting off firecrackers and 
periodically breaking into a chant: " Ole, ole, ole, ola, Lu-la, Lu-LAH! " 
</P>
<P>
 And in the exhausting heat, which even after midnight wrapped itself around us 
like a barber's towel, I marveled at the passions raised by this short, hairy 
48-year-old man whose thick neck, powerful torso and spindly legs give him the 
physique of a cartoon bull. Squeezed into a cheap tan sport coat that would be 
fashionable nowhere, he had none of the shimmering charisma of JFK or Gorby. 
But the crowd didn't mind his lack of patrician style. That's part of what they 
loved about him. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of them, a son of the peasantry poised to become a new kind of 
president: a socialist, a democrat and a worker. If he wins, Lula will be South 
America's first elected president to come from the dispossessed classes. Like 
the Chiapas uprising or the voting-out of the neo-liberals in Venezuela, Lula's 
ascent challenges the official post-Cold War story line in which everyone is 
rushing to embrace free-market capitalism. ("I defend private property," he 
says, "'but for everybody. We cannot allow one man to own 25 million acres when 
others are starving.") Old-school communism may be dead, but the conditions 
that fostered it are still thriving, especially in Brazil, a country 
permanently on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype of the new Latin American leftist, Lula shatters all the cliches 
about wild-eyed revolutionaries. He's not a caudillo. He's not a guerrilla with 
bandoleers crisscrossing his chest. He's not even reflexively anti-American. 
(He has always opposed Soviet-style communism.) His party boasts some of 
Brazil's leading congressmen and mayors. It brings together tens of millions of 
supporters in a coalition of unionists, peasant farmers, rubber tappers, 
intellectuals, progressive priests, left-wing millionaires, activists and 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more democracy there is in Brazil," Lula says, "the better our chances of 
winning." That's why, the morning after our arrival in Boa Vista, the 
Citizenship Caravan drove two hours through dusty savannah punctuated by cashew 
trees and cracking, gray termite hills that resemble avant-garde sculptures. 
Our destination was the Maloca do Bismarck, central meeting place for the 
Macuxi tribe, whose members have no idea how such a Teutonic name was applied 
to this collection of open-air huts roofed with leaves from the naja plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the main hut, scabby-kneed kids ran around in T-shirts adorned with 
peculiar misspellings ("Vacatign Time!") and sneaker logos unknown to the 
industrialized West. Inside, the village elders reported on the state of the 
tribe, then turned the rally over to Lula, who rose and talked about the things 
he always talks about -- better health care and education, the social cost of 
corruption, the egregiously unfair distribution of wealth, the absolute need 
for land reform. But all politics is local politics, and the Macuxi were 
listening for what he said about Indians. They unleashed their most vigorous 
nods when Lula said that he would support their right to their lands "without 
vacillation." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good speech, and Lula held his audience easily, flaunting all the 
charisma I'd missed the previous night. Using no notes, he started softly, his 
gravelly bass voice working against his deliberateness, a slight lisp 
comporting oddly with his coiled physicality. As he went on, his tempo 
quickened, and he worked himself up, not hammy but focused, like Brando 
burrowing into an especially tasty scene. His finger jabbed, his hand made 
small circles (you noticed the missing little finger of his left hand, lost in 
a machine press) and, as a flush brightened his skin, his eyes became the 
smoldering black coals of a thousand romance novels -- he's not a person you 
want glaring at you. Lula spoke with the angry, barrelhouse directness of one 
who cut his teeth addressing the hard men in Sao Paulo union halls. By the end 
of the speech, he had reached the point I recognized from the television clips, 
when his impatience for change surrounds him like a white-hot aura. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry, impatient, direct -- was this the way to win an election in a country 
that prides itself on tropical good humor? I mentioned this to the professor on 
the airplane, Marcus Barros, who is also president of the Amazonian chapter of 
the PT. His eyes lost their smile, and he put his hand on my shoulder. "You 
have to understand. We've been waiting all our lives for this election. Now is 
the chance to change the history of this country. The same people have been 
running Brazil for the last 500 years. It finally has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST COUNTRY IN POPULATION (152 MILLION) AND AREA 
(slightly smaller than the United States), Brazil has the surreal expansiveness 
of a country that embraces the Amazon rain forest and the hardscrabble 
northeastern sertao , the Girl from Ipanema and the ugly sprawl of Sao Paulo 
with its umpteen million people. Such a vast, swirling country is impossible to 
get a handle on -- there are just too many stories. Small wonder that many 
commentators fall into the cliche of treating Brazil as the real-life version 
of its telenovelas, the nighttime soaps watched by everyone from millionaires 
to slum dwellers in the favelas.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is something delirious about the place. In Sao Paulo, people 
were laughing at the black-comic refinements of the latest corruption scandal. 
Explaining how he'd made $51 million from an $80,000-a-year job, Congressman 
Joao Alves got on the tube, clasped his hands and insisted he'd done nothing 
wrong -- God had helped him win the lottery 24,000 times. After a few days of 
such hijinks, I began to understand Charles de Gaulle's remark: "Brazil is not 
a serious country." 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends on what you mean by serious. There are 40 million Brazilians in 
absolute poverty, another 60 million living in squalor, many of them with jobs. 
There are millions of homeless children, the abandonados, and they are 
routinely murdered in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, often by policemen and 
paramilitary thugs paid by local businessmen. The minimum wage buys less than 
it did in 1940, and the distribution of income is far worse than India's. The 
inflation rate -- currently 2,751% a year -- makes simply buying one's 
groceries a brainteaser, and crime has reached the point where the middle-class 
sequesters itself in bunker-like enclaves, protected by armed sentries, while 
the poor crowd into some of the world's most dangerous slums. Even the 
legendary beaches are being destroyed. The vast majority of Brazilians live 
from hand to mouth, without money or power or hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of this catastrophe were planted centuries ago: Since the days of 
Portuguese control, Brazil's ruling elite has been notorious for its cruelty 
and greed. But the current mess has its immediate roots in the 1964 coup 
d'etat, when President Joao Goulart, a moderate reformer, was ousted by the 
military in the name of "order" and anti-communism, with the support of 
President Lyndon B. Johnson's Administration. For the first 15 years of the 
ditadura, the dictatorship, the Brazilian economy expanded by leaps and bounds, 
but most of the new wealth went to the elite and the emerging middle class. 
Brazil was becoming what they call "Belindia": a prosperous population the size 
of Belgium's surrounded by masses living in the misery one associates with 
India. In 1972, President General Emilio Garrastazu Medici described the 
situation memorably: "The economy is going well, the people not so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many brave souls stood up to the dictatorship, the military cracked 
down brutally; even today, everyone you meet knows someone who was bullied, 
jailed, tortured or driven into exile. As happened in the communist bloc, the 
Brazilian generals lost their grip when the economy began collapsing, and 
people began publicly challenging their authority. Perhaps the boldest of these 
challenges came in the late 1970s, from the Sao Paulo auto workers, whose union 
was led by the fiery young Lula. 
</P>
<P>
 Under duress, the generals announced the abertura , a gradual political 
opening, and in 1989, Brazil had its first direct presidential elections in a 
quarter of a century. But in the absence of a sturdy democratic tradition, the 
1989 campaign had a frantic, almost demented quality. Months into the campaign, 
the country was shaken by the entry of a new candidate, Silvio Santos, a TV 
variety-show host whose sweaty hucksterism made one yearn for the self-effacing 
sincerity of Jerry Lewis in mid-telethon. Santos promptly shot to the top of 
the polls and might well have won, had the courts not ruled that he'd filed 
improperly for the race. "After the dictatorship, we did not know how to have a 
politics," explains Andri Petry, a senior political editor at Veja, the 
Brazilian equivalent of Time magazine. "There were too many parties. Sometimes 
one man was a party. The people did not know how to understand a campaign, and 
the press did not know how to report it. That is how Collor won." 
</P>
<P>
 Petry is referring to Fernando Collor de Mello, the little-known governor of 
Alagoas who narrowly defeated Lula for the presidency. Collor's campaign cast 
him as a young, handsome outsider who wanted to go to Brasilia to fire overpaid 
bureaucrats ("maharajahs") and clean up corruption; a famous photo showed him 
with his pockets pulled out, demonstrating their honest emptiness. In fact, the 
crazy-eyed governor was a multimillionaire scion of the ruling class (his 
father once shot a man to death on the Senate floor but was never charged) and 
ran for president as the Menendez boys might buy a car. After taking office, 
Collor spent a year dazzling everyone with his vigor; he did karate, drove 
racing cars, jogged in T-shirts emblazoned with catch phrases about the Amazon. 
President George Bush compared him to Indiana Jones -- an embarrassing move, as 
it turned out. Enraged by a family squabble, Fernando's own brother Pedro went 
to the press and announced that President Collor had been peddling influence to 
the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Collor was impeached in 1992 but, true 
to the traditions of Brazilian justice, has never been charged with any crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Collor's dishonesty left the public shocked. The cynicism kicked in last 
October when it was revealed that nearly 20 members of the congressional budget 
committee had used their positions to make themselves rich. They stole $200 
million of federal money earmarked for charities. They pocketed millions in 
kickbacks from construction projects. They siphoned off millions meant for 
health care and education -- this in a land where most adults have only a 
grade-school education, and schoolteachers make barely $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 These high-octane scandals, plus scores of routine ones, have shaken public 
faith in politicians; a few idiots have begun making pleas for the good old 
days of the dictatorship. But according to Veja's Petry, such scandals have a 
positive side: "It is good for us to get over our illusions. Before, we thought 
it was only the generals who were the problem. Then we thought it was only 
Collor. Now we see that the corruption is all through the elite. We see the 
connections between the business elite and the political elite that we did not 
know before. We are no longer naive, and this is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly good for the PT, which has been at the forefront of 
investigating the congressional scandal -- none of its 37 members were accused. 
It has been even better for Lula himself. Before the scandal broke, he had been 
assailed for claiming that the Congress was filled with picaretas, chiselers. 
Now, Lula's claims as a truth teller are stronger than ever and his personal 
honesty even more of an asset. He's a worker who's never moved in the circles 
where big deals are cut and million-dollar bribes exchange hands. The PT pays 
him a salary of $24,000 a year; he lives in Sao Bernardo do Corpo, an 
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lula's a known quantity," says Petry. "He's been famous since the late '70s, 
and everybody knows he hasn't become rich. Even people who hate him know he is 
not a thief." 
</P>
<P>
 "HERE'S A CLASSIC STORY FOR YOU." THE SPEAKER IS ADRIAN COOPER, AN expatriate 
documentary filmmaker who's been filming Lula on and off since the late 1970s. 
"A couple of months ago, I was flying back from Belo Horizonte (Brazil's 
fourth-largest city), and I ran into Lula in the airport. He was all alone in a 
coffee-stained white suit, carrying his battered old bag, waiting for his 
flight home on Tam, a domestic airline with mostly prop planes. We went for a 
drink in the bar, and I remember thinking how amazing it was that this guy was 
probably going to be the president of Brazil next year, and here he was flying 
in his stained suit in an economy seat on a second-rate airline. It's so 
extraordinary, the difference that separates him from a man like Paulo Maluf 
(the mayor of Sao Paulo), who would always take a Lear jet or fly first-class 
-- he'd never rub shoulders with the masses. But then, that's Lula." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly the Lula of the public image, a man invariably described by his 
supporters as um brasileiro tipico , an ordinary Brazilian man. Of course, such 
a characterization is more than a little disingenuous: How many perfectly 
ordinary men have the talent and drive to approach the presidency of the 
world's fifth biggest country? Still, it's true that, like a much greater Jesse 
Jackson -- greater because he is less vain and more accomplished -- Lula is as 
much a metaphor as a man. He's lived a life that encapsulates the mythic 
trajectory of his whole country. To understand his rise is to understand 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Inacio da Silva was born in 1945 in the farming town of Garanhuns, in the 
perpetually poor northeastern state of Pernambuco; the youngest of nine 
children, he was given the nickname Lula (which was later officially added to 
his name for electoral purposes). Shortly after his birth, his father, 
Aristide, moved to the southern city of Santos, where jobs were more plentiful. 
When Lula was 7, Aristide returned to Pernambuco, put his family on the back of 
a truck and took them down south, a 13-day journey of 1,800 miles. In making 
this journey from the rural north to the urban south -- the great symbolic 
journey of modern Brazil -- Lula joined in a migration made by 30 million of 
his compatriots since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The family lived in a shantytown where Lula sold peanuts on the street and 
dreamed, like all Brazilian boys, of becoming a soccer star; at 11, he quit 
school to work in a laundry. When he was 13, he landed a job in a factory that 
made nuts and bolts, working a machine press from 7 in the morning to 7 at 
night. It may sound dreadful, but for a boy of Lula's background, this entry 
into the labor elite was an achievement comparable to a Kentucky coal miner's 
son getting a degree from Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the 1964 coup, Lula was working for Industrias Villares, a 
heavy-goods producer in Sao Bernardo do Campo. And despite the heated 
protestations of his brother Jose, a militant Communist, he was vehemently 
anti-union. Lula didn't so much as enter the union hall until 1967. Once he did 
go inside, however, he quickly became one of the union's leaders. By 1972, the 
year he married his current wife, Marisa Leticia (his first wife died of 
hepatitis), he was elected to the governing board of the Sao Bernardo 
Metalworkers Union. Within three years, he'd been elected union president, 
winning more than 90% of the votes from its 140,000 members. At 30, Lula 
already led the largest union in South America.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his position, he remained largely apolitical -- "a common union 
leader," he now says. All this changed when, in 1975, the military arrested his 
brother for being a "subversive." Rather than backing off, Lula was galvanized. 
By 1978, he was leading the Metalworkers Union in a labor action against the 
Scania truck company, the first full-fledged Brazilian strike in 10 years. 
Scania was forced to negotiate a pay raise for the workers, who at the time 
were making 60 cents an hour (compared to $8.65 in the United States). This 
success led to a series of more ambitious strikes that became a test of the 
government's authority. Lula become a household name, famous for his skill at 
rallying his troops, less known for softening their militant stridency. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper remembers "going to a football stadium filled with 80,000 metalworkers, 
all of whom desperately wanted to keep on with the action. Lula got up before 
them and explained why they shouldn't -- how it would be pushing beyond their 
strength and lead to disaster. Nobody in the stadium wanted to hear that -- 
they all wanted to keep striking -- but he eventually persuaded them with the 
clarity of his logic and the passion of his speech. By the end, the whole 
stadium was chanting 'Lu-lah, Lu-lah, Lu-lah.' I've never seen anything like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to negotiate with Lula, the government sentenced him to 3 1/2 years 
in prison on trumped-up "national security" charges. But the political winds 
had changed, and Lula's conviction was overturned on appeal. Back in the 
streets, he was free to take his next step -- the creation of a workers party, 
the PT. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized it was necessary in 1978," Lula says, "when I went to Congress to 
talk to the representatives. And I learned that of 480 representatives, only 
two were from trade unions. I asked myself, 'How can the Congress approve laws 
for the workers if all the representatives there represent the businessmen?' So 
we decided to create our own political organization." He snorts a laugh. "If 
I'd known that doing it would be so difficult, I possibly never would have 
tried." 
</P>
<P>
 It is always difficult to know exactly when something new has entered the 
world, but the creation of the Workers' Party on Feb. 10, 1980, may have been 
one of those moments. "The PT established itself as the first political party 
in the country's history that was not formed at the behest of the elite." So 
say Ken Silverstein and Emir Sader in "Without Fear of Being Happy," the best 
book in English on Lula and the PT. Their words are echoed by professor Jorge 
G. Castaneda, whose "Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left After the Cold 
War" sees the PT in an even larger context. "Lula's PT is a harbinger," he 
tells me from his office in Mexico City. "It may well be the new Latin American 
populism -- in the good sense of the term." 
</P>
<P>
 It took the PT years to expand its influence. In 1982, Lula ran for the 
governership of Sao Paulo state with the slogan "A Brazilian Like You" -- a 
phrase designed to attack the traditional authority of the elites. But at this 
point, the ordinary Brazilian was still so filled with a sense of inferiority 
that the slogan backfired: It was taken to mean, "A loser like you." Paunchy, 
kinky-haired and ungrammatical, Lula lacked the sable elegance that the masses 
associated with a real governor. Despite such setbacks, the party continued to 
water the grass roots, winning important mayorships and enlisting the fervent 
support of top agrarian reformers, prominent Roman Catholic priests (including 
the famous liberation theologian Leonardo Boff) and rain-forest activists such 
as the late Chico Mendes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the presidential election of 1989, the PT was ready to explode. After 
months of campaigning, the election came down to two men: the underdog, Lula, 
and the overwhelming favorite, Collor. It was a campaign to make the 
Clinton-Bush contest seem dignified. Although Collor, as a governor, had ended 
taxes on sugar companies that then backed his candidacy to the tune of $12 
million, the campaign centered on increasingly shrill charges against the PT's 
candidate. Lula, it was claimed, owned a JVC stereo; this proved he wasn't 
really a worker. Lula, it was claimed, would force middle-class families to 
give rooms in their homes to PT workers. Lula, it was claimed, was 
anti-democratic -- this despite his leading role in the democracy movement and 
Collor's own voluminous silence during the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lula whittled away at his opponent's lead, promising land reform and a 
higher minimum wage and calling down wrath on the corrupt elite. The race was a 
dead heat when Collor pulled a stunt that could have come from a telenovela. 
Days before the election, he arranged for Lula's ex-mistress, Miriam Cordeiro, 
to hold a press conference and accuse Lula of offering her money to abort the 
fetus that was to become their daughter Lurian (he has four children with his 
wife). All the evidence rebuts these charges -- Lula acknowledges paternity, 
Lurian's a PT activist, Cordeiro suddenly came into a lot of money -- but the 
attack threw Lula into a funk. He performed feebly in the last presidential 
debate, and specially edited lowlights of his performance were replayed over 
and over by TV Globo, the pro-Collor network watched by 70% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Collor won, 35 million votes to 31 million -- a triumph soon to be 
sullied by the man who enjoyed it. Yet even as the election showed that the PT 
had not fully arrived, it established Lula, only 44 years old, as the national 
alternative to the traditional political elite. The past 4 1/2 years have 
diminished neither his stature nor his savvy at wooing the middle class: His 
grammar is better, his beard more neatly trimmed, his suits more likely to be 
Italian. In recent polls that have him running against every possible candidate 
at once, Lula invariably receives 30% to 32% of the vote, more than twice the 
nearest opponent. He is, if anything, more popular than ever, both personally 
and as the embodiment of his party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an ordinary Brazilian guy, and that's his appeal," said Ricardo Kotscho, 
a shrewd, witty ex-journalist whose official title of press secretary masks a 
more profound role as Lula's buddy, confidant and jester. "Usually your 
Brazilian politicians are from the elite, the political elite or the cultural 
elite. Lula's the first one who comes from the people, and he already has much 
more than he ever dreamed of. So now he feels responsibility to do something 
about the injustice in Brazil. It's not that he's a saint. He's not. He's a 
man, um brasileiro tipico. If Lula was free to do whatever he wanted, it would 
be fishing, soccer, women and parties. And that's why people like him."  
</P>
<P>
 OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE LIKES LULA, OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE LOST THE 1989 
election. Late one smoggy afternoon, I stopped by Sao Paulo's City Hall to talk 
to the mayor, Paulo Maluf, who has twice run for president as the candidate of 
the Social Democratic Party, which was created by the dictatorship. Maluf is a 
dapper, funny man whose penchant for deliberate, cheerful buffoonishness -- his 
hoarse voice and full cheeks recall a thousand sendups of Don Vito Corleone -- 
can't hide his enormous shrewdness. Although coy about whether he would again 
seek the presidency, he was straightforward when it came to Lula and the PT. He 
couldn't imagine why anyone would vote for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lula's probably good at many things, but for being president" -- he wrinkled 
his brow ironically -- "he has no more experience than the average people. He 
never worked in business, private or public. He never was a director of a free 
enterprise or public enterprise. He never was a mayor. He never was on a city 
council. He never was a secretary of transportation or anything else. He never 
was a minister." Maluf rubbed his thumb along a desk the length of a 
shuffleboard court and gazed happily around his huge office with its 
scale-model version of a new public-works project. The problem, he said, isn't 
merely Lula himself: It's the limitations of his ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideas of the left are old-fashioned. Don't pay the public debt, don't pay 
the national debt, complete control of the banks -- this was a speech that was 
good 50 years ago. That's the reason they're not going to win the election. The 
PT was the government for four years in the city of Sao Paulo, and they lost 
the next election because of mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
 This view of Lula is shared by the elite and much of the middle class. Some of 
their disdain is mere snobbery toward any man with a working-class style and 
little formal education. But their main objection is economic. The PT wants to 
limit the size of landholdings, stop privatization of state industries, 
maintain trade barriers and find ways to redistribute wealth. These economic 
proposals will cost his opponents money and diminish their power. They also run 
counter to the neo-liberal orthodoxies of the West. There's considerable 
off-the-record nervousness about what a leftist government in Brasilia might do 
to the spread of free-market policies in South America. At the same time, most 
international financiers and U.S. State Department experts think that it's too 
early to be sure how radically Lula would actually govern. As one Latin 
American financial expert told me, "Reform governments have a way of coming 
back toward the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's economic elite isn't nearly so sanguine. The daily papers are filled 
with business leaders arguing that a Lula presidency will lead to stagnation, 
the ruination of trade, the end of luxury imports, capital fleeing the country. 
To reassure them, Lula has had 54 meetings with businessmen's groups to let 
them see firsthand that he's not o bicho-papao , the bogyman. In Boa Vista, I 
sat in on one such session with the Commercial Association of Roraima (located 
over a bridal shop) and was startled at how well he eventually got along with 
these small-city entrepreneurs, who clearly couldn't stand his economic plan. 
"I liked him," a store-owner said afterward. "I'm against him, but I liked 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to be the general attitude, whether in Roraima or Sao Paulo. The 
businessmen he meets plan to oppose him tooth and claw, but they respect his 
personal honesty and willingness to negotiate: They think he's a man you can do 
business with. What scares them is that Lula, who stands at both the figurative 
and ideological center of the PT, often cannot control his party's radical left 
wing, whose dogmatic zeal has gotten them dubbed "Shiites." It's this group 
that leads many middle-class Brazilians to fear that Lula's election will 
destroy the country's cruel but functioning balance, unloosing an even crueler 
chaos onto the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the presidential campaign won't hit its stride for several more 
months, Lula and the PT are expecting nonstop attacks between now and October, 
especially because the political right is floundering. All its potential 
candidates of national stature have been discredited; the right can't even 
field a dazzling unknown because Collor discredited that kind of dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponents' current disarray hasn't lulled the PT into a false sense of 
confidence. Its leaders know that anything is possible in Brazilian politics 
and that it would not be easy to defeat another left-of-center candidate, such 
as Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Whoever Lula's opponent, he will 
be backed by the most powerful men in Brazil. Baronial landowners who buy the 
votes of their peasant workers with shoes or food. Right-wing politicians such 
as Bahia's Gov. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who are expert at manipulating the 
government bureaucracy. Corporate magnates like Roberto Marinho, owner of the 
Globo media empire, whose support of Collor is widely believed to have swung 
the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 Every politician in the world gripes about the media, but in Lula's case the 
complaints are often justified. Headlines accuse Lula of crimes that the 
stories beneath them do not mention, much less justify. News programs trumpet 
every charge against him, even unsubstantiated smears by his political enemies. 
Last November, a small-time union boss named Oswaldo Cruz Jr. accused the PT of 
taking illegal campaign contributions from the Central Workers Union; over the 
next weeks, the papers never stopped implying that Lula was just as corrupt as 
any other politician. The story eventually petered out. Then in early January, 
Oswaldo was murdered. For the next week, the media were filled with 
insinuations that Lula had ordered him assassinated. TV Globo's nightly news 
show devoted seven or eight minutes each night to the crime and its possible 
links to Lula. Wishful thinking, as it turned out: The confessed murderer had 
killed Oswaldo in the course of a personal argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula has no illusion that he can win over the media, and it's unlikely that he 
would want to even if he could: He has a bracing blue-collar contempt for 
politicians who tart up their images for television. Yet virtues have a way of 
becoming vices, and Lula's hostility to image making might hurt his electoral 
chances in a country that gets its news from TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing captures the ambiguities of his relationship to the image-making 
process better than a brief exchange that occurred at Roraima's Lake 
Caracarana, where the Citizenship Caravan stopped for a few minutes after 
meeting the Macuxi tribe. Relaxed for the first time that day, Lula rolled up 
his blue jeans and walked into the lake. Roberto, the photographer from Veja, 
was snapping away, happy to catch Lula in his red T-shirt against a picturesque 
background -- the big-city socialist grooving on nature. Noticing a woman doing 
her wash in the water, he suggested that Lula go over and help her. Lula shook 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go on," said Roberto. "It will make a great shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Lula said. "I don't want to bother her. I don't want to turn everybody I 
meet into part of my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the van, Roberto couldn't stop talking about the strangeness of a 
politician who would pass up a photo op. "As a man, I respect him for not 
wanting to bother the woman. He's a good guy. I voted for him. But as a 
photographer" -- he shook his head sadly -- "he just doesn't know how to give 
you any good pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE THEODORE WHITE AND NORMAN MAILER TRANSFORMED how 
journalists write about politicians, it's become impossible to cover any 
presidential hopeful without asking, "What's driving this man to seek the big 
prize? What gives him the fire in his belly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get these answers while talking to him on the fly, I waited around 
Sao Paulo for days, hoping for the in-depth personal interview that would show 
me the real Lula. I finally got my audience with the candidate in his airy 
office atop a small office building off the Rua Pousa Alegre. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he stood to greet me, his body tight as a cramped muscle, I 
knew he was in a black mood. He'd been fighting with a Sao Paulo newspaper and 
obviously didn't care what somebody would write about him in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When I began by saying I wanted to ask about the past, he glowered at his 
press secretary. He'd answered these questions a thousand times before. I 
persevered, but his eyes took on the half-vacant look I recognized from 
American politicians -- he was talking by rote. He listened to my questions as 
if they contained fishhooks. Lula may be an unconventional politician, but he's 
still a politician, and he used my questions to score his own points -- 
parrying perceived criticisms, attacking the media, insisting that the campaign 
was completely under control. 
</P>
<P>
 His impatience filled the room, and I suddenly got the slightest whiff of 
something I've seen in Jesse Jackson: a sense of entitlement, as though the 
world owes him the presidency because he's come so much further than the other 
candidates and cares so much more deeply than they do. In that moment, I felt 
sure I understood what was driving Lula to seek office: the rage of a man who 
was raised hungry, faced the humiliations of powerlessness, battled for 
everything he'd gotten and now feels that he spends his life being slandered by 
the very men who grew rich from the fruits of his labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as I was struck by his ill temper, I knew better than to think it was 
the whole story. It's one of the small-minded habits of our time that we are 
always looking for unsavory private motives to explain compassionate political 
behavior, as if a consuming desire for justice or passionate solidarity with 
the poor couldn't possibly be enough to make anybody do anything except write a 
small, tax-exempt check. To say that Lula is driven simply by anger is to 
diminish the man by mistaking moral indignation for personal resentment; if 
anger is his goad, it is not his goal. I remembered how, during the Roraima 
caravan, he'd been mauled by his public: strangers wanting a handshake, 
reporters asking about allegations from his political enemies, PT workers vying 
for his gaze, seeking the benediction of one whose potential power makes him a 
source of good luck. I could see in his eyes that he wanted to flee -- he was 
beat -- but he kept right on with his task. 
</P>
<P>
 His situation reminded me of something I'd heard about the Amazon. It seems 
that when you need to lead cattle across a river where there may be piranha, 
you always throw in one ox first so that the fish will attack it and the others 
can cross safely. The term for this first ox is boi da piranha , and in an odd 
way, that's how Lula struck me on that trip to Roraima: a man who was letting 
himself be devoured to help his comrades get across. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those who say that the piranha won't really start biting 
until Lula wins the Oct. 3 election. That's when he will learn what Solidarity 
learned in Poland and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua: Nothing can destroy you 
more exquisitely than the expectations you create. In fact, a small version of 
this has already happened to the PT: When Luiza Erundina was elected mayor of 
Sao Paulo in 1988, her achievement fell so far below the dreams she had excited 
that the PT's next candidate for mayor was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luiza Erundina did not satisfy the expectations that were created," says 
"Utopia Unarmed's" Castaneda. "She didn't make a revolution. All she was, in a 
sense, was a good, honest, decent, somewhat progressive mayor. That doesn't 
sound like much. On the other hand, having honest, decent, somewhat progressive 
mayors in countries like ours is not something we're used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the same will probably be true if Lula is president. The expectations 
will be too high. The best that can be hoped is that he be honest, decent and 
somewhat progressive in the face of so many problems that no one president 
could solve them. That would be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 But his defeat would be a crushing disappointment for the Latin American left 
and, in particular, his followers in Brazil. It wouldn't be enough for them 
that Lula had proven to be their Jesse Jackson, the underclass hero who gives 
the best speeches but never wins the top prize. 
</P>
<P>
 One Saturday, I had lunch with Luis Tenorio de Oliveira Lima, a prominent Sao 
Paulo psychoanalyst, and asked him if he could explain Lula's place in the 
national psyche. He smiled, perhaps at my curious American way of putting the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would answer this way. There have always been two Brazils -- a Brazil where 
people have many things, and a Brazil where people have nothing. For a long 
time, these two Brazils looked at one another through a pane of glass. They did 
not really touch, but they saw each other, and they could communicate. Over the 
last 30 years or so, the country has grown more fragmented, and the glass has 
grown much darker. When the haves and have-nots look at each other now, they 
see only their own reflections and their own dark fantasies of the other. They 
can no longer communicate but only know fear and hatred. The country functions, 
but it is . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychotic?" 
</P>
<P>
 He nodded: "Lula is the one man who can stand where the glass has always been 
and communicate with both sides. He can talk to both the poor and the powerful 
as their equal. He is the only politician since the 1920s with the potential to 
start the two Brazils talking again." 
</P>
<P>
 "And do you think he'll be able to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too old to have hope in anything." He cocked his head. "Of course, that 
doesn't mean I wouldn't vote for him."

DOING TIME IN TIJUANA; IN LA MESA PENITENTIARY, PRISONERS LIVE WITH THEIR

</P>

By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Sebastian Rotella is a Times staff writer. He covers the 
U.S.-Mexican border from the San Diego bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE BOY IS 4 YEARS OLD. WEARING A BLUE SWEAT SHIRT, BAGGY jeans and a look of 
solitary awe, he wanders through the Sunday afternoon tumult of the La Mesa 
State Penitentiary, a raucous Tijuana dreamscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy passes taco stands in the central plaza, a makeshift video arcade and 
a general store with a hand-painted 7-Eleven sign. He gets a pat on the head 
from one of the scruffy tattooed men crouched in a predatory daze around the 
basketball court. He stops and peers up at a trio of musicians celebrating the 
baptism of 32 babies in angelic white regalia, new arrivals behind the walls 
patrolled by baby-faced guards who wear rifles and jaunty touches -- a scarf, a 
Raiders jacket -- over their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's world is a daily barrage of wonders: huddled heroin addicts shooting 
up in a corner, point-blank gunfights between pistolero s in cowboy hats. He 
mimics what he sees. In the chapel with a Madonna framed by flashing lights, he 
clasps his hands in prayer. In the gym, he throws furious shadow-punches as 
boxers pound speed-bags to a clattering funk beat. Asked his name, he responds 
with one soft word: "Mascara." 
</P>
<P>
 His melancholy visage has inspired that moniker, which means "mask." He has 
been rechristened by residents of a prison that seethes with the surrealism of 
the U.S.-Mexico border. He is not visiting. He lives here with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 2,500 residents of La Mesa, 300 are wives and children of 
prisoners. Because many inmates are migrants, the prison evolved to accommodate 
their impoverished kin. The resulting overpopulation forced authorities to 
tolerate construction of unofficial dwellings, known as carracas , creating a 
lucrative real estate market. More than 200 carracas and about 60 inmate-owned 
businesses are crammed into four acres that bear scarce resemblance to the 
stark confines of U.S. prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, La Mesa is a product of the only land boundary between First and 
Third Worlds, a frontier shaped by wayfarers, pioneers and desperadoes. In a 
1992 report, the National Human Rights Commission of Mexico concluded: "It is 
not exaggerating to state that the prevailing circumstances inside the state 
penitentiary create a tableau that is unique in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 With its strolling families and shack-town skyline dotted by homemade 
television antennas, this prison-turned-village in the centrally located La 
Mesa neighborhood has earned the nickname "El Pueblo de La Mesa." It has 
developed its own architecture, economy and laws -- a strange order that 
governs the seeming anarchy. Creativity and warmth endure alongside corruption 
and savagery, challenging the stereotype conjured by the words "Mexican jail." 
</P>
<P>
 "The government accommodates the people, and the people accommodate the 
government," says San Diego Police Sgt. Carlos Chacon, an expert on prison 
gangs who knows La Mesa well. "The government doesn't have a lot of money, so 
they are forced to work together." The pragmatic arrangement has produced a 
class structure mirroring that of the larger Mexican society. The rich amass 
luxuries and surround themselves with servants and bodyguards hired from the 
ranks of the poor, who scrabble to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like it's dangerous," says Mario, a tall, rugged Chicano 
serving 10 years for marijuana possession. "But there are criminals in here 
that will kill you for a quina (about 20 cents). You can't forget you're in a 
penitentiary. You gotta remember, they got guns in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates committed at least 12 murders in the prison in 1993, using smuggled 
firearms including Uzis. Although turf wars between inmate mafias pose a 
potential for disaster, La Mesa has not had the deadly riots experienced by 
other Mexican, Latin American and U.S. penitentiaries. The presence of inmates' 
relatives defuses some of the tension. "In our society, the family is extremely 
important," says warden Jorge Alberto Duarte Castillo. "Through the family, it 
has been possible to control the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its problems, the prison preserves a measure of humanity. "They should 
take this and apply it in the U.S.," says Mario, who has done time on both 
sides of the border. "You got the stores, the wives and the kids. Morale-wise, 
a guy doesn't feel locked up. In the U.S., it's all steel and concrete. A guy 
is in with a bunch of men; there's homosexuality, frustration. He comes out 
angry and violent. He goes from a black-and-white world to color. And he can't 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mexico in general and Baja California in particular, La Mesa is 
experiencing a sometimes painful transformation. The federal government and the 
administration of Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel have spent more than $5 million on 
new cellblocks and other improvements. Gingerly, Duarte is trying to 
superimpose a modern institution on the existing one. During his two-year 
tenure, the 41-year-old law professor has begun programs in which inmates 
participate in community service, athletic events and musical performances 
outside the walls. And he openly acknowledges the nagging existence of guns and 
drugs. "I think you are making a big step forward when you speak the truth," he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 The bearded, deeply religious Duarte retains a gentle demeanor in a job that 
chews up wardens regularly. Some critics regard him as well-intentioned, but 
say he has ceded power to criminal kingpins. Duarte shrugs off the accusations. 
"We cannot lose the human aspect. If all we do is toughen the system, it will 
not work. This is a reality with which I have to live. Gradually, conforming to 
the economic conditions, we can go about changing the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 ANGEL LEANS ON THE RAILING OF HIS BALCONY, SURVEYING HIS DOMAIN. A boombox 
cranks a San Diego Top 40 station. In good weather, Angel and his neighbors 
recline in the sun outside their second-floor carracas. "You don't feel the 
time," he says. "This is the most luxurious prison in the world. The only 
problem is, you can't leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel was sentenced to 10 years after federal police busted him at the Tijuana 
airport with 200 kilos of California-bound cocaine. The bearlike, unshaven 
24-year-old is from Mexico City. He slides breezily between Spanish and 
English, explaining how he went about setting himself up in the typical style 
of the big shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hire four or five guys to take care of you," he says, indicating the 
grinning young inmates who hover nearby. "Bodyguards. This is my cook. Somebody 
to watch your house, do the household work. I had two French poodles, and a 
Rottweiler, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The balcony overlooks a grocery stand with three brightly colored parrots in 
cages, as well as a new, fenced vocational school; the prison's past confronts 
its future. Construction of new carracas is banned, but the real-estate 
business flourishes. Buyers use brokers and property deeds to avoid rip-offs. A 
percentage of transactions goes for prison services, such as maintenance. 
Prices range from $100 for a tiny enclosed bunk to about $25,000 for 
townhouse-type dwellings stocked with cellular telephones and Jacuzzis. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel leads a jovial tour: the separate bathroom, living area, kitchen and 
what he calls the "master's bedroom." He paid the previous owner $8,000 for the 
apartment, which suggests a slightly ramshackle college dormitory suite. He has 
a microwave oven, refrigerator, compact-disc player, shower, TV/VCR, heater and 
air conditioner. "It gets hot here in the summer, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of his neighbors, Angel does not have cable television. He rents 
movies from the video club and watches the networks from north of the border. 
"CBS, NBC, Fox, KPBS," he says. "Public broadcasting -- I watch that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 As a big shot, you fork over $40 to avoid three months of maintenance work 
required of newcomers. You tip guards to avoid getting up at 6 a.m. for roll 
call. You tip the industrious messengers who race each other to bring news of a 
visitor at the gate. Perks and appliances enter for a fee; guards charge $20 
for bringing in a radio. Scotch, marijuana and other prohibited items cost 
more. The price for sneaking in a gun is as high as $5,000. You spread enough 
money around, Angel says, and "you can get what you need." 
</P>
<P>
 SINCE THE PENITENTIARY WAS built in 1956 as a municipal jail with a capacity 
of 600, Tijuana has surged from honky-tonk to metropolis. The city's population 
now approaches 2 million, fed by trans-border industry and migration at the 
world's busiest international boundary. Always notorious for vice, Tijuana has 
evolved into a hub for multimillion-dollar criminal enterprises: drug 
trafficking, immigrant smuggling, car theft.

<P>
 Growth overwhelmed infrastructure, including law enforcement. Migrants from 
throughout Mexico filled desperate shantytowns, often hoping to cross to 
California, sometimes ending up behind bars. Officials, moved by both 
humanitarianism and payoffs, soon began allowing families to build housing 
within the walls. Replicating the helter-skelter sprawl of Tijuana, 
incarcerated workmen erected two-story blocks that consumed most open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government was obligated to construct at the rhythm dictated by reality, 
but it was not done," says Jose Luis Perez Canchola, Baja California's human 
rights ombudsman. "Two factors converged: The state did not invest enough for 
an appropriate jail. . . . At the same time the market flourished in selling 
spaces, construction permits, properties. And then the sales among the inmates 
themselves. It has all been corruption and bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the state has improved pay and training in hopes of rooting 
out persistent corruption among the guards, who routinely carry guns on patrol 
among the inmates. Officers earn an average of about $500 a month. (But in the 
California system, better pay and high-tech vigilance have not eliminated 
bloodshed, drugs and bribery, notes Sgt. Chacon, the San Diego prison gang 
expert. "What's the difference?" he asks. "A guy in Pelican Bay (California's 
maximum security prison) can still order a murder in another prison. The power 
to kill is still there.") 
</P>
<P>
 Americas Watch and other human rights watchdogs have criticized Mexican 
prisons for overcrowding, corruption, squalor and constitutional violations 
such as the mixing of sentenced convicts and suspects awaiting trial. In La 
Mesa, killers live next to drug-mules who live next to the wrongly accused. 
"The Napoleon law, man," says Mario, referring to the Napoleonic Code, the 
foundation of Mexican law. "Guilty until proven innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether guilty or innocent, those who run afoul of Mexico's troubled justice 
system tend to be the most vulnerable. "The rich don't go to jail," says Perez 
Canchola, the rights ombudsman. "And there are many criminals among the rich. . 
. . It is a very unjust situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The most desperate of the poor in La Mesa are the drug addicts, more than 500 
of them. Their hustling and marauding charge the streets with a roiling energy. 
"We knew there were drugs," says a former high-ranking guard. "We attacked 
heroin, but not marijuana. You punish the seller but not the user. You have to 
leave the poor something or they'll explode. It calms them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Victor Clark Alfaro, a Tijuana human rights activist who works with 
inmates: "La Mesa is a latent bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, it does explode: In 1978, the warden, his assistant and two 
guards were killed, one of several multiple shootings over the years. In 1991, 
a corruption scandal felled another warden, a military man chosen for his stern 
reputation. Then in January, after a harrowing disturbance in which inmates 
fired guns into the air, warden Duarte removed his commander and three other 
top officers. They allegedly beat up a convicted murderer after getting word 
that he was hired to kill the commander in retaliation for a crackdown on 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The strained relations between the state and federal governments worsen La 
Mesa's plight, according to critics. Gov. Ruffo, elected in 1989 as the first 
opposition-party governor in modern Mexican history, contends that federal 
officials neglect Baja's budget because the state is a bastion of opposition to 
the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party. Federal criminals account for 
close to half the population, but no federal institution exists in Baja. 
Construction of a new state prison at Tecate ground to a halt years ago for 
murky reasons, leaving a ghostly compound in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern has become familiar. The Tijuana press, generally eager to 
criticize an opposition administration, thunders about the latest crisis. The 
government pledges reform. The attention subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN THE BLOCK FROM ANGEL'S balcony, in one of the old dormitories known as 
tanques , a gloomy passageway leads into a congested warren of cells resembling 
pigeon coops. Men smoke cigarettes on benches, murmuring in the near-dark. A 
precarious staircase winds up to the workshop of Celestino Martinez, 29. As in 
many other hard-luck stories, his began when he crossed illegally into the 
United States. The immigrant from Guanajuato settled in a San Diego barrio, 
where he did landscaping jobs and eventually won resident status. But then his 
marriage fell apart. On the day the divorce became final six years ago, 
Martinez went looking for his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of control," he says, eyes haunted behind thick glasses. "I killed 
her." He fled to his parents' home in Tijuana. Mexican authorities hunted him 
down and tried him in cooperation with San Diego officials under a Mexican law 
that allows prosecution for crimes committed abroad. He got 11 years. Martinez 
has become a skilled woodworker, seeking redemption in sculpted crucifixes and 
statues.  
</P>
<P>
 The working poor here do what they have always done outside: shine shoes, 
serve food, sift through garbage like the professional scavengers of Mexico's 
urban dumps. Until about two years ago, hundreds of inmates could not even 
afford a bed. The homeless of La Mesa curled up in dormitory hallways known 
caustically as los freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent construction of two cellblocks with a capacity of 1,350 has reduced 
homelessness, providing the only living space that is not for sale. "It's not 
fair to say nothing has changed," says warden Duarte. "But we have two types of 
housing -- the official housing, which is a cell for six people, and then the 
individual housing, with more conveniences. This implies a very serious problem 
for the prison and the government itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Unabated population growth still forces grim improvisations. Two men bunk on 
the shelves of an old cabinet in a stairwell. Another lives in a furnished 
top-floor loft with a low ceiling; his head disappears through a hatch when he 
stands.  
</P>
<P>
 When inmate Norma Yvette Araujo arrived at La Mesa, she spent two nightmarish 
weeks without a place to live. The 32-year-old former accounting clerk sought 
refuge in corridors and stairwells, wrapped shuddering in a blanket during the 
menacing pre-dawn hours. "I was terrified," says Norma, a divorced mother of 
three. "I didn't sleep the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she lives comfortably in an individual cell she bought for $300 in the 
tranquil women's dormitory that is decorated with plants and multicolored crepe 
paper. The dormitory is the only area segregated by gender. "As a woman, you 
have to be careful," Norma says. "I say hello to everybody. But there are 
certain carracas where I do not visit. There are certain places I don't go." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Norma moved to Tijuana from Mexico City to be near her family, 
immigrants living in Los Angeles. But she was arrested for possession of five 
grams of marijuana and now she works at the prison maquiladora to support her 
children, who sometimes stay with her at La Mesa. Prices in the prison are 
artificially high, forcing reliance on the lifeline of family and friends. 
"Every diaper costs 50 cents," Norma says. "A bottle of milk that would cost me 
$2 outside costs almost $4." 
</P>
<P>
 Norma's black hair cascades down her back. Her wardrobe is well-kept -- 
sweaters, a sports jacket, crisp jeans. She has a pleasant, slightly 
gap-toothed smile. In a conscious effort to stay busy, she takes English 
classes and belongs to the theater ensemble, which has performed around 
Tijuana. Exuding serenity, Norma exchanges greetings with passersby as she 
strolls down the manic thoroughfare known as the Boulevard of the Eagles. She 
stops in for a cup of tea at an Asian food stand run by a group of accused 
immigrant smugglers, marooned Taiwanese sailors from three ships that were 
intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard off Baja and turned over to the Mexican 
Navy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Esmeralda comes running up and gives her mother a hug. Norma 
supplies her with change and sends her scampering back to the children crowded 
around the video arcade in the sun-splashed plaza. Esmeralda is old enough to 
be frightened by the surroundings. "She says, ' Mami , I don't like this 
place,' " Norma explains. "She doesn't go anywhere alone. She's scared." Four 
months after Norma was imprisoned, she gave birth to her youngest daughter, now 
a year old. "It was very tough and very sad for me that she was born here. I 
had her here for the first three months, then my brothers took her to Los 
Angeles. They bring her and she spends 10 days, a week, 15 days with me. So she 
doesn't forget me." 
</P>
<P>
 ARMS FOLDED, A SHORT, SOLEMN MAN OVERSEES EMPLOYEES BENT OVER sewing machines 
in a 24-hour workshop that produces clothes to be sold in California. A husky 
young bodyguard in a cowboy hat watches the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in charge has a gray mustache and favors fashionable warm-up suits. 
His cap bears the legend "Commander in Chief." He is Antonio Vera Palestina, 
who is serving 25 years for the 1988 assassination of Hector (Gato) Felix 
Miranda, a crusading Tijuana columnist. Vera formerly directed security at the 
Agua Caliente racetrack owned by businessman Jorge Hank Rhon, a target of 
Felix's column. Mexican journalists have demanded for years that authorities 
investigate whether Hank ordered the murder. Hank, whose father is Mexico's 
agriculture minister, denies involvement and has never been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera opened the garment business last year and obtained contracts with 
U.S.-owned maquiladoras, low-wage plants that dominate the border economy. 
Workers earn between $5 and $13 a day, not much less than on the outside; the 
penitentiary gets almost 100 sorely needed jobs; Vera collects a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich inmates constitute a formidable shadow government. "The big shots don't 
escape because they don't want to," says Jesus (Flaco) Araiza, the officially 
designated inmate coordinator who controls everything from work assignments to 
property disputes. "They take care of their business from in here. They are 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Araiza's nickname means "Skinny," but he is bulkier than the sobriquet 
suggests. The respect he enjoys is evident as he roams the prison with a 
swashbuckling languor, calling orders over his shoulder to a cleanup crew, 
joking about his hangover with a deferential guard, handing a coin to a beggar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The authorities don't interfere," says Araiza, who owns a thriving restaurant 
in the plaza. "We run the businesses, the sales of carracas. Among ourselves." 
Araiza, who is more than six feet tall, bought his well-appointed apartment for 
$3,000 and had the ceiling raised to accommodate his height. He predicts it 
will sell for $10,000 when he finishes his seven-year drug trafficking 
sentence. Araiza entrusts only his servant with the keys. Guards do not have 
keys to carracas ; residents lock themselves in at night. "It's my own little 
jail," Araiza says. "And I'm the jailer." 
</P>
<P>
 Press reports have said that Araiza is one of the chieftains in the prison's 
so-called mafias, which run liquor, prostitution and protection rackets and 
have ready access to hidden guns that elude sweeps by police. Authorities 
confiscated 50 firearms last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Araiza scoffs at those accounts. "They said I walk around with 20 bodyguards," 
he says. "Do you see any bodyguards?" But he can field a personal security 
force in a hurry if hostilities break out. "You have to. You're not going to 
make it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 One former pistolero -for-hire describes the life: He earned free meals, 
marijuana and about $5 a day for guarding the steel door of a drug dealer's 
carraca. "Sometimes I had to push people out," he says. "And sometimes I had to 
pull them inside." 
</P>
<P>
 The king of the La Mesa gunslingers appears to be Comandante Zafiro (Commander 
Sapphire). Tomas Gonzalez Zamacona, 37, was an officer of the federal police 
until he crossed the thin line separating the federales from the drug cartels. 
He allegedly led a band of hit men until his conviction for a kidnap-murder 
last year. His ferocity has gained him near-legendary status. Since a wary 
phalanx of police deposited him in La Mesa last year, Comandante Zafiro has, by 
many accounts, established himself as a kingpin. When a federal judge went to 
the prison to hear his testimony, Zafiro sent word from his carraca that he 
would not come out. The judge left. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Saturday night last October, Zafiro and two sidekicks engaged in a wild 
shootout with rivals near a row of burned-out food stands. At least 27 shots 
were fired from semiautomatic weapons. Two gunmen were wounded, one seriously, 
and Zafiro was hit in the leg. Conflicting theories circulated afterward. Did 
another boss try to bump off Zafiro? Was the shooting a setup engineered to 
make guards take Zafiro to a hospital, where he could escape? 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Zafiro was never removed. His power brings relative peace, 
according to a Baja official. "If you give him control, the violence stays 
down," the official says. "Zafiro rules in there." 
</P>
<P>
 ON WEEKDAY MORNINGS, the perennially busy main gate releases a crowd of wives 
leaving for work and children going to school. The live-in relatives bring 
economic as well as psychological benefits -- and present a thorny dilemma that 
is central to any debate about reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we don't want to leave, it's the economic conditions," says 
Maria Isabel Martinez, who is from Jalisco. "It would cost me $20 just for 
child-care. We can't afford to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria, 19, earns about $50 a week at an outside factory that makes briefcases 
and suitcases. She returns in the evening to wait in line for guards to rummage 
through her grocery bags and stamp her hand as a "permanent visitor." The waits 
are especially lengthy on the two nights designated for conjugal visits.  
</P>
<P>
 While Maria works, her husband baby-sits Jose Arturo, 3, and Joanna, 1. "The 
men stay out of trouble because their kids are here," Maria says. "They control 
themselves for the sake of the kids." The children play outside near a row of 
concrete washbasins that serve as the communal laundry. About 100 feet away, 
junkies duck behind a coffin-like box to inject themselves. "It's up to me to 
raise the kids right," Maria says. "We keep them close by. Some people let them 
run around alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Having visited prisons in the United States, Cuba and Russia, warden Duarte 
asserts that Mexico's liberal visiting policy is among the most progressive. 
"We do not understand a philosophy that prohibits conjugal visits. That is 
nothing more than punishment, not rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
 But he agrees with experts who want the government to provide alternative 
housing for the wives and children of La Mesa, the only Mexican prison in which 
carracas and families are permanent fixtures. The environment breeds 
exploitation of women, who are pressured into prostitution. Although most 
children are showered with affection, the playground becomes increasingly 
treacherous as they grow up. "It helps rehabilitate the inmate," says rights 
activist Clark. "But this also hurts the family. They are manufacturing future 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 At least theoretically, new family members have been discouraged from moving 
in. Duarte would like to remove those who remain. But previous attempts 
provoked violent protests. Inmates have come to regard singular practices as 
inalienable rights. To demolish 33 carracas for the construction of the new 
school, for example, authorities had to engage in protracted negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The true solution is to build another prison in Baja, Duarte says. "In the 
long run, we have to think about another facility. It's not possible to have 
this many people in here." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE FEAST DAY OF THE Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of Mexico, the 
bishop of Tijuana pays a visit to inaugurate the new chapel. Shaking hands, 
dispensing laminated pictures of the Virgin, Bishop Emilio Carlos Berlie 
Belaunzaran makes his way smoothly through the men lining the chain-link fence 
that separates the chapel from the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The chilly interior is packed with a visiting choir in wool ponchos and 
families in their Sunday best: wet-combed toddlers, stern fathers in 
sunglasses, a mother with black hair swept up by glittering ribbons decorated 
with pictures of Minnie Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The little boy named Mascara drifts among the pews. He fixes his mute 
questioning stare on adults until they notice him, smiling down in surprise. 
Mascara follows a carpenter carrying a wooden cross to the altar. When the 
bishop blesses the cross, the carpenter breaks down and weeps. Mascara finds a 
good spot next to the choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Berlie leads the Mass. He asks the Virgin to bestow mercy and comfort 
on the people of La Mesa. Afterward, he baptizes 32 babies born to inmates. 
Then the congregation emerges on the steps of the chapel and faces the mob: the 
forlorn migrants, the baleful addicts. A chant builds expectantly: "Bolo!"  
</P>
<P>
 The word refers to the time-honored ritual in which godfathers must dispense 
alms to the poor after the christening. On cue, the godfathers toss a shower of 
coins through the fence into the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The mob goes wild. Dozens of men lunge, wrestle, scrabble for the skittering 
coins. The frenzy seems sure to end in bloodshed. But it subsides. The men dust 
themselves off, laughing. And through it all, this ritual of faith and despair, 
Mascara watches.

BILL MOYERS ACTS UP; IT ISN'T ENOUGH BEING THE CONSCIENCE OF AMERICA; HE WANTS 
TO BE AN AGENT OF CHANGE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marshall Blonsky, Marshall Blonsky is writing a book about the business and 
politics of information for Viking Penguin. He teaches semiotics at New York 
University and the New School for Social Research.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blue and magenta ceiling lights coat a high-tech set at PBS' WETA 
television studio with a glitzy aura. "On Bill Moyers, OK," says a technician 
at a console behind me. Moyers, 10 yards away, sits still as statuary, his 
handsome face turned in profile, a makeup woman spraying and brushing his 
already perfect hair. He has been through this routine for 23 years, most of 
them on his own terms, the journalist without a brief except the brief he sets 
for himself: conscience of America, some would say. 
</P>
<P>
 The taping resumes, and an oversize screen to Moyers' left displays Bill 
Clinton orating. On monitors inside the control room, the wall behind Moyers 
glows magisterially, like a midnight sky traced with purplish rocket trails. 
With Moyers as interlocutor, two best-selling political authors, William 
Greider and Kevin Phillips, are about to take aim at the President and 
big-money politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In quick succession, like knife thrusts, Moyers leads the two -- and after 
them, a group of activists -- in delivering the blows. They list the 
President's ties to corporate America and lambaste his "skimpy" attempt at 
campaign-finance reform; they lay out the mechanisms of lobbying, the damage 
done to democracy. It is typical Moyers -- discourse interlaced with 
mini-documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just after Moyers thanks his final guest, just before the credits roll, 
he turns toward the camera, his face a study in sober geniality, and lets slip 
the journalist's mask. In that famous Texas baritone, rich with gravitas , he 
appeals to his audience to act. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can work to challenge the system," he says. "Call this toll-free number. 
. . . Let me repeat that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, "Money Talks" is the opening installment of PBS' "Bill 
Moyers' Journal" for 1994 and, it would seem, the opening act for the second 
half of the journalist's life. This is the year that Bill Moyers -- in a 
riposte to critics who have long called him partisan -- becomes an activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe our democracy is being auctioned off every day," he tells me 
days before the taping, "and that unless we address the dominance of money in 
politics, we're going to lose our democracy. Whatever voters want, donors can 
trump and negate. One of the consequences of the sabbatical" -- Moyers is only 
recently returned from eight months off -- "is to realize it's not enough just 
to produce television. I have also as a citizen to try to be an agent of change 
on at least one fundamental issue. And that issue is money politics." 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Moyers had called me from New Hampshire. "I'm up here taping 
Donald Hall, the poet," he said. "He's dying. It's very moving." In those days, 
he was mentioning death more than a little. "I guess I've outlived my time," he 
had joked in November, 1992, fumbling with a ticket machine in the Washington 
Metro. Then, back in New York: "You should watch me interview Agnes de Mille; I 
want to tape her before she dies." And driving around his hometown, Marshall, 
Tex., his mood was sometimes funereal. "What breaks my heart," he said, 
pointing through the windshield at Marshall's faded downtown, "is that this 
next block and all on around was just one small shop after another, full of 
mysteries and wonders and goods from all over the world. That hotel was as 
bustling as Times Square." Now, he says succinctly, "It's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a dark season for Moyers. In October, his grandson, William Henry 
Moyers, was born with a serious lung defect. Moyers flew back and forth from 
his homes in New York and New Jersey to Atlanta, where his son and 
daughter-in-law live, charting the baby's progress, worrying about his 
namesake's tenuous hold on health. He anchored "Listening to America," a weekly 
campaign series of round-tables and issue pieces -- many of which critiqued 
image-over-reality politicking -- and, when it ended, looked up to see such 
programs all but declared passe in the supposed era of phone-in talk shows and 
infomercials. He had a new PBS series set for February of 1993, "Healing and 
the Mind" (a variation on the theme of death), but when he looked beyond that, 
nothing was sure.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the middle of the path of our life," wrote Dante to begin "The Inferno," 
"I found myself in a dark wood because the right way was lost." This middle is 
the moment when death becomes real and it produces a desire for a change of 
life. At the end of 1992, contemplating his upcoming sabbatical, Moyers told me 
he was "hoping for an encounter, someone or some experience to indicate a new 
way. I don't want to go on just repeating myself more efficiently," he said. 
His franchise, as he put it, had worn not out, but down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, seemingly out of the woods, Moyers explains his new activism as "partly a 
function of contemplation, partly a function of age." He is charged up, 
passionate. Rather than retreating, as he had implied he might pre-sabbatical, 
he told me he is "bountifully blessed" with new plans: In the next few years, 
he will pursue television projects with less "intensity," but there will still 
be monthly "Journal" entries, plus a four-hour special on violence and a 
10-part look at the Genesis Seminar, a salon at New York's Jewish Theological 
Seminary of America that focuses on the first book of the Bible.  
</P>
<P>
 And Moyers will continue to declare himself an "agent of change." "There are 
things I want to do other than produce television," he says. One week after 
"Money Talks" aired, he faxed me. An estimated 20,000 people called the 800 
number, his missive said. "At least those people take citizenship seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 TRUTH TO TELL, BILL MOYERS POST-SABBATICAL HAS PLENTY IN COMMON with the 
pre-sabbatical man. The 800 number may be new, but the impulse behind it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyers has made a career of being Citizen Moyers, projecting the image of a 
private person going public in the Thomas Paine mold. Pre-TV, he might have 
been a crank writing letters to the editor or printing his own broadsides, a la 
"Common Sense." But in the postmodern age, he has seized on television (and its 
corollary soapboxes -- book spinoffs, lectures) to pronounce his jeremiads and 
sing his stories of hope and healing to a never-big-enough audience. (He's 
sensitive about his ratings; just 2% of the nation regularly tunes into PBS.)  
</P>
<P>
 Moyers' life journey started in Hugo, Okla., and Marshall, Tex., where his 
family moved when he was 3. At the Marshall News Messenger, he was a cub 
reporter after school, and at the Central Baptist Church, an active member. In 
1959, he was ordained a Baptist minister, but he followed instead another 
calling and became a politician's apprentice, working for Lyndon B. Johnson 
during Johnson's Senate years and his presidency. After Moyers resigned from 
Johnson's White House, he became a newspaper publisher, at Newsday in New York, 
and then a reporter again, at CBS and PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular pilgrim's progress, from political actor to observer, has made 
him controversial -- the far right considers him a liberal mouthpiece, the left 
can't quite forgive him for press-agenting for LBJ. With his history, and his 
penchant for saying things like "I am a moral agent" and "information is hope," 
Moyers doesn't quite fit journalism's tabula rasa ideal.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, says a top Washington newspaper journalist, he is "an American type, 
a morally vain, Bible-toting figure out of the southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rap on Moyers is he's too earnest," says ABC News political and media 
analyst Jeff Greenfield. "I used to write for the National Lampoon; I am 
incapable of that kind of earnestness. But if you want cynicism and jadedness, 
hip and ironic, boy, there's enough of that to go around in the media. So a 
little earnestness? That's fine."  
</P>
<P>
 Moyers admits to having "the persona of a scold." Told once that he was 
considered preachy, he demurred: "Having been called that, I retreat from 
assertion." Hardly. Moyers retreats only until he cannot bear it, hurling his 
judgment darts like some banderillero aching to be matador. "In the beginning 
was the Word," a Gospel starts, and he is a master of words, using them to 
wound our sense of the way things are.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider his off-the-cuff capsule history of recent administrations. "Look," 
he tells me, "You got Lyndon Johnson campaigning for peace, and we went to war. 
Richard Nixon, law and order, and we got a gang that tried to steal the 
Constitution. Jimmy Carter, competence, and we got a maladroit. Ronald Reagan, 
fiscal responsibility, and we got the largest debt in our history. George Bush, 
promising a kinder, gentler nation, and we got the culture war, the religious 
war. How anybody could take seriously the legitimacy of a governing class that 
has perpetrated, from the Vietnam War right on through, such costly policies on 
the American people, is a mystifying question to me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is his dearest theme: political responsibility. The post-sabbatical Moyers 
is just much bolder about brandishing it. "The Titantic's captain was 
indifferent," he says. "I have always likened democracy to the ability of a 
passenger to go up on the bridge and grab the arm of that captain and say, 
'Sir, that's an iceberg out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moyers hasn't been shy about hoisting himself onto the bridge of the latest 
American ship of state. It started with an invitation to Transition Little 
Rock. Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz questioned him about the visit 
while Moyers and I limousined from Washington's National Airport to the CNN 
studio, where Moyers was about to sit in for vacationing Larry King. "We saw 'A 
River Runs Through It,' " Moyers purred into the cellular, "and then we went 
back to the governor's mansion." A pause. "Well, where else was I to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 The next day's Post headline tore into Moyers for backsliding, being tempted 
by the sin of participation: "Listening to Bill Moyers: Objectivity Questioned 
After Chat With Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Which didn't deter Moyers, bent on preventing another Titanic disaster. The 
night before Clinton's inauguration, Moyers delivered the main speech at an 
invitation-only prayer service for the President-elect. Standing at the 
lectern, he offered his advice to the new President. "At the core of our 
(Baptist) faith is what we call soul competency," he declaimed, "the competence 
of the individual before God. Created with the imprint of divinity, from the 
mixed clay of earth, we are endowed with the capacity to choose, to be . . . 
response-able. . . . These beliefs do not make for lawless anarchy or the 
religion of Lone Rangers. . . . They aim for a community with moral integrity, 
the wholeness that flows from mutual obligation."  
</P>
<P>
 "It may be," Moyers preached to Clinton and Gore, "that this inbred tendency 
in free church life is one of the best gifts you bring to high office at this 
most pluralistic, fragmented and perplexed time in our history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kind of lifted at that point," Moyers would remember happily. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he wasn't dubious about the new President. "The Administration has a 
chance," he said shortly after the election, sitting in a bar sipping a vodka 
tonic, "if they don't screw up, which I think they will."  
</P>
<P>
 Post-sabbatical, Moyers has exchanged the persona of scold for a prophet's 
harsher tones. "I had high hopes not only for Clinton but for the return of his 
party to power, for fresh faces, fresh voices and fresh willpower," he says 
with feeling. "But I've never seen anybody abscond so quickly. It's a year 
later, after the barricades have been stormed, and that new day of democracy, 
for democracy, turns out to be midnight."  
</P>
<P>
 BILL MOYERS FIRST WENT TO WASHINGTON IN 1954, WHEN HE WAS 20, A COLLEGE intern 
on then-Sen. Johnson's staff, writing letters to the voters back home. Moyers 
left after that summer disillusioned with what he had seen -- McCarthyism at 
its apogee. ("It was Edward R. Murrow's" -- Murruh's , in Moyers' soft drawl -- 
"broadcast that made me aware it was not the Senate that first called McCarthy 
to judgment, but the journalist.") Yet it can't have been a profound 
disillusionment, for six years later, Moyers came back. Johnson called as he 
and his wife, Judith, were packing to move from Ft. Worth to Austin, where 
Moyers was going to add a Ph.D. to his just-finished master's in divinity. He 
wanted the 26-year-old for the 1960 presidential campaign, as liaison to Jack 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Judith," Moyers remembers, " 'Leave everything in the boxes, just 
cross out Austin and put down Washington. We're going the other way.' "  
</P>
<P>
 At 12, he had been baptised, "an affirmation of my desire to be in a right 
relation with God." At 25 he was preaching, circuit style, in small rural 
churches. Yet in Washington, he told me, he was instantly at ease with power, 
even when it was exercised in Johnson's hideaway in the Capitol basement, where 
Moyers drank Old Capitol Hill bourbon with the best (and worst) of them. ("I 
sure got drunk on it one night down there," Moyers says, laughing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Far from considering those days and nights any sort of lapse, he regards his 
ease of adjustment as a function of his religiosity. "It didn't cause any moral 
crisis to be there; it was a natural extension of your being prepared for the 
world -- that's what soul competency means." He doesn't think "the old story" 
-- in his case, the Christian one -- ever ceases to resonate in those it 
informs, but as one pursues one's life, "a continuing course in adult 
education" he calls it,"you begin to realize the story's limits and listen for 
its successor." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, Moyers was named deputy director of the Peace Corps, where he 
remained for two years. Then, in November, 1963, he went to Dallas for 
President Kennedy and returned an aide to President Johnson. "Kennedy's advance 
men had gone down to set up the November Texas trip," Moyers recalls. "They had 
blundered terribly, and Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's political adviser, asked me to 
go down and hold the hands of all the warring factions until Kennedy was in and 
out of the state. I was young and basically nonpartisan, and they knew that I 
was kind of a healer. And I told Kenny, 'I can't, I'm in the Peace Corps; the 
Peace Corps isn't political, so you have to get somebody else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, the phone rang, and it was the President. "He said, 'Bill, 
I want you to go to Texas.' I said, 'Mr. President, the Peace Corps can't get 
involved in politics.' He said, 'Bill, you go to Texas and worry about 
politics, and let me worry about the Peace Corps.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moyers did as he was told. Which is how, on Nov. 22, he came to be lunching in 
Houston at the Forty Acres Club with the chairman of the Texas Democratic 
Executive Committee. When word of JFK's shooting reached them, they chartered a 
plane and flew to Dallas. At Love Field, Moyers scribbled a note to Johnson: 
"I'm here if you need me." A few minutes later, Moyers was motioned up into Air 
Force One. "We bonded rather quickly," Moyers says. "We spoke a shorthand to 
each other, and I was useful to him." 
</P>
<P>
 His four years with President Johnson were not without their low moments, some 
of which trail him today. Moyers has publicly apologized for what he says was 
marginal participation in circulating J. Edgar Hoover's files on Martin Luther 
King Jr. ("I was a very flawed young man," he told a reporter, "but I have 
never in my life engaged in character assassination.") He also offers mea 
culpas about commissioning, on Johnson's orders, the infamous 1964 campaign ad 
in which film of a little girl plucking daisy petals segues into an atomic 
explosion: "I wish I could take it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President said to me, 'You know, Goldwater is making a headlong dash 
toward respectability. Got to remind the public he's been reckless about 
nuclear weapons,' " Moyers says. The daisy ad inaugurated the era of special 
effects, contrived images in political ads, he allows -- "which short-circuit 
the analytic process, which are so harmful precisely because they replace 
words."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the boss was pleased, and in the summer of 1965, LBJ promoted Moyers to 
press secretary. "It was a role that I resisted," says Moyers, "but I couldn't 
say no any more than I could say no to Kennedy when he asked me to go to 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 He told Judith, "This is the beginning of the end, because no man can serve 
two masters." The second master was the press. "The reason I get attacked by 
fellow journalists is they feel I'm hypocritical. They say, 'Look, when you 
were press secretary, your administration regularly contradicted the very 
principles you so mightily espouse now.' And there's no question about it. The 
two administrations I served, Kennedy's and Johnson's, were brought low by 
policies conducted in secrecy. Kennedy on Cuba, Johnson on Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, it's all past history," he says. The next quarter century of his life 
becomes two succinct sentences: "I resigned in '67 and became publisher of 
Newsday, stayed there until it was sold in 1970 to the Los Angeles Times, and 
did (the book) 'Listening to America.' In '71, I was called by some people who 
were putting together the (news) broadcast called 'This Week,' and that's when 
I joined public television." In his hurry, he skips over his move in and out of 
network news -- twice he went to work for CBS before giving up on commercial 
television to start his own PBS-affiliated production company, Public Affairs 
Television, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 One Washington observer suggests another reason why Moyers fast-forwards 
through Life After Johnson: "He could reasonably have dreamed about being 
President. But he was on a train going a hundred miles an hour -- right into 
the brick wall of Vietnam." Johnson's political collapse was also Bill Moyers'. 
 
</P>
<P>
 MOYERS IS SITTING IN AS HOST OF "LARRY KING LIVE." AT 40 MINUTES before 
showtime, the phone rings, and Moyers picks it up: "Hey, Larry" -- King is 
calling from Hawaii -- "I've rolled up the carpet, the boxes just arrived. I'm 
going to like it here, buddy." More chitchat. They are somewhat surprising pals 
-- Moyers the prince of the old news and King the celebrity of the new.  
</P>
<P>
 A monitor on the desk softly plays the program that precedes King's, 
"Crossfire," starring Michael Kinsley and John Sununu. Tamara Haddad, King's 
then-senior executive producer, sits across from Moyers, loosening him up with 
small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyers' eye catches the monitor. The mood goes from light to serious. "That 
guy" -- pointing to President Bush's onetime Chief of Staff Sununu -- "should 
have 'lobbyist' supered over his head every time he speaks." He notices 
Kinsley. "Look at the eyes," he directs me. "He's arguing with a wink," he 
says. "These guys are phony." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you think people even watch them, or Larry?" I ask him. He's aware 
I've been transcribing the session on a small note pad, and now he gives me a 
morsel for it: "Some people watch to fill in the blanks, some people watch to 
fill in the time," he says. I have the sensation that he is dictating, not 
talking, to me. "People are so lonely, even when they live together, that a 
third party in the house is always a welcome guest. It's noise in an otherwise 
empty room." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be his turn on the screen shortly. He will host a round-table on gays 
in the military, with Margarethe Cammermeyer, the National Guard colonel 
dismissed for revealing her lesbianism, Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank and 
retired Rear Adm. C. A. Hill. He will also quiz the Speaker of the House, 
Thomas S. Foley, and the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, on the Clinton 
Administration's chances for success.  
</P>
<P>
 "What do you ask these guys?" Moyers wonders aloud about Foley and Gephardt. 
"They're not the most inspiring pair." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the conversation is not scintillating. Moyers manages to bring it 
around to what interests him, the notion of a pariah Congress and the 
President's relationship to it. "Candidate Bill Clinton stayed away from you 
folks during the campaign," he says, trying to provoke Gephardt. "I mean, you 
were like lepers during the campaign, members of Congress -- a little 
exaggeration. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," responds Gephardt, "first, we weren't treated that way in the 
campaign. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Moyers is dismissive. "It's squash, but they don't hit the ball you 
put against the wall. You hit a red ball there, and they make it yellow and hit 
it back." They didn't -- the show's format doesn't -- play fair. Moyers 
couldn't exercise his customary control. He has already admitted that his own 
chat shows are a triumph of editing, not straight interviewing. "If you were on 
my show," he says, "you wouldn't believe that was you talking. I'd shoot 50 
hours for the one I'd use." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of the King show, Moyers encourages, then referees, a nasty 
point-counterpoint about the military's ban on gays and later delivers another 
bad review. It was not at all the "conversation of democracy" he had intended. 
"It was about arguing, not argument. It's a bloodsport," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't comfortable," he admits, "and I just think I'd be a rich man today 
if I were. I'm not. And I'm saddened by that." He sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such regret rarely passes Moyers' lips. Instead, he says he considers himself 
well and happily out of the clutches of both the new news and commercial 
broadcasting. He left CBS -- and a big salary -- voluntarily, he reminds 
interviewers. "There are few opportunities in any sphere of our society that 
can equal the freedom, the mobility, the access, the creativity, the license 
that I have in my job now," he says. He might also have added: the power and 
the glory.  
</P>
<P>
 He is one of very few journalists whose names crop up as presidential or 
vice-presidential material. Moyers doesn't always quash such talk. In July, 
1991, he coyly told the New York Times that a run would be "fun"; a few months 
later, he told the Washington Post he hadn't been seduced into electoral 
politics -- "yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The mere notion of a Moyers candidacy was the ostensible reason the New 
Republic made him its cover boy in August, 1991. In a story by Andrew Ferguson, 
the magazine called Moyers a liberal fraud, accused him of getting privately 
rich off public broadcasting and generally attacked him for embodying one of 
the sins Moyers most often rails against -- the cultivation of myth to 
obfuscate venality.  
</P>
<P>
 Moyers has always been sensitive to criticism. Now he went ballistic, paying 
for two pages of ad space to rebut what he told me was "an ideological attack 
by a journalistic hack." He quarreled over big and small points, saving perhaps 
his biggest outrage for Ferguson's attack against "history" in linking Moyers 
directly to the FBI's character assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in the 
'60s. "If (Ferguson) were a gentleman," Moyers fulminated near the end of his 
"Open Letter," "I would challenge him to a duel." 
</P>
<P>
 In the resulting tempest in a media teapot, the New Republic piece was widely 
acknowledged as vicious, but Moyers was chided for overreacting. The words 
"ego" and "obsessive" came up. At about the same time, conservatives were 
attacking public broadcasting's budget and casting Moyers as a biased villain 
in a liberal media conspiracy. Predictably, Moyers fired off more retaliatory 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, media writer Jon Katz, once a producer at CBS, weighed in with a 
witty New York Times piece that jabbed his former colleague -- "a brooding, 
pious pain in the neck," Katz acknowledged -- but also praised him.  
</P>
<P>
 Moyers didn't let it pass. Seizing on Katz's observation that he was mostly 
doing "chats," he composed a fact-packed reply proving Katz wrong, ending with 
a writer's equivalent of a tight smile: "Jon will no doubt think that setting 
the record straight indicates a thin skin. So be it. I do appreciate his advice 
that I not run for President. Why should I? As a journalist, I enjoy my work 
far more than George Bush seems to enjoy his." 
</P>
<P>
 MOYERS HAS INVITED ME TO VIEW HIM THROUGH THE PRISM OF HIS HOMETOWN. "Place is 
the glue on the stamp of time," he says. "Even though I live in New York and 
New Jersey, I'm stamped." By Marshall, Tex., he means. 
</P>
<P>
 We begin at his mother's house. Over a cup of coffee, Ruby Moyers offers up 
her explanation for the career choice her son made. "Bill had no hobbies as a 
boy," she says. "To this day he doesn't. He was too small to play football, too 
thin to play any sport, so he couldn't attract the girls on the basis of an 
avocation. But he became a reporter for the Messenger and he had the courthouse 
beat. And at 16, after school, he would go to the courthouse and stand around 
with the prosecutors, the judges, the defense attorneys -- and would you 
believe it? The girls would be congregated at the courthouse door, waiting for 
Bill, who was suddenly very popular, because he had the gossip." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's full of old stories," Moyers tells me, now at the wheel of my car. We 
are going 15 miles an hour, sightseeing. Marshall has a population of 26,000, 
and like Everytown, U.S.A., an outskirts crowded with franchise strips and big, 
alienating malls. But that's not where we are going. We are headed deep into 
old Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patsy Findlay lived in that house that is now gone," he points. "That's my 
church there, Central Baptist. There is the house where Gloria Taylor lived. I 
was on my first double date with her. We were in the back seat. The couple in 
the front seat were necking. Gloria threw her arms back and said, "Take me.' 
And I said, 'Where?' Talk of naive."  
</P>
<P>
 Moyers has led this tour before, for the whole nation. His 90-minute 
"Marshall, Texas; Marshall, Texas" is an oft-repeated PBS staple. He sounds its 
themes again today; the hometown as teacher, touchstone for good or ill. As he 
did on film, Moyers doesn't shrink from Marshall's dark side. "This was the 
theater," he says; we can faintly see the sign: "Paramount." "If you go around 
the side, that's the entrance for colored. They would go around to the side, 
and they'd be sitting up there in what we called the buzzard's roost. That's 
the kind of place it was." He pauses. "I come out of a culture that paid a 
terrible price for disallowing dissent. I think my scolding comes from being a 
Southerner who learned how much we suffered because we didn't engage in 
self-scrutiny and internal dissent." 
</P>
<P>
 He pulls over and leads me up the lawn of a well-tended lot next to a restored 
historic landmark; he shows me a plaque in the grass. It commemorates Georgiana 
Lale, and, not incidentally, the words on it were written by Moyers, a 
commentary in her memory he delivered long ago on CBS News: 
</P>
<P>
 "She . . . held no office except those stations which citizens must fill to 
keep things going," the plaque reads. "Trinity Episcopal Church would not have 
been the same without her . . . nor the Red Cross nursing home volunteers. . . 
. Nor would the hummingbirds have been fed so lovingly on Fitzgerald Street. . 
. . I cannot count the ways she mattered, or her kind everywhere. If you look 
closely at the fabric of civilization which overlays the passions of this race, 
you will discover it held together with tiny rows of thread stitched by the 
hands of anonymous folk. No community makes it without them; no school, no 
church, no neighborhood or society." 
</P>
<P>
 In case I don't get it, Moyers makes clear what Georgiana Lale means to him. 
"I am a self, an authentic self; I truly matter," he says incantatorily. "I 
signify historically. I am a moral agent." It is a fundamental tenet of 
fashionable contemporary thought, postmodern thought, that the self is anything 
but authentic, that it matters so little that scholars speak of its death. 
Moyers is conversant with postmodernity and its offspring, deconstruction. But 
he is reconstructive, not deconstructive. He chooses to participate in what 
Elie Wiesel has called the new secular religion, a global wave of volunteerism, 
renouncing the aid of government and announcing the necessity of doing things 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgiana," he instructs me, "having fed the hummingbirds, left the garden 
for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be one more stop on this tour. "That's Bowie Street down there, 
that's Crockett Street," he says, "and this is the house where I grew up." We 
peer into the front windows of 801 E. Austin St. "That was my bedroom right 
there, first window to the right." His language is flat now, no rhetorical 
flights. "Just a four-room house, that's what we had. This was a street of poor 
people, but you'd never find this." 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff on the front porch" -- he waves his hand -- "the old refrigerators 
and stoves, the boxes like this. It was clean and orderly. My mother and father 
had middle-class values even though they were working-class people." 
</P>
<P>
 801 E. Austin doesn't match his ideal of a web of community; the fabric of 
civilization needs mending all the more. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN THE LIGHTS GO down on the "Bill Moyers' Journal" set, it's lunchtime. 
Ever the host, Moyers invites me upstairs, where sandwiches have been laid out 
for the crew and the talking heads. At the top of the stairs, he pauses; he has 
decided to interview himself. "Is it on?" he asks, pointing to my tape 
recorder. When I say it is, he says, "Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's disappointing about Clinton?" he queries. "It's that he took a dive in 
the first round on things that really mattered: fundamental reform of the 
political system, getting money out of politics. The Clinton White House has 
put itself on the side of the winners."  
</P>
<P>
 "What's the purpose of a political system?" he asks next. "It's not simply to 
be for the winners, it's not simply to bless the winners, it's not simply to 
lift the arms of the winners. It's to figure out what to do about the losers." 
</P>
<P>
 His anger won't end. He wants to matter in the world, to be a great man in an 
age that doesn't favor them. And in his own way, Citizen Moyers isn't shy about 
admitting it. "I felt when my grandson was born that the history of the future 
is my downstream," he tells me. "You begin to take yourself seriously 
historically. Not with grandiosity, but you realize, no matter what circle I'm 
in, I matter. What Kazantzakis said in the end of his wonderful memoir, 
'Journey to Morea': 'It's given to each man to serve one circle of ideas and 
people, and if he can't serve those ideas and those people, he can't save the 
world.' That to me is what citizenship is all about."

MOVIES / COMMENTARY; WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE; 'BLACK HARVEST' IS GRIPPING, 
FLABBERGASTING AND INDELIBLY ENTERTAINING. DID WE MENTION IT'S A DOCUMENTARY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An exceptional motion picture, recent winner of a worldwide 380-film 
competition and the capstone of a trilogy that has dazzled critics and won 
dozens of international awards, is opening theatrically today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years late. 
</P>
<P>
 For an abbreviated run. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing at 11 a.m. only. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to this seeming riddle is that "Black Harvest," screening today and 
next Saturday and Sunday at the Nuart on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los 
Angeles, is a card-carrying member of that most shunned of all genres: the 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, unfortunately, shouts "unclean" at today's theatrical audiences so 
much as that category, with the result that "Black Harvest" is being shown as 
part of a series carefully labeled "Nonfiction Film" to avoid contamination by 
that accursed 11-letter word. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true in nominally sophisticated Los Angeles, where, 
exceptions like the long-running "Visions of Light" notwithstanding, 
movie-goers seem to view documentaries with the kind of antipathy usually 
associated with freeway diamond lanes. But if it took an earthquake to make 
those lanes palatable, maybe this aesthetic quake will do the same for the 
documentary genre. 
</P>
<P>
 For the overwhelming irony here is that "Black Harvest" (which may get an 
expanded run if the box office warrants it) is more gripping, flabbergasting 
and purely entertaining than 90% of what usually appears on movie screens. The 
unexpected resonances of its story, the vividness of its cast of characters, 
and the passion with which it's been made all translate into an indelible movie 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson, the Australian filmmaking team (he does 
camera, she sound and they both edit with Ray Thomas) spent more than a dozen 
years making the trilogy that "Black Harvest" concludes. Though this final film 
contains a recap of the first two ("First Contact" and "Joe Leahy's Neighbors") 
and stands completely on its own, a bit of background information is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 All three films are set in Papua New Guinea, the large island nation just 
north of its former colonial master, Australia. One of the last places on Earth 
to be affected by Europeans, Papua New Guinea was largely untouched until 1926, 
when the discovery of gold brought the inevitable invasion of outsiders. Still, 
because the interior of the island looked to be one continuous and impenetrable 
mountain range, no one thought to search inland. Until the Leahys. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead by Michael, the eldest, and joined at varying times by brothers Patrick, 
James and Daniel, the Leahy mining expeditions were in many respects typical of 
prospectors looking for the big strike. But as they ventured inland, a pair of 
related developments confounded everyone. Those supposedly impenetrable 
mountains turned out to contain huge and fertile hidden valleys, valleys 
inhabited by close to a million people who had never seen, heard or so much as 
imagined the existence of white people. 
</P>
<P>
 Encounters like this had been taking place for hundreds of years, ever since 
Columbus, Cortes and Pizarro came to what they called the New World. What made 
the situation in Papua New Guinea different was a simple quirk of fate. Michael 
Leahy was a photography buff, and along with his mining gear he had casually 
brought along both movie and Leica cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary result (related in "First Contact") are several hours of 
16-millimeter film and 5,000 still photos that for the first time documented 
the way indigenous peoples reacted to the incomprehensible appearance of 
pale-skinned invaders. The looks of awe and terror Leahy's cameras recorded let 
us see just what Columbus and all the rest must have seen on their arrival in 
an unprepared world.  
</P>
<P>
 The tribal men thought that these pale people were spirits or gods, but the 
women found out soon enough how human they were and several mixed-race 
children, never recognized by their fathers or fully accepted by the tribes, 
were born. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these, Joe Leahy, Michael's unacknowledged son and the protagonist of "Joe 
Leahy's Neighbors" (like "First Contact" available on video from Documentary 
Educational Resources in Watertown, Mass.), was easily the most prominent. 
</P>
<P>
 Made in the mid-1980s when Joe was in his 40s, "Neighbors" details his 
interaction with the Ganiga, a prominent highland tribe. More educated and 
entrepreneurial than the Ganiga, who still live quasi-traditional lives, Joe 
buys land from them and turns it into a successful coffee plantation, which in 
turns leads to tribal resentment about Joe's determination to keep all his 
profits for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Harvest" opens with Joe at the peak of his influence. That first 
plantation has made him a wealthy man and, partially to quiet that resentment, 
he has gone into partnership with another of the Ganiga clans, lead by Popina 
Mai, a charismatic "big man" with the face and manner of an Old Testament 
prophet. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe, who promises the tribe that "you'll be up to your necks in money," 
provides the expertise, the tribe the land, with profits to be split 60-40. 
Five years after the deal, with the new plantation preparing for its first 
harvest, the filmmakers returned to see what would transpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly and Anderson's commitment to stay in the highlands for as long as it 
took for the story to unfold -- even though it meant living for a year with 
their infant daughter in a grass hut they built themselves -- is one of the 
keys to "Black Harvest's" success. For what did unfold was a tale no one could 
have anticipated, a wrenching, human story that reverberates with personal and 
global implications while revealing a singular culture from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a culture, first of all, that greatly admires oratory, and one of the 
film's unexpected pleasures is to hear premier public speakers like the 
expressive Popina Mai powerfully declaim in Temboka, the melodic local 
language, about the burning issues of the day. Of which there turn out to be 
several. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, no sooner is the new plantation ready to harvest than worldwide 
coffee prices drop steeply, and not only won't the Ganiga be up to their necks 
in money, they'll be forced to do the bean picking for less wages than they 
have in the past in order to keep the plantation out of the hands of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 And if this crisis wasn't enough, the Ganiga get halfheartedly drawn into a 
tribal war that is not really their affair. But like all wars, this soon 
escalates out of everyone's control, keeping Joe's workers away from the 
plantation and wreaking havoc with all of his and an increasingly haunted 
Popina Mai's careful plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a visual point of view, the footage Connolly and Anderson got of these 
bow-and-arrow tribal battles, during which one of their closest friends, a key 
player in "Joe Leahy's Neighbors," was killed and their own hut burned, is 
riveting, a startling glimpse into prehistory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically enough, that footage may have kept "Black Harvest" from being 
nominated for a best documentary Oscar last year, when persistent rumors had it 
that a minority of the nominating committee felt these shots had been staged. 
In a public letter issued in response to the controversy, Connolly and Anderson 
underlined the methodology that make their films so effective: "To not 
interfere, manipulate, stage, interrupt, but to unobtrusively observe is 
absolutely central to our filmmaking philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 And though the war footage is visually arresting, it is in fact a sidelight to 
why this film is such a knockout. For what "Black Harvest" focuses on is Joe 
and Popina Mai trying to cope with these crises. It is concerned with what 
happens when the 20th Century meets traditional ways, about a people forced to 
confront the shaky coexistence between revered tribal customs and lust for what 
Western modernism can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But potent as it is on that level, "Black Harvest" is even more effective when 
it personalizes these dilemmas. For at base this is a story about the death of 
dreams and all the anger, exasperation and sadness that goes along with that. 
It is a story of two men caught between competing cultures who both have reason 
to feel angry, trapped and betrayed, victims of societal forces that are well 
beyond anyone's control. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Joe Leahy tells Popina Mai at one point, "Nobody cares about us and 
our little enterprise, we're insignificant," "Black Harvest" shows that that 
doesn't have to be true. As told in this singular film, their story becomes not 
only our story, but in some ways the key story of the past 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Black Harvest," screens today , Saturday and next Sunday at the Nuart on 
Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: PINING FOR A BIT OF THE 
OLD ULTRA-VIOLENCE? BLAME MICHAEL MEDVED -- BETTER YET, DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has Michael Medved single-handedly shamed Hollywood into cleaning up its act? 
</P>
<P>
 So one might conclude from the cover of last weekend's supplement carried by 
more than 400 newspapers, which showed a beaming Medved seated beneath posters 
for "Sleepless in Seattle," "Schindler's List" and "The Age of Innocence."  
</P>
<P>
 "On the eve of Monday's Oscars," the USA Weekend cover line proclaimed, "the 
critic who took on the movie industry says: 'Hollywood Got the Message'." 
</P>
<P>
 Medved, who reviews films for public television and the New York Post, 
contended in the article that filmmakers have "started to make a serious effort 
to reconnect with the values of ordinary Americans" in part because of the 
overwhelming public response to published excerpts from his controversial 1992 
book, "Hollywood vs. America." 
</P>
<P>
 The book -- widely criticized within the industry as simplistic and moralistic 
-- attacked the notion that sex and violence sell tickets and accused the movie 
industry of engaging in self-destructive behavior by steadily increasing the 
percentage of R-rated releases. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence that Hollywood is now buying his argument, Medved cites such 1993 
PG-13-rated releases as "Jurassic Park" and "The Fugitive" and the PG-rated 
"The Age of Innocence." Praising "The Fugitive" for its restraint, he 
speculated that had the Oscar-nominated thriller "appeared a few years ago, it 
might well have been an R-rated bloodbath full of dismemberment and crude macho 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to Arnold Kopelson, the producer of "The Fugitive," which, 
like Medved's other examples, was in development years before "Hollywood vs. 
America" was published. " 'The Fugitive,' as it appeared on screen this past 
year, is precisely the film that we always intended it to be," Kopelson said 
through a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 He refrained from attacking Medved directly, but others did not. "I have never 
met a film critic who would so shamelessly suggest that his or her opinions 
influenced the direction of the film industry," said John Powers, who reviews 
movies for New York magazine. "The only film critic who thinks he has any power 
is Michael Medved." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Newsweek's David Ansen: "He's patting himself on the back and taking 
credit for something that I'm not sure has even occurred." Medved himself notes 
that in 1993, 61.2% of all rated films got an R -- a 3% increase over 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Both critics acknowledged that Hollywood is showing new interest in family 
films, but they said this trend was inspired more by studio executives' 
experiences raising children than by outside pressure. "They've wised up to the 
fact that there's an audience for these films," Ansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Medved described himself as "one participant among 
many in the ongoing debate which has begun to shift the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 "The (headline) says 'Hollywood Got the Message.' It doesn't say, 'Hollywood 
Got My Message,' " he said. "I don't think there's any suggestion that I 
single-handedly changed things. I was just one of many voices raised in this 
cause over a long period of time."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: WHERE WERE THEY ON OSCAR 
NIGHT? WE'RE JUST ASKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So where were Meryl and Mel, Jodie and Kevin, Barbra, Sly, Robin, Julia, 
Arnold, Michelle, Denzel, Jack, Warren & Annette and Demi & Bruce on Oscar 
night? 
</P>
<P>
 Did they forget to show? Were all the limos taken? Was there a shortage of 
designer gowns? 
</P>
<P>
 Such were the pressing concerns of the camped-out looky-loos and die-hard fans 
whose hopes of seeing the A-list stars last Monday night were dashed when 
Hollywood's Big Night Out turned out to be Hollywood's Big No-Show. And such 
was the buzz of Hollywood in the days after the Oscar telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy Awards, after all, has always been the night more than 1 billion 
folks around the globe can count on seeing their favorite movie stars mug for 
the cameras and parade around in some weird, or hopefully, risque attire. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted by The Times, missing stars' agents and publicists served up 
sundry excuses for the MIAs: 
</P>
<P>
 * On location, on vacation or preparing films: Jodie Foster is in Asheville, 
N.C., working on "Nell," Mel Gibson is prepping "Brave Heart," Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is rehearsing for Ivan Reitman's "Junior," Julia Roberts is in 
Paris shooting Robert Altman's "Pret-a-Porter," Sylvester Stallone is in Miami 
making "The Specialist," Bruce Willis and Demi Moore were out of town on a 
"personal holiday" and Meryl Streep was in Hawaii on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why bother?: If someone wasn't a nominee or a presenter, the attitude was 
why bother with the hassle and expense of showing up? Richard Gere lives in New 
York and didn't want to travel west for one day just to be seen. Eddie Murphy 
just returned from Jamaica, where he was celebrating a one-year anniversary 
with his bride, Nicole. Michelle Pfeiffer isn't a big fan of event/party 
hopping anyway. And Denzel Washington did it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Showing up without being a presenter or nominee now carries the connotation 
of being a bit desperate: Who wants to take the chance of hearing "Why is he 
here?" or "Her star must be falling since she's obviously here to be seen. What 
other reason could it be?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Hollywood has become much more of a big business: The one-time family 
community spirit of turning up just to support your nominated colleagues has 
basically exited, stage left. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents generally shied from having their names mentioned here. But all say 
their clients just didn't feel like they should attend unless they had a 
purpose for being there.  
</P>
<P>
 Publicist Nancy Seltzer, who represents such stars as Julia Roberts, Warren 
Beatty and Annette Benning, says, "Jack (Nicholson) doesn't come unless he's 
doing something on the show. Most people don't. Annette showed up last year 
because she was presenting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also said simply showing up without a real reason for being there makes 
stars feel awkward. "What are they supposed to do, just stand around? I tell my 
clients they don't have to go," conceded one top agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some veteran publicists who have masterminded various stars' past 
Oscar campaigns, the absentees were particularly noticeable this year. "It's 
tough to pinpoint the year it changed, but it has changed. This used to be the 
big night that almost all the stars would show up," says Dick Guttman, who 
represents Barbra Streisand. She, by the way, wasn't there because she's 
prepping for her new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even those who skipped the awards ceremony used to turn up at Swifty Lazar's 
(Oscar party at Spago) to watch it on TV," he noted. But even Lazar's was 
starting to become the gathering spot for fading A-list stars. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent noted that after Lazar's passing this year, there was a boom on 
post-Oscar bashes and the sense was that there were too many parties, so little 
time. Such bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Brown, executive VP at Arnold Kopelson Prods., who co-produced "The 
Fugitive" (which won Tommy Lee Jones a best supporting actor Oscar), recalls: 
"When Arnold won the best picture for 'Platoon' in 1986, I remember looking 
around the room and seeing the place packed with familiar faces." This year, he 
says among the few recognizable studio executives and some stars, "there were 
lots of faces I had never seen and I remember thinking . . . there's definitely 
something missing."

DANA PARSONS: ALL RANDI WEBER WANTS IS HER OWN HOME TO DIE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The springtime of her life is long since gone. Summer, too, for that matter. 
The only mystery left for Randi Weber is whether, at 42, winter is now upon her 
prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that she's afraid of dying; she came to grips long ago with the fact 
that AIDS would eventually kill her. No, the final question of her life isn't 
whether she'll die young, but where. Will it be in the safe haven of her San 
Clemente home of the past 14 years, surrounded by friends and two poodles and a 
Chihuahua, or in some place as yet unknown to her? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to die here," she says. "I have no problem saying that." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something else on her mind that she wants to ask me. Frankly, it's 
the reason she has invited me to her home. She jokes that she "dressed up" in a 
new red sweat suit she just got for her birthday. Before we get to what she 
really wants to ask, I ask her about her recent life. 
</P>
<P>
 She had her first seizure in 1982. She had her second in 1983. That time, a 
growth showed up in her brain, and it proved to be a malignant tumor. She had 
brain surgery and a blood transfusion in an Army medical hospital outside 
Denver. The surgery was successful; the transfusion was not. The blood supply 
was tainted, and in 1986 Weber, who had been a nurse, was diagnosed with 
full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that, her husband, a career Marine, served her with divorce 
papers and moved out. The divorce wasn't final until 1991. One of the terms was 
that when her ex-husband retired from the Corps, their house would be sold so 
he could receive his legal share of the asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi Weber chuckles as she recalls why the divorce took a few years to be 
finalized: Nobody figured she would live very long. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's now 1994 and her ex-husband, now living in Virginia, recently retired 
after a 20-year career. He wants his share of the house, a sum of money Randi 
Weber can't beg, borrow or steal. So, she has put the house up for sale and has 
a pending offer. 
</P>
<P>
 To her friends, it seems like the ultimate cruelty: her husband divorced her 
and now is legally entitled to force the sale of the home. Should Randi die 
before it's sold, he would own it outright. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another whammy. If the house sells, Randi will clear enough money to 
disqualify her from certain medical benefits she depends on -- such as a 
live-in caretaker -- but not enough to re-establish herself comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, that's all extraneous. The simple fact is that she doesn't want to 
move, even if she had the physical strength to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there an answer to all this? I ask her. "The answer is -- and this is hard 
for me to do," she says. "I've never done this before in my life. I'm asking 
for your help to see if people will help me. Does that sound awful? This is my 
humbling experience. I've never done this, and it's very hard for me to ask for 
help like this, but it's my only option." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the current value of the house, Randi's attorney, Cisca Stellhorn, 
says $50,000 to $60,000 would buy out her ex-husband. Stellhorn says if someone 
were to lend Randi the money, for example, it could be secured against the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "To him (her ex-husband), this is an investment and a house," Randi says. "To 
me, this is home and security. This is where my support is." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, she says, buying out her ex-husband would enable her to leave the 
house to her caretaker and her 20-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder, as I did, why her ex-husband can't stretch things out a bit 
longer. I presume he has his reasons. I telephoned him in Virginia to ask about 
those reasons but was unable to contact him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Randi Weber is in the countdown mode. "Fifty-four days," she 
says. Fifty-four days to come up with the money or the offer on the table must 
be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving her house won't save her life. "It's not going to give me an immune 
system," she says. "It's a matter of time, I know this. I know it's a matter of 
time until one of the opportunistic infections hits me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, no, the money won't save her life. I told her it was a long shot, at best, 
that anyone would come up with that much money. 
</P>
<P>
 After I left, I thought about Randi Weber's last dozen years. . . . Brain 
tumor. Tainted blood supplied by the government. A husband who left her after 
she got sick. Watching herself slowly succumb to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 It struck me as near-pathetic that she felt embarrassed asking for money from 
people she doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 A cruel world? Sometimes it's hard not to think so. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund has been set up: Randi's House Rescue, in care of Mariners Bank in San 
Clemente. 
</P>

MISPLACED COMPASSION FOR MURDERER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * When I had completely read the article ("Latinos Say 6 Youths 'Railroaded,' 
" March 10) regarding the Latino community outrage over police, prosecution and 
media portrayals in the Steven Woods murder case being unfair, I too was 
outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 I am disgusted that people who commit heinous acts of violence are, through 
some twisted logic, portrayed as victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez trial, the defense did not deny that Lyle and Erik executed 
their parents with shotguns, (but) they defend the action by stating that they 
are victims of parental abuse. In the Woods case, Latino leaders claim that the 
(Anglo) youths came looking for trouble, and that is justification for a 
17-year-old being impaled through the skull with a paint roller. Something is 
dreadfully wrong here. 
</P>
<P>
 Having experienced true racism (being judged purely on the color of my skin), 
I believe that racism is an intolerable act that can leave deep emotional 
scars, and we must continue the work we have already done to erase it from the 
American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 However miserable it might be, I would always choose to be the target of 
racism (rather) than the target of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that one 17-year-old boy is dead and the boy who caused the death 
is alive. It doesn't matter what race either boy is or was, if we want to show 
compassion for the murderer, we must be insensitive to the murdered. It's as 
simple as that! 
</P>
<P>
 We can't have it both ways, so we must choose who will receive our compassion, 
the murdered or the murderer.

HATE CRIMES WANE BUT NOT BY ENOUGH; * SPOTLIGHT MUST BE KEPT ON ACTIONS TO 
ERADICATE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the average, a hate crime or hate-related incident was reported nearly 
every other day last year in Orange County. That is an appalling number, yet it 
actually represents a slight improvement over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission, which began compiling lists of 
hate crimes and incidents in 1990 and issued its first report the next year, 
reported that the total in 1992 was 188; last year it fell to 180. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the incidents reported: An employee at an Irvine law firm was the target 
of anti-Semitic comments from a colleague. Among the crimes: A man thought by 
his assailants to be gay was savagely beaten in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Few groups were spared: whites, blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, gays; all 
were targets. Most often singled out were gays and lesbians, accounting for 35 
incidents, up from 25 reported in 1992. Next came Jews, 31 incidents, up from 
19 the previous year, and African Americans, 29 incidents, a steep drop from 
the 61 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Police from departments across Orange County deserve credit for helping 
compile the reports. Police officials have become sensitive to attacks 
motivated by ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation rather than just money 
or revenge, and have instructed the cop on the beat to be on guard for such 
attacks. A number of departments have designated one individual to handle hate 
crimes, making coordination easier and increasing the likelihood that seemingly 
separate incidents will be seen as part of a larger picture. Still, the Human 
Relations Commission is hoping for better reporting by some less diligent 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of police officials meet periodically with leaders of community 
organizations who banded together as a "hate crimes network." That is a good 
idea, because it makes it easier for groups to report incidents directed 
against their members and lets police keep open the lines of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Bernstein of the Orange County chapter of the Anti-Defamation League, 
which monitors anti-Semitic incidents, said the number of verbal and physical 
attacks on Jews reached a record high last year -- 41 by his group's count, 31 
by the commission's, using a different reporting method. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernstein cautioned that part of the increase from the usual number of 17 
or 18 may be the result of people being more willing to report the attacks. 
That is a good sign if it means someone feels confident enough not to hide his 
or her identity as a gay or lesbian, a Jew or a Muslim, or whatever. It also 
indicates that the person attacked believes that reporting the incident will do 
good, rather than shrugging it off with a "nobody cares" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who care are state and federal judges, whose tough sentences in 
Orange County cases last year sent a clear message that hate crimes are 
especially vicious and will not be tolerated. A federal judge sentenced a 
20-year-old to eight years in prison and a 17-year-old to nearly five years 
after they attacked homes and synagogues and plotted attacks on Jews, blacks, 
Asians and Latinos. A Superior Court judge sentenced the attacker of the man he 
presumed to be gay in Laguna Beach to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Relations Commission has done a good job of shining the spotlight on 
incidents and crimes of hate. There may not be many who act upon their hatred, 
but unfortunately their power to hurt others is great. We need to be reminded 
that this behavior exists, so we can reach out to victims, take action against 
the perpetrators and try to eradicate the poison before it spreads.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON BUSINESS; CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE PLAN 
THREATENS THE COUNTY'S RECOVERY; EMPLOYER MANDATE PUTS UNFAIR FINANCIAL BURDEN 
ON SMALL FIRMS, WITH JOB AND WAGE CUTS AND HIGHER PRICES THE LIKELY RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL J. FELDSTEIN, Paul J. Feldstein, Ph.D., is a professor and the FHP 
Foundation Distinguished Chair in Health Care Management at UC Irvine's 
Graduate School of Management. The author of six books and more than 60 
articles on health care, Feldstein is currently conducting a study on the rise 
in employer health care costs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when Orange County businesses are finally beginning to recover from the 
worst recession since the Great Depression, they are being confronted with a 
new economic threat: President Clinton's plan to require every employer to 
participate in the financing of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's plan, employers would have to pay 80% of health insurance 
costs (up to 7.9% of payroll), while employees contribute 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 For employers who are not currently providing health benefits or are providing 
less generous benefits than those Clinton's plan would guarantee -- i.e., the 
smaller firms that are the lifeblood of Orange County's economy -- this will 
mean facing a significant increase in labor costs on the heels of a prolonged 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has shown little sensitivity to the enormous 
financial burden its "employer mandate" would place on small businesses. When 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was questioned some time ago about how this 
mandate might injure small firms, she said: "I can't go out and save every 
undercapitalized entrepreneur in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton may not be concerned about whether entrepreneurs can survive 
health care reform, but anyone who has a stake in Orange County's economic 
health must be. State Employment Development Department figures show that firms 
with fewer than 20 employees -- those most likely to be without health 
insurance -- account for 86% of the county's estimated 71,650 companies, and 
firms with fewer than 100 employees account for 98% of businesses in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Because large companies have downsized and learned that they can get by with 
fewer employees, we have been looking to small businesses to lead the rebound 
in jobs as the economy recovers. But instead of growth, we are certain to see 
more job losses if Clinton's employer mandate is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan attempts to provide some relief for small businesses by 
offering subsidies that make the employer contribution as low as 3.5% of 
payroll for the smallest firms with the lowest average wages. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with subsidies, many Orange County companies would suffer under 
Clinton's plan. Stuart Butler, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, 
pointed out during the recent Health Care Forecast Conference, sponsored by UC 
Irvine's Graduate School of Management, that two-thirds of all firms not 
currently providing health insurance would face annual costs, after all 
subsidies, of at least $1,000 per employee, and 15% of those firms would end up 
paying more than $2,500 per employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are likely to respond to this increase in health costs in three ways 
that would be detrimental to Orange County's economy: 
</P>
<P>
 * By hiring fewer workers or laying off low-wage and part-time workers to 
avoid the cost of providing health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * By reducing salaries -- the Heritage Foundation estimates that 88% of the 
cost of the employer mandate would be passed on to employees through salary 
cuts -- or deducting more from paychecks for health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * By passing extra labor costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, companies eventually will shift the cost of the employer 
mandate onto workers or customers, and we will have what amounts to a 
regressive tax, with the low-income population bearing an unfair share of the 
cost of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has made it clear that he considers the employer mandate the 
most crucial element of his plan to provide health insurance for every 
American. He apparently views it as the only way to provide universal coverage. 
But there is an alternative that would enable us to achieve this important goal 
in an equitable manner -- without deceiving the public about who is really 
bearing the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need is a mandate that places the responsibility for obtaining basic 
health coverage on the individual rather than the employer. Insurance should be 
portable, with guaranteed renewability, and those who can't afford coverage 
(including Medi-Cal patients) should receive vouchers or tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of providing coverage for the low-income population could be financed 
through the tax system, either through a direct tax increase or by limiting the 
deductibility of health insurance premiums. (Health insurance premiums paid by 
employers are now excluded from employees' taxable income and from payroll 
taxes, a practice that costs the federal government more than $66 billion a 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
 We don't hear President Clinton talking about an individual mandate because, 
for political reasons, he must preserve the illusion that we can guarantee 
universal coverage without increasing taxes. The idea of employers being 
required to pay 80% of premiums doesn't carry the shock value of a tax 
increase, because people who have insurance through their employer tend to 
forget that they are paying for it in the form of lower wages and higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is that if we are to have universal coverage, all of us -- as 
purchasers of insurance for ourselves and as taxpayers who care for the poor -- 
will have to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's employer mandate would place a disproportionate share of the 
financing burden on small businesses and their employees. Orange County's small 
firms, which face the costs of operating in a highly regulated business 
environment, will find it hard enough to recover from the recession without 
this added burden. And so will the low-wage workers who end up losing their 
jobs or having to do without necessary income.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; USC FALLS SHORT IN CHASE FOR TITLE; 
WOMEN: LOUISIANA TECH USES ZONE PRESS TO OVERCOME TWO SEVEN-POINT DEFICITS IN 
75-66 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They walked off the court, beaten but unbowed. USC's women's basketball team 
had just had its season ended in a 75-66 loss to Louisiana Tech in the Mideast 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 While exuberant Louisiana Tech players cried, hugged and cut down nets, USC's 
players filed off the court and entered a cold linoleum hallway leading to 
their locker room.  
</P>
<P>
 All eyes were straight ahead. There were no tears. USC Coach Cheryl Miller 
followed her team, eyes straight ahead. For the Pac-10 champions, there would 
be no trip to the women's Final Four for their rookie coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And for 6-5 senior Lisa Leslie, her last chance at a Final Four appearance had 
slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, USC, before 4,704, finished 26-4 on the season, losing to a team that 
has now won 24 in a row and meets Alabama Saturday in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Louisiana Tech Coach Leon Barmore came up the same hallway, 
gleefully dribbling the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Barmore wondered how much his Lady Techsters (30-3) will have left in 
Richmond. Barmore's players had already been extended here at Bud Walton Arena 
with a 71-68 upset of the nation's top-ranked team, Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised his team's second-half zone press, which erased a 37-34 USC 
halftime lead and two seven-point USC leads early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tennessee game took a lot out of us, and in the first half we were 
standing around, not much movement," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm drained. I'm amazed at what my team did the last couple days. I love 
these players. But I had to get after 'em a bit at halftime. They know I love 
'em, but they know I can kick 'em in the butt if I have to, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was really something -- what these kids did was like fighting Mike Tyson 
on Thursday and Rocky Marciano on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who watched Louisiana Tech wreck Tennessee with superior team speed, 
managed to negate that advantage by taking away its transition game. But she 
also watched her team get outrebounded, particularly in the decisive final 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got them in a half-court game, which is what we wanted, but we needed much 
better rebounding," she said. "And we had enough good shots to win, but they 
didn't drop for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's team had won seven in a row until Saturday, including three NCAA 
tournament games, but Tech exposed several USC weaknesses, indicating the 
direction Miller must head in the recruiting season.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to replacing Leslie, Miller must find two sure-handed guards and a 
three-point shooter. Senior Nicky McCrimmon was one of the nation's best point 
guards this year, but it was obvious Saturday that she had little help in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans committed 20 turnovers to Louisiana Tech's seven, and were only 
one for nine from three-point range.  
</P>
<P>
 Late in the first half and early after halftime, USC seemed Richmond-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans scored the last six points of the first half, then had 41-34 and 
43-36 leads, thanks to Leslie and McCrimmon.  
</P>
<P>
 But later, a remarkable 18-foot fadeaway jump shot by Tech's Amy Brown with 
11:30 to go and her subsequent free throw gave Tech a lead, 55-54, it never 
relinquished.  
</P>
<P>
 After Brown's score, the Lady Techsters had nursed a slim lead until 
tournament MVP Debra Williams (26 points) hit three jump shots within four 
minutes, including a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5:48 to go, USC was looking at a 68-61 deficit and the Trojans scored 
only one basket in the final three minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Barmore saluted Miller . . . . and took a slight rip at Leslie. 
Friday, Barmore had said at a news conference that Leslie was college 
basketball's best woman post player in the last dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leslie is a fine player, but she's not in the same league with Cheryl Miller 
at effort and gettin' after it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our post players did a great job tonight against her." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's final game produced 24 points, 10 rebounds, five blocked shots and 
two assists. Miller got four points from her starting guards, while Barmore got 
42, 16 from Pam Thomas in addition to Williams' 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Thomas both made the all-tournament team, along with Leslie, 
USC's Tina Thompson and Tennessee's Nicki McCray. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Miller said it had been an educational season. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a coach, this was a learning experience. I'm not upset with my players, 
they had a hell of a year. We have a lot to draw on for next season."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; DUKE'S BITE WORSE THAN DOG'S BARK; 
SOUTHEAST: BLUE DEVILS HOLD PURDUE'S ROBINSON TO SEASON-LOW 13 POINTS IN 69-60 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Those were the oldest tricks in the book Duke taught the Big Dog Saturday 
night, the one about defense and teamwork paying off and the one about five 
always beating one, even if the one is All-Canine and the five are the leanest 
Mike Krzyzewski has brought down this pike in many a moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue's Glenn Robinson finally met his match against a Duke team that has no 
Christian Laettner, has no Bobby Hurley and had no Grant Hill for the six most 
important minutes of the 1994 NCAA Southeast Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's fleas ran Big Dog out of this tournament, 69-60, buzzing at his 
kneecaps, swarming around his face, pestering Rob inson into his poorest 
shooting performance of the season and bringing Purdue down with him before 
23,370 at Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleas were green (freshman Jeff Capel) and they were small (Chris Collins, 
the shortest Blue Devil) and they were Meek (Erik, Duke's backup center), but 
they were all over the place. Robinson's all-court, any-angle repertoire 
doesn't need much operating room, but Duke allowed him next to zero, and 
Purdue's meal ticket punched out with a six-for-22, 13-point brickfest -- 
including a scoreless spell of nearly 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen points are a season low, 18 below Robinson's season average and 31 
below Robinson's 44-point virtuoso against Kansas on Thursday night. Only twice 
this season had Robinson scored fewer than 20 points in a game -- 18 against 
Western Michigan and 15 against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But until a meaningless dunk in the final 30 seconds, Robinson had been held 
to 11 points by Duke, including a 17-minute 56-second stretch in which he 
failed to score a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been to a lot of regional championship games," said Krzyzewski, who 
is 7-0 in these things, "and this is as good as any we've played in." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Krzyzewski pointed to a six-minute period late in the second 
half with Hill, Duke's best player and defender, on the bench with his fourth 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill left the game with 9:54 left and the Devils nursing a 46-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned, with 3:52 remaining, that lead was 56-50. During those six 
minutes, Robinson managed but a single basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought when Grant Hill got that fourth foul . . . I didn't know what to 
think," Krzyzewski said. "What I saw the next six minutes was some of our best 
basketball this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fate has a funny way of dealing with things. Finally, all of a sudden, in 
this most important moment, the people Grant Hill brought along all year were 
the ones bringing him along." 
</P>
<P>
 Capel, a 19-year-old guard averaging eight points a game, scored 19 in this 
one and personally out-highlighted Robinson with a behind-the-back bounce pass 
to Antonio Lang and a breakaway rim-hanging jam that burst the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang, assigned to Robinson when Hill left the game, also scored 19 points, and 
center Cherokee Parks chipped in 15 points of his own and did whatever he could 
to narrow the Big Dog gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things were getting rough," Hill said, "whenever there was a stoppages 
of play, Cherokee would start calling me 'Big Dog' . . . Eventually, he was 
calling everybody on our team 'Big Dog.' 'Way to go, Big Dog!' That's part of 
Cherokee's personality, to keep everybody loose." 
</P>
<P>
 And what did the real Mr. Dog have to say about the evening's proceedings? 
</P>
<P>
 Not a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's opening postgame statement: "It was a great game. We fought hard. 
They won the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, someone worked up the courage to ask Robinson if he could 
please elaborate on his, uh, off-night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's gonna have a bad game," he glowered. "I didn't pick the best time 
to have a bad game, but I'm not ashamed at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the season, I opened Sports Illustrated and Street and 
Smith's and they were calling us the 30th-best team in the country, 35th, 29th. 
. . . The Chicago Tribune, before the start of conference, said 'Purdue wasn't 
a good team, Purdue was a one-man team, believe me, at the end of the season, 
Purdue won't be in the top 10.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We made you guys look like fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the inevitable question: Was this the final collegiate game for 
Robinson, a junior expected to be the No. 1 selection in the NBA draft, if and 
when? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who asked that?" Robinson snarled. 
</P>
<P>
 A hand went up in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson shot him a glare that could have melted a backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I have a press conference, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill scored only 11 points but was named outstanding player of the regional, 
primarily for his defensive work on Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grant had to expend the most energy out there, so he had to pick his spots on 
offense," Krzyzewski said. "He's the best defensive player in the country. Has 
been for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 And now Hill's back in the Final Four for the third time in his four years at 
Duke. For Krzyzewski, this is his seventh Final Four in the last nine years -- 
and possibly his most surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not devoid of talent, we have talent, but I knew we had a chance not 
to be a Final Four team -- nothing against you guys," Krzyzewski said, glancing 
across the dais at Hill, Lang and Capel. "To be honest, I'm a little bit 
shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski called this Duke group "not a great team, but a good team with 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 That may not beat a team with the best offensive force in the nation every 
time, but given his druthers, Krzyzewski will take his chances.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; ARIZONA GUARDS SILENCE CRITICS, 92-72; 
WEST REGIONAL: STOUDAMIRE (27 POINTS) AND REEVES (26) FUEL VICTORY OVER 
MISSOURI. 
</P>

<P>
 They run, they jump, they have the conscience of a used car salesman when they 
shoot, and they are in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Arizona Wildcats, saviors of the Pacific 10 and the best team in 
the West after blowing out Missouri, 92-72, Saturday to win the West Regional 
before 15,517 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also pretty excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so fired up it's pathetic," center Joseph Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why. The Wildcats made up for back-to-back first-round NCAA 
tournament defeats the last two years and earned a trip to the Final Four for 
the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (29-5) will play the winner of today's Midwest Regional final 
between Arkansas and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Arizona seems pretty confident after knocking off Big Eight 
champion Missouri, which was seeded No. 1 in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no fluke," Blair said. "We're not the weak, pansy West team. We're 
out to kick some butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence and jump shots flowed freely at the Sports Arena, where Arizona's 
point-snuffing defense and its backcourt of Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves 
ended Missouri's season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire made four three-pointers in the first half and wound up with 27 
points, which went along nicely with the 26 points by Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can flat-out light you up," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "And they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more to Arizona's success than Stoudamire and Reeves. Most notable 
was the Wildcat defense, directed by Olson and produced mainly by Reggie Geary, 
who held Melvin Booker to 14 points in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 So dominant was Arizona that Missouri got no closer than eight points in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, who led by 48-34 at the midway point thanks to Stoudamire's 18 
points in 20 minutes, saw the Tigers claw to within 52-44 on Paul O'Liney's 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 That was as close as Missouri got. Blair scored from close range, Geary tipped 
in a missed shot and Reeves converted a Booker turnover into a breakaway layup 
and quickly Arizona was out of sight again, 58-44. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air was out of their balloon," Geary said. "You could just tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it really did start to get sort of disheartening, Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't make the key plays," he said. "They made the key plays to get 
(the lead) back up. We knocked on the door, but we couldn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri (28-4) spent most of the game missing shots. The Tigers made only 29 
of 83 field goal attempts and were seven for 33 from long distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Norm Stewart said Arizona's defense was partly responsible, but then so 
was lousy shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what was to be? How about an Arizona victory, one that the Wildcats used 
to silence those who dared to point out their recent shortcomings in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys have labeled us a choke team," Geary told reporters in the Arizona 
locker room. "It's basically Arizona versus the world. We like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson was equally direct, spending nearly as much time chastising the media as 
savoring the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tremendously proud of this group of guys who have been doubted and 
questioned and called chokers and losers and the rest of it," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing in my mind that can feel better right at this point than for 
them to just take it and put it in the appropriate place." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri might have fared a little better if it had spent slightly more time 
in the appropriate place, such as on defense, according to Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Missouri is a team we thought was a little slow getting back," Stoudamire 
said. "We were getting a lot of pull-up jumpers, four-on-twos, three-on-twos . 
. . Missouri was a step slow in transition and that was probably the main 
difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but there were more differences. Arizona played Missouri evenly on 
the backboards, even though Blair and Kevin Flanagan were in foul trouble in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri's main inside threat, 6-foot-9, 242-pound Jevon Crudup, had 14 points 
and six rebounds, but he fouled out after 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said he was not sorry to see him depart, even though it was 69-53 at 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a big old fella," Blair said. "He's not some little missy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire is not a big old fella, not at 5-11 and 162 pounds, but he knew he 
had to play big if Arizona was going to Charlotte. That's why he showed up at 
the Sports Arena at 8 a.m. to practice his jumper, the one that had been so 
errant in the victory Thursday night over Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dedicating myself to this day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good choice. Stoudamire shot four three-pointers in the first half 
and made them all, the ball barely rippling the net each time. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who has seen it before, still liked it. "At times, he is amazing to 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's lead grew to 88-61 on two free throws by Reeves with 2:59 to go and 
all that was left was for Blair to dance in front of the Arizona bench as the 
clock wound down. 
</P>
<P>
 He did the same dance after Arizona's 71-58 victory over Virginia in the 
second-round game at Sacramento. At that time, he called the dance his 
"Sweet-16, I'm-happy, we're-not-a-soft-team-from-the-West-anymore, 
let's-win-it-all dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair decided to shorten the name of the dance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Blair Bump," he said.

COMMENTARY; GARAGIOLA TAKES CUTS FOR BASEBALL'S NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Garagiola remembered the woman. She was young and beautiful and vivacious. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembered her from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in St. Louis, the years after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 That war was World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a teammate's wife, and Garagiola remembered her the way we remember 
youth. As a snapshot of a moment. The woman smiling. Everyone happy to be near 
her. Time caught in a bottle, time suspended. In memory, we are forever young. 
</P>
<P>
 When she called Garagiola, he hadn't heard her voice for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice caused a flash of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A snapshot of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days. Garagiola came to the Cardinals as a kid catcher with a 
big future. Signed for $500 off the St. Louis sandlots by Branch Rickey, 
Garagiola, only 20, was a World Series star in 1946: .316, with four hits in 
Game 4. He was at .347 in mid-June of 1950 when he tore up a shoulder avoiding 
a collision with Brooklyn Dodgers first baseman Jackie Robinson. He never was 
as good again. In 676 games, Garagiola hit .257 with 42 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers say: just another guy. 
</P>
<P>
 A catcher in 70 games a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds did that. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd have forgotten Joe Garagiola by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for this: He made himself unforgettable by becoming baseball's savviest 
and funniest broadcaster. For almost 40 years he has given radio and television 
audiences daily demonstrations of his love for the game and its people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those people was the beautiful young woman from all those years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now she's calling me," Garagiola says, "and I'm seeing her the way I 
remember her -- until she starts talking. Sobbing, really. She's breaking down. 
She says, 'Joe, I'm going to jail. I'm 69 years old, Joe, and I'm going to 
jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garagiola says, "How can we help you?" 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years now, Joe Garagiola has been at the heart of BAT. That's the 
Baseball Assistance Team. It's an organization created to help baseball people 
who no longer can help themselves. Garagiola says it's there "for those who are 
hurting and forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman from Garagiola's youth owed tax money. She had fallen behind on 
credit-card bills. Her husband was dead and she had nowhere to turn. It was 
then that Garagiola and BAT helped. "She wasn't going to jail," the old catcher 
says. "We paid her bills." 
</P>
<P>
 At its start, BAT intended to help only former big league players who weren't 
covered by baseball's pension plan, mostly those whose work preceded the 
pension's creation in 1947. But BAT's reach was extended when Garagiola heard 
about a woman who didn't have the money for a double mastectomy and 
hip-replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd worked 31 years in a minor league team's front office," Garagiola says. 
"She was more baseball than Babe Ruth! And somebody should help her." 
</P>
<P>
 Now BAT helps umpires, scouts, widows, front-office workers, Negro League 
veterans, anyone in the baseball family. It has paid the burial expenses for a 
ball player's 11-year-old son. It has paid for the funeral of a ball player 
whose body went unclaimed for four days at a morgue. It helped a widow put a 
tombstone on her man's grave. A player who once made $800,000 a year sought 
BAT's help when he couldn't pay for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a call like I did this week, a minor leaguer needing a 
bone-marrow transplant and no way to get it," Garagiola says, "it's a crusher." 
</P>
<P>
 So Garagiola and BAT go looking for money. The organization works out of 
offices made available by the baseball commissioner at 350 Park Ave., New York. 
BAT has only two employees, Executive Director Frank Slocum and his secretary. 
Everyone else is a volunteer, including Ted Williams, Bob Gibson and Willie 
Mays. As Garagiola put it, "We're always scrounging and clawing and scraping 
for money." 
</P>
<P>
 In BAT's case, corporations are not eager to make donations to a game filled 
with millionaires apparently unwilling to help the hurting and forgotten people 
who made today's wealth possible. The players tell you, though, they are 
reluctant to make contributions until the owners also kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest -- the only -- breakthrough came with a $150,000 donation of one 
game's receipts by George Steinbrenner and the New York Yankees. Garagiola 
says, "If one owner each year gave BAT one game's receipts, we're home free. 
And each owner's turn would come up once every 28 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that all players today ignore BAT. Donations have come from Dwight Gooden, 
both Ken Griffeys, Dave Valle, Dave Stewart and Willie McGee. And BAT has a $1 
million endowment: $300,000 from Gannett's Freedom Forum, $300,000 from the 
Major League Baseball Players Assn., $300,000 from the commissioner's office 
and $100,000 from USA Today's All-Star promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the interest earned by a $1 million endowment covers only a fraction of 
BAT's costs. Garagiola says, "Unfortunately, our business is picking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Deck, the baseball-card people, donates $10,000 per old-timers game.

ERIC SHOW WAS A TROUBLED SOUL IN RECENT YEARS; PERSONALITY: FRIENDS HEARD HIS 
PANICKED CRIES OF FEAR, HIS DESPERATE CALLS FOR HELP. THEY LOVED HIM, BUT 
COULDN'T SAVE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WILSTEIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real cause of Eric Show's death will not appear on autopsy or toxicology 
reports. He snorted crystal methamphetamine -- speed, crank, rocket fuel -- but 
he died of an inner torment not even his closest friends fully understood. 
</P>
<P>
 They heard his panicked cries of fear, his desperate calls for help. They 
loved him, but couldn't save him. Not the friends who took him in for weeks at 
a time, nor the wife who waited for him to come home. They saw death coming, 
yet didn't recognize it until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The former San Diego Padres pitcher wrote a tender letter to his wife Cara 
Mia, a week before he died at 37 on March 16, telling her he was entering a new 
stage of life. Death, he believed, would bring salvation. At the same time, 
Show visited his father, hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease, and made peace 
at last with him after years of emotional emptiness between them. He held his 
father's limp hand, kissed him and never saw him again. 
</P>
<P>
 A portrait of a brilliant, generous but terribly troubled man emerged from 
interviews with Show's friends and former teammates since his death. He was 
never easy to understand, and his death in a rehabilitation center was no 
ordinary drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been a millionaire star for the Padres, led them to their only National 
League pennant 10 years ago, and possessed the talent to be a top jazz 
guitarist. Yet he got sucked into a vortex of despair, and a week ago he was 
buried in a green coffin with his guitar, his glove and a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the secrets of his enigmatic life are beginning to surface. The 
infamous cuts on his fingers at spring training two years ago came from 
climbing a barbed wire fence to escape "the wrong people in the wrong place at 
the wrong time," he confided to a friend. That led to his release by the 
Oakland Athletics and the premature end of his baseball career. To all but a 
few people, he disappeared mysteriously when he left camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Show's death ended two lost years in a life that had been so full of fervor 
for baseball and music, physics and art, math and religion, politics and 
philosophy. He had a probing mind. He would much rather spend an afternoon on 
the road in an art museum than hanging around the hotel talking baseball. He 
had an appetite for learning as great as his appetite for food. 
</P>
<P>
 If Show came off as arrogant, as he did to some teammates, he demonstrated 
compassion often enough, too, by helping the homeless with hot meals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not arrogance or petulance that led Show to sit down on the mound when 
he gave up Pete Rose's record 4,192nd hit in 1985. He certainly looked odd at 
the time, but all Show did was rest a few moments until the commotion died 
down. And he did congratulate Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Show of those years was far different from the troubled soul of recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously sick. I don't know if drugs made him sick, or because he was 
sick he used drugs," said Mark Augustin, his partner in a guitar shop, one of 
his most devoted friends to the end and a pallbearer at his funeral. "It was a 
gradual diminishment of enthusiasm over the past couple of years. He told me he 
was bored. He was stuck. He hated the fact that he was doing drugs. But he was 
never a vagabond, a street person, as some people said. He always had a roof 
over his head and he was very successful in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric had always done everything passionately. There was no halfway about him. 
That's why he accomplished so much in such a short time. But he was so complex 
that, as much as I knew him, as tight as we were, I still could never get at 
the bottom of what his real struggle was. We talked about it many times. We 
talked about what made him tick. He wanted to know. That was his struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs were just part of his struggle. There were deeper issues inside -- 
childhood issues, his relationship with his father. He wanted to be closer to 
him. I think there was a void there that Eric desperately wanted filled. His 
father really pushed him hard to play ball. If it wasn't for his father, he 
never would have been a major league ballplayer. But being a major league 
ballplayer is not everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Show loved the game, calling it "divine" in its balance and symmetry and 
praising it for being "purely American like a Norman Rockwell painting." He 
majored in physics at UC Riverside and once observed, "As long as air has 
weight, I'll have a slider." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he was always a little uncomfortable with the money and fame baseball 
brought. He wanted people to know he was more than just a guy who threw a ball. 
When kids were around, he signed autographs enthusiastically, chatting with 
them and taking an interest in their answers. He never considered himself a 
hero, and when he first saw his picture on a bubble gum card he got a little 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't look like Mickey Mantle and I was mad," Show once told Mike 
MacIntosh, the San Diego Police Department chaplain who eulogized him at last 
Saturday's memorial service in his hometown of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was serious," said MacIntosh, who had known Show since his minor league 
days in 1980. "In his mind's eye, he would look as big as Mickey Mantle, and he 
said, 'It was just me on the card. I wasn't Mickey Mantle. I wasn't some big 
hero. It was just me."' 
</P>
<P>
 Around Christmas, Show wept on the phone to MacIntosh, pleading for help. 
MacIntosh, busy at the time, assigned two pastors to Show full time to assist 
him during another attempt at rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was smart enough to know not to do drugs," MacIntosh said. "And he hated 
it. But it confirmed that he had a weakness, a flaw. He was struggling to 
please everybody and be perfect and he just couldn't be. He tried to be a good 
college student, a good son, a good friend, a good husband. He was always real 
intensive. But when he would see his flaws and weaknesses, he'd beat himself 
over the head, trying to say, 'Oh, I've got to do more.' Instead of just 
enjoying, he was always struggling. He couldn't turn his mind off." 
</P>
<P>
 Show, profoundly religious for years, was consumed by an overpowering 
spiritual battle with himself. Former Padre teammate Dave Dravecky credited 
Show with giving him the courage and faith to deal with the loss of his 
pitching arm to cancer, but Show couldn't deal with his own demons. 
</P>
<P>
 "For anybody who wants to know, read Romans 7:5-25," Augustin said. "That was 
his struggle. It talks about doing the things that you don't want to do, but 
you still do them. It's not you that's doing them, it's the law of sin. And the 
law of sin is opposed to spiritual law. Eric delighted in God's law. He really 
did. He would want you to print that." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that verse reads: 'O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from 
the body of this death?" 
</P>
<P>
 Show had a theory about everything. He stirred up a fuss in 1984 by joining 
the right-wing John Birch Society, espousing a belief in global conspiracies, 
and getting Dravecky and Mark Thurmond to join him at a society booth at the 
Del Mar Fair. But Show was no racist, no neo-Nazi as some who didn't know him 
thought. He was more of an intellectual conservative in a William Buckley way, 
soft-spoken but pointed in his arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Show's best friends on the Padres, and favorite opponents in heated 
debates, was Alan Wiggins, an admirer of Malcolm X. Wiggins died three years 
ago of AIDS contracted from intravenous drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 Show took heat in 1987 when he caused a near-riot in Chicago by hitting Andre 
Dawson in the face. Show's John Birch affiliation had made some people believe 
he was bigoted and the throw deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very isolated, very alone at times," Show said a few years ago. "It 
was like a family -- a dysfunctional family. There was a lot of turmoil. A lot 
of chaos. There were times when it seemed like everybody was hating everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Show could have left it all behind and walked into a new career in jazz. "He 
had the talent," saxophone player Joe Marillo said at Croce's, the bar owned by 
Jim Croce's widow where Show sometimes sat in on sessions. "He had the feeling, 
the timing, the knowledge of the chords, the scales, and the passion most of 
all. And when you have that, you don't rely on cliches. You wait for your ear 
to bring you melodies. If he did it full time, he could have been a great jazz 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 But Show never gave up the hope of returning to baseball, even when it was 
clear to others that he couldn't. He was working on a new pitch -- a "cup ball" 
that was thrown like a fastball but slowed like a changeup -- and stayed in 
good shape by working out often. His numbers still looked good, a San Diego 
record with 100 victories in 10 years before his release. If only he could 
start over fresh somewhere and without back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He had undergone back surgery to remove a disk in 1989 and lost his first six 
decisions in 1990. Fans booed him and some teammates turned against him. Jack 
Clark called him selfish and screamed at him in a team meeting. He began 
feuding with pitching coach Pat Dobson. The Padres tried to trade him, but got 
no takers. At the end of the season they bought out his contract. Two months 
later he signed a two-year, $1.6 million deal with the Athletics, the 
pennant-contending team he had long dreamed of playing for. But after one 
mediocre year in Oakland and his release when he showed up with cut hands in 
spring training, Show was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time he was getting more involved with the insidious and powerful 
crystal meth. Ten bucks for a big rush, a six-hour high and, inevitably, 
depression and paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Show had spent part of that off-season trying to get away from the drug by 
turning to Scott Ruiz, Oakland's team chaplain. Show briefly left his wife to 
move in with Ruiz and his wife for many draining days of prayer and talk. Cara 
Mia stayed home, hoping Show would return at peace with himself and with the 
zest he once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cara Mia never gave up on Eric," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really needs to be made clear," Augustin said. "Eric and Cara Mia had a 
very strong marriage. There was a tremendous amount of love between the two of 
them. People probably are pondering how come Eric wasn't at home with his wife. 
He knew that what he was dealing with was inappropriate. He left out of love 
for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Show's moods swung from exuberant to apathetic, but the more time went on the 
more his indifference dominated. The thrill was gone, as B.B. King sang, and 
jolts of crystal could bring it back only briefly. The drug called to him and 
he answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before Show checked back into rehab for the final time, he and 
friend Bob Bell were eating at a Burger King when Show abruptly wrote out a 
complicated math formula and said excitedly, "Hey, Bob, look at this. It 
works." Bell stared at the symbols and found them as incomprehensible as 
French, but it was a moment that recalled the time when Show had been a 
dazzling intellect to all those around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lived several lifetimes in one," said Bell, who works with Augustin in 
Mark's Guitar Exchange. "He was always just go, go, go. He had a profound 
intensity about everything. I wish I had half his brains, talent and energy. He 
was what every guy wanted to be. Who doesn't want to be the pitcher in the 
pennant race, a jazz guitarist who can stand up and play beautifully, a man who 
can talk intelligently about Plato and physics. I called him a Renaissance man. 
It embarrassed him when I said that, but it was true." 
</P>
<P>
 The next afternoon, Show was distant and disinterested again. He had lunch 
with Augustin, and at 11 p.m. that night checked himself back into the private 
Rancho L'Abri rehab retreat. He was still trying to kick the habit, still 
looking for a safe place. At 8:23 a.m. the following morning, he was found dead 
in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I look back on it, he was saying goodbye to people near the end, as 
if he knew it was close," Augustin said, thinking about a signed photograph 
Show gave him recently expressing love and friendship. "At the time you don't 
realize. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was larger than life," Augustin added, his voice choking and his eyes 
moist. "I felt honored to be with him."

SOCCER; U.S. SHARP, BUT SETTLES FOR 2-2 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 89 minutes of spirited action, it came down to a header when the U.S. 
national soccer team settled for a 2-2 tie against Bolivia in a World Cup 
warm-up Saturday before 26,835 at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shot that could have given the United States its second victory of the 
year, Claudio Reyna barely missed as the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down 
on the goal line before being cleared by Bolivia as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although disappointing, Reyna's try symbolized a strong U.S. effort that was 
highlighted by Hugo Perez' two goals.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was Reyna, a midfielder who played on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, who 
gave the Americans a lift in the second half when the teams traded scoring 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna's header in the last minute failed to change the result, but it provided 
the most excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna was in position to score because Cobi Jones broke free on the left 
touchline and crossed to the midfielder, who was breaking toward the goal from 
the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pass was a little behind me," Reyna said. "After I hit it, I didn't see 
where it went because I was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Although tying Bolivia for the third time in 10 months, the United States 
showed some progress Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it started that way. Playing against a team missing some of its best 
players, the United States gave up the first goal on a set play, the kind that 
frustrate coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 It came in the 12th minute when Bolivia's Julio Baldivieso scored on a free 
kick from about 25 yards out. It was a perfectly placed kick, and all goalie 
Tony Meola could do was make a diving attempt to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 And if not for a defensive blunder in the second half, the United States could 
have -- make that, should have -- won. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez scored his first goal on a penalty kick to tie the game in the 31st 
minute, then he scored in the 48th minute to give the Americans a 2-1 lead. 
After that, the teams traded attacks and lost opportunities. Bolivia had a good 
chance in the 58th minute when Meola, who had six saves, was lulled out of the 
goal by Ramiro Castillo. But his shot, taken at a difficult angle, was saved by 
defender Paul Caligiuri who rushed to the line to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, the defense faltered in the 76th minute when Luis Cristaldo 
chased down a pass in the left corner and found himself unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristaldo turned and crossed to the near post where Castillo was waiting in 
front of the goal. He simply one-touched the ball in with his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They caught us unaware," said Sigi Schmid, a U.S. assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of letting down, the United States kept attacking with Reyna and Jones 
trying to create opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important that we didn't lose," said Perez, who moved into sole 
possession of second place on the U.S. all-time scoring list with 16 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, fighting for a position on the World Cup roster, said his second goal 
was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed it was. The goal was set up when Jones took a long pass and kicked 
to Chris Henderson on the right side. Henderson beat a defender and drew 
goalkeeper Carlos Trucco to him. He centered the ball to Perez, who was 
unmarked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was candy," Perez said of the eight-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia also came away happy with Saturday's result. 
</P>
<P>
 Xabier Azkargorta, Bolivia's coach, said the team showed the kind of 
improvement that will make it better this summer, and with some of his stars 
playing in Europe, he was not too concerned about this game.

SILVER ISN'T ENOUGH FOR BONALY; FIGURE SKATING: SHE OBJECTS TO DECISION GIVING 
SATO THE GOLD MEDAL. KWAN FINISHES EIGHTH WITH STRONG FREESTYLE PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

 It came down to a choice between Yuka Sato's artistry and dynamic footwork and 
Surya Bonaly's gymnastic jumping, and the judges gave the women's world figure 
skating championship to Sato Saturday in Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonaly at first refused to join Japan's Sato and bronze medalist Tanja 
Szewczenko of Germany on the awards podium. Afterward, she quickly took off her 
silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later what message she meant to convey, the French skater said: "It's 
not right." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bonaly tried to succeed with technique, she said she had been told she 
wasn't artistic enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I change to just normal skating, that's not good, too. I don't know what 
I have to do. It's crazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was close. Sato received higher artistic marks -- six 5.9s and three 
5.8s -- and the first-place votes of five of the nine judges. She got technical 
marks of 5.7 and 5.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonaly got mostly 5.8s and 5.9s for her technique in an ambitious program that 
included a triple toe loop-half loop-triple salchow-double toe loop sequence 
and back-to-back triple jumps. She touched her hand to the ice, however, on one 
later triple loop, and had landed on the ice before completing the last turn of 
her triple-triple combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Her artistic marks ranged from 5.5 to 5.9, and four judges ranked her first. 
But one rated her third, behind Szewczenko. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived late at the medalists' news conference and said she was "fed up." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a championship, not (a place) to do just like everybody else. It's 
not right," Bonaly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato completed a clean sweep with her first-place in the freestyle program 
after earlier winning her qualifying group and the technical program. She 
finished fifth in the Olympics, one place behind Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Kwan of Torrance, at 13, the youngest competitor ever to represent 
the United States in the world championships, skated well.  
</P>
<P>
 She completed a demanding freestyle program, landing six of seven triple 
jumps, as she improved from 11th after the previous day's technical program to 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy that it ended this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan was encouraged by her ability to rebound from a poor technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to say to myself, 'What's done is done,' " she said of her mental 
preparation for the four-minute freestyle program. "You can't rewind or record 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what she learned from her first major international competition as a 
senior, she said: "Whether you're nervous or not nervous, you still have to go 
out there and try your best. You have to have energy out there.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to have been more aggressive this week. I'm even more 
motivated to go home and work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 There was pressure on Kwan because she needed a top 10 finish to assure that 
the United States would be allowed to send two women to the 1995 World 
Championships at Birmingham, England. If she had finished 11th or lower, the 
United States would have had only one woman representative.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States had only three top 10 finishes in Chiba and failed to win 
any medals for the second consecutive year. Not since 1963-64 had the United 
States failed to win medals in consecutive World Championships. RANDY HARVEY

MORNING BRIEFING: KNIGHT A BULLY? INDIANA COACH THINKS HIS IMAGE IS QUITE FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight was asked recently at a news conference if 
being perceived as a bully clouds his accomplishments, which include three 
national championships with the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cloud my accomplishments to who? My wife? She doesn't worry about it. My 
players don't worry about it," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is my image? My image is pretty damn good with most people that are 
around what we do. I just raised a million dollars for the Indiana library. 
Have any of you raised a hundred for anything lately?" 
</P>
<P>
 Add Knight: On being perceived as menacing: "I wouldn't know why. I never 
carry a gun with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Dodger pitching record for most victories in a 
season since the team moved to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958? 
</P>
<P>
 Only way to lose: Greg Boeck of USA Today writes that the Dallas Mavericks' 
season resembles a broken-down bus, adding, "But, at least, the team travels 
first class: 
</P>
<P>
 "Owner Donald Carter bought a DC-9 for the Mavs. Among amenities: four TV 
monitors with built-in videotape players, two telephones, an eight-seat lounge 
and 50 inches -- compared with 37-40 in first class on commercial flights -- 
between seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Plausible: Utah Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek, recently acquired from the 76ers, 
and his wife are expecting a child in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the mid-playoff due date was bad timing, he explained, "Hey, I 
was with Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumblings: The Philadelphia Daily News headline when Mitch (Wild Thing) 
Williams reported to the Houston Astros: "Gentlemen, Start Your Ulcers." 
</P>
<P>
 A setup?Raider owner Al Davis on the feud in Dallas between Coach Jimmy 
Johnson and owner Jerry Jones: "I'm surprised I'm not being blamed for it. 
Actually, don't put it beyond comprehension that the whole thing is a setup. 
Maybe both of those guys weren't getting enough ink." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Davis: On where the Raiders will play next season: "We could go anywhere. 
The Raiders are global." 
</P>
<P>
 Minor detail: Minor league manager Charlie Manuel on the defensive 
capabilities of first baseman Sam Horn:  
</P>
<P>
 "He has trouble with the thrown ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: In the 1960 NCAA championship basketball game, Ohio State led 
California at halftime, 37-19, after having made 16 of 19 shots.  
</P>
<P>
 "Men, we have to get more defensive rebounds," Cal Coach Pete Newell told his 
troops.  
</P>
<P>
 Replied Cal center Darrall Imhoff: "Coach, there have been only three, and I 
got all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch: From "Baseball's Even Greater Insults:" After a young Dodger recruit up 
from a farm club asked where the whirlpool was, Manager Tommy Lasorda replied, 
"Just stick your foot in the toilet and flush it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Sandy Koufax, with 27 in 1966.

GOLF ROUNDUP; NORMAN, AT 19 UNDER, HAS THEM ASKING FOR STROKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Norman has the best players in the world talking about asking for 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing flawless golf -- no bogeys in 54 holes -- Norman finished three rounds 
of the $2.5-million Players Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla., 19 under par and 
four strokes ahead of his nearest competitor, Fuzzy Zoeller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a 10-shot handicap and I'll have a shot at him," Zoeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who was among 72 players stranded on the course by darkness Friday, 
finished up a 67 in the morning, then shot another one in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Open champion completed three rounds at 197, a record on the home 
course for the PGA Tour, the TPC at Sawgrass. He needs only a final round of 
par 72 to break the 72-hole record of 18 under set last year by Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Zoeller, who had a third-round 68 and a 201 total, remained within reach. 
</P>
<P>

 Isao Aoki shot his second consecutive five-under 68 for a one-stroke lead over 
Tom Wargo after the second round of the Senior PGA Doug Sanders Celebrity 
Classic at Kingwood, Tex.

ANDREWS RIDES STRING OF BIRDIES INTO LEAD; GOLF: SHE PUTS TOGETHER FIVE IN A 
ROW FOR A 67 AND A ONE-SHOT EDGE OVER DAVIES AT DINAH SHORE TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Andrews is playing in only her second Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament, 
but already the Mission Hills Country Club is becoming a favorite course. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews put together a string of five birdies beginning with the sixth hole 
Saturday and shot a five-under-par 67 to move into the lead in the third round 
of the $700,000 LPGA major event. She is at 10-under-par 206.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a double-bogey on the 16th, Laura Davies, co-leader after 36 holes, 
was in second place, one shot back, after a 69 for 207. The other second-round 
co-leader, Michelle McGann, bogeyed the 18th to drop into third place at 208. 
</P>
<P>
 In fourth place was Jan Stephenson. Not at all intimidated by playing with 
long hitters Davies and McGann, Stephenson shot a 70 for 209. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was fresh snow on the mountains around the desert, the weather 
was warm and perfect for golf. The breeze was light and scores were generally 
lower. But not for Nancy Lopez, who faded on the back nine and shot a one-over 
73. In the first two rounds, Lopez, still a gallery favorite, was six under on 
the back nine. But her two-over 38 in the third round left her at 213, seven 
shots behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' spurt put her in front, but the biggest crowd followed the threesome 
of McGann, Davies and Stephenson. The fans seemed in awe of the prodigious 
feats of Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 An example was the 526-yard par-five 18th. Nobody else on the tour reaches it 
in two shots. Davies, after a powerful drive of close to 300 yards, used a 
two-iron to put her second shot into the middle of the green. The resulting 
two-putt birdie put the big Briton in position for her second consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies enjoys playing the 18th, the longest hole on the course, but would 
rather bypass the relatively short, 375-yard 15th. In the last two rounds, the 
hole has cost her three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate that hole," she said after a double-bogey six on 15 knocked her out of 
the third-round lead. "I hate the fairway, I hate the green. I don't know how 
to play it. Today I tried a three-iron off the tee and hit it in the rough 
behind the trees. Tomorrow, I'll try a four again." 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting her second shot on the 15th into a sand trap below the hole, she 
bladed the sand wedge and knocked the ball into the trap above the green. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw where that one was sitting (on a downhill lie at the back of the 
trap)," she said, "I knew it was a double bogey." 
</P>
<P>
 When she saved par by sinking a 20-foot putt after almost falling down on a 
sand shot on the 17th, it rekindled Davies' spirit and she rolled home with the 
two big shots on 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews doesn't have a problem with any hole -- only a particular shot. Twice, 
while trying to get into position for an easy birdie on two par-fives, the 
second and the 11th, she hit a duffer's shot -- what the pros call a 
"chili-dip." 
</P>
<P>
 On the 504-yard No. 2, which has been the easiest in the tournament, Andrews 
hit her second shot in front of the green, only 20 yards from the hole. After 
mis-hitting a wedge, she was still short of the green. This time she salvaged 
par. 
</P>
<P>
 The next chili-dip ended her string of birdies as she bogeyed after being just 
in front in two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Andrews' hot putting streak began on the fifth hole when she made a 
six-foot putt to save par. "That was when I started to feel like I was going to 
make every putt," she said. "I just knew they were going to go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' birdie putts were from six, 20, 15, 12 and three feet. She then 
missed a 20-footer for par on the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I missed the 20-footer, my husband, my caddy, said, 'It's just as well 
you missed one. The fans were getting bored.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, John Reeves, has caddied for her before. They were married last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandie Burton of Rialto had the best round of the tournament Saturday with a 
seven-under 65. She is within five shots of the lead at 211.

NHL ROUNDUP; PANTHERS MOVE CLOSER TO PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers are the winningest expansion team in NHL history, and 
they aren't through yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers beat the New York Islanders, 3-1, Saturday at Uniondale, N.Y., a 
record 32nd victory for an expansion franchise.They also strengthened their 
hold on the eighth and final Eastern Division playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers are four points ahead of Philadelphia and six ahead of the 
Islanders for the last playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real big win for us," Panther Coach Roger Neilson said. "If we stay 
above .500, I think we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6, Quebec 3 -- The Nordiques' slim playoff chances were reduced with 
the loss at Toronto. With 10 games left, the Nordiques are 10 points behind 
eighth-place Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's Mike Gartner scored twice, giving him 30 goals. It's the 15th 
consecutive year he has at least 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, Montreal 3 -- Adam Oates had two goals and two assists at Boston as 
the Bruins moved to within one point of the Canadiens in the battle for home 
ice in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 7, Philadelphia 2 -- Bill Gurein, Tommy Albelin and Bob Carpenter 
scored second-period goals as the Devils set a club record with their 25th home 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Gary Roberts' second goal of the game, at 15:27 of 
the third period at Calgary, broke a tie and helped the Flames extend their 
unbeaten streak to 2-0-1.

HEBERT IS FEELING DUCKY AGAIN; HOCKEY: GOALIE RETURNS AFTER THREE-GAME BENCHING 
AND MAKES 32 SAVES IN MIGHTY DUCKS' 3-2 VICTORY OVER HARTFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Guy Hebert found out, it isn't always lonely at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert had company inside a month after becoming the Mighty Ducks' No. 1 
goalie after Ron Tugnutt was traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 He faltered just enough to let Mikhail Shtalenkov get a skate in the net, and 
suddenly Hebert's only save in three games came when an errant dump-in pass 
landed in his lap on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hebert recovered some Saturday night, making 32 saves as the Ducks beat 
the Hartford Whalers, 3-2, in front of a sellout crowd of 15,635 at the 
Hartford Civic Center. It was Hebert's first victory since March 4 -- ending a 
four-game personal losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in my mind, I thought the whole scenario would be that I became the 
No. 1, and pretty much only a disaster would unseat me as No. 1," Hebert said. 
"I don't think that ever happened, but since we've been so close to the playoff 
drive, losing a couple of games was big enough to make the change just to see 
what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have nevertheless been relegated to longshot status in the chase to 
catch San Jose for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. They 
trail the Sharks by eights points with nine games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a long meeting yesterday and talked about some of the little things 
we've gotten away from doing," said Coach Ron Wilson, whose team hit a low 
point by giving up five goals in a period in a loss to Boston on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the air going out of the playoff balloon -- or tire -- we just wanted to 
make sure we regroup and keep it interesting for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Van Allen, who was scratched the game before, helped the Ducks beat 
Hartford with his first two-goal game of the season. He had gone 14 games 
without a goal until he blocked a shot with his skate in the first period, 
picked up the puck and took off on a shorthanded two-on-one break. He kept the 
puck himself and beat Jeff Reese for a 1-0 lead at 19:15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks took a 3-1 lead in the second after Van Allen's second goal and 
another by Todd Ewen.  
</P>
<P>
 The key was that Hartford had not come from two goals behind to win in 43 
tries this season. Even though Ted Drury cut the lead to one late in the 
second, Hebert made 13 saves in the final period, including a tense few with an 
extra attacker at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been feeling good the whole time," Hebert said. "I just think it was 
like early in the season where tough breaks and bad bounces led to some 
losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Hebert "pouted a little" at first about his three-game benching in 
favor of Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's pouting," Hebert said. "That's pretty unprofessional. If 
you don't appear to be disappointed, I think there's something the matter. I 
think any coaching staff should be happy a player's not ecstatic he's not in 
the net or playing in the game."

DIVISION II; BAKERSFIELD USES DEFENSE TO REPEAT AS CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second time around was just as sweet for Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners beat Southern Indiana, 92-86, Saturday to become the first 
team to repeat as NCAA Division II champion in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (27-6) used a tight man-to-man defense to stifle the running game 
of Southern Indiana, which was averaging 102 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense wins games," Bakersfield Coach Pat Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive year Bakersfield shut down a high-powered 
offense in the championship game. Last year, the Roadrunners beat a Troy State 
team that once scored an NCAA-record 258 points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively, they are the best team we've played," Southern Indiana Coach 
Bruce Pearl said. "I am very proud of our kids. But I'm frustrated. Bakersfield 
State didn't let us show what we could do here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners went on an 11-2 run to take a 28-17 lead midway through the 
first half. Tyrone Davis scored on a layup, Kenny Warren made a three-point 
shot and Davis scored twice more during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornelius Banks' three-point basket keyed another 9-1 run with 4:30 left in 
the half. The Roadrunners held the Screaming Eagles to three baskets in the 
final nine minutes of the half to lead, 45-30, at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Indiana (29-4) chipped away at the lead in the second half, with Stan 
Gouard keying a 9-1 run that cut the lead to 77-71. Gouard led the Screaming 
Eagles with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reggie Phillips' driving basket and layups by Jeff Kuehl and Warren gave 
Bakersfield an 85-73 cushion with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips and Davis finished with 15 each for Bakersfield, while Roheen Oats 
added 13 and Kuehl 11. Banks had 11 points, including three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The last team to repeat as Division II champion was Kentucky Wesleyan in 1968 
and 1969.

NBA ROUNDUP; ONCE AGAIN, OLAJUWON PROVES HE'S A FAST FINISHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hakeem Olajuwon finished with a flourish for the second consecutive game, 
scoring 20 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter as he led the Houston Rockets 
to a 98-83 victory over the Utah Jazz at Houston on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say about Hakeem but MVP every night," Houston Coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich said. "He just never lets up." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, who had 15 fourth-quarter points in Thursday night's 113-107 victory 
over the Lakers, enabled the Rockets to end a three-game losing streak against 
the Jazz. Houston won for the seventh time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing better than anyone I can think of right now," Jazz Coach Jerry 
Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fourth quarter, my concentration level goes up," Olajuwon said. "The 
first three quarters I'm getting a feel for the game. Tonight, I was making 
myself available and my teammates were reading very well and making good 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz guard John Stockton got two steals and became the second player in NBA 
history to reach 2,000. He trails Maurice Cheeks, who had 2,310. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 100, Miami 90 -- Stacey Augmon scored seven of his 25 points in the 
final 3:31 at Atlanta as the Hawks won for the fifth time in six games to move 
one-half game behind the idle New York Knicks for the best record in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 112, Golden State 101 -- David Robinson scored 29 points and Terry 
Cummings added 22 to lead the Spurs at Oakland. Chris Webber led the Warriors 
with 23 points and Latrell Sprewell had 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 113, Minnesota 93 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 23 points to lead five 
players in double figures at Seattle as the SuperSonics beat the Timberwolves 
for the 13th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 112, Dallas 101 -- Dikembe Motombo scored a season-high 27 points to 
help the Nuggets win at Denver. The victory was the fourth in a row and sixth 
in seven games for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the 14th in a row for Dallas. The Mavericks, 8-60, also have had 
losing streaks of 20 and 16 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 103, Washington 100 -- Armon Gilliam's short hook shot with 16 
seconds left gave the Nets their first lead of the game at Washington as they 
handed the Bullets their eighth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 90, Indiana 88 -- Scott Williams blocked Derrick McKey's layup attempt 
at the buzzer as the Bulls withstood the Pacers' second-half comeback at 
Chicago.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; WILL COACH MAGIC HAVE SWEET 16? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I nterim?  
</P>
<P>
 You have to hand it to the Lakers, they still know how to throw a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else makes an announcement. With the purple and gold, you get 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 This one didn't quite match the '81 classic, at which Jerry Buss fired Paul 
Westhead, who had won five games in a row, and tried to hire Jerry West, who 
lateraled the job to Pat Riley right in front of everybody, after which Riley 
won them four titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't exactly routine, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim? Magic Johnson's news conference drew the biggest crowd the Lakers had 
seen since . . . uh . . . his last news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerials on the minicam trucks looked like a forest in the parking lot. 
Tickets for Johnson's debut were flying out; more than 1,000 were sold by the 
end of the news conference on walk-ups at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The franchise was like a light bulb that had been off for two years and was 
suddenly switched back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the surprise . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Interim? Yes, Buss asked, and Johnson agreed that he would coach the Lakers 
only for the last 16 games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side had its reasons for putting off a real commitment, though neither 
was talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers want to see if Johnson is serious, as opposed to taking a walk on 
them as he did when he called off his 1992 comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson wants a piece of an NBA franchise. Buss has politely but steadfastly 
refused suggestions he sell him part of this one. The last time it came up, 
Buss' spokesman, Bob Steiner, noted wryly that the owner had always said he 
would leave the team to his children and, while he considered Johnson a 
surrogate son, that didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 Things simply changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbit pulled a magician out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Having brought Johnson back to relight the lights, Buss has little choice but 
to keep him or face a new night, darker than the franchise has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, this was Buss' sole initiative and he did it for better 
reasons than a 33% drop in attendance in two years. Today's boomlet will end 
soon enough and the reasons will still be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is a terrific coaching prospect. It's a people job, he's a people 
genius, someone who can air a player out -- yoo hoo, Vlade Divac -- without the 
player minding. 
</P>
<P>
 Players will hustle for him as they never did for Randy Pfund, who had neither 
Johnson's presence nor Johnson's name. Pfund was on a tightrope, besides, and 
his rascals knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers might attract better free agents with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't fall on his face. How bad can anyone look taking over a 28-38 team? 
</P>
<P>
 He will love it. He loves the game and lives for challenges. This is challenge 
enough for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He is ideal for Buss, who has complete confidence in him. Although it hasn't 
sunk in yet, rebuilding requires patience. Johnson will be allowed to struggle, 
a license Pfund wasn't granted. Buss has been a model owner who pays generously 
and trusts his professionals. However, the franchise's fall, predictable as the 
sunset when Johnson retired, has left him in a state of denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would he want to fire his rookie coach last spring after trading the 
team's most dependable player -- Sam Perkins -- for a prospect plus Benoit 
Benjamin? 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers faced hard times then and still do, with Johnson, John Wooden, Rick 
Pitino or whomever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NBA, players make programs and superstars make dynasties. If Riley had 
inherited Divac and Nick Van Exel rather than Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
he might still be on the radio next to Chick Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a difference between players and prospects. The Lakers have more of 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac has become a top-10 center. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel is a find. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lynch is undersized, but talented. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler remains a prospect, but with a question mark: What happened 
this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie is their best prospect, but his flame was allowed to flicker 
after the All-Star break as Pfund, fighting for his job, played veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are planning a shopping expedition, but face furious competition 
for Danny Manning and Horace Grant. The other free agents are older players, 
such as Buck Williams and Michael Cage, helpful for a contender, but no one for 
a young team to build around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have high hopes for their first lottery pick -- the second-to-last 
lottery pick at the pace they are on. They are 125-1 for Glenn Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 This draft falls off a cliff after the first four -- Robinson, Jason Kidd, 
Grant Hill, Donyell Marshall. At No. 10, the Lakers are back in 
undersized-forward country. 
</P>
<P>
 It would shake a normal man, but Johnson's optimism is the stuff of legends. 
</P>
<P>
 It really is a job for a Magic man. Luckily, there was one available. RANDY 
PFUND: MAY 18, 1992-MARCH 23, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Two words describe his tenure as Laker coach: 
</P>
<P>
 Human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund wasn't a natural. He had things to learn, but he was tireless and 
devoted to a fault. He chose the Laker job and all the pressure that went with 
it over an offer from the Sacramento Kings, whose goals are more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't even a choice for him. He was a Laker, period. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss never understood Pfund's problems, nor was he interested in understanding 
them. Buss simply wanted things the way they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund did get one of those Buss scholarships, an extra year tacked on to his 
contract when they already knew he was gone, which means the Lakers still owe 
him another $900,000 or so. He earned it with his devotion and, when it was no 
longer required, his grace. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pfund got the bad news, he thanked Buss and West for the opportunity. At 
$900,000, he was a bargain. HUMAN HIGHLIGHT FILM: COMING? 
</P>
<P>
 While he lasts, Dominique Wilkins is the best thing that ever happened to the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, after years of having players throw their money in their face, here 
is a bona fide superstar who acts as if he wants to be here and says he will 
talk others -- such as Ron Harper -- into staying, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, business is also business. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it can't be too surprising that Wilkins' agent said last week that they 
will test the free-agent market. But when ESPN reported that he was interested 
in the Lakers, they couldn't have been whooping it up at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Leverage is anywhere you can find it, but the facts suggest that Wilkins will 
finish his career as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers can pay him that $6-7 million a year he's asking for. Anyone else 
would have to clear that much room under the salary cap, a prodigious task. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers can give him a multiyear contract. No one else can sign him for 
more than a year; he is about to turn 35. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilkins wants to be a Laker badly enough to accept $1.75 million -- the 
most they could pay him -- on the assumption he will have enough left in a year 
to merit a $6-million contract, he's one high-rolling dude. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome home: Former Hornet Kendall Gill, playing his first game in Charlotte 
since forcing his trade to Seattle, was booed every time he touched the ball, 
elbowed by former teammate Larry Johnson and got into an argument with his 
former coach, Alan Bristow. Gill then proceeded to score 22 points, 10 in the 
last five minutes, as the SuperSonics beat the Hornets. . . . The Johnson-Gill 
feud started when Gill threw a party without specifically inviting Johnson. 
Johnson then threw a party, making sure not to invite Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's game, Johnson waited by the court for Gill, who was doing a 
postgame radio show. Hornet assistant T.R. Dunn dragged Johnson back to the 
dressing room before he could start real trouble. "LJ wanted a piece of him," 
teammate Hersey Hawkins said. "Luckily, they didn't meet in the tunnel. It 
saved them both a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Quinn Chronicles, continued: In their recent game at the Sports 
Arena, Dallas players had to break up two fights between Coach Quinn Buckner 
and Jim Jackson, the one prominent Maverick Buckner hadn't previously angered. 
Last week Buckner fined forward Terry Davis $500 for second-guessing his 
substitutions in the newspaper. Buckner sent him a letter informing him of it, 
whereupon Davis told Buckner -- in the newspaper -- to "be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 How to rebuild -- not: You're supposed to trade your veterans for young 
prospects, lose games and fall into the lottery, but the Detroit Piston stars, 
Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, are staying where they are, Thomas to run the 
team, Dumars because he doesn't want to be traded. "I'm the one who has to 
adjust to a trade," Dumars said, "and I don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Piston Olden Polynice helped break up the fight early in the season 
between guard Alvin Robertson and Billy McKinney, Piston director of personnel. 
Polynice recently was upset that McKinney had traded him to Sacramento, made 
him fly back when the deal was canceled, then traded him back to Sacramento. 
Said Polynice: "Maybe we should have let Alvin strangle him."

ANOTHER SWEEP VICTORY FOR CSUN; MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: DRIVING FOR PLAYOFF POSITION, 
MATADORS DEFEAT SAN DIEGO STATE FOR THEIR FIFTH WIN IN SIX MATCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge seems to be peaking at just the right time. Getting 
timely hitting from Oliver Heitmann, Craig Hewitt and Jason Hughes, the 
Matadors swept the San Diego State Aztecs, 15-13, 15-11, 15-11, Saturday night 
in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation interdivision match at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the Matadors' third in a row and fifth in six matches, kept 
Northridge (13-8, 9-6 in conference play) two games behind second-place Brigham 
Young in the MPSF Mountain Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams in each division, plus the two remaining teams with the 
best records, regardless of division, advance to the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which has swept its last two opponents, has four matches remaining 
-- two at home, and two on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely on a roll," Northridge Coach John Price said. "We kind of 
gave a match away last week against Hawaii or we'd be 6-0 (in our last six 
matches). No matter what kind of roll you get on now, it's not enough come 
playoff time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who defeated San Diego State in four tough games at the Asics 
tournament earlier this year, were expecting a strong effort from the Aztecs 
(14-9, 8-7), who entered the match in third place in the MPSF Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Aztecs, who held brief leads in all three games, never led after a 
game reached eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-and-oh, that's deceiving sometimes. It can be a lot tougher than some 
five-game matches," Price said. "I wasn't comfortable in any of the three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seemed to get a lead every time, and they came back every time. I don't 
think we ever dominated." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State led, 7-5, in the first game, but Northridge scored six of the 
next seven points to take an 11-8 lead. The Aztecs tied the score, 11-11, but 
the Matadors pulled away and won when freshman Nick Pabarcus hit wide 
cross-court at game point. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge fell behind, 4-1, in the second game, but rallied behind Heitmann 
to win 10 of the next 11 points and take an 11-5 lead. The Aztecs got as close 
as 13-11 before the Matadors won on a dink by Hewitt to an empty midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge pulled away from an 8-8 tie in the final game and won on a smash by 
Heitmann down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, who had 10 kills in the first game and 12 in the second, finished 
with a match-high 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt, who finished with a .586 hitting percentage, had 20 kills and seven 
digs, and Hughes added 17 kills and seven digs.

SPLIT KEEPS NORTHRIDGE IN 1ST PLACE; COLLEGE BASEBALL: SMALER'S HOMER PROVIDES 
3-2 WIN OVER FRESNO STATE IN FIRST GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge already had the home-field advantage against Fresno State 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Bill Kernen would have liked to add a rule change as well for 
the Western Athletic Conference doubleheader at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we played, we might as well skip the first eight innings and just 
play the ninth," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-run home run by Josh Smaler in the bottom of the ninth inning gave 
Northridge a 3-2 victory in the first game. In the second game, the Matadors 
pushed across five runs in their last at-bat before losing, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think we like to have our backs to the wall, but that's the 
way we played, " first baseman Jason Shanahan said. "We were fortunate to hang 
in there as long as we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more importantly, the Matadors (16-14, 5-3) managed to hang onto a 
half-game lead in the WAC Western Division over the second-place Bulldogs 
(15-14, 3-2). The teams conclude the three-game series at Matador Field at 1 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 An errant throw by Smaler allowed Fresno to take a 2-0 lead in the third 
inning of the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior catcher dropped a third strike and then overthrew Shanahan at first 
base, allowing Javier Renteria to reach base and James Borges to score from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to do something to make up for the two runs that I cost us and 
it just happened to be that it was a two-run home run," Smaler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's Kevin Howard drove in Eric Gillespie from third in the bottom of 
the third to cut the Fresno lead to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Contreras (4-4), who pitched his eighth complete game, held the Bulldogs 
at bay to set up Smaler's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Nelson opened the ninth with a single to bring up Smaler, who knocked a 
2-2 hanging slider from reliever Scott Warembourg (1-1) over the left-field 
wall for his third home run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Fresno starter Jared Fernandez (5-3) surrendered a 
fourth-inning home run to Shanahan but not much else. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander limited the Matadors to three hits in eight innings, 
but surrendered four in the ninth -- including a three-run home run by Joey 
Arnold -- before being replaced by Chad Cattaneo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattaneo retired two of three batters he faced to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge starter Johnny Najar (5-3) allowed seven runs, six earned, in 7 1/3 
innings.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / DANA HADDAD: EXODUS BAFFLES ECKLUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has coached four Southern Section championship baseball teams. He has 350 
career victories in 22 seasons at Fillmore High. He was elected to the Ventura 
County Sports Hall of Fame last week. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does Coach Tom Ecklund -- Mr. Baseball in Fillmore -- react when four 
starters quit his team? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting, frustrating," said Ecklund, 50, who said he has never had 
this many players quit at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would quit on a coach who has produced 14 league titles and the 
second-highest win total in Ventura County history? 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me," Ecklund said. "I really don't know. A lot of them didn't like 
the roles they were given. We're starting three sophomores now." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly defined roles and teamwork have been staples of Fillmore's success 
under Ecklund, but now that the Flashes have lost their starting second 
baseman, third baseman, shortstop and designated hitter, two of whom pitched, 
the team has struggled to a 1-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the players, shortstop/pitcher Felipe Ordaz, said he quit because of a 
back injury he sustained in football. He said Isaac Jimenez, Josh Underwood and 
Jose Becerra were the others who quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, a senior second baseman who was among Fillmore's best hitters, said 
he was unhappy about a position change. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood, a senior, was out of town during Fillmore's spring break last week. 
and Becerra, a sophomore, couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they got tired or bored or thought baseball was boring this year," 
said Ordaz, a 5-foot-7 junior. "I like (Ecklund). I think he's a good coach. 
He's a good disciplinarian, and that's what we need. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I guess the other guys don't like him." 
</P>

 On Saturday, Park topped off the week by getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bringing my team on my honeymoon," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he and wife Kate head for Las Vegas, where the Lancers will compete in 
the Easter Classic. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Closing in: Saugus baseball Coach Doug Worley is approaching his 300th career 
victory, and if he continues to get the kind of pitching he did in No. 297 
Friday, the wait should not be long. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior right-hander Brandon Hernandez threw a one-hitter, walking none, in a 
3-0 victory over Burroughs that lifted the Centurions to 6-3. Worley, in his 
18th season, is the only baseball coach Saugus has had. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prowling the bases: Who needs three-run homers when you can scoot around the 
bases like Oak Park? The Eagles swiped 10 bases in 11 attempts Tuesday and beat 
Crossroads, 11-5. In six games, Oak Park (4-1-1) is 35 for 38 in stolen-base 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game is speed," Coach Mike Bolyog said. "We just felt we could take 
advantage of the speed situations. We take a lot of extra bases. But that's the 
most (stolen bases) I've seen in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Tops among the thieves is Tyler Blondi (13 for 15). But the Eagles have also 
gotten strong pitching from Todd Schultz (21 strikeouts in 15 innings, 1.20 
earned-run average) and Camron Marcarelli (2-1 record, 1.79 ERA). Brian 
McMullen has made a smooth transition from guard on the basketball team to 
catcher. He has nine hits in 13 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach and pronouncer: Burbank High tennis Coach Clyde Richards led the 
Bulldogs to a Southern Section championship last season and has them off to a 
6-1 start this season against tough competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally impressive is how this math teacher rattles off the names of some 
of his players -- Vazghen Zaghiyan, Stratos Christianakis, Varand Ghazikhanian, 
Rafi Hovanessian and Yamil Sarmiento. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the hardest part of coaching these guys," Richards said. "They're good 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's only defeat this season was against Hawaii Punahou, which has won 26 
state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fong stays put: Richard Fong couldn't parlay his status as the Times' Valley 
Football Coach of the Year during the off-season, so now he is staying at St. 
Genevieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong was a runner-up for jobs at Burbank, Burroughs and Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 He had applied at La Canada and Agoura but decided not to interview for those 
positions.

PREP SWIMMING / CIF GIRLS' RELAYS; IRVINE LEAVES THE REST OF FIELD IN ITS WAKE 
EN ROUTE TO CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Going into the finals of the Southern Section Relays on Saturday night at 
Belmont Plaza, Irvine's girls' swimming team was favored to win its first such 
relay title. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine didn't leave anything to chance. During a pre-meet lunch, the 
Vaqueros psyched up by braiding their hair and applying Roadrunner tattoos on 
their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Roadrunner is more of a landlubber, "he's fast," explained one 
Irvine swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 So were the Vaqueros, who won the section relays by a landslide. Irvine scored 
216 points to runner-up Fountain Valley's 175. Mission Viejo was third (166) 
and defending champion El Toro took fourth (160). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the top teams participating were missing at least one swimmer to the 
junior national meet in North Dakota. Irvine, with Wendy O'Brien gone, was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't sure how much that would hurt us," senior Monica Huszcz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much. According to Coach Scott Hinman, every Irvine swimmer swam an 
average of two seconds faster than they had at last weekend's South Coast 
Relays, which they lost to El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "After last weekend, I changed some people around," Hinman said. "I thought 
we'd have a shot, but I didn't think we'd win by this much." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro Coach Sheri Ross, who was missing Katie Lowes and Christie Kennedy, 
did: "I thought last week that they would win." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine didn't win a single relay, but pulled out the team title through depth. 
It was the lone school to qualify in the championship heats of all seven 
events, where the Vaqueros were second in the 6 X 50-yard freestyle and the 4 X 
100 freestyle relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Huszcz's anchor time of 54.01 in the 400 free relay was her personal best and 
Lana Kraus posted a section qualifying time in the same event. And, in the last 
event of the meet, the 4 X 50 medley relay, Irvine got a glimpse of its 
promising future. It's fourth-place team was made up of four freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the final event, Mission Viejo, Capistrano Valley and El Toro were 
tied for fifth. In a close race with Mission Viejo, Irvine and Redlands, El 
Toro's backstroker took the lead and the next two swimmers held their positions 
for the Charger victory.

SCHULTZ BREAKS THROUGH TRAFFIC TO WIN AT SAUGUS 
</P>

<P>
 Street Stock racer John Schultz was in the right place midway through the oval 
main event Saturday night and it led to a victory in the season opener at 
Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Valencia resident was running third when he received a break 
13 laps into the feature race. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mike Price and Todd Conrad battled for the lead, Schultz slid past and 
pulled away to take the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conrad and Price got together and somehow I was able to get around," said 
Schultz, who finished fourth in the Street Stock points standings last year. 
"After that I was just trying to ride a good line." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz was shadowed much of the final 12 laps by Greg Benner of Whittier, who 
finished second. Conrad wound up third, followed by Sun Valley's Edward Dazzo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," Schultz said. "It couldn't have been better. The car really 
came together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Warden of Anaheim won the 15-lap Mini Stock Racing Assn. main. Tim 
Mitchell of La Crescenta finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith of El Monte won the 12-lap Pro Four Modified main event, moving 
past pole sitter Gregg Symonds of Agoura Hills seven laps into the race. 
Symonds held on for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Limberopoulos of Bellflower held on for a victory in the 20-lap Mini 
Stock feature race.

TENNIS / DAVIS CUP; U.S. ADVANCES WITH DOUBLES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States moved into the second round of the Davis Cup on Saturday 
with its third victory over India. But India was delighted with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McEnroe and Richey Reneberg won a hard-fought four-set victory over 
Leander Paes and Gaurav Natekar, 7-6 (7-0), 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relief," U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said. "I was expecting a tough 
match today." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States meets the Netherlands, which took a 3-0 lead over Belgium, 
in the World Group's next round on July 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Jim Courier and Todd Martin gave the U.S. team a 2-0 lead, beating 
Zeeshan Ali and Paes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran McEnroe-Reneberg partnership played solid, unspectacular tennis 
but outplayed the low-ranking Indians when it counted most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the boys came through under pressure in the tiebreaks. They showed 
a little more experience and took the play to the Indian team a little bit 
more," said Gullikson, in his first match as Davis Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe is ranked 18th in doubles, and Reneberg is ranked 30th. 
</P>
<P>
 Paes and Natekar, after watching their serves returned for cross-court 
winners, moved to an I-formation serve, with both offensive players on one side 
of the court, prompting errors from the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good strategy by them," McEnroe said. "It makes you hit the ball 
somewhere else and makes you think a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves had the better of the Indian team. After two service breaks each in the 
first set, the Indians failed to win a single point in the tiebreak. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second set, India dropped a 4-1 advantage and lost five games in a row. 
Then in the fourth set, each side held serve to set up the tiebreak, when 
Reneberg's volleys gave the Americans the match.

<P>
 To the mourners at her father's funeral, Lynn Barlow was a wonder. Although 
she had lost both her father and her breast to cancer in a span of three 
months, she was bearing up without any signs of strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctor had told her husband, Rich, that the quiet stoicism might crack. 
But as the months wore on, there was no sign of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beginning to be confident we weren't going to have a low low -- a 
bottom out," he said. "But when it hit, it was like a bomb went off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich came home one day, eight months after Lynn's mastectomy, to what looked 
like ground zero. Lynn had emptied her closet and strewn her clothes throughout 
the house. She was huddled on their bed, sobbing uncontrollably. It took a 
tranquilizer to calm her enough so that she could speak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'I'm not a whole person. How can you love me? Why do you love me?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, the Barlows, who live in Aliso Viejo, struggled 
to keep their marriage intact. Like other couples, they came to realize that 
breast cancer not only invades a woman's body and endangers her life. The 
disease also can destroy a woman's self-image and her confidence. And it can 
strain a relationship to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is the woman who has cancer, her partner also faces some of its 
effects. He is afraid she will die. He's unsure how to respond to her range of 
emotions as she copes with her illness. He feels compelled to be stalwart and 
rock-ribbed, even when he is terrified. And, finally, he has to confront how he 
feels about the woman's body, transformed by surgery and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hell for her, but him too," said Ron Pepin, 65, of Anaheim. His wife, 
Ginny, 65, had a mastectomy in 1988 and reconstructive surgery a year later. 
"So many things happen to a woman where the guy doesn't understand what the 
hell to do. It's confusion, frustration and fear. It's a lack of knowledge and 
understanding. All that together, you've got a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a problem that led to the formation of a men's support group at the 
Breast Care Center in Orange. Two men whose wives had been treated by the 
center saw how they benefited from the patient support group and asked if a 
similar program could be started for men, said Barbara Scott, the center's 
patient educator. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups began meeting in the fall of 1992. Once a week, for a month or so, 
women whose cancer has been diagnosed in the past six months come to the center 
with their partners. The couples talk together for about a half-hour, then 
split into men's and women's sessions for an hour or more. Then the couples 
meet again to summarize what's been covered that evening. When the formal 
sessions have concluded, couples can exchange addresses and phone numbers and 
continue to meet if they wish, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I see most is a fear of saying what you're feeling to that other 
person," Scott said. "The woman is so busy saying 'I'm fine, fine; I'm going to 
be fine,' that she doesn't get to say, 'I'm really scared.' And the man is so 
busy saying, 'You'll be fine,' that he doesn't have the opportunity to say he's 
scared, too. Here they can come to a safe place and say their deepest feelings 
in a supportive environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John West, the surgical director of the center, said he urges men to go to 
the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't do it, I lean on them a little bit," he said. "I'm now 
convinced it's part of the healing. The males do better; the relationship does 
better, and maybe there's a survival-rate improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although men are not known for pouring out their hearts to strangers, the 
group setting does work, said Craig Nattkemper, a psychologist who leads the 
men's sessions. Even if a man doesn't talk, he can at least listen and learn 
that other couples are going through the same difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Men such as Pete Wesselink, 48, of Lemon Heights, attend to tell the group 
what they and their wives went through. Susan Wesselink had a bilateral 
mastectomy, rigorous chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so valuable for the guys," Pete said. "It gives them the chance to see 
how other people have dealt with this thing. If a guy asks, 'What did you do 
when her hair fell out?' or "How was your love life and did it bother you that 
your wife didn't have a breast?' you give them the benefit of your experience. 
That's been comforting to people." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups nearly always talk about what it means for a couple when a woman 
loses her breast to cancer. Women and men who've participated in the groups and 
talked to couples individually agree: It's more often the women who think 
losing a breast makes them less desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a universal response, that when the woman asks about what the 
loss of a breast means, the man says, 'Hey, it doesn't matter,' " Ron Pepin 
said. "Most women don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesselink said he understands why that might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you watch TV or go to the movies, it's fairly obvious that it's the 
stereotype that's presented: Men are attracted to women because of their 
breasts," he said. "And it's not just breasts, but the bigger the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesselink said most men aren't as fixated as the media make them out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a factor, but you learn to deal with it. You come to the realization, 
when you face a life-threatening illness, that there are more important 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Lynn Barlow's surgery eight years ago, Rich Barlow, 51, has talked with 
some men who don't share that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like they're putting their wife on display . . . and to them, it 
would be like displaying a diamond: You wouldn't want to display one with a 
flaw," he said. "To me, it's very shallow. Those two pieces of flesh in the 
front of a lady have nothing to do with her brain or her heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when a man sincerely tells a woman that the breast doesn't matter, it 
can take a year or longer for a woman to believe it, Nattkemper said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was extremely difficult for Marie Lussenden, 58, of Anaheim. She had a 
breast removed in 1991 and resisted reconstructive surgery because she was "so 
petrified of dying" that she couldn't even think about it. In chemotherapy, she 
lost every strand of her body hair, including eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing your body with only one breast is bad enough," she said. "Losing you 
hair is another psychological blow." 
</P>
<P>
 To top things off, she gained 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Dale, saw her through all of it. Her voice still catches as she 
praises him as "the biggest gift in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say wonderful things: 'I didn't marry you for your breast; I don't 
care if you weigh 500 pounds; I love the Marie inside.' But to me, I was 
hideous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could do was put my arms around her and hold her," said Dale, 50. 
"Sometimes we said nothing. I guess I treated her the way I would have wanted 
to be treated." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple still is coping with the changes cancer has wrought. Marie said 
tamoxifen, the drug she takes to ward off the recurrence of breast cancer, has 
reduced her sex drive. And she still fights the feeling that if she hates her 
body, her husband must, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But things are getting better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every relationship survives the buffeting that breast cancer inflicts. 
Pepin knows of one recent situation where a woman's fiance left her after 
hearing that her cancer recurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In such situations, Wesselink said, "you want to take the guy in the other 
room and knock his block off. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't force someone to care for someone. In my opinion, something was 
wrong before." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Wesselink, 47, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that relationships that aren't strong have a difficult time 
surviving adversity," she said. "Ours was good to begin with, and one of the 
gifts of cancer was that it made it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 She calls her husband "Prince Pete" for his approach to her illness. He shared 
nearly every step of treatment with her -- from reading her books on healing 
and attending all her chemotherapy sessions to shaving her head so that she 
wouldn't have to watch hair fall out in clumps every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both stood there in the bathroom, crying, cutting hair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginny Pepin said she and Ron also found that her illness brought them closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 40 years of marriage, although you get along, you sort of take each other 
for granted," she said. "When this happens, it makes you realize how special 
life is and how much you appreciate one another." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barlows couldn't agree more. Lynn's illness tested their marriage, they 
said, but it also made them see the depth of their commitment. Lynn, who had 
her other breast removed in 1987 as a precaution and then underwent 
reconstructive surgery for both breasts, finally realized that Rich meant it 
when he said he loved her for the heart inside her chest, not what was in front 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't I lucky?" Lynn asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the lucky one," Rich replied. "You came around." Where to Get Help

CROSS COLORS; INTERRACIAL DATING IS NOT NEW, BUT HOW COUPLES GET TOGETHER HAS

WANDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Looking for love? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at the very least looking ? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if of late you've strolled, well-worn china marker in hand, through the 
jumble of newsprint personals, you just might have noticed an emerging theme: 
</P>
<P>
 "A Pelican Brief: Seeking Julia Roberts/Denzel Washington chemistry. 
Successful professional SBM, 28, ISO attractive SWF for adventure romance, 
friendship & positive relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the local female who quite specifically outlines the object of her desires: 
"Let's start a romantic revolution! Intell., tall, blnde, 43 sks So. Amer., 
Carib., or Ethiopian prof. 30-40." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these passion plays are downright outrageous, pointed and purposely 
testing all limits; others are romantic anachronisms -- carefully plotted, 
lush, production-designed daydreams waiting to spring to life. What all share, 
however, is the desire for companionship, with a twist -- crossing often 
historically indelible lines of race, ethnicity and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles -- celebrated Ellis Island West and noted trend and style 
capital -- many taste-making factors come into play. From proximity and 
bare-bones curiosity to simply the fallout of big city living, singles who feel 
isolated, marginalized or simply lonely confront days that are top-heavy with 
work, not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Add growing sociological and psychological concerns -- such as the common 
kaffeeklatsch complaint about the shortage "of good (fill in the blank with any 
hue) men." And communication breakdowns that keep men and women from embarking 
on, let alone completing, even the simplest dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although interracial coupling is certainly nothing new, how people are meeting 
is definitely changing. From personal ads and highly specialized dating 
services to cross-cultural mixers, 900-numbers, special-interest support groups 
and magazines, those interested in dating outside their race have a plethora of 
avenues to wander. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To call this a complex issue would be like saying Los Angeles has had a "spot 
of trouble" the last couple years. Words don't adequately capture the candor 
and volatile potential of even broaching the subject of interracial dating -- 
not to mention the public display. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that the "Thin White Duke" himself, David Bowie, and Somalia-born model 
Iman provide a highly photogenic paparazzi moment, that Connie Chung and Maury 
Povich can publicly trade a fond smile and kiss, or that it's easy to discern 
the hottest black super-model by keeping close tabs on who is on Robert 
DeNiro's arm. As open as many believe the "crossing" climate is, opposition 
still awaits those who go against this rigid yet often unspoken social norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the trend is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although data is often difficult to come by, and not always complete or easily 
interpreted, Dan Hollis, co-editor of New People magazine, says that the U.S. 
Census shows a "fourfold increase" just in black-white interracial marriages 
from 1970 to 1990 -- to more than 200,000 in the latter year. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps part of this increase, some say, can be attributed to media broadening 
the purview. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lawrence Tenzer, author of "A Completely New Look at Interracial 
Sexuality: Public Opinion and Select Commentaries," cites a 1991 Gallup Poll, 
which found that 64% of people 18-29 approve of marriages between blacks and 
whites, while only 27% of those older than 50 concur. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty astounding if you think about it," he says. "But young people 
today are growing with TV, seeing blacks as professionals as opposed to what 
their parents saw -- mammies, servants. In my opinion, media set the standards. 
And it is the sole factor affecting change right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Burrell agrees that media have had tremendous influence on altering mood 
and softening the stigma. In her two years as a personals ad representative at 
L.A Weekly, she's noticed a marked increase in singles open to searching for 
mates outside their racial or ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are becoming less selective about physical attributes when 
they are looking for someone to date," she says. "And if you look at the media, 
they show interracial couples in everything from Levi's ads to music videos, so 
it is not a novelty or taboo anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell also notes that it isn't so much about quenching the thirst of a 
fantasy as some people might think. Singles she serves, mainly between ages 
25-40, "are people who are looking for serious relationships and are not 
satisfied by the quality of people that they are meeting, so they are expanding 
their horizons. . . . That's why they say 'race unimportant' . . . because they 
realize that there are a lot of quality people that they may not meet if they 
are closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell, who is African American, met her fiance, Randall Schlesinger, who is 
white and Jewish, through an ad she placed in the paper's personals three years 
ago.

 She suggests, however, answering ads -- any ad -- with caution. And with those 
of the cross-cultural variety, she says, there are other signs to look out for, 
signals to explore: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can kind of tell by the way they're written. . . . They build them up as 
a fantasy thing, like 'Vanilla looking for chocolate fantasy' or 'Vanilla 
looking for chocolate topping' . . . rather than someone being open to dating a 
lot of people. So I say ask questions, ask a lot of questions."

 Just a few hours after sunrise, Kymberly Jean takes long, brisk strides down 
Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice. The president of Opposites Attract, an 
interracial introduction service she launched four years ago, Jean apologizes 
for her casual attire. That includes full makeup, pressed black jeans, boots, 
newsboy cap turned backward, and baggy flak-jacket festooned with swatches of 
African cloth, shells and buttons made to look like coins. 
</P>
<P>
 An alarm-red sports car screams out of an alley, interrupting her stroll. It 
misses Jean by inches, and the driver, flustered and arms flailing, mouths a 
dramatic apology. She turns to absolve him with a short nod. Pausing, she turns 
again, time enough to take in the rugged face and tousled sandy-brown hair. Two 
more steps and she stops again, turns and flashes a brilliant smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymberly Jean -- matchmaker for the '90s -- logs in little downtime. 
</P>
<P>
 From a mere $500 to a cool $5,000 ("depending on the difficulty of the 
match"), Jean hopes to quite possibly send you on your . . . er . . . married 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 This whole caldron of a career began, she explains, with a nocturnal image: "I 
was sleeping and I was awakened about 3 or 4 in the morning with this clear 
vision. Like somebody just whispered in my ear." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, her service works like others: "I ask you some questions. . 
. . 'Tell me a little bit about you? . . . What do you have to offer a person?' 
Then I give a homework assignment . . . 'cause 80% of the time people don't 
know what they are looking for. They say: 'Just somebody nice.' And I say . . . 
'Let's get a little specific here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jean digs for cogent details about the client's background: "How you got into 
dating interracially? Why is that a preference, or is that a fad? Will you date 
someone of your same race?" Quickly, she develops a profile. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who inadvertently communicate dubious intentions, who have their 
heart set on capturing a fantasy based on racial-ethnic stereotypes? 
</P>
<P>
 "I send them on their way," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean says she can ferret those out pretty quickly, as well as singles who are 
simply trying to slip out of a bad dating cycle as if it were a blouse, hoping 
a different shade may change their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they'll say, 'Well I've never done it, but I'm curious 'cause I 
hear white guys are really nice . . . they're really generous.' Well," says 
Jean, her smoky voice turning steely, "they're not all nice and they're not all 
generous and this is not a toy. Or a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, she has observed, are naive about what crossing racial borders 
entails. When differences within their relationships crop up or tension brews 
from outside, Jean says, the couples are often ill-prepared to handle the 
sometimes blusterous attention: 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's a bed of roses, but it's not. I mean when I started dating 
interracially, people would walk up to us all the time and throw bottles . . . 
shout things. It's not the piece of cake that people think it is. Now it's a 
little better, especially here in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for crossing vary almost as widely as the choices available to singles 
in a city that has become a veritable cultural smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jean hopes to explore some of those reasons in "The Meeting Room," her 
half-hour show on Century Cable. "Personalities, the differences, ethics, 
economics, education," she notes. "I cannot hide the fact that with some people 
it is sexual. Some people do it for business. Like some guys will marry a 
certain race of woman because it will make him look better in the law firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Making matches that reduce a person to an object or symbol creates a whole set 
of tangled issues to consider. "I have a problem with doing it for the wrong 
reason -- period," she says. "And if the reasons aren't good enough, I have 
every right to refuse people." Still, Jean admits, "It happens all the time." 
</P>

 Sam, who met his wife, Sharon, through Opposites Attract, wasn't 
experimenting. "It wasn't something new," he says. "I had my first interracial 
relationship with a black woman in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sam, 32 and of Italian descent, says he didn't date black women 
exclusively, the attraction eventually emerged as preference; the appeal, he 
notes, is a sense of inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always raised that color never really meant anything, that it was the 
person on the inside, not the color on the outside," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, 44, says she decided to look into the service after seeing Jean on 
"Oprah." What gave her pause, however, was the stigma that surrounds that brand 
of matchmaking in general. (And because of that, neither Sharon nor her husband 
will allow their last names to be used.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't realize the social supermarket when you are in school," she says. 
"You just think that life is like that. That new people will come along." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon says she chose Opposites Attract because "(Interracial dating) was what 
I was used to. . . . Where I grew up, we were the only black family in town. . 
. . I hadn't been exposed to many black men through my work, where I lived . . 
. and I thought this might be a way to meet people who are open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 Matchmaker Jean, who has dated interracially for more than 10 years, has come 
under fire -- from the raging talk-show three-ring to threatening calls and 
letters -- for providing an outlet for people who prefer to date out of their 
race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "People accuse me of committing genocide," she says. "When I started this, it 
was not my intention to hurt anybody, to create any problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In this supply-and-demand culture, and as an ambitious entrepreneur, she 
simply recognized a need, Jean explains: "Now it's 'in' to be interracial. . . 
. More women . . . are saying I need a mate. Regardless of color." 
</P>

 Michael James, national sales manager for a firm that provides voice-mail 
service for about 400 publications nationwide and in Canada, believes that the 
voice-personal phenomenon provides a safe harbor in this tenuous territory that 
a face-to-face meeting cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doing a little something to break down an image of a person (one) likes 
to date. . . . Maybe that's one of the reasons why there is more interracial 
dating going on with voice mail services. . . . By hearing someone, you don't 
picture this person as being Asian, Hispanic, black or white . . . you have to 
listen to what they are all about." 
</P>
<P>
 With dating services, says Dr. Jonathan Brower, a Westlake Village 
psychotherapist, "there are the same pros and cons . . . as there are when 
people meet in general. On the surface it saves a lot of time, it seems as if 
there is less hit or miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the problem is that people have, no pun intended, these great 
expectations that the dating services will lead them to their true love. And 
when they don't, they feel betrayed and angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're looking specifically for a cross-cultural connection or not, 
Brower suggests, the approach is not as mysterious as one might think. He 
believes in a more conventional route: "Do things they enjoy. And there they 
will come across someone who they have something in common with, get to know 
one another, spend time together -- and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But heady with the thrill of finding a soul mate, some couples often are 
astonished and emotionally ill-equipped when problems roll into view. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a very idealized notion of what love can and cannot do," Brower 
says. "They look at it as magic. That can't be sustained. There are people who 
are attracted to other racial groups and ethnicities because they need to be 
rebellious. . . . That is not a good foundation for a relationship. But it 
doesn't mean that a couple can't work through that." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Cook, an L.A. marriage and family therapist, warns that some people 
are trying to multiculturize without looking at historical factors: "There are 
a whole set of values that accompany this thing called race and color." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sometimes emotionally strenuous and often thankless work, the efforts 
that interracial couples make to dismantle the walls by the simple act of 
living their lives, Cook says, are invaluable for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an exciting piece to it," she says. "These folks are on the cutting 
edge . . . they are the first drop of water in a stream. Whether we like it or 
not, people are mixing and they are paving the way for other people to." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Magazines such as Atlanta-based Interrace and New People, in Detroit, want to 
increase that dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Mills, 29, launched Interrace in 1989, with very little support. "Not 
even my husband's," she says with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
 What prompted her to put her money and energies into such a herculean project 
was her frustrating search for resources, advice and direction. As a young wife 
in an interracial union and the mother of a biracial child, Mills says there 
was really nowhere to look for answers to her specialized needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when the mainstream did, it was something that exploited rather than 
edified. Spiced up in order to sell papers or get ratings," she says. "There 
was no balance. I don't have a problem with examining or reporting on 
dysfunctional interracial families or children. They do exist out there, but 
there was nothing about those that were functioning quite normally." 
</P>
<P>
 Now published eight times yearly and with a circulation of 25,000, Mills and 
her husband, Gabriel Grosz, 43, want to promote cultural understanding, not 
necessarily sanction interracial unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Interrace examines the fears of those in interracial relationships . . 
. as well as those who point fingers and judge from the outside," she says. "I 
think there is more of a tolerance , but there is no such thing as acceptance 
when it comes to interracial couples. If that were to happen, we'd have no 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Walker-Hollis, 32, and her husband, Dan Hollis, 35, hope to do their 
part to dismantle some of those fears come August. 
</P>
<P>
 New People, their 4-year-old, 2,500 circulation magazine, will host a 
convention in Dallas under the banner, "No More Fear," with workshops 
addressing the range of topics surrounding interracial marriages and 
relationships. Hollis says they plan to send a strong and resonant message: 
"Anybody black or white or whatever . . . who has a problem, might as well 
accept us, because you're not stopping us." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple started the magazine fueled by Mills' same sense of isolation. "We 
became a clearinghouse and support mechanism," Walker-Hollis says, "for people 
who don't have friends to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 Both magazines traverse the same universe, publishing advice columns for 
newlyweds and young parents of biracial children, and discussions about 
transracial adoptions. They also serve as rotating bulletin boards of sorts for 
support and advocacy groups, as well as providing personal listings and 
advertisements for dating services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both couples have seen growing interest in interracial relationships 
through correspondence to the magazines, both Mills and Grosz say many dating 
services find it difficult to survive. "They are often run by people who don't 
have training in management," Mills says. Be careful, she warns, suggesting 
that before you join any dating service, try to get verifiable written 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone starts out with good intentions, and it's a great idea," Grosz says. 
"There is a population out there who wants an interracial connection . . . and 
I think that there is a need for these dating services. We get more and more 
(personal) ads from people who are afraid to approach someone of a different 
race or culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Grosz would like to further expand such opportunities and, with today's 
climate, he's thinks the possibilities could be limitless: 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone were to start an interracial night club, where people are not 
afraid to approach people and aren't worried about being turned down on the 
basis of race, they would really be on to something." Dating Rules When Race Is 
Unimportant 
</P>
<P>
 The following is excerpted from "Interracial Dating Turn-offs," by Sandy 
Cirillo, Interrace magazine, January/February, 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Racial slurs: 
</P>
<P>
 If you think words such as China Doll or Chief are harmless, cute or funny, 
you should think twice about crossing the color line. The use or slip of just 
one racial slur has the power of altering an interracial relationship forever 
and can often lead to its termination. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Imitating/impersonating a different race: 
</P>
<P>
 There are many people who purposely and very obviously attempt to sound like, 
walk like, dress like a particular group of people unlike themselves in order 
to fit in. If you are not black, you don't have to "act black" to date a black 
man or woman. Likewise, if you are not white, you don't have to "act white" to 
date a white man or woman. Be yourself! 
</P>
<P>
 3. Assuming stereotypes are true for all: 
</P>
<P>
 It is unwise to get into an interracial relationship based primarily or solely 
on stereotypes, whether they be positive or negative. We date individuals, not 
a race of people. Thus every person should be appreciated and treated on an 
individual basis, especially when it comes to dating interracially. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Secret relationships: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get involved in an interracial relationship if you are planning on 
hiding or denying to friends and family that you are in one. It is demeaning 
and unfair to everyone, including yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Shock effect: 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing the color line is not a game. If you think the attention, the stares 
and comments, and the novelty of crossing the color line will make no 
difference to you and thus jump into an interracial relationship without regard 
to what interracial dating entails, you need to brace yourself for a hard 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
 6. To have fair-skinned children: 
</P>
<P>
 As sad and bizarre as this may sound, not only is this a painfully honest 
reason why some people become interracially involved, but it also seems to be 
more acceptable than interracial couples are. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Wild erotic sex: 
</P>
<P>
 The color of a person's skin has nothing to do with how "sweet" he or she is 
in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Status symbol: 
</P>
<P>
 How emotionally and psychologically damaging it has to be to your partner's 
self-esteem to know that the only reason he or she was chosen was because their 
skin was darker or lighter. We are much more than color. Don't short change 
yourself into thinking that any human being can be used as a status symbol for 
long. Don't give away your identity to a person of a different race. Only you 
can make yourself acceptable to others. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Self-hatred: 
</P>
<P>
 If you think an interracial relationship can fill your emptiness, it will only 
serve to make things worse for you. First you must confront why you hate 
yourself, why you look down on your own people. Then step back. Now you must 
fix yourself by yourself (as opposed to being in a relationship). Only then do 
you have a chance in building a healthy, happy interracial relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Being afraid to commit: 
</P>
<P>
 It is imperative that you don't commit to an interracial relationship that you 
may not be able to handle. Only you know how much outside pressure you can 
take. Discuss this with your partner so he or she isn't left holding your 
baggage.

<P>
 Richard Avedon was singing as he stepped into his New York studio -- "Stage 
Fright," an old tune by the Band with its protagonist "who got caught in the 
spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in October, and the photographer felt something like that himself. He 
had just appeared on three national television networks and been a featured 
subject in several international magazines, talking endlessly about the 
photographs he's made over the past five decades, portraits of the great and 
terrible, of artists, writers, performers, athletes, leaders and unknowns.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm turning into this media nut," he said then. "I'm more comfortable on talk 
shows now than I am in real life, because the studio here is so chaotic that 
I'd do anything to get back on television, where everything is focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's five months later, and Avedon sits over a plate of chicken tacos in 
Hollywood, rubbing his temples, on another wearying bi-coastal schedule. Last 
fall's tour was for the sake of "An Autobiography," his epic collection of 
nearly 300 images, now in its second printing despite its $100 price and some 
scattered unfriendly reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is "Evidence" (Random House and Eastman Kodak), another 
retrospective of Avedon's most important work. This collection, all black and 
white, ranges from rediscovered pictures of 1940s Harlem to portraits of his 
dying father, which Avedon hopes communicate an underlying view on death and 
beauty, comedy and horror.  
</P>
<P>
 If "An Autobiography" was the photographer's vision of his own history, 
"Evidence" offers a less subjective view and serves as the catalogue to a 
museum retrospective of the same name that opened Thursday at the Whitney in 
New York and that will come to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the 
summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that these retrospectives mean the photographer has come to the end of a 
long and sometimes controversial career. In 1992, Avedon signed on as the first 
staff photographer for the New Yorker, where his newest images have included a 
group portrait of gays in the military, surreal montages on the Academy Awards, 
and a somber series of portraits of survivors from the Kennedy years. 
</P>
<P>
 On this trip to Hollywood, his schedule includes photographing Steven 
Spielberg for a New Yorker series on Hollywood players and breakfasting in 
Santa Barbara with former high-fashion model Suzi Parker -- their first reunion 
in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to trust certain people to say 'You've lost it,' " says Avedon, who 
turns 71 this year. "You know, I'm not going to be photographing a tree out of 
the window, like (Edward) Steichen. At the moment I feel in full command. I'm 
still, as always, concerned with what to do next and not repeating myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He hints that he may even be tiring of the empty white backgrounds that have 
been a signature of many of his portraits and of such major projects as "In the 
American West," his stark series of portraits of drifters, coal miners, 
waitresses, migrant workers, truckers, adolescents and others across the rural 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could stop right now, in terms of the work that expresses myself," he says. 
"And I have a body of work that's fine. But I love the idea that maybe I could 
find a last stage that may go on for 10 years, in which I would develop 
something completely new to me, challenging to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One option is a raw, deeply subjective style of documentary photography that 
he practiced in his montages of the Academy Awards and the 1991 Volpi Ball in 
Venice, Italy, billed as the last great aristocratic ball. Avedon's photographs 
from that event were intense and claustrophobic, presenting an ancient 
subculture caught in a desperate fade. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really felt the sinking ship," Avedon says. "You just felt that this 
would never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Evidence" and "An Autobiography" include a ghostly scene from Berlin's 
Brandenburg Gate, New Year's Eve 1989, when East and West Germany were welded 
back together in a celebration the photographer found frightening. Other 
photographs from that frantic six-hour shoot captured a night sky filled with 
rockets and pistol-fire, young men climbing walls and signposts and raising 
champagne bottles to their lips. Not a few celebrants are caught with 
expressions of horror, their faces grossly over-lit, as if caught in a 
searchlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids were climbing the scaffolding to get up on the top of the bridge, and it 
fell -- three people died," Avedon recalls. "They were throwing bottles and 
cherry bombs or something. Bottles were crashing down with the excitement of 
it, and it was really dangerous. And you can see that in some of these faces." 
</P>
<P>
 With these pictures, Avedon has arrived at the edge of something more biting 
and personal than his aborted documentary for Life magazine about Harlem in 
1949, published for the first time in his new book. But he's rarely been 
accepted as a true believer in photojournalism by critics, who sneer at his 
roots as a fashion photographer and his decades of work for Harper's Bazaar and 
Vogue. Avedon's early '80s pictures from the West earned some scathing reviews 
accusing him of taking an Eastern view of Westerners as haggard, hopeless and 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics also questioned the fairness of the white backdrop, isolating his 
subjects from their natural surroundings, his 8-by-10 view camera presenting 
their human flaws with a cruel precision. And there was Avedon's willingness to 
set up and pose his subjects, as he did for a striking image of a hairless and 
shirtless beekeeper he covered with bees to create a precise design. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are other people's ideas and other people's rules," he says of his 
critics. "When I started, the high road was (Henri) Cartier-Bresson's you do 
not crop an image at all, " says Avedon. When he began at Harper's Bazaar in 
1945 under the tutelage of art director Alexey Brodovitch, Avedon says, "I 
started retouching, cropping, all from Brodovitch. I learned from him there was 
no difference between a camera and a paintbrush." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the beginning of his professional career, Avedon has experimented 
with a variety of photographic genres, from fashion work to photojournalism, 
often succeeding in bringing some personal vision to a given style. So in 1972, 
he could capture an elegant and serene Groucho Marx or spend a frenzied 
afternoon with pianist Oscar Levant the same year as he was documenting his 
father's final days. 
</P>
<P>
 Avedon's best fashion pictures found an elegant reality, incorporating the 
drama and blur of life's action. "When it told something about the nature of 
being a woman in relation to their looks, and the anxiety that went with that 
-- something I knew about clothes and women and facades -- that contradiction 
made me a strong fashion photographer." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Avedon's self-portraits reveal a serious presence, the unblinking 
artist, rather than the pleasant host he is in interviews. For him, flattery is 
photography's least-welcome vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My self-portraits, the ones that I've shown so far, don't differ from my 
portraits of anyone else," he says over the restaurant clamor. "The confusion 
is in confusing a man's work with his real life. Art is art and real life is 
real life. Otherwise you'd just have these endless videos of people chatting." 
</P>
<P>
 It is his portraiture that has remained the backbone of his work, in spite of 
his influence on fashion and accomplishments in other genres, says Jane 
Livingston, guest curator of the "Evidence" exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think you can look at photographic portraiture without an 
awareness of what Dick has done," Livingston says, noting that generations of 
photographers, from Irving Penn to Annie Leibovitz and beyond, have felt 
Avedon's influence, "not only because the work has been so widely seen, but 
also because it is so distinctive." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she says of Avedon's work, "There is this prodigious kind of 
variety and this mastery of many, many things. There are few, few photographers 
who have done that. I think of Irving Penn, I think of (Eugene) Atget, of 
Steichen, of Bernice Abbott. There are a few, but I think he belongs in that 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Both books connect all these facets of his photography in a way Avedon says he 
could not express or argue until now. A pattern has emerged across the decades. 
"You see that a black woman walking through the streets of Harlem is not so 
different from someone walking through the streets of Paris," he says. "I was 
looking for beauty and found it." 
</P>
<P>
 That continuing variety of visual interests is reflected on the top floor of 
his New York studio, a red-brick converted laundry building, where he's worked 
for 20 years. There his own framed and unframed pictures are scattered along 
the walls with works by his onetime rival Penn and other photographers. He's 
collected images since he was an adolescent and they remain a resource for 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 But Avedon has been buried under the weight of his own past these last two 
years, printing and cataloguing all of his work, beginning with 1945. The first 
results are the two books and the museum show, to be followed by a book on the 
1960s next year and a series of four "teaching books." 
</P>
<P>
 His reasons for summing up his career now, as he is in the midst of one of his 
busiest periods, are simple. "I just wanted to do it before they do it to me," 
he says. "You never know when you're going to be a geezer. It could happen 
tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring that, Avedon expects to continue as before, making portraits and 
documentary photographs for the New Yorker, or fashion pictures for the 
designer Versace. His name is usually enough now to win a sitting with 
virtually any subject who interests him, as revealing as his camera can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone decides not to give anything, and be suspicious of me, then it's a 
picture of someone who's suspicious," he says. "That's terrific ."

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; PIERCE COLLEGE DESERVES COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT; SCHOOL NEEDS 
NEIGHBORS' SYMPATHY, EARTHQUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a certain irony in the fact that a quake-relief concert held on 
behalf of Cal State Northridge was held at Pierce College's Recital Hall. Since 
the underlying message of that story was that CSUN was too damaged to host its 
own recovery event, Pierce once again found its own considerable troubles 
overshadowed by other concerns. Pierce also suffered greatly in the quake, a 
fact that exacerbated an already onerous financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College's importance to the southwest San Fernando Valley's educational 
offerings is too often overlooked; so is the fact that its presence has 
enhanced the local economy by bringing faculty, staff people and 15,500 to 
16,000 students to a central location. On occasion, those folks just might buy 
a thing or two in the surrounding area. In a recession, that's certainly a 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Few institutions have come up with as many imaginative and independent 
solutions to fiscal problems. And few institutions have faced as many efforts 
to place restrictions on those solutions. Perhaps the neighbors who object to 
every survival idea that Pierce officials come up with would rather see it 
slowly deteriorate into a shabby, underenrolled and financially strapped 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 We are on the brink of that, and to allow it would be a great mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a new acting president prepares to take the reins, it's time to point 
out that the school at least needs some sympathy from its neighbors, if not 
considerable help from those who can afford to provide it. It needs attention 
from elected and appointed officials. It needs earthquake relief and it needs 
to be given a chance to decide on whether it should seek out a new educational 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College sustained more than $2 million in damage from the Northridge 
quake. It was not only the most severely damaged of the nine Los Angeles 
community colleges, it suffered more financial losses than the other eight 
campuses combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before that, Pierce faced a $1.3-million budget shortfall, necessitating 
a cut of some 130 classes. But this is also the area in which unusual burdens 
have been placed on Pierce. Simply put, it is not allowed to act as a college 
that is struggling to do its best for its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the idea of offering itself as a repository for the dirt that was to be 
excavated from the nearby Warner Ridge development, was labeled a bad one, even 
though Warner Ridge had planned to pay Pierce $2.1 million for it. Neighbors 
said that this would destroy one of the natural rest stops for Canada geese. 
(The deal has since fallen through, leaving that huge deficit in its wake.) The 
Pierce idea of setting aside some of its land for a revenue-producing golf 
course and driving range was also panned. This time, Pierce was referred to as 
one of the Valley's last open spaces, which, of course, meant that the open 
space had to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College is not a wildlife refuge. It's not a park. It's a college that 
wants to offer a full summer program and a full slate of courses in the fall 
and the spring for students who deserve such choices. It has tried to come up 
with solutions that would not have involved any additional costs to taxpayers. 
For that, it ought to be applauded, not panned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Pierce's newly chosen acting president -- Valley College 
President Mary Lee -- brings with her a certain reputation for toughness. Lee, 
for example, opened the Valley College campus two days after the quake, much to 
the chagrin of faculty and students who felt they needed much more time to 
recover from the temblor's effects. She'll need that toughness to deal with 
Pierce's enrollment decline, budget problems, and the detractors who shoot down 
its efforts to raise more revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has just two years to come up with solutions. She deserves some room to 
maneuver, and the active support of her new neighbors and elected officials in 
the West Valley.

CLOSURE WOULD DEVASTATE VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * An aftershock to the Jan. 17 earthquake hit the VA Medical Center in North 
Hills recently, and its potential impact may devastate veterans in the area for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The honorable Jesse Brown, secretary of veterans affairs, unveiled a plan that 
will probably result in the closure of the medical center, which has served the 
San Fernando Valley and northern communities for almost 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, the seemingly omnipotent chairman of the House Veterans 
Affairs Committee, G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) announced support for 
post-quake rebuilding of the center. On March 8, the Southern California 
contingent in the House of Representatives sent Mr. Brown a letter making 
irrefutable arguments in favor of rebuilding the medical center. This letter 
was signed by Reps. Bob Dornan and Maxine Waters and everyone in between the 
political poles they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran patients from the North Hills medical center and their families do not 
want to travel to West Los Angeles for care. Right or wrong, many of them 
perceive great differences between the two facilities. These perceived 
differences will result in a large number of our patients choosing alternatives 
to continued VA care. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Secretary Brown would propose an almost universally rejected idea is 
beyond understanding. To do so in the nation's second-largest media market 
during an election year is lunacy. To give opponents of the President's health 
care plan fodder -- "He has broken long-standing promises concerning health 
care to veterans; can you trust him with your health care?" -- is political 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposal will fail. It will cost the President and others politically. As 
a lifelong Democrat, I am considering the unspeakable: voting Republican.

EX-SEN. ROBBINS PAID THE PRICE FOR GREED; RESTITUTION AND THE LOSS OF HIS REAL 
ESTATE LICENSE STAND AS APPROPRIATE PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Robbins is in the news again. The former (D-Van Nuys) state senator from 
the Valley's 20th Senate District who spent 20 months in prison for 
racketeering and tax evasion wants his real estate license back. He says he 
needs it to pay his fines. It was recently revoked by a state commissioner who 
said that Robbins "had lost his moral compass" and did not appear to have been 
rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins misses his old job in Sacramento. He also claims he was the target of 
animosity from other inmates in a work camp. (. . . Perhaps he ought to 
consider the "animosity" he might have been subjected to at a tougher prison.) 
He wants to be remembered for his good deeds for his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' old colleagues have distanced themselves of late (Sacramento is a bit 
far removed from the Lompoc Federal Prison Camp), but he has a message for 
them: "They would be well-advised to look at what they could do to clean up 
their own house." And he says that transcripts of the wire he wore for the FBI 
in their investigation of influence peddling should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 We think Robbins ought to be remembered for having ruined 18 years of 
seniority and one of the most powerful positions in the state Senate, a 
position from which his constituents deserved to honestly benefit for many more 
years. He ought to be remembered for having extorted $229,700 from a San Diego 
hotel developer, for laundering money, for extorting cash and campaign 
contributions, for illegally obtaining bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins has been greatly compensated for the assistance he gave the FBI. A 
five-year prison term became a 20-month sentence, and a judge recently spared 
him more prison time over those loans, leveling a fine instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The roughly $4 million in fines and restitution that Robbins has to pay, and 
the loss of his real estate license, are high prices, but appropriately high. 
Let them stand as enduring examples of the price of greed.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; A SITUATION IN DIRE NEED OF CORRECTION; PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE 
PLUMMETS IN WAKE OF ESCAPES FROM STATE PRISON AT LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have some disturbing news for folks who live in the Lancaster area of the 
Antelope Valley. It involves state prisons and Level IV, maximum-security 
inmates, the kind you least want wandering around the countryside for any 
length of time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Times reporter Phil Sneiderman, just one of 11 state prisons that 
house such inmates has had a Level IV convict escape this year. Just one of 
those prisons -- the same one, in fact -- had such an escape in 1993. And the 
October, 1993, escape broke a 68-month streak in which no male maximum-security 
inmate had been able to effect a breakout from a California state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The state prison with this most unenviable streak-buster status is none other 
than our very own, in the Lancaster area of Los Angeles County. Both inmates 
were later apprehended, but the context just provided shows why that is hardly 
reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the argument that the 13-month-old Lancaster facility suffered from 
normal first-year operational problems has also been refuted. None of the 
state's newest prisons have shared the Lancaster facility's security problems. 
In fact, the last male maximum-security inmate to escape from a facility other 
than Lancaster broke out of one of the state's older prisons -- in Tehachapi -- 
way back in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minimum-security inmates also escaped from Lancaster last year and were 
later recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Lancaster Warden Otis Thurman has been replaced, but much more is 
needed here. 
</P>
<P>
 We understand, for example, that electrified fences are being installed at 
various maximum-security prisons around the state. It does not require a degree 
in rocket science to suggest that the Antelope Valley prison ought to be the 
first to receive such fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been far too little communication between prison authorities 
and an increasingly fearful and frustrated public. It would make sense, for 
example, for prison officials to try to explain how they intend to ensure that 
another maximum-security inmate will not be able to scale not one, not two, but 
three razor-wire walls and fences without detection (Level IV escape 1) and 
won't be able to slip into a prison kitchen waste bin and then into a garbage 
truck when guards are supposed to be present at both the garbage bins and the 
trucks (Level IV escape 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Such assurances are at least mildly important, given the fact that state 
corrections officials hope to build another prison in the county to take the 
place of the one that had been proposed years ago for East Los Angeles. 
Lancaster was under consideration for that prison too. Care to guess how 
welcome it would be now?

WISDOM AND ADVICE COME WITH $6 HAIRCUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The story "Barbers Suffer Unkindest Cut of All" (March 12) left me saddened. 
Jim and Tom's Barber Shop is a unique, timeless place where a haircut may come 
with a medley of Broadway show tunes played on a slightly out-of-tune piano.Or 
the wisdom of life experiences of the two barbers approaching 80 years old, or 
of customers ranging from businessmen and plainclothes police officers to 
retired blue-collar workers or a brilliant homeless musician. 
</P>
<P>
 A haircut at the cluttered little shop has always been a friendly experience, 
dipping into the past and speculating about the future. It's a place never 
short of opinions, on any subject, expressed by proud individuals. And the 
haircut is included for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 The article indicates that the barbers think they may be evicted because 
they've extended friendship to two or three homeless people. Is there something 
wrong with a non-patronizing acceptance of a few individuals with problems? 
What a loss!

REVISED PROJECT WILL CHANGE CALABASAS FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I recently moved to Calabasas because of its uniqueness. I moved from the 
San Fernando Valley because of what "progress" had brought with it -- gangs, 
crime, graffiti, traffic, pollution and unsafe communities. 
</P>
<P>
 It distresses me to learn of the proposal by Kilroy/Abrahamson to revise the 
Calabasas Park Centre project, because the development will change forever the 
unique character of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 I was under the impression that Calabasas became a city so that it could 
control its own destiny. We can learn from the mistakes of the neighboring 
communities, mistakes that resulted from excessive and inappropriate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 I live in the Oak Park Condominiums on Park Granada. Our complex is adjacent 
to Calabasas Park Centre. We are not a guarded community, and we do not have 
security parking facilities. We will be among the most affected by the 
additional traffic generated by the project as approved. The revised project 
will have more of an impact. And what about the increased potential for crime 
in the complex where I live? 
</P>
<P>
 We need to consider the potential consequences of such development. Is the 
projected extra income that will accrue to the city as a result of the 
additional retail space planned worth the potential damage that will result to 
our way of life? There will be no turning back if this is approved.

CANYON OAKS PROJECT WOULD BENEFIT TOPANGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We were dismayed by the recent turn of events at the March 10 hearing before 
the County Board of Supervisors on the Canyon Oaks project. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, is playing fast and loose with public funds when he injects 
himself into a political dispute by proposing use of public money to bail out 
the Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community and the Topanga Town Council from a 
battle they could not win on merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments weighed heavily in favor of the Canyon Oaks project. The 
developer's planning addressed all of the association's and the Town Council's 
objections and demands, based on meetings with Topanga residents. The county 
Planning Commission testified that all county and environmental requirements 
were met or exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has clearly been designed to benefit the whole community while 
adhering to the Los Angeles General Plan, the Los Angeles Hillside Guidelines 
and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Master Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, the association and Town Council supporters put on an 
unruly, emotional demonstration outside the hall, then disrupted proceedings 
repeatedly by unseemly outbursts intended to influence and, we believe, even 
intimidate the board as the hearing progressed and it became obvious they were 
losing credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewridge area and upper Topanga residents who will be the ones most affected 
by the Canyon Oaks project are overwhelmingly in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 They are especially pleased with the way it blends with the environment and 
complements current residential development in the ridge area. It promises to 
be a boon by widening the tax base, providing work and improving the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the supervisors will have the final responsibility to determine 
what can be done with $19.9 million of public money that is proposed for the 
purchase of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 After acquiring the land, the county would have to spend more to operate and 
maintain it, instead of letting a private enterprise do a better job at no cost 
to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Public funds are hard to come by. Those who voted for Proposition A represent 
a much wider constituency than the association and the Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will have to answer to that larger constituency if they vote 
against a project offering far more benefits to the immediate community 
essentially free than can otherwise be bought at public expense to please a 
misguided minority.

PARENTS SHOULD SUPPORT RESOLUTION ON EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your March 12 article "Pupil's Exposure to High Electromagnetic Fields 
Enrages Parents" got its facts correct but was incomplete. As Mayall Street's 
PTA president, I was responsible for having the EMF levels measured at our 
school last year. 
</P>
<P>
 We do have a transformer with an EMF level exceeding 600 milligauss adjacent 
to it. A fence was constructed at our request to keep students away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 But we also had to vacate a classroom due to high EMF readings from nearby 
breaker panels. We continue to experience transient high EMF readings in and 
around our cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding Dixie Canyon's EMF experience to Mayall's leads one to believe that all 
areas of our schools should be tested for these potentially hazardous 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution dealing with safe EMF levels is being brought to the California 
State PTA convention in May. Concerned parents should ask their local PTA to 
support this resolution.

PHOTOGRAPH OF CHILD ON BIKE WAS IRRESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was very irresponsible of you to publish the photo headlined "Biker's 
Double Dare" (March 15). 
</P>
<P>
 The picture shows children lying on the ground, susceptible to no less than a 
few broken ribs from the cyclist riding over them.If the child riding the bike 
should make an error, he could land directly on one of the boys and cause 
severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize this child races bikes, but even the most proficient rider 
occasionally falls. 
</P>
<P>
 My other complaint about this picture, where is the boy's helmet? Actually not 
only should he, by law, be wearing a helmet, he is doing stunts on his bicycle 
and should be completely outfitted with kneepads, elbow pads and so on.

CSUN WAS WISE TO SPEND $15,000 ON MAYA ANGELOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Having attended the evening with Maya Angelou at Cal State Northridge on 
March 17, I was shocked to read a letter (March 21) berating the university for 
paying a $15,000 fee to a visiting poet while classrooms lack the basic 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud CSUN for bringing one of our country's greatest literary artists to 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity audience, representing every culture and generation, attested to 
the fact that people at CSUN, surrounded by devastating reminders of the Jan. 
17 earthquake, proudly stated their intention not only to recover but also to 
bring a greater educational experience to their students and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not have made a better choice than to spend their funds for the 
inspiring gift of Maya Angelou.

HARRIS SHOULD GIVE EQUAL TIME TO CRIME VICTIMS

 * While I am always touched by Scott Harris' sympathy for professional 
burglars like Brian Simpson, I am curious to know whether The Times and Harris 
ever devote equal space, sympathy, and compassion to the people whose homes 
Brian Simpson has burglarized? 
</P>
<P>
 Or does Harris' sympathy lie only with crooks, inmates and thugs he watches 
from his ivory tower?

VALLEY COMMENTARY; PLANNING TO GROW UP; LOS ANGELES' 'GENERAL PLAN FRAMEWORK' 
REQUIRES SEVERAL FACTORS TO WORK. AND, JUST AS CRUCIAL, THE CITY NEEDS THE 
MATURITY TO STICK TO THE PLAN. 
</P>

(Solano Press) and editor of California Planning & Development Report, a 
newsletter based in Ventura.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost half a century ago, at the beginning of the San Fernando Valley's 
postwar boom, the Los Angeles Department of City Planning drew up a series of 
"community plans" that called for the preservation of agricultural greenbelts 
by clustering new development in existing communities such as Reseda and Van 
Nuys. Needless to say, the plans went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, in the 1970s, City Planning drew up another plan, this 
time with the help of homeowner groups. The citywide General Plan called for 
protecting residential neighborhoods by channeling new development into 
existing "centers." They would feature high-density housing, shopping, office 
buildings and transit stops. This plan, too, went largely unheeded. The density 
arrived, but it was scattered willy-nilly, wherever politically influential 
developers wanted to build. And the transit system is still on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now City Planning is in the midst of yet another major planning effort. The 
"General Plan Framework" currently being discussed at workshops in the Valley 
will likely renew the call for concentrated development around transit stops to 
protect single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan grew out of the city's sewer moratorium of the 1980s. Before 
expanded sewage treatment facilities, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
wanted proof that Los Angeles would manage the sewer system responsibly. The 
city has responded by revisiting growth issues in a comprehensive way for the 
first time since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan will take years to produce and cost the city several million 
dollars. The biggest issue surrounding it is whether the city and its residents 
have the gumption to make it stick once it's prepared. Given Los Angeles' 
planning history, it's understandable why many citizens might not place much 
faith in the new plan -- even the citizens who participate in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in Los Angeles, the story of U.S. city planning has been that 
"plans are made to be broken." Both the postwar community plans and the 1974 
L.A. General Plan were recognized among planners as outstanding documents -- 
conceptually. But they conflicted with the city's zoning ordinance, which is 
the day-to-day workhorse of land-use decisions, and the city's politicians did 
not have the will to stick to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the '74 General Plan was not implemented for more than a decade. It 
took a special law by the state Legislature and lengthy litigation by citizen 
activists to force the City Council to reconcile the plan and the zoning 
ordinances for some 800,000 parcels throughout the city. In the meantime, 
developers were able to "break" the plan by constructing large buildings 
outside designated centers, especially on the Westside and in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the plan's conceptual power remains compelling. Most planners continue to 
believe that the notion of a multi-centered city, with high-density centers 
separated by low-density residential areas and connected by transportation 
corridors, is right for Los Angeles. This idea will most likely form the core 
of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But can the city turn the lofty concepts into a meaningful constitution for 
future development? Experience suggests that for a plan to be effective in the 
long run, four important factors must be present. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The plan must be realistic. It made sense on paper to cluster postwar 
development around existing Valley communities. But the barriers to suburban 
sprawl were falling rapidly. Land was cheap; mass-produced housing was becoming 
available; middle-class families could afford low-density houses and the cars 
that made a low-density life possible. Squared off against reality, the plans 
didn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The plan must have the enduring commitment of local politicians. Planning 
isn't about maps. It's about getting eight votes at the City Council. Despite 
the involvement of politically influential homeowners groups, the '74 General 
Plan fell because politicians did not feel deeply committed to it when the real 
estate boom of the '80s arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A plan needs powerful external forces arrayed behind it. Examples are the 
threat of litigation and penalties from the state or federal governments. The 
'74 plan was implemented, belatedly, only because a lawsuit was used to enforce 
a state law. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Maybe most important, a plan needs a city that has reached maturity. It 
must have left behind the go-go years of its youth and understand that its 
middle age must be carefully managed. New York and Chicago became committed to 
planning after chaotic periods of rapid growth that established them as great 
cities. San Francisco -- the most heavily planned city on the West Coast -- 
turned to planning only after it was created overnight by the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured against these four yardsticks, the new plan has a chance to work. But 
success is by no means assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more realistic than past efforts, the plan is likely to emphasize 
development along transit corridors, and that remains a somewhat dreamy idea. 
Yes, the transit system will be built, and some people will be channeled into 
it. But most people will continue to drive most places -- a fact the plan must 
confront. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether members of the City Council will commit 
themselves to the plan. By all indications, many council members -- especially 
the newer ones -- have been closely involved in the planning process, and 
that's good. But 1970s politicians also spouted a lot of rhetoric about 
planning. To succeed, the plan must represent a set of agreements so deeply 
woven into the city's political fabric that the politicians cannot abandon it 
when circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's greatest potential for success may lie in the third yardstick -- 
the external threat. Expanding on its original concern with sewage treatment, 
the EPA intends to scrutinize the plan for compliance with federal clean-water 
and clean-air laws. If the EPA holds Los Angeles' feet to the fire, the city 
will have to follow the plan or risk severe federal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to remember that the federal bureaucrats operate in a 
political environment too. In the past, when the Clean Air Act has threatened 
to impede Los Angeles' economy, Congress or the EPA or both have changed 
federal policies to lessen the blow. Given Southern California's fragile 
economy and political importance, the Clinton Administration may decide not to 
push too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important question is whether Los Angeles is mature enough to 
stick to a plan. After a lengthy adolescence, Los Angeles is now large and 
unmanageable. Its problems and costs make it verge on economic 
uncompetitiveness with other cities, much as New York did 20 years ago. Sooner 
or later the city will begin taking its plans seriously, if only to remain a 
manageable place to live and work. But will it be now? 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan will give Los Angeles an opportunity to prove that it's time not 
to just do good planning but to stick to it. Whether the current planning 
effort succeeds will depend on whether the city's people and politicians are 
truly willing to leave acne scars and wild parties behind and face their city's 
adulthood.

LET'S GIVE DANK SCHOOL SYSTEM A FRESH COAT OF PAINT; IT'S BASIC PSYCHOLOGY THAT 
A BETTER-LOOKING ENVIRONMENT ALLOWS FOR BETTER LEARNING. BUT AESTHETICS AREN'T 
A TOP PRIORITY WHEN THERE'S LITTLE MONEY FOR TEACHERS, BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI, Michael Szymanski is a free-lance writer whose work 
appears frequently in The Times.

 "Business executives could never work in these conditions," says John Perez, 
an angry parent in North Hollywood. "They would never deal with the secondhand 
equipment or mismatched furniture in dirty, dank rooms with institutionalized 
gray or green paint peeling off the walls. They could never go into buildings 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez takes a deep breath and adds, "But they send their children there and 
expect them to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez has two girls being educated in Valley schools that look like 
warehouses. One is Byrd Junior High School in Sun Valley; the other, Strathern 
Street Elementary School in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 It's basic psychology that a better-looking environment allows for better 
learning. A freshly painted classroom makes students feel welcome and could 
improve study habits and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But aesthetics aren't a high priority when there's hardly enough money to pay 
teachers and buy books. Most schools in the Valley built in the 1950s have 
never been painted. It's possible that the grandchildren of today's youth could 
still be looking at the same paint peeling off the same walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, as The Times reported awhile back, it's taken an earthquake to 
make a difference at some schools. Because of the damage, they'll get some 
unscheduled maintenance. That won't help the ones that look shabby because of 
mere neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crime to see the condition that most of the schools are in," says 
Perez, who is also the secondary vice president of the United Teachers of Los 
Angeles. "And we're going to have to depend more and more on parents to help 
keep the schools beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike employees in some unions, L.A. teachers have no clause requiring an 
attractive workplace, says UTLA official Catherine Carey. "We do have a section 
that says the workplace must be safe, but it doesn't have to look nice," Carey 
says. "Yet it's well-documented that a nice work environment makes you feel 
better about going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents know this. At schools like Canoga Park High School, LeMay Street 
Elementary School in Van Nuys and Castlebay Lane Elementary School in 
Northridge, parent organizations have raised money for painting classrooms that 
are in shoddy shape. Now parent groups all over the Valley are waiting to 
provide the muscle work after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very active school beautification committee," says Castlebay Lane 
Elementary Principal Natalie Messinger, who had the heating and air 
conditioning fixed in her school after the quake. "They're waiting to find out 
how many cans of paint we're going to get. The labor is there. The parents will 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the maintenance schedule for repainting classrooms is every five 
to seven years, says Yugo Fukushima, Los Angeles Unified School District 
assistant operations manager. But he says the reality is that it takes up to 20 
years. Margaret Scholl, director of maintenance and operations for all Los 
Angeles schools, admits: "It would really be more like 30 years; painting is 
just not very high up on the priority scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me that some of the schools look as well as they do in the 
Valley, and I know that's due to some volunteer efforts," Scholl says. "The 
bottom line really is that New Jersey spends about $15,000 a student and we 
spend $4,500. We're at the bottom on what we spend in education, and 
maintenance is at the bottom of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perez recalls that a fundamental reason for his family moving across the 
country from New York when he was a child was to take advantage of the 
high-caliber California school system. Today, he knows his children are getting 
an education that's inferior to what he received -- and they're trying to learn 
in a pitiful environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's more important things to work on, like lowering the classroom 
size per teacher, for instance," says Perez, "but the bottom line is that if we 
let our schools deteriorate in how they look, we also will see education 
deteriorate even more." 
</P>
<P>
 "The district maintenance people are doing their best, I know, but it does get 
frustrating," says Messinger, the Castlebay principal. "I'll give you an 
example. We had a new product tried on our playground and driveway when the 
school was built, but it melts in the summer and firetrucks can't go on it. We 
were supposedly on a high priority to change it. It's been 22 years."

JIM MURRAY: LONG DRIVES NOT HER ONLY ASSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone knows the longest hitter of the ball is this big blond young basher 
who hits the ball out of the county and has this powerful, full-turn backswing 
that takes the club back so far from parallel that it seems to go around twice 
or in a 380-degree arc. Hits the ball regularly 80 to 85 yards past the 
competition with shots that have the hang time of a hot-air balloon. Galleries 
come from three fairways over simply to gawk and marvel and ooh and aah.  
</P>
<P>
 It's good for the game to have this belting blond bomber. You know how 
Americans love home-run hitters, knockout artists, three-point shooters, 
strikeout pitchers. The small sneaky skills bore them. They don't want fancy 
boxers, ballplayers who hit-em-where-they-ain't, pitchers throwing junk. They 
want King Kong, not King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 In golf, too, no one goes to see a good putter. But they stand three-deep when 
this big gun gets ready to fire. It's every player's dream. I mean, ever see a 
guy at a driving range practicing chips? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this player is young. Perhaps has a lot to learn. Hasn't won too 
much on tour yet. But hopefully will. Needs maturing.  
</P>
<P>
 John Daly? Who said anything about John Daly?! 
</P>
<P>
 Look! How far would John Daly be bashing it out there if he had to play in a 
skirt? If he had to spend the morning at the hairdresser's? If he couldn't make 
up his mind what to wear? 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly got a driver in his hand as soon as he was old enough to walk. Our 
candidate grew up playing with dolls, not nine-irons. She didn't learn to make 
a putt, she learned to make a bed. She did her ironing with on a board, not a 
fairway.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ms. Laura Davies learned to hit a ball as far as Master Daly all the same. 
She is the resident ballistic missile launcher of the ladies tour. The Human 
Cape Canaveral. She doesn't yell "Fore!" she yells "Lift off!" You don't watch 
her ball, you track it. An identified flying object entering orbit.  
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Davies is one of the Queen's Own. An M.B.E. (Member of the British Empire) 
dubbed by Her Majesty herself. One step up and she becomes "Dame Laura Davies" 
or "Her Ladyship." She is so British she sounds like Margaret Thatcher. Her 
conversation is sprinkled with "I should thinks," and "I dare say," and a lot 
of "as wells." Saturday and Sunday are referred to as the "wee-kend." 
</P>
<P>
 It is entirely possible she hits the ball farther than any woman ever did and, 
maybe, most men. Her drives this week at the Nabisco Dinah Shore at Mission 
Hills have been stepped off at 284 and 290.  
</P>
<P>
 Her game is really too big for the ladies tour. She used a two-iron to tee off 
at three par-fives in Friday's second round. She used a five-iron off the 
375-yard par-four on Saturday. She reached the 526-yard 18th with a drive and 
two-iron on Saturday. The best guess is, the drive was 296.  
</P>
<P>
 It's possible the ladies' tour is too short for her. She led off nine holes 
with a two-iron on Friday. "If she used a driver off the tee -- and kept it in 
the fairway -- the rest of us would be playing for second most of the time," 
Nancy Lopez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Laura: "If we played back where the men play, I could let it fly. But the 
way the courses are set up for us, you will only hit the ball into places where 
the fairway narrows or there are traps or trouble and a poor angle to the 
green." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies plays a game shackled, in a sense. Like DiMaggio forced to hit a cotton 
ball. When you can hit a ball 296 yards but discretion dictates you tee off 
with a five-iron on a 375-yard hole, you are playing the game in an iron 
corset, a straitjacket. Daly has plenty of use for his driver and it has scars 
all over it. Davies' driver looks like it recently came out of the cellophane.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an axiom of golf that those who hit the ball a long way off the tee 
usually can't do much else. The golf books are full of long knockers who never 
won much but the long-drive contests. Daly, for all his charisma, has won only 
two tournaments. He gets the gallery, someone else gets the cup. Around golf, 
they like the story of hotshot, long-hitting young neophyte who got in a game 
with the great Ben Hogan and was outdriving him on every hole. Ben said 
nothing. Finally the kid couldn't stand it any longer after 16 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Hogan, what do you think of my game?" he wanted to know. Hogan was 
startled. "Which part?" he asked. "Well, my driving," said the kid. "Your ball 
runs too much," Hogan told him.  
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is not lost. Golf is not how you hit it, it's where you hit it.  
</P>
<P>
 Davies would feel more comfortable back on the black tees.  
</P>
<P>
 Does Lady Laura become merely John Daly in skirts, another longballer, a 
one-purpose crowd pleaser who can do one thing well, like a guy who can do 
tricks with a deck of cards but cannot win at poker? 
</P>
<P>
 Davies is giving evidence she is not out there as a trick-shot artist. She is 
coming off a victory at last week's Ping Standard Register Open at Phoenix (her 
fifth) and at the close of business at the Dinah Shore on Saturday, she was 
only one shot off the lead at nine under.  
</P>
<P>
 Milady has no intention of letting the Empire down. She has no desire to be a 
sideshow on the women's tour. She wants to be a factor, not a freak.  
</P>
<P>
 If she gets any longer she will be able to play only north-and-south in 
England. And they should enter her in the Masters so she can turn to Daly and 
say, "You're away, John."

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; HE'S EAGER TO LEAVE HIS 
MARK 
</P>

 A little after 7 o'clock Saturday morning at the Hilton downtown, one of the 
leaders of Team Illustrated was up and around. Damon Stoudamire was in the 
shower, soaping his tattoo. Damon has the old-English capital letters "DAMON" 
on his left bicep. He intends to add two more tattoos before leaving for the 
Final Four basketball tournament, which will tie him for the University of 
Arizona team tattoo lead with three. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Reeves heard the water running. He wondered why his Wildcat roommate 
would be up so early, even for a 12:40 afternoon game. He decided he didn't 
care. Reeves rolled over and went back to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire fast-broke. He stopped for nothing, except to brush his teeth. He 
even skipped his usual ritual, the one Reeves usually can't believe, the one 
where after a shower, Stoudamire powders, perfumes, creams, combs, primps, then 
irons everything he intends to wear, even his T-shirts and socks. It amazes 
Reeves, who complains, "It's like waiting for a girl to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time. Five hours early for a date with Missouri, there he was, the 
Liberace of college basketball, on his way to the Sports Arena, sloppy and 
unshaven. Senior guard Dylan Rigdon tagged along. So did freshman Jason Richey. 
So did a coach. They were inside the gym by 7:45, shooting around. Stoudamire 
had stunk up this gym Thursday night against Louisville, or so he thought. And 
the thing he kept thinking was how much he hated stinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two for 12," he remembered. "Oh, man. I was nasty. I was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 His game needed cosmetic help. Stoudamire didn't know where to go, to a Tucson 
tattoo parlor or a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 All season long, he and Reeves had fancied themselves the best backcourt in 
America, best-looking and best-playing. OK, they were on the small side, 
Stoudamire at 5 feet 11 and Reeves at 6-1, but they stood head-and-shoulders 
above guards everywhere. Or, to quote their coach, the tattoo-free Lute Olson, 
"I don't recall seeing anybody with two guys who can do what these two can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire took shot after shot Saturday while other players were back in 
their rooms, watching cartoons. "Maybe 200," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves needed no practice. Reeves could shoot needles into cactus. He had 
nailed 29 points against Louisville, would nail 26 more against Missouri. He 
was a scoring machine, as one opposing coach from Washington State had called 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Fisher from Michigan had gone even further after a December defeat at 
Tucson, raving, "Khalid Reeves is as good a player as I've had the misfortune 
to sit on the opposite bench and coach against." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire thinks of himself as being in the same class. Not educationally -- 
he's a junior, a year behind Reeves in school. Athletically, though, he's 
pro-rated. Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino put the label "NBA lottery picks" on the 
two Arizona guards. He should have seen them here at the West Regional, where 
they lit up Missouri for 53 of Arizona's 92 points. It was not much of a 
catfight, this Wildcat-Tiger thing. Arizona had it in the bag almost from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers looked bad. They missed more three-point shots (26) than most 
Sports Arena spectators do during Clipper halftime promotions. They were so 
bad, the player voted Missouri's most valuable by the folks from CBS fouled out 
with 7 1/2 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners looked good. They got 10 rebounds from Stoudamire, the smallest 
starter on the floor. They got 10 more from Ray Owes, who also missed all 10 
shots he took but hoped nobody noticed. And eight more boards for Team 
Illustrated came from big Joe Blair, the human billboard. He has tattoos on his 
belly, breast and arm. Blair is about to set a new Final Four record for 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's team is ready to make a run at the national title, barring a breakout 
of skin poisoning. He is one happy coach. All those people who have branded his 
Wildcats "chokers and losers," Lute growled, well, phooey on them. He never 
actually identified who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's wife is doing her part. Stoudamire was thankful to Bobbi Olson for 
taking her hex off, or at least reversing it. "She told me I was going to score 
26 the other night, and I scored 11. So she told me I was going to score three 
points today, and I got 27. She's not so good at predicting my outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon, the omen. He is not a predictable guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Slapping the calf of his left leg in the locker room, Stoudamire said, "I'm 
going to get my initials tattooed right here before we go to Charlotte. And a 
basketball-hoop tattoo, too." 
</P>
<P>
 To look as good as Joe Blair's? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, looking good in the tournament," Stoudamire said. "You know. It's 
important."

COACH MAGIC READY TO ROLL; PRO BASKETBALL: ROOKIE LAKER BOSS APPROACHES DEBUT 
MUCH AS HE DID AS A PLAYER -- WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HARD WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 OK, but can he coach? 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson has already gone Mach I in talent and popularity, but he is 
suddenly a rookie again with a new barrier to break, stepping into one of the 
loftiest positions in basketball, coach of the Lakers, with the smallest of 
resumes. The four-week test run starts tonight, when the Milwaukee Bucks visit 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's supporters are unwavering in their belief that he can quickly adapt 
to the intricacies others have spent years learning. He was a coach on the 
floor during 1,060 regular-season and playoff games, right? John Lucas, a stint 
with the summertime U.S. Basketball League his only background when hired in 
San Antonio, ran on a similar platform for respectability last season and now 
has the Spurs contending for a title. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are skeptics. Some of his new peers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, when you sit there, you have 10 thoughts on your mind," Seattle 
SuperSonic Coach George Karl said last week. "And not only do you have to 
evaluate which one to do, but you have to evaluate the effect that each one 
will have on your team, on the other team and probably also on psychological 
circumstances. There is a tremendous amount of information involved in making 
decisions. All of this has to be done in seconds and minutes. I think he's 
going to be amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 Counterpoint: 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is one of the more unique players I've ever been around," said Laker 
assistant Bill Bertka, in his 22nd season on an NBA bench and a coach on the 
pro and college level since 1954. "In a timeout, he could tell you how 
everybody on his team was being played defensively. His court perception and 
game presence is a true gift. These are some things guys in this business spend 
their whole life trying to hone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are not alone in this belief. The Atlanta Hawks wanted to fire Bob 
Weiss last January and have Johnson take over and, like the current situation, 
finish the season before deciding if he would like to return. The commitment 
was so great that management, looking for an infusion in the team and the 
turnstiles, was willing to fly Johnson's family back and forth from Los Angeles 
and say now they were willing to offer a blank-check contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought prior to meeting with him that he would be an ideal candidate to be 
a successful coach in the NBA," Hawk General Manager Pete Babcock said. "Not 
only was he a great player, but he was an intelligent player. He always seemed 
to see things before they happened and he had enthusiasm and great work ethic 
and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then after meeting with him, I was even more impressed. That reinforced 
everything I thought about him. He detailed his organization in a practice, 
what his areas of emphasis would be, going through each player on our roster 
and saying how he would use their strengths and hide their weaknesses. I had a 
real good idea what he wanted to do with the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks thought he might accept their offer, and Johnson admits he came 
close before deciding to keep pursuit of ownership as his No. 1 priority. So he 
heads into the debut tonight and a 16-game test run before deciding on his 
future with only one prior run as a bench coach, with his barnstorming team 
that has played around the world and against CBA opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference. The likes of Mike Dunleavy, Karl and Lenny Wilkens, all 
counterparts within the first eight days of his reign, were not on the other 
side in Grand Rapids or Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried because there's already a lot of bad coaches, so I'll just 
join the rest of them," Johnson said. "What's the difference? Might as well 
give me a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about that at all. The difference is, I played and I know the 
game. The players have got to play. I don't care how good a coach you are, it's 
the players who get the job done. You've just got to prepare them and hopefully 
they will execute, they will play defense, on an on. I'm going to get them out 
there, I'm going to prepare them. I'll guarantee you this: whether we win or 
lose, they will be better players at the end of the season. I guarantee you 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having my tour and coaching and playing, I had to draw the plays up, I had to 
make decisions before games, I had to diagram plays in the timeouts, that whole 
thing. I feel good about this, the fact that I think I can do this. Now, I'm 
not going to sit here and tell you that tomorrow I'll be a great coach or 
anything. I know that anything takes time and you have to work at it. I talked 
to Pat Riley already. I will use Jerry West's expertise, I will use Bill 
Sharman. I'm going to use people around me and ask them what it takes to be a 
good coach. I don't have all the answers. I do know what it takes to win and 
what it takes to be a good basketball player, and that's hard work. You have to 
go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight.

NEW OWNER, NEW OPTIMISM; COMMITMENT TO MAKE ORIOLES A WINNER COULD MEAN 
MERRIMENT IN MARYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The impact on the Baltimore Orioles of the free-agent spending spree by new 
owner Peter Angelos is best measured, perhaps, in the clubhouse corner occupied 
here by Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oriole shortstop will start the 1994 season only 233 games shy of Lou 
Gehrig's record streak, but it's as if that has become a forgotten subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to downplay the streak, but I haven't even had to work at 
that this spring," Ripken said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very refreshing. The focus has been on the team, and that's the way it 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
 The team? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need any surprises to win," Manager John Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need two or three guys having career years. We only need them to do 
what they do normally." 
</P>
<P>
 Oates isn't predicting an American League East title. He is only saying the 
Orioles have the capability in one of the toughest and most competitive of the 
realigned divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want our players or fans thinking there's a correlation between money 
spent and games won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously have a better chance now, but you still have to do it between 
the lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos put it on the line when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 A hometown attorney who amassed a fortune litigating lawsuits on behalf of 
workers exposed to asbestos, he saved the Orioles from absentee ownership when 
creditors and the courts forced a bankrupt Eli Jacobs to auction the club last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos and his group, which includes novelist Tom Clancy, tennis player Pam 
Shriver and sportscaster Jim McKay, paid a record $173 million for the team, 
then committed $42.85 million to free agents Rafael Palmeiro, Chris Sabo, Sid 
Fernandez and Lee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 That commitment doesn't include the three-year, $10.25-million contract given 
outfielder Brady Anderson, the $1.8 million used to retain designated hitter 
Harold Baines, or the more modest signings of three other free agents, relief 
pitcher Mark Eichhorn, infielder Rene Gonzales and outfielder Henry Cotto. 
</P>
<P>
 While baseball's owners are trying to negotiate a salary cap with the players 
union, the Baltimore payroll has risen from $28 million to more than $40 
million, with the owner willing to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do what we need to do," Angelos said. "I mean, we'd like to stay within 
certain parameters at this point, but we're not going to be restricted by 
arbitrary limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can take an extra step to make the Orioles as competitive as possible, 
we're not going to back off and say, 'We have a budget and we have to stick to 
it.' That's what was happening to the club before, but it's not our intent to 
shrink from those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 To Angelos, who put up more than $40 million of the purchase price, or about 
$20 million more than Clancy, the next-largest of the 20 investors, the new 
approach is a pay-back for fan support at Camden Yards.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles have drawn 3.5 million and 3.6 million in their two seasons at 
Camden Yards, selling out 71 of 80 dates last year, and expect to draw 3.8 
million in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated net profit of between $25 million and $30 million in each of 
the last two years, $173 million seems to be a long-term bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fan support is beyond words," Angelos said. "If we had enough seats, we'd 
surpass every other club.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our expenditures were long overdue in light of the fan support and rather 
meager compared to the expenditures of other clubs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had some catching up to do, that the previous ownership had not 
done all it could to repay the fans, to give them what they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to operate major league baseball in Maryland in a different way. 
We're committed to making the club as competitive as possible, and that's what 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles finished third in each of their first two years at Camden Yards, 
winning 89 and 85 games, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 They were still alive in September of last season despite losing the injured 
Mike Mussina, Mike Devereaux and Gregg Olson, but their only late-season pickup 
was the 37-year-old Lonnie Smith, who batted .208 in 24 at-bats. Not exactly 
Fred McGriff or Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I'm talking about," Angelos said. "You had a club in the race, 
but management didn't respond. The fans deserved more." 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner huddled with Oates and General Manager Roland Hemond soon after 
taking over and basically said, "What do you want? What do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Hemond put it: "He said he wanted to bring a championship to Baltimore, 
and he's backed it up. I mean, it was the ideal time to make moves because we 
were relatively close. We were adding to a foundation and not rebuilding." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary need, Oates and Hemond agreed, was greater production at the 
infield corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabo, who drove in 82 runs for the Cincinnati Reds last season, 
</P>
<P>
 ultimately rejected a multiyear offer by the New York Mets to accept a 
one-year, $2-million contract with the Orioles "because they give me a better 
chance to win immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro, who had 37 homers and drove in 105 runs with the Texas Rangers, 
agreed to a five-year, $30.35-million contract with the Orioles after Angelos 
had pulled the club out of negotiations with Will Clark.  
</P>
<P>
 Clark then signed quickly with the Rangers, which left Palmeiro embittered at 
both Clark and his former team and basically with no other offer than a 
two-year, $10-million bid from the Mets when Angelos topped it significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way of really knowing if he had other offers," Hemond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he was talking to several teams and faced the risk of coming up 
empty, had he signed with one of them. Peter said, 'Let's go. Let's get him,' 
and you have to admire that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's believed, however, that Hemond and others in the baseball end of the 
Orioles' operation would have preferred Clark, although Hemond now says 
Palmeiro was always their No. 1 objective and they pursued Clark only because 
they were certain Palmeiro would return to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos put it another way, saying he pulled out of the Clark talks because he 
wasn't going to pay $30 million to a player whose statistics and availability 
had diminished over the last two years because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the past is prologue, there was reason to question Will's consistent 
availability on a long-term basis," Angelos said. "I also liked Palmeiro's 
statistics better. You're comparing 37 home runs to 14 (for Clark). 
</P>
<P>
 "The one guy seemed to be improving while the other was declining." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, almost six months later, Palmeiro can still fill a notebook with his 
complaints about how the Rangers handled his contract talks and how Clark 
slipped in behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro clearly wanted to stay in Texas, where he is building a 
multimillion-dollar house, and it's as if $30.35 million can't erase the hurt, 
although he remembers to preface it by saying he has the deal he wanted with a 
club that has a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy here," Palmeiro insists. "Potentially, we have the best offense in 
the league. The owner promised he'd get players, and he has." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup is imposing: Anderson, center field; Devereaux, right field; 
Palmeiro, first base; Ripken, shortstop; Baines, DH; Chris Hoiles, catcher; 
Sabo, third base; Mark McLemore, second base; Jeff Hammonds, left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offense has the capability of making up for (pitching) mistakes, picking 
up the slack if need be," coach Davey Lopes said, expressing a thought Oates 
would rather not contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the hitters to start off with that frame of mind because it puts 
that much more pressure on them," the manager said while acknowledging that 
pitching depth is his major concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need our horses to take the ball on a regular turn," he said, referring to 
Mussina, Ben McDonald, Jamie Moyer and Fernandez, who got a three-year, 
$9-million contract and might sit out most of April because of shoulder 
tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited pitching market prompted Angelos and the Orioles to ignore the 
injury risk with Fernandez while citing it in their approach to Clark and 
Olson, the longtime closer who sat out 51 late-season games because of an elbow 
injury and was allowed to join the Atlanta Braves as a free agent. He was 
replaced in Baltimore by Smith, 37, who received a one-year, $1.5-million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does Angelos stop and his career baseball people begin? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always be involved in the major financial decisions, but once the 
important phase of improving the team is completed I'd expect to have minimum 
involvement," he said. "I don't need another job, that's a certainty." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Greek immigrant and tavern owner, Angelos grew up in a 
lower-to-middle-class section of East Baltimore. He attended Baltimore Law 
School at night, served one term as a city councilman and was defeated in a 
1967 bid for mayor while running on the city's first biracial ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 He has nine law offices in five states and has reportedly won damages or 
negotiated settlements totaling more than $1 billion in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also heavily involved in the bid to move the Rams to Baltimore, is 
considering a November bid for governor and is making changes at Camden Yards, 
on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He is correcting sight lines in the left-field corner by installing swivel 
seats. He is returning some of the best box seats, which Jacobs had retained 
for his closest friends, to season-ticket holders. He plans to add 1,500 seats 
next year for free use by youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lopes: "The man has sent a clear and succinct message that he'll do 
everything he can to bring a winner to Baltimore. All you can ask of an owner 
is that he's committed to giving you the personnel to win, and he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell if the Orioles can end the Toronto Blue Jays' three-year reign 
in the East, hold off the improved New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, and 
contain the high-scoring Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, who hasn't played for a division winner since 1983, looks at the 
improvement of his hometown team in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Oriole fan and Baltimore resident all my life, it's very exciting to 
see the addition of players like Palmeiro, Sabo and Fernandez to a team that 
was already very competitive, but as a player I try to curb some of that 
excitement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no secret formula for winning a pennant, or everyone would have it. 
We have to keep all of this in perspective, stay focused and go about our job 
day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is comforting, however, to know you have the support of the owner. There 
are a lot of places where that doesn't seem to be the case -- and there have 
been times that it wasn't here."

THEY PLAY IN PEORIA, BUT . . .; THE PADRES HAVE THE CHEAPEST ROSTER IN BASEBALL 
-- AND THEY ALSO HAVE VETERANS SUCH AS GWYNN, WHOSE LEADERSHIP MIGHT BRING SOME 
TALENTED UNKNOWNS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A San Diego Padre television promo that Tony Gwynn would love to see late this 
summer: 
</P>
<P>
 " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, dressed in Giant and Dodger uniforms, 
are looking at a posse of Padres hot on their heels. Bewildered and frightened, 
they ask, 'Who are those guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe, by the end of the season, people will know who we are," Gwynn says, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one huge maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the luxury of their new spring-training facility in this suburb of 
Phoenix -- an appropriate locale for a team trying to rise from the ashes -- 
the Padres dare to dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget they lost 101 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the distractions caused by ownership's fire sale of big contracts and 
big names. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that what most of these kids know about winning in the big leagues can 
be written inside a matchbook.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Manager Jim Riggleman says he feels good about the direction the club is 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a really nice core of young people who are already good players," 
Gwynn said. "And I think a lot of guys learned something last year. They 
learned you can put blinders on and still play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these guys were here for at least part of the year and they know what 
it's like to come to the park every day and answer questions about what's 
happening to the club. With guys getting traded every other day, rumors every 
day and all the negativism flowing through the place, it's absolutely amazing 
some of these kids did what they did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn put in his .358 worth and the Padres had the third-highest run total in 
club history. But they also had poor starting pitching except for Andy Benes 
and played dreadful defense. As a result, no San Diego team in the last two 
decades has lost as many games . . . or as many fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff. Gary Sheffield. Greg Harris. Management made the trades, 
reducing the payroll to less than $14 million, by far the lowest in baseball, 
and turned Jack Murphy Stadium into a lonely place. 
</P>
<P>
 And ownership -- a group of 15 millionaires -- isn't doing much to help. One 
minority owner spent the first week of spring training in full uniform until he 
was noticed strolling across the infield while outfielder Phil Plantier, who 
had 34 homers and 100 runs batted in last season, was sending rockets out of 
the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Majority owner Tom Werner points out that they did sign Gwynn, whose average 
exceeded .300 for the 11th consecutive season, for four more years. They signed 
free agent Bip Roberts, who fills a void at the leadoff spot. And they still 
have Benes, who is only 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner appears to be banking on a revenue-sharing plan and salary cap coming 
out of collective bargaining with the players. He says the Padres won't be able 
to achieve success the "Toronto way" and will have to do it the "Montreal way." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans aren't convinced. The Padres have sold fewer than 3,000 season 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Peoria, however, they are trying hard to believe in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're young and we're going to make mistakes," says Benes, who gave up two or 
fewer runs in 17 of his 34 starts last season and ended up 15-15. "But you 
can't get experience unless you play, and we hope some of the lumps we took 
last year will pay off in a positive way down the road. So throwing these 
talented young guys in the fire has its benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's list of well-known players ends with Gwynn and Benes. After that, 
you can't tell the Padres without a scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
 The outfield is the foundation, where Gwynn and Plantier are joined by Derek 
Bell, who hit 21 homers last season and is impressing teammates this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego figures to be set for a long time at shortstop, where 23-year-old 
Ricky Gutierrez hit .251 and ranked fourth defensively among National League 
shortstops as a rookie last season, and catcher, where Brad Ausmus hit five 
homers and batted .256 in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is clearly a plus at second and in the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is out on Archi Cianfrocco at third and Dave Staton at first, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggleman has made it clear that both will have to swing the bat to keep their 
jobs because neither has the skills to improve San Diego's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Staton, who played at Tustin High, Orange Coast College and Cal State 
Fullerton, hit one home run in every eight at-bats when he came up last 
September. His first big league hit was a second-deck shot against the Dodgers' 
Kevin Gross and his first at-bat this spring yielded a tape-measure homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cianfrocco had 11 home runs and 47 RBIs in 84 games last season after coming 
over in a trade with Montreal in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the rest of the rotation after Benes. Their No. 2 starter is 
Wally Whitehurst, who started last season on the disabled list, twice was 
knocked out of games by line drives, was put back on the disabled list after 
the All-Star break, then came off and went back on a again, both times because 
of rotator-cuff problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come down to how our starters do," Benes said. "We've got a 
pretty good bullpen with Gene Harris and Trevor Hoffman, but we can't go out 
there and have starters throw three or four innings 40% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope somebody in our organization decided to dump salaries because they saw 
(realignment) coming," Gwynn said. "We're in a four-team division and one 
happens to be an expansion club, so anything can happen. Maybe it will only 
take 81 wins to win the West this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is for a lot of these young guys to take it to another step. And 
we've got some veterans here who know how to help young players, to help bring 
out whatever needs to be brought out." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in '91 and returned as a free 
agent this winter, sounds more tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like it's my job to not only lead by example, but remain positive 
through negative times," he said. "It's going to be a new adventure for me, 
though, because I've always been surrounded by proven talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Days I go 0 for 4 or 0 for 5, I've got to stay positive. It's going to be a 
challenge for me, but I think I'm up for the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Gwynn is looking past the distractions of '93 and forward to 
the challenge of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude has been really good this spring because we haven't had to deal 
with all that stuff," he said. "All we've had to deal with is going out there 
and trying to improve. To see the way the kids are working this spring, that's 
very encouraging for an old guy like me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the difference this year is that guys have come to realize that it's 
all on our shoulders. Now, it all comes down to wins and losses and if we start 
accumulating losses, man, last year will come flying back in our faces. And if 
we are going to turn it around, it isn't going to be the manager or the GM or 
the owners, it's going to be the guys in this clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever they are.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA WOMEN'S TOURNAMENTS; SAN BERNARDINO DOESN'T HAVE 
ENOUGH IN RESERVE IN DIVISION II FINAL, 89-56

 Darci Steere had 32 points and 17 rebounds as North Dakota State defeated 
undermanned Cal State San Bernardino, 89-56, Saturday night at Fargo, N.D., to 
win its second consecutive NCAA Division II women's basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino (29-4) started the game with only eight players, and lost two 
more to fouls early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino's Tammie Beckley suffered an injured right knee and leading 
scorer Kim Young limped off the floor with a twisted ankle, but returned when 
Beckley chased a loose ball into a table on the sidelines and had to be carried 
off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Chery'll Few led San Bernardino, which moved up from Division III in 1991 and 
was playing in its first NCAA Division II tournament, with 25 points.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; IMPATIENCE HURT MISSOURI, COACH SAYS; 
WEST REGIONAL: STEWART CITES POOR SHOT SELECTION FOR THE TIGERS' 29-FOR-83 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The box score told the story of why Missouri's dream season ended with a 
20-point nightmare loss to Arizona on Saturday in the NCAA West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four missed shots out of 83 attempts. Twenty-six misfired three-pointers 
out of 33 tries. Twenty-seven fouls and 12 turnovers. Arizona's starting 
three-guard backcourt with 67 points compared to Missouri's two guards with 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably a combination of both (poor outside shooting and Arizona's 
defense)," Missouri Coach Norm Stewart said. "But I would say it was a little 
more of a lack of patience. I don't think we were tense, but really not in sync 
and we didn't give ourselves a chance to get in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took 83 shots, but obviously a lot weren't good ones." 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching the regional final by winning 18 of its last 19 games, thanks 
to timely perimeter shooting and strong team defense, Missouri (28-4) had a 
December flashback against the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of playing their best game of the season to gain a berth in the Final 
Four, the Tigers played like the team that lost by 52 points to Arkansas more 
than three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri led only once against the Wildcats, at 11-9 six minutes into the game 
on a three-point basket by Melvin Booker. The lead lasted only 18 seconds as 
Arizona outscored the Tigers, 14-3, over the next three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get the ball in the hole early," Stewart said. "We missed easy 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which has made a practice this year of not losing early leads, made 
things difficult for a Missouri comeback by answering every brief scoring run 
by the Tigers with one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 With Damon Stoudamire scoring 18 points from the outside and getting several 
key rebounds, the Wildcats took a 48-34 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Missouri is a team we felt didn't get back well on defense," Stoudamire said. 
"Therefore, if we got the rebound, we felt we could definitely push the break, 
especially if one of the guards got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri had a chance to rally at the start of the second half when Arizona 
missed 16 of its first 21 shots, but the Tigers had their own share of scoring 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 With reserve Paul O'Liney scoring five consecutive points, Missouri cut the 
Wildcats' lead to 52-44 with 15 minutes remaining. Arizona then answered with 
six consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second half, they didn't shoot the ball very well starting off," 
Booker said. "We came out and got it down to like eight points. But we couldn't 
make the key plays to bring it down enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers had hoped to get Booker, their leading scorer, free for some easy 
shots in the second half, but Arizona's Reggie Geary wouldn't allow him to 
break free. 
</P>
<P>
 Geary, a sophomore from Santa Ana Mater Dei High, harassed and annoyed Booker 
all game as he limited him to five-of-12 shooting for only 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a real good job," Booker said. "He was very aggressive and he also was 
very quick. I had trouble trying to penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
 The only player who was having any type of offensive success against Arizona 
was center Jevon Crudup with 14 points, but he battled foul trouble for most of 
the game before fouling out with 7:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Crudup sat down, Arizona fans began to chant "Final Four," while Missouri 
followers could only think back to the Tigers' 15-game regular-season winning 
streak and 14-0 Big Eight Conference record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the season on the whole was a great one," Missouri senior Lamont 
Frazier said. "We accomplished quite a lot from the beginning of the year. This 
was something we looked forward to all year. Right now, we have nothing to be 
ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
 And you can bet that the Tigers will be rooting for Arizona in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that they do well," Stewart said. "If they can get guard play and 
handle the pressure, which would appear that they could, they'd have a good 
chance."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; EAST REGIONAL; BOSTON COLLEGE, FLORIDA 
ARE STILL STANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the NCAA East Regional gone as planned, America would have spent today 
overdosing on Dean Smith anecdotes or trying to understand a single word spoken 
by Connecticut's Jim Calhoun, whose New England accent is as thick as a bowl of 
chowder. At the very worst, there would have been Indiana's Bob Knight, who 
would have done nicely in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the legends and near-legends are gone, replaced in today's regional 
final by one guy who still fears for his job and another guy whose program 
needs a note of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the NCAA office pool nightmare: No. 9-seeded Boston College vs. No. 
3 Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the Gators' high seeding fool you. Other than Coach Lon Kruger and 
immediate family members, almost nobody thought Florida would do the Star Trek 
thing and go where no Gator team has gone before. But here they are, a victory 
away from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people had UConn vs. North Carolina . . . Donyell Marshall 
vs. Dean Smith," said Florida center Andrew DeCler. 
</P>
<P>
 That would have made sense. The No. 1 Tar Heels against the No. 2 Huskies. 
Logical. Probable. A good TV matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Florida and Boston College crashed the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators, your basic unknown outside Gainesville and the Southeastern 
Conference, squirmed past James Madison by two points, beat Pennsylvania by 12 
and then defeated Connecticut in overtime last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were trying to hype up UConn, but we play better teams than UConn," 
Florida guard Dan Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 All Connecticut did, of course, was win the Big East Conference by three 
games, outscore its opponents by an average of 17 points and feature one of the 
best five players in the country, the aforementioned Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw who we had to beat," said Cross. "I saw the pairings. I think once you 
make it this far, everybody's No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Coach Jim O'Brien's Boston College team was busy beating Washington 
State, shocking North Carolina and disposing of Indiana. Not bad for a coach 
who said he won't feel totally secure until he signs a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
 So here you have it, the clash of the unknowns. One writer here mockingly 
referred to the meeting, the first ever between the two schools on a basketball 
court, as "something you'd expect in the Hall of Fame Bowl, not the Final 
Eight." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, said the Eagles and Gators. Like it or not, the Final Four is going 
to get one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have filled out (an office pool bracket), I would have had to put 
us all the way to the championship game," DeClercq said. "You have to think 
positive thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Any more positive thoughts and the Gators (28-7) will be picking out Final 
Four championship rings. The same goes for Boston College's players, who have 
quit trying to explain how any of this happened. They play. They win. What's 
there to understand? 
</P>
<P>
 So confident are the Eagles (22-10), that they didn't exactly rush home to 
their TV sets Friday evening to watch the Connecticut-Florida contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only saw the last three seconds of the game," Eagle center Bill Curley 
said. "I really didn't care who won. Our focus is on getting to the Final Four, 
and we don't count on ending our careers here, but so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 This might not be the most glamorous matchup of the day, but it will be the 
loudest. Seismic equipment in California might even record the shock waves 
created when Gator forward Dametri Hill and Eagle forward Danya Abrams meet in 
the paint. Hill is 6-7, 286 pounds ( down from 350) and Abrams is 6-7, 265 
pounds. At least that's what it says in the respective media guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if when they start posting up if there's going to be a whole lot 
of room in there for anyone else," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley will find a way to sneak in. He had better or Boston College could be 
in trouble. Curley, the Eagles' leading scorer and rebounder, averages 20.0 
points and 9.0 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Gators and Eagles are remarkably similar. Both teams feature 
World Wrestling Federation-sized forwards in Abrams and Hill. Both teams 
feature one other inside player, Curley for Boston College and DeCler for 
Florida. Both teams feature very good perimeter attacks. The Eagles have Gerrod 
Abram, Howard Eisley and Malcolm Huckaby, the Gators have Dan Cross and Craig 
Brown. Both teams play solid defense. And both teams were ignored at 
tournament's beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand where people are coming from, because there's no big name on 
this team," said DeClercq, who easily could have been speaking about the 
Eagles. "We don't have a Donyell Marshall, a Jason Kidd, a Glenn Robinson -- 
the marquee names. But we find a way to win every time we come out on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 So this isn't Carolina-Connecticut, or Deano waxing poetic about his days 
coaching Air Jordan, or Knight fielding questions about his burial preferences. 
Then again, there's something to be said for the unpredictable. Just ask two of 
the best, Boston College and Florida.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; HE'S NO BO, BUT THIS JACKSON IS READY TO GO FOR WHITE 
SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has overcome Graves' disease and testicular cancer, and he was exposed to 
Air Jordan this spring, but showed no signs of an allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the carnival that was Michael Jordan's right field tryout with 
the Chicago White Sox, Darrin Jackson solidified his hold on that position -- 
and the chance to follow Bo Jackson as the club's second consecutive comeback 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a career year," the former first-round draft choice from 
Culver City High said. "I feel better than I've ever felt physically and feel I 
can surpass anything I've done before. It didn't seem that long ago that I 
couldn't be sure where I was headed physically or what my baseball future was." 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered strictly a defensive standout with the Chicago Cubs, Jackson 
blossomed offensively for the San Diego Padres while getting the chance to play 
regularly in 1991 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit 21 home runs and drove in 49 runs in 122 games in '91, then had 17 
homers and 70 RBIs in 155 games in '92, which put him in position to be awarded 
a $2.1-million salary for 1993 in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was too rich for Padre owner Tom Werner, who wouldn't know 
the Baseball Register from a cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 With the commissioner's chair empty, Werner continued to break up the Padres 
last March when he dealt Jackson to the Toronto Blue Jays for Derek Bell and 
Stoney Briggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated leaving San Diego, where so many members of the family could see me 
play, but I was getting the chance to play left field for the world champions," 
Jackson said. "It was a great opportunity. Unfortunately, the season turned 
into a nightmare. I was too sick and too weak to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson contacted food poisoning near the end of spring training but began to 
suspect something more as he continued to lose weight and endured a battery of 
inconclusive tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped 15 to 20 pounds, my heart rate was elevated and I became sensitive 
to heat," he said. "I'd stand in the batter's box and my hands and legs would 
be shaking so badly it was difficult even to grasp the bat or make my way to 
the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 He was batting .216 when the Toronto opportunity disintegrated. On June 11, he 
was traded to the New York Mets for Tony Fernandez. By that time, the name on 
the uniform didn't matter. Jackson wasn't sure he'd be able to go on wearing 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the All-Star break I couldn't take anymore," he said. "I mean, it took 
three months of 'What the heck's wrong?' before anyone recognized what was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets' first trip of the second half went to San Francisco, where the 
Giants' team doctor walked in, listened to the symptoms and told Jackson it 
sounded like hypothyroidism or Graves' disease, an opinion confirmed by tests 
at Scripps Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was put on radioactive iodine, taking 10 pills a day, which ultimately 
killed off the thyroid altogether, he said. His weight began going the other 
way, soaring in time to more than 20 pounds over his normal 195. 
</P>
<P>
 He was put on the disabled list for the first time in his career in August, 
ultimately finishing with a .195 average in 87 at-bats with the Mets. He became 
a free agent when the Mets, uncertain he would recover, failed to tender him a 
contract because it could only include a 20% cut to $1.68 million. Too big a 
risk, they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson returned to his home in Mesa, Ariz., unsure of his marketability, but 
hired a personal trainer and began to lift weights again. His medicine was 
eventually adjusted to a proper level, and Jackson told agent Alan Meersand he 
would do whatever a club asked to prove he was healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted an opportunity to go to spring training," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Meersand: "There were a lot of teams interested, but there was a general 
lack of knowledge about his condition. Most clubs took a wait-and-see attitude. 
The White Sox were more aggressive. They called on the date of the non-tender 
by the Mets (Dec. 20) and said they wanted to be first in line. They only 
wanted Darrin to be examined by their own doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox had successfully traveled a similar route a year before, signing 
right fielder Ellis Burks, who was coming off back problems with the Boston Red 
Sox, at a comparatively bargain rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks responded with 17 home runs and 74 RBIs, turning that performance into a 
three-year, $9-million free agent's contract with the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson passed the White Sox physical and signed a $750,000 contract that can 
generate another $800,000 in incentives based on plate appearances. He also has 
a shot at postseason rewards with a club that won the American League West 
title last year and will open 1994 as the favorite in the new Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 30, is excited. He had a big spring despite the Jordan hoopla and 
also is confident he can resume his career after a serious illness because he 
has done it before. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen days after being called up by the Cubs in September of 1987, he had 
surgery for the removal of a testicular tumor, then had a second operation for 
precautionary removal of lymph nodes from his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was back playing in '88. He had five years of follow-up examinations, 
but did not require the precautionary radiation treatments Philadelphia first 
baseman John Kruk is undergoing after his surgery for the removal of a 
testicular tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he hopes to visit Kruk or, at least, get a message to him.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell him that I went through the same thing and am still playing 
the game I love," Jackson said. "I'd tell him to relax, take his time and not 
hurry back." 
</P>
<P>
 There are ways to make life better, and Jackson and his wife, Darleen, are 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the last two years, they have sponsored a Read to Win program in 
the fourth grades of three racially diverse schools in Inglewood, Mesa and 
Portland, Ore., where Darleen's nephew is a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Students get a prize for each book read, and teachers are compensated for 
extra time given to the project. The student credited with the most books last 
year received a trip to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been involved in drug programs, and it's just something that evolved," 
Jackson said. "My wife and I have paid for everything ourselves, and at this 
point we're taking a year off to try and reorganize the foundation to generate 
broader funding." 
</P>
<P>
 With his career on track again, a healthy Jackson is hoping to reach the 
contract incentives that will make it easier to provide incentives in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox went to spring training with only two question marks in their 
regular lineup. Jackson has taken care of one, and designated hitter Julio 
Franco the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere, who won 12 games as a rookie, and an equally promising Scott 
Ruffcorn will join Jack McDowell, Alex Fernandez and Wilson Alvarez in a 
rotation deeper than anything in the Central -- or anywhere west of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, unable to get a multiyear contract again, still isn't the happiest 
camper, but Black Jack is at his best when he's growling.  
</P>
<P>
 McDowell makes it clear, though, that he intends to be elsewhere next year. He 
made $4 million in 1993, sought $6.5 million in arbitration and was awarded the 
club's figure of $5.3 million, an arbitration record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough for me to sit here, making $5 million, and be able to explain to 
everybody the seven years of dealings I've had with the White Sox, but it 
hasn't been very comfortable," McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't too many guys who have had a contract history with their club 
like I've had, particularly when you consider what I've contributed on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been persistent rumors that the White Sox might trade McDowell 
rather than getting only a draft choice as compensation if he leaves as a free 
agent, but that seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack suggested that I don't have the guts to trade him," General Manager Ron 
Schueler said. "I'd trade him, and at some point in the season I might have to, 
but not if we're in the race. We're here to win, and Jack can obviously help us 
get that done."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; SO FAR, MONDESI HAS REALLY BEEN A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi, the Dodgers' unofficial opening day right fielder, had three 
singles in four at-bats against the Kansas City Royals Saturday at Haines City, 
increasing his batting average to .341.  
</P>
<P>
 His ability to hit has been noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually you can throw fastballs by hitters in the spring,"Bret Saberhagen of 
the New York Mets said. "But (mythical fastballer) Syd Finch couldn't throw a 
fastball past Mondesi. He's got some quick hands, Mondesi." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Manager Tom Lasorda has gone to great lengths not to publicly award 
Mondesi the starting job over last season's starter, Cory Snyder, who has been 
injured all spring, Mondesi sounds ready to assume the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got more confidence," Mondesi said. "They told me two months ago in the 
Dominican that I could win the job. That gave me confidence. I do the job, they 
have to give me a chance, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lasorda: "I told him he could win the job -- maybe he didn't understand 
my Spanish. I told him the way our outfield was shaping up, he'd have a real 
chance. Before, it was a little bit different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio, whom Lasorda has said is behind schedule, made his second start 
of the spring and gave up a three-run home run to Mike Macfarlane in the first 
inning, keying the Royals' 5-3 victory. Astacio gave up four earned runs, 
walked five and threw two wild pitches in five innings. His earned-run average 
is 8.00. Lasorda said that of the five projected starters, Kevin Gross is also 
behind schedule. TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; IT'S OFFICIAL: PEREZ IS THE FIRST BASEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Angels have decided that Eduardo Perez will be their starting first 
baseman, and barring any trades, could open the season with first baseman J.T. 
Snow at triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a viable option," General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but nothing's been 
decided." 
</P>
<P>
 The simple reason for Snow's possible demotion is that they want Perez to play 
first base instead of left field because of his tender elbow. They could keep 
Snow on the bench as a defensive specialist, but the Angels are worried his 
skills would diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still cannot foresee opening the season with J.T. and (left fielder) Dwight 
Smith," Manager Buck Rodgers said before the Angels' 13-3 loss to the Milwaukee 
Brewers. "We just cannot get enough at-bats for everybody at this point. We 
have to do something. We have a lot of options, and a trade is not the only 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was on the verge of being traded Friday to the New York Mets for starter 
Anthony Young until Bavasi changed his mind. The trade was postponed, and if 
Young is not traded before Tuesday, the Angels will be on hand to scout him 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 They have no other viable trade options for Snow or Smith. To maintain Snow's 
trade value, the Angels believe it might be best if he plays every day in 
Vancouver rather than sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The club also decided that second baseman Kevin Flora is not ready to play in 
the big leagues and optioned him to Vancouver. The Angels also are expected to 
option Russ Springer to Vancouver and will try to convert him into a bullpen 
stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who are willing to trade Springer (0-2, 14.34 ERA), will 
immediately begin their pursuit of a utility infielder who can start at second. 
They are focusing their attention on infielders Jose Vizcaino, Jose Hernandez 
and Rey Sanchez of the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not expend a fortune, or commit to anything longer than a one-year 
contract," Bavasi said, "because we still believe Kevin is our second baseman 
of the future. But we will look for an infielder." 
</P>

 Rookie Brian Anderson received a phone call Saturday morning from pitching 
coach Chuck Hernandez telling him he might pitch at their minor league camp. "I 
thought, 'Well, I'm gone,' " Anderson said. "I wonder why they just don't come 
out and tell me?" Hernandez, however, simply was informing Anderson that Tempe 
Diablo Stadium might be too wet.  
</P>
<P>
 When Anderson arrived at the park, was reassured that he had not been cut, and 
proved a few hours later that he might be staying. Anderson pitched three 
hitless innings and immediately becomes the front-runner for the fifth spot in 
the starting rotation. "If it was up to me, yeah, I'd say I belong on the 
team," Anderson said. "I know I can pitch up here, and after being around these 
guys, I feel I belong." BOB NIGHTENGALE

QUESTION MARKS PUNCTUATE RAMS' STORMY OFF-SEASON; ANALYSIS: QUARTERBACK 
SITUATION MIGHT BE SOLVED, BUT THERE STILL ARE THE ISSUES OF FREE-AGENT LINEMEN 
AND THE DRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Rams were painting yardage markers on their practice field Friday, 
seemingly oblivious to a city request they must soon vacate the premises, in 
order to provide a proper setting for quarterback Chris Miller's workout debut 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has undergone surgery on his left knee twice in the last two 
years, has received medical clearance to practice without limitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been fitted with a knee brace, he's ahead of schedule in his 
rehabilitation, and doctors have told him he's ready to go," said Joe Vitt, Ram 
assistant head coach. "Obviously, if he can stay healthy, and we think he can, 
he gives us a great chance to be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks into free agency, one month away from the draft, a year before they 
might leave town, the Rams have shown an interest in improving. But so many 
questions remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Miller's knee hold up? Why did the Rams spend $7.7 million to sign Jimmie 
Jones, a backup Cowboy defensive tackle? Who is Kevin Donnalley, why was he so 
important to the Rams, and why did they lose him? Jim Everett was only worth a 
seventh-round pick in 1995? Do the Rams still try to move forward in the draft 
to get quarterback Heath Shuler or Trent Dilfer? Do they trade down in Round 1, 
pick up an extra draft choice and select USC wide receiver Johnnie Morton? Will 
they lose anyone in free agency? Will they attempt to sign Houston receiver 
Haywood Jeffires? Are they still looking to sign players via free agency? FREE 
AGENCY 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams opened aggressively. They signed Jones, found a quarterback without 
having to surrender draft picks and were in position to finish strongly with 
the addition of Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers matched the $4.1-million offer for Donnalley, who was going to 
be the Rams' starting left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams blew it. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff identified Donnalley as a big-time player for years to come 
and just the right man to protect Miller's blindside against the league's best 
quarterback muggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Warned ahead of time that Houston intended to match the Rams' offer unless the 
Rams made it prohibitive, with a huge base salary, the Rams opted instead to 
make a conventional offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting an offer that would cost us $1.5 million to $1.7 million 
under the salary cap, and it would have been tough to match," a Houston 
official said. "When the Rams offered a $950,000 cap number, there was no doubt 
we were going to match." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were extremely disappointed in the play of Irv Eatman at left tackle 
last season and will bring back Jackie Slater at right tackle only if he takes 
a substantial pay cut. That leaves Darryl Ashmore and an ambulance on call to 
cart off Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our organization probably spent more man hours on Donnalley than any one we 
have looked at in free agency," Vitt said. "He's a young kid, productive, and 
he had shut down some damn good ends last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big disappointment to lose him, and we all feel terrible, but we've 
got to move on. That's the difference this year; we're prepared if something 
like this happens, and we'll move on. The thing is, we tried to get something 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing opinion around the league is that the Rams overpaid Jones, a 
6-foot-4, 276-pound defensive tackle, to gain his signature, but they were 
determined to not let him escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can say we overpaid him until we see what he's done at 
the end of the year," Vitt said. "If he puts tremendous numbers up (sacks, 
tackles), all of a sudden people will be saying he was a steal. We thought the 
bidding would go higher if we didn't do the deal at that time, and we wanted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we play an opponent, the plan is stop Sean Gilbert. They 
double-team him with the center, which leaves a guard one on one with our other 
defensive tackle. To be successful, we needed an athletic pass rusher who could 
play inside next to Sean. Sean will have a great year, but Jimmie Jones could 
have better numbers because he will get more one-on-one situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The knock on Jones in Dallas was that he was not motivated and didn't work as 
hard as Coach Jimmy Johnson demanded, but the Rams say they have done their 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was what they said about Cortez Kennedy when we drafted him in Seattle," 
Vitt said. "We talked to the kid, and he eased any concerns we might have had. 
He will be working with (defensive coordinator) George Dyer, and George gets 
the best out of players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams went after Jones as soon as the free-agent market opened. They felt 
the same about Miami quarterback Scott Mitchell, but they also had a plan. They 
wanted to be aggressive, but they wanted to be sure about their selections, and 
while Jones impressed them in meetings, Mitchell did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitchell was our No. 1-rated guy going into this thing," Vitt said. "But when 
we brought him in, we found out his shoulder was worse off than Miller's knee. 
Mitchell wasn't going to be able to throw for another month, and he hadn't 
started the rehab process yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who was recovering from arthroscopic shoulder surgery, could not 
work out for the Rams. Miller, who was coming off arthroscopic knee surgery, 
threw for the Rams' benefit and immediately caught the team's fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miller's been productive, he's one of the most accurate passers in the game, 
he has the ability to throw a great long ball, he has leadership skills, and 
all it cost us was money to get him," Vitt said. "It's a calculated risk, but 
look at what was out there. We had obvious interest in Warren Moon, but Houston 
never got back to us. We would have had to give up a high pick for him, too." 
</P>
<P>
 If Miller stays healthy, the Rams probably will gain attention for making the 
best move available in free agency. Miller was on his way to becoming one of 
the game's best quarterbacks before being injured, and the Rams acquired him 
without giving up a player or draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Rams have a quarterback, they must find players to catch the 
ball. They traded a fourth-round pick in the 1995 draft to San Diego for wide 
receiver Nate Lewis, but they regard Lewis as a No. 3 receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams do not expect to re-sign Henry Ellard and have talked about trading 
Flipper Anderson, if that's what it takes to sign a player such as Jeffires. 
Jeffires has made it known he prefers returning to Houston, but his salary 
demands make it impossible for him to fit under the Oilers' salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are also very interested in Indianapolis receiver Clarence Verdin and 
New England receiver Greg McMurtry to complement Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has until July 15 to sign unrestricted free agents and still might 
sign additional players for their secondary, such as Kansas City safety Martin 
Bayless, Jet cornerback Clifford Hicks or released Cleveland cornerback Terry 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 They will continue to look for an offensive tackle, too, beginning with 
Miami's Mark Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams lost safety Michael Stewart to the Dolphins, and the Oilers have made 
a pitch for tight end Pat Carter, who is coming off shoulder surgery. Slater 
will visit Atlanta this week, and safety Pat Terrell is trying to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But their best unsigned players (defensive end Robert Young and linebacker 
Roman Phifer) are restricted free agents, will stay with the Rams and will 
receive handsome raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Cleveland Gary is a free agent, but the Rams have the option of 
matching an offer for him. They will keep Gary because they intend to run the 
ball and will require a top-notch backup for Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody can fill all their critical needs through free agency," 
said Vitt, who was assigned the duty of organizing the Rams' free-agency plans. 
"We've done some things already, but we've only won 11 games in two years so I 
don't think we can sit back and feel good about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Knox and (Senior Vice President) Jay Zygmunt did a great job of mapping 
this out, and we have been right on top of things. We still have that sense of 
urgency to improve our personnel, but now the salary cap enters the picture. 
Now decisions are made with a calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've proven here we know how to draft -- our No. 1 picks the last two years 
have been in the Pro Bowl -- so now it's a matter of doing the right thing all 
the way to July 15 with free agency." THE DRAFT 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have the fifth pick in the first round and a pair of selections in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not intend to trade forward to position themselves to take a 
quarterback, but they do have their eye on one in Round 2. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also not ruled out trying to sign Kansas City's Dave Krieg or 
Phoenix's Chris Chandler later this summer to back up Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams want a wide receiver in the draft, and because none are projected to 
be taken among the first 10 picks, there is a strong possibility of the Rams 
moving backward in Round 1. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a consensus among NFL observers that the first four players 
to be selected in this year's draft will be, in no particular order: San Diego 
State running back Marshall Faulk, Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler, Fresno 
State quarterback Trent Dilfer and Ohio State defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama cornerback Antonio Langham is considered the next-best selection, with 
Notre Dame offensive guard/tackle Aaron Taylor and Nebraska linebacker Trev 
Alberts right behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like Langham but are more interested in bolstering their offense. 
They have high regard for Taylor, but Taylor has let people know he prefers to 
play guard in the pros, and the Rams need a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, I had a damn good idea for quite a while who it would be," said 
John Becker, Ram director of player personnel. "But there's not one guy that 
has just flat jumped out as the guy this year. For one thing, we're still in 
the middle of free agency and there's things to be done yet." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the quarterbacks? Aren't these two similar to the two (Drew Bledsoe 
and Rick Mirer) who drew so much attention a year ago? Can the Rams pass on the 
chance to pick one? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both will be gone before we pick," Becker said. "Most football people 
see these guys as very capable quarterbacks, and I do, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither one has Mirer's athleticism. And neither one has Bledsoe's arm 
strength. But I have been impressed with both, and if one was sitting there 
when we picked, I wouldn't be surprised if we took him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will not have a pick in the fifth round because they surrendered it 
to Phoenix to acquire wide receiver Ernie Jones last season. They will have 
three picks in the sixth, but will be without a seventh-round selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Rams had nine picks, but only Bettis (first round) made a 
significant contribution. The team still has high hopes for tight end Troy 
Drayton (second) and safety Deral Boykin (sixth), but running back Russell 
White (third) and wide receiver Sean LaChapelle (fifth) do not figure in their 
plans. THE TRADE 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day the Rams gave a fourth-round pick in the 1995 draft to acquire 
Nate Lewis, they received a seventh-round pick in the 1995 draft from New 
Orleans for Jim Everett, who is slated to be the Saints' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams knew Everett was finished a year ago at this time, but they lacked 
the guts to trade him and start anew. John Shaw, the team's executive vice 
president, went so far as to suggest moving forward in the draft in an effort 
to land Bledsoe, but others were more interested at the time in running back 
Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams stuck with Everett, and now they have a seventh-round pick in next 
year's draft to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, meanwhile, will be pitching for the Saints, and according to 
associates still with the Rams, he telephoned recently and told them that he 
doesn't care if he's deathly sick or seriously injured, he will be there to 
play the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, things are looking up for the Rams, but short of playing an 
Everett-led team every week of the season, it remains to be seen if they have 
done their off-season homework well.

A 7-4 LEAP BY FISCHER IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS; TRACK AND FIELD: CAMARILLO SENIOR 
SETS AREA MARK, MOVES TO EIGHTH PLACE ON ALL-TIME HIGH SCHOOL LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Dennis Riedmiller talked the talk and Jeremy Fischer walked the walk in the 
Santa Barbara Easter Relays on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riedmiller, Fischer's coach at Camarillo High, had predicted all season that 
his senior phenom would high-jump 7 feet 4 inches in the meet at Santa Barbara 
City College -- one of his favorite places -- and Fischer didn't let his coach 
down by clearing the height on his second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was definitely shooting for 7-4 coming in here," said Fischer, who is 5 
feet 10, 155 pounds. "I jumped 7-1 here last year and I just missed at 7-3 so I 
figured I could make that height. I just love jumping here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-4 clearance raised Fischer's Ventura County record by an inch, surpassed 
the region standard of 7-3 1/4 set by Lee Balkin of Glendale in 1979, and moved 
him into a tie for eighth on the all-time U.S. high school outdoor list. 
</P>
<P>
 He also climbed to second on the all-time state list behind Maurice Crumby, 
who leaped 7-4 1/2 for San Francisco Balboa High in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were definitely shooting for Balkin's record," Riedmiller said. "That was 
something we wanted to get. After 7-4, it was up to Jeremy to decide what he 
wanted the bar raised to." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-five would have been the next logical height, but Fischer had the bar 
set at 7-5 1/2 because a clearance would have been the highest ever in a U.S. 
high school meet. Dothel Edwards of Cedar Shoals (Ga.) set the national high 
school record of 7-6 in 1983, but he cleared it in a junior (age 19-and-younger 
meet) meet that also included collegiate competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fischer was unsuccessful on all three attempts at 7-5 1/2, his second 
effort was relatively close as he knocked the bar off with the back of his 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could have made (7-5 1/2), but I kind of psyched myself out, said 
Fischer, who also won the long jump at 21-8 1/2. "I'm not familiar jumping at 
that height." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in weather conditions that make most of the country envious of 
Southern California in March, Fischer cleared 6-4 and 6-8 on his first 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing 6-10, he cleared 7-0 and 7-2 on his second efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 He barely grazed the bar with his left heel on the 7-4 jump, but not enough to 
dislodge it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say he's going to break the national record this year," Riedmiller 
said, "but I will say that he will definitely challenge it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer's performance, which marked the third time this season he has cleared 
7-2 or higher, overshadowed several other quality efforts by local athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands won the girls' shotput and discus with 
marks of 41-11 1/2 and 145-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Her discus effort added three feet to the Ventura County record she set last 
year and moved her to fourth on the all-time region list. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo won the boys' 3,000 meters in 8 minutes 38.70 
seconds and placed second in the 1,500 in 4:07.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Mike Wygant won the triple jump with a school record of 44-10 1/2 and 
Newbury Park's Jared Trefethan was first in the discus with a throw of 151-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local winners included Andrea Wasden of Rio Mesa in the 100 high hurdles 
(wind-aided 15.27 seconds) and Shawanda Hotchkiss of Channel Islands in the 
triple jump (wind-aided 36-11 3/4).

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; FOR GRAF, THIS SEASON IS A RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf's dominance in women's tennis is partly attributable, of course, 
to the absence of Monica Seles, who has not played since she was stabbed by a 
deranged fan during a match at Hamburg, Germany, last April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 But Graf, unbeaten in 28 matches and winner of $774,065 already this year, 
suggests that other factors should be considered: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Until last week, when she suffered a sprained knee ligament in practice and 
pulled out of this week's Family Circle Cup at Hilton Head Island, S.C., she 
was injury-free. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Her new racket is superior to her old one, of a different make. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, 24, said she endured several weeks of hard workouts at the end of last 
year, hoping she could avoid the injuries that nagged her throughout the year. 
This year, she is as physically fit as she's ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day running, one day weights," she said of her regimen. "Every second 
day, I did the other thing for six weeks, taking only two days off. It was a 
very hard time because it took from morning to evening. It was very difficult, 
but it was all worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, there wasn't a tournament where I didn't have anything (bothering 
me). I had a lot of foot problems. I got the (foot) operation finally in 
October. I've had a lot of shoulder injuries. In August, I started to get back 
pain, which I've never had before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every tournament, at the end I had to play with (painkilling) injections. 
Every morning, I went to the doctor for injections. And I didn't want to do 
that. I got so many injections last year, and I went to so many doctors, I had 
enough of it. Even with all the success I had, I was questioning if I was doing 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf said she put off switching rackets as long as possible because of a sense 
of loyalty. "I'd been with the company since I started playing a lot, but all 
the other rackets have been so much better that it was just a matter of time 
before I did it," she said. "It took me very long -- I never really wanted to 
do it -- but this racket gives me much more power and it helps me at the net." 
</P>

 Struggling artist: A certain former No. 1 player, having collected art since 
he was 20, has opened the John McEnroe Gallery in the SoHo district of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe told Esquire magazine that he has traded tennis lessons for drawing 
lessons from artist Eric Fischl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now he's a better tennis player than I am a drawer," said McEnroe, who 
credits Fischl with helping to guide his taste. "But I hope to change that."

restored to the U.S. Tennis Assn. record book as captain of the 1972 U.S. Davis 
Cup team, but he is still threatening to sue the USTA for removing it. 
</P>
<P>
 This mess started about a year ago, when USTA President Bumpy Frazer, acting 
on information received from past presidents Robert Colwell and Stan Malless, 
authorized 20-year-old records to be altered by ordering that Colwell and 
Malless be listed as captains of the '72 U.S. Davis Cup team in the 1993 USTA 
Yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston, who in each preceding year was listed as captain from 1972-75, was 
given a footnote as "coach" of the '72 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged by this bit of revisionist history, Ralston retained a lawyer, Bob 
Ranck, and solicited affidavits from the players on the '72 team, among them 
Stan Smith and Tom Gorman, who vouched for his role as captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazer said he had no reason to doubt Colwell, who for three years had 
campaigned to have his name added to the record book. Frazer said Colwell had 
told him that, as USTA president in 1972, he'd made a handshake agreement with 
Ralston that Colwell, or another official appointed by Colwell, would serve as 
captain for matches played outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team won the Davis Cup in '72, playing all of its matches, including 
the final at Bucharest, on foreign soil. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence of Colwell's claim could be found, however, and Ralston's name was 
ordered restored to the USTA Yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston, though, is irked that he did not receive an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't say a damn word about, 'I'm sorry, we made a mistake,' " Ranck 
said. "Boy, they're an arrogant bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry that I caused Bumpy Frazer the embarrassment," Colwell said. "But I 
have nothing to apologize for because nothing I've said or done wasn't 
completely true and honest and aboveboard."

Martina Navratilova, 37, was asked to defend her decision to leave the WTA Tour

 "I had my mental state questioned by some people," she said. "They said, 'Are

THREE TRAINERS SAY THAT HORSES TESTED POSITIVE; SANTA ANITA: HENNIG, MCANALLY 
AND MANDELLA DENY WRONGDOING, BELIEVE THAT INCIDENTS SOMEHOW OCCURRED DURING 
TRAINING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual news conference, three prominent trainers told reporters 
Saturday that their horses have tested positive for the same prohibited 
medication after victories in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the horses, Lady Blessington, tested positive after Mark Hennig saddled 
her for a victory worth $66,300 in the Buena Vista Handicap on Feb. 27. Lady 
Blessington's postrace urine sample contained scopolamine, a depressant, as did 
the tests for Delacroix, a 31-1 shot who won a maiden claiming race on March 3, 
and Water Prospector, a favorite who won a maiden claimer on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Delacroix is trained by Ron McAnally, a member of racing's Hall of Fame. Water 
Prospector's trainer is Richard Mandella, who won Breeders' Cup races with 
Kotashaan, the horse of the year, and Phone Chatter at Santa Anita last fall. 
Hennig, a former assistant to Wayne Lukas, formed his own stable in 1992 and 
won last year's Santa Anita Derby with Personal Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella said that the three trainers, according to state rules, have sent 
split urine samples from the horses to independent laboratories for analysis. 
If those tests also come back positive, suspensions or fines are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope those tests come back negative, which would show that Truesdail (the 
state testing lab) made a mistake," Mandella said. "The racing board has their 
job to do, but we've decided to be up front about this because of all the 
rumors going around." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally said that a test for scopolamine has also turned up positive on a 
standardbred who raced at Los Alamitos this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had that cocaine scandal (five years ago), it wasn't good business 
for racing," McAnally said. "I'm sure they won't find us guilty this time, 
either. We haven't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 After the cocaine positives in 1988-89, the California Horse Racing Board 
eventually dropped charges against several trainers, including Lukas and the 
late Laz Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very disturbing," Mandella said, "because we've worked all our lives 
to make sure our records are clean. I'll do anything in my power to keep this 
off our record." 
</P>
<P>
 Because all three of the horses were stabled at Hollywood Park and vanned to 
Santa Anita for their races, the trainers believe that the scopolamine, which 
is described as a natural substance contained in several plants that grow in 
the United States, could have come from contaminated feed and/or bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's odd that all three of the horses were stabled at Hollywood and all three 
positives came at about the same time," Mandella said. "The horses went over to 
Santa Anita in different vans. Two different feed companies are involved, but 
they both buy from the same grower." 
</P>
<P>
 Hennig said that he was aware of the positive before Lady Blessington ran in 
the Santa Ana Handicap, three weeks after her victory in the Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had her tested (before the Santa Ana) to make sure that she didn't have the 
stuff in her system," Hennig said. "I sure didn't want a second positive. If 
the pre-race test had come back positive, I would have scratched her." 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Blessington, who finished fourth in the Santa Ana, has been sent to 
Kentucky to be bred to Summer Squall. She has won 12 of 27 starts and earned 
$664,112. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally said that he hasn't had a horse test positive in 30 years. Mandella 
could recall only one positive on his record, when there was a mix-up between 
him and a veterinarian about how many days before a race a horse was to be 
medicated. Hennig said that he has had no positives in the two years he has 
been a head trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robert Jack, the racing board's equine medical director, 
scopolamine is used to treat horses that have diarrhea or vision problems. Jack 
said that for humans the drug is used to prevent nausea that accompanies motion 
sickness. At certain levels, the drug is capable of causing drowsiness. Horse

 With Fanmore scratched from today's $250,000 San Luis Rey Stakes because of a 
leg injury, Bien Bien has been made the 3-5 morning-line favorite. . . . Chris 
Antley sent Bold Windy to the front early and the 5-year-old mare out-finished 
Angi Go for a 2 3/4-length victory in the $76,200 Santa Lucia Handicap. Bold 
Windy, trained by Gary Jones, carried 117 pounds, two less than the highweight 
and favorite, Alysbelle, who was third, beaten by 6 3/4 lengths. Bold Windy has 
won seven times, with five seconds, in 20 starts.

ALABAMA FIGHTS TO RESCUE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MIRED IN MEDIOCRITY; EDUCATION: 
LEGISLATURE, UNDER JUDICIAL PRODDING TO REVAMP STATE'S APPROACH, IS LOCKED IN 
DEBATE ON RIVAL PLANS IN ITS CURRENT SESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The statistics tell the story: Forty-eight percent of all adults in Alabama 
failed to graduate from high school. An estimated 25% of the state's adults 
cannot read. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mind-set that simply does not value education," said DeWayne Key, a 
former science teacher and school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Alabama remains at or near the bottom in most national 
educational rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 That might not continue for long, however. Education reform has come to the 
Heart of Dixie, which is locked in a debate over how to level the playing field 
for its 723,000 public school students, many of whom are accustomed to old 
books, dingy paint and unrealized dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio call-in shows, people are discussing classroom funding and teaching 
methods. Parents are turning out in large numbers for meetings about improving 
schools. In Montgomery, politicians up for reelection are giving education 
their undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other Southern states have already gone down the path toward improving 
their schools. Even Mississippi passed sweeping education reform measures in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate over schools is virtually unprecedented in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 There have always been, of course, thousands of parents concerned about 
education. Businesses and industrial recruiters have constantly pleaded for 
better schools and qualified graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polls show it's the No. 1 issue in the state. It has been for several years," 
said Pat Cotter, a pollster with Southern Opinion Research in Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion never was enough to move schools to the front of the agenda, 
though. It took something else, something more concrete: a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 A state judge in Montgomery has given leaders a Sept. 30 deadline for 
revamping Alabama's public schools, with the implicit threat that he will do it 
himself if the Legislature fails to act by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 decision by Circuit Judge Gene Reese came in a lawsuit filed by the 
Alabama Coalition for Equity, a group of 28 poor school systems. The suit 
claimed the state's current method of funding schools unfairly favors wealthy 
systems instead of putting money in poorer districts that do not have 
sufficient tax bases to fund schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese sided with the poor systems, but went a step further in deciding that 
Alabama's public schools do not offer "equitable and adequate" opportunities to 
all children. He set forth 11 broad principles for reform while leaving the 
specifics to legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of little more than rhetoric about the importance of schools, 
State School Supt. Wayne Teague said the decision finally is making Alabama 
take stock of its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not enough people have shown an interest in a long time," Teague said. "The 
best friend education has had in my lifetime has been Judge Reese." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the political campaign season heating up, Gov. Jim Folsom, 
legislators and other leaders are trying to balance Reese's order with the 
election-year booby-traps of taxes and children's futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers are considering two reform plans: one backed by big business and 
Folsom; the other touted by conservative Republicans in an odd coalition with 
teachers' union lobbyist Paul Hubbert, an opponent of Folsom in the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proposals would reduce class sizes, lengthen the school year and fix 
worn-out buildings. Supporters claim each would result in better-educated 
children. But either plan would carry a huge price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Williams, executive director of the Public Affairs Research Council of 
Alabama, estimated the academic improvements under either proposal would cost 
nearly $1 billion. Fixing ramshackle schoolhouses and buying new buses could 
cost another $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the improvements, Folsom is proposing $166 million in new taxes 
phased in over several years, coupled with growth in existing taxes. A 
$1.2-billion bond sale would finance improvements in school buildings and buy 
buses and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the cost were not enough of an obstacle, some school systems simply do 
not want to be reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hoover, a wealthy Birmingham suburb with a broad tax base, three new 
schools are under construction. Supt. Robert Bumpus is worried that whatever 
comes out of Montgomery will hurt his 6,100-student system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel if they are really serious about improving education, leave us alone 
if we are doing a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover collects the most local school revenue of any district in the state -- 
$2,938 per pupil annually -- and Bumpus fears legislators or the judge might 
try to take some of that away and give it to a poorer system in the name of 
equalized funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that they could very well destroy Hoover city schools if they 
don't leave funding alone," the superintendent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fears are different in rural, impoverished Dallas County, which raises a 
state-low $202 locally for each of the 2,000 students in its school system. 
Parents and teachers there are afraid changes resulting from the school reform 
debate won't be radical enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Five Points Elementary School, located about 15 miles outside Selma. The 
school's 212 students make do with antiquated bathrooms, encyclopedias dating 
back to the mid-1960s and poor lighting. The only play equipment is a rusted 
basketball hoop hanging over a pool of muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the self-esteem. We have the enthusiasm. It's just the facilities," 
said Principal George Poole. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the crying needs of some systems, few would be surprised if the 
Legislature fails to act, based on Alabama history. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state constitution of 1901 requires the Legislature to redraw its 
district lines every 10 years, lawmakers shrugged off the mandate for more than 
six decades until the U.S. Supreme Court intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after a federal judge ordered change in Alabama's mental health 
system in the 1970s that the state began improving inhumane conditions in its 
mental hospitals. The pattern held true in desegregation, prison overcrowding 
and the child-welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is the same. It has been generations since Alabama schools got their 
last major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1935, a Legislature dominated by farm interests set local funding minimums, 
then used state money to supplement the poorest systems. The law was considered 
one of the nation's best plans to equalize school funding at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, in 1938, legislators adjusted the amounts of local taxes 
that school systems were required to raise. But in 1939, lawmakers froze the 
state's total assessed property value at $938 billion amid fears that land 
prices were decreasing because of the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state got caught up in the racial politics of segregation, schools 
moved to the back of the bus. Partly as a result, the amount of local tax 
support required for schools has never been significantly changed. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been sporadic attempts over the last 55 years to adjust the system. 
In 1969, legislators approved a funding plan that allocated state money on the 
basis of average daily attendance. Test scores and teacher salaries went up. 
</P>
<P>
 "For several years there, we looked pretty good," said Albert Brewer, governor 
at the time. "But everyone else kept progressing and developing their programs, 
and about all we did was add kindergarten." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, lawmakers passed what was billed as a major effort to reduce class 
size, improve curriculum and increase the accountability of local schools. The 
changes were hollow, though, because legislators refused to appropriate any 
money for the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 1991 Education Improvement Act is the basis of a plan backed jointly 
by Republicans and the teachers' union to meet the judge's order. A group 
called Score 100 is trying to build support for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the Score 100 proposal would establish a core curriculum 
and establish fines of as much as $1,000 for parents who fail to show up for 
teacher conferences or refuse to help correct behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools also would be required to maintain traditional grading methods, teach 
reading through phonics and instruct youngsters on the differences between 
communism and free-market economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial supporters of the plan included the Alabama Education Assn. and the 
Alabama Farmers Federation, two powerful Statehouse forces that butt heads on 
most issues. Joining with them was the Eagle Forum, a conservative women's 
group with considerable clout in the Bible Belt state. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that weighty trio, legislators focused nearly all their attention on a 
rival plan backed by the governor and a group called A Plus, which is financed 
mainly by the state's industrial leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Folsom's plan would put the state under a performance-based education system, 
as required by the judge. Such plans are founded on the principle that all 
children can learn at higher levels and require students to meet certain 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's proposal also would establish community centers in poor areas 
to help solve social ills and provide for after-hours programs to help slow 
learners. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the Folsom plan contend that although all children deserve a 
chance, performance-based plans have not worked in states like Kentucky, which 
adopted such a system because of a lawsuit like the one in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that performance-based education is part of a shadowy 
national movement to indoctrinate children with liberal beliefs, such as the 
acceptance of homosexuality, rather than teach the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettye Fine Collins, a Republican member of the State Board of Education, told 
about 200 parents during one Score 100 meeting that first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton was a "major player" in what she claimed was a conspiracy of political 
correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interested in restructuring lives," she said. "Womb to tomb is what 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the reform effort deny any ulterior motives. They say their main 
goal is to make school funding fairer and improve conditions in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, the former teacher and ex-superintendent, put together the coalition of 
school systems that sued for change. He said conservatives are dredging up 
fears over vague liberal agendas and teaching techniques because they do not 
want to pay more taxes for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging in the balance is the question of whether a judge or elected 
representatives will chart the future of Alabama's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having it deteriorate to a debate over education philosophy compares to 
showing up at a great banquet and going over in a corner and eating peanut 
butter and crackers," Key said.

VERMONT TOWN CRACKS DOWN ON POLICE; ABUSE: RESIDENTS DEMANDED ACTION AFTER A 
SUSPECT SAID HE WAS TORTURED FOR FAILING TO SPIT OUT HIS CHEWING TOBACCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRAM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of this small town had complained about the police for years, with 
no results, until a suspect was allegedly tortured in custody for refusing to 
spit out his chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation was ordered, and now two of the town's three full-time 
officers -- including the chief -- face criminal charges and four of 10 
part-time officers have resigned for undisclosed reasons. Charges are also 
pending against two part-time officers. The officers facing criminal charges 
are on administrative leave pending resolution of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of 5,600 residents about 10 miles south of Montpelier is left with 
one full-time officer and six part-timers. And the full-timer, Donald 
McCormick, has just returned from a 10-day suspension after a sexual harassment 
allegation, said Municipal Manager Kevin O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents turned out for a meeting earlier this month to demand 
answers from the town's governing Board of Selectmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "People right now have lots of questions," said the Rev. Edward DeLong, pastor 
of the United Church of Northfield. "There needs to be some forum where people 
can get those questions answered." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell blames the town's troubles on a group of 30 or so malcontents who 
have trivial gripes against the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "An officer was responding to a call and the question is why was he driving so 
fast," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents have a series of complaints about the local police, complaints 
that came to a head on New Year's Day. That's when Officers Timothy Trono and 
Brian Elwell allegedly used a stun gun on a handcuffed Raymond Boyce after he 
refused to spit out his chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce's stepmother, Pam Boyce, sought help from the town's grand juror, Chuck 
Slocum. Under Vermont law, a grand juror has a prosecutor's authority to 
conduct investigations, and that's what Slocum decided to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum collected statements and photographs of the 19-year-old Boyce's wounds 
and went to the state police. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum, a former police officer forced to retire because of a disability, said 
the officers had no reason to make Boyce spit out his chew. "They were just 
being mean, as far as I can tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an eight-week investigation, state troopers rolled into town on March 11 
and arrested four officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trono and Elwell are each charged with misdemeanor simple assault; they face 
up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted. They were released on 
their own recognizance. No court dates have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Falcone, a part-time officer, is charged with misdemeanor unlawful 
mischief for allegedly firing two shots into a store owned by a man who had 
been feuding with the town police for years. Falcone could face a $500 fine and 
six months in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Michael O'Neill is charged with obstruction of justice in 
connection with the alleged store shooting. He faces five years in prison and a 
$5,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 William Oren, who owns the store Falcone allegedly shot at last fall, said 
town officials have ignored residents' complaints for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oren says he has complained about police confiscating fireworks and using them 
at private parties; raising funds for the daughters of a woman missing since 
last August and not turning the money over to the family, and failing to keep 
adequate records of confiscated drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The discontent finally seemed to coalesce around Boyce's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is more symptomatic of a lot of feeling in town than just that 
these are a few malcontents," said Richmond Moot, chairman of the selectmen. 
"This is pretty deep-seated."

FUTURISTIC TOOLS IN SELF-DEFENSE ARSENAL; CRIME: ENTREPRENEURS OFFER SUCH 
WEAPONS AS A FAKE CELLULAR PHONE THAT SQUIRTS PEPPER SPRAY AND A CANISTER THAT 
PAINTS AN ATTACKER'S FACE GREEN. BUT EXPERTS WARN THAT USING SUCH DEVICES CAN 
BACKFIRE.

 A flashcube to temporarily blind attackers. A fake cellular phone that squirts 
pepper spray and sounds an alarm. A palm-sized canister that lets you paint an 
assailant's face. A bullet-resistant shield that can be stashed in a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising concerns about crime have resulted in some innovative self-defense 
tools that are closer to "Get Smart" than "Dirty Harry." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of entrepreneurs who are trying to capitalize on the panic 
that's now enveloping America," said Northeastern University criminologist 
James Fox. "People are scared, they feel defenseless and they are looking for 
ways to make them feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Superflash is little more than a flashcube on a key chain. It's supposed to 
stun attackers, allowing victims to run away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the element of surprise, followed by a blind spot," said Nicholas 
Bonk of Hamilton, Ontario, who conceived Superflash after his mother was mugged 
in 1976. He began selling it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Superflash, DYEWitness doesn't harm attackers. But its green foam stains 
their faces, leaving them easily identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have this green dye on your face, basically what happens is that you 
can't go out on the street. You look different. You look funny," said Vic 
Intiso, whose Allied Products International in Clifton, N.J., markets the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Superflash and DYEWitness both cost $19.95. Both have limitations: A flash 
cube is useless in sunshine, and DYEWitness won't faze -- and might even anger 
-- an aggressive assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-defense advocates are more likely to recommend conventional devices like 
pepper spray and personal alarms. But since so many brands are on the market, 
manufacturers are adding new twists to the old standbys to gain a competitive 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied Products' Hidden Edge, which costs $49.95, looks like a cellular phone, 
but contains a pepper spray canister and a 130-decibel alarm -- about as loud 
as an ambulance siren. 
</P>
<P>
 It is carried with a wrist strap that breaks off if someone snatches it, 
leaving the spray inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 More expensive is PRO-TECH-TOR, a portable bullet-resistant shield devised by 
a Boston cabby, Daryl Hopkins. A 6-pound model that costs $189 is marketed for 
police and cab drivers. A 3-pound model that costs $97 is aimed at the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighter model can withstand a .38-caliber bullet and, at 16 inches by 11 
inches, can be slipped into a briefcase, said Hopkins, who began selling the 
shields in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like you're walking down the street like Captain America," he said. 
"No one would know you have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovation alone doesn't guarantee success in the crime-fighting business. 
</P>
<P>
 D-Ter, a capsule that releases a powerful, repulsive odor, has been available 
for 10 years but has never been a big seller, said George Demcak of 3-D 
Marketing in Edison, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 It's targeted especially at women, who can wear it around the neck. An 
antidote is included in the $9.95 price. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Don Wactor, president of the New Jersey Crime Prevention Assn., said some 
non-lethal weapons can help stop crime. But in some cases they only aggravate 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the public has to do what police have to do: Use split-second 
decision-making," he said. "Either you do or you don't. Then you have to deal 
with the repercussions."

HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO RUN A (MODEL) RAILROAD; HOBBIES: N.Y. STORE THAT 
CATERS TO MODEL TRAIN ENTHUSIASTS OFFERS THOUSANDS OF ITEMS, RANGING IN PRICE 
FROM 25 CENTS TO $10,000.

 Here on a layover from Germany, Peter Nanz got hit on the head by a train. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey!" Nanz cried as the tiny engine fell off a shelf at the Red Caboose, the 
only store in Manhattan dealing exclusively in model trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Every inch of the store's 1,500 square feet is crammed with hundreds of 
thousands of model trains and accessories. Boxes brimming with tiny bottles of 
paint lie in the aisles, and drawers explode with miniature bolts, screws and 
bulbs. Signs, engines, tracks and toys dangle from the ceiling, and a plate on 
the floor awaits a cat slumbering somewhere in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 One customer who regularly comes to peruse the magazines scattered on the 
floor and stuffed into racks said as he rummaged through a disorderly stack, 
"It's a challenge, but I have years of experience doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many trains," Jerry Tipton said to his son, Mark, as they 
moved past hundreds of minuscule passenger cars and engines. "Some of them I've 
never even seen before." But instead of a $30 locomotive, Mark bought a scenery 
magazine for $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Because enthusiasts can spend a little or a lot on this hobby it is extremely 
popular. The Model Railroad Industry Assn. says the half a million model 
railroaders in the United States spend between $10 and several hundred dollars 
a month on the hobby and reports a 415% increase in sales of model railroad 
equipment in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news to Alan Spitz, the store's owner, because he carries the very 
cheap to the outrageously expensive. When an elderly customer asked about a 
particular engine, Spitz scampered from behind his cluttered counter to display 
the $1,500 brass locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nuts and bolts for a quarter," Spitz said when the customer moved on, 
"and a Hudson engine that is $10,000 because it is a collector's item from the 
'40s. And everything in between is equally as important." 
</P>
<P>
 As knowledgeable as he is about model railroading, Spitz is sometimes less 
than polite. He reportedly brushed off one shopper seeking an inexpensive item 
as a "nickel-and-dime customer." 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends tell me I have a personality for mail-order," he said. "Sometimes 
my patience is a bit shortish -- and being a New Yorker, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 But many other customers have only praise for both curmudgeon and store. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows everything and he's got it all," said Ronald Docksal from Reston, 
Va., who shops at the Red Caboose when he's in New York on business. "It's the 
only place to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz and a few friends started selling model trains from the back of a 
hardware store around 1970. His friends, he said, "gradually drifted away and 
left me with the albatross." 
</P>
<P>
 He opened his own store, on West 45th Street, in the early '70s and watched it 
grow. During what Spitz called "the flush Reagan go-go years," he grossed $1.7 
million a year. With the recent recession, that figure has leveled out at $1 
million a year. In 1988, he hired a company to take his inventory, but it gave 
up in frustration. It did, however, leave him a 1,200-page partial list of his 
items and estimated their value at $800,000. Spitz says his current stock is 
much larger, and he now offers services such as locomotive painting and in-home 
scenery design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his enormous stock that keeps the customers coming. In fact, Spitz says, 
customers are his best advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Alan for 25 years," said Mike Masino, who specializes in subway 
trains and makes a weekly trip to the Red Caboose. "He's got new products 
coming in all the time. He must have 300 different engines in the N scale alone 
in different varieties, in different colors. A hobby store will carry only two 
or three." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz's stock attracts out-of-town and foreign business as well. In the late 
'80s he began advertising worldwide shipping in three hobby magazines. Now the 
phone never stops ringing and he ships to Italy, France and Portugal. 
Mail-order sales account for 40% of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 But walk-in customers make up the other 60% of his business, and though many 
of them live in apartments, they have adapted a potentially space-hungry hobby 
to the confines of city life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita McMahon, a marketing researcher shopping for a tunnel, said her son's 
trains run on the back of a panel that folds down from the wall like a Murphy 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that ingenuity?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 West 45th Street used to house three model-train stores, but now that his last 
competitor across the street closed, Spitz plans to move the Red Caboose into 
the larger space. He said he hopes that a street-level storefront will attract 
more customers and added that he may expand his stock and his mail-order 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But as one Red Caboose customer observed, it is difficult to believe there is 
anything the store doesn't already stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's marvelous! It's a museum!" exclaimed Michael Bieger, a German customer, 
as he pressed his face close to glass cases lined with trains that could fit in 
the palm of his hand.

RATS PERIL MARINE LIFE, BIOLOGISTS WARN; ALASKA: THE RODENTS COULD DO MORE 
DAMAGE THAN A MASSIVE OIL SPILL. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF 
SUCH AN 'INVASION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez killed hundreds of thousands of 
marine animals. But biologists say the ships that ply state waters often carry 
a cargo that could prove even more devastating to plant and animal life -- 
rats. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a ship goes aground on a major sea bird colony, the resulting damage could 
be far worse to marine life than the (1989) Exxon oil spill," said Art Sowls, a 
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of wildlife service biologists in Alaska, who have dubbed 
themselves the "rat pack," are developing plans to protect the state's fragile 
island ecosystems from the rodents, which are inadvertently introduced into the 
environment when sea vessels dock or run aground. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony DeGange, another fish and wildlife service biologist involved in the 
project, said the group is just beginning to write proposals and try to secure 
money for their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most island wildlife evolves without predators and is therefore very 
susceptible when rats enter the ecosystem, DeGange said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rodents feed on the eggs and chicks of birds. DeGange said they are 
capable of wiping out an entire sea bird species on an island. Rats also prey 
on fauna and, once loose, reproduce rapidly. In addition, they are tenacious 
and reclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effects of oil spills are relatively short term compared with what can 
happen with rats on an island," he said. "You may never get them off." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, biologists are concentrating their preventive efforts on 
areas they believe are mostly free of rats, including the Pribilof Islands and 
the hundreds of uninhabited keys in the Aleutians. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGange said the methods biologists employ will vary, depending on whether an 
island or group of islands is inhabited. 
</P>
<P>
 The inhabited Pribilofs -- St. George and St. Paul -- are home to about 2.5 
million nesting birds and a million fur seals, Sowls said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny Bering Sea islands, about 300 miles off the west coast of Alaska, are 
experiencing a boom in the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development is so quick it's almost like a military invasion," Sowls 
said. "It's great for the economy, but a real challenge to the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists aren't sure whether rats could thrive in the Pribilofs' harsh 
Bering Sea conditions, but DeGange said with the increased development they 
don't want to take any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to teach people how to use rat poisons and have them set bait and 
trap stations in the harbors of St. George and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping rodents off the uninhabited islands in the Aleutians and other areas 
of the state pose a different, and potentially trickier, problem for 
biologists. 
</P>
<P>
 There are millions of sea bird colonies in the Aleutian Chain, DeGange said, 
and though many of the islands are remote, uninhabited and undeveloped, major 
shipping lanes pass within a few miles. 
</P>
<P>
 If a ship were to wreck, he said, biologists would have to act quickly to 
determine whether the vessel probably contained rats, and if it did, how to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller ships like crabbers don't pose much of a problem, but DeGange said 
bigger vessels that travel long distances, such as grain ships, are likely to 
have rats. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a grain ship went aground, my guess is we'd get out there as fast as we 
could," DeGange said. 
</P>
<P>
 With more funding and research, biologists hope to be able to use more complex 
eradication methods soon, such as anticoagulants to get rid of rats if a ship 
runs aground. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of anticoagulants, which cause internal hemorrhaging, is that 
rats don't seem to build up the immunity they develop to other poisons, DeGange 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rats also can learn to avoid standard traps, he said.

CHEMICAL WARFARE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR ANTARCTIC ANIMALS; ECOLOGY: 
DEFENSELESS SEA BUTTERFLY, SPONGES AND SNAILS CONTAIN CHEMICALS MAKING THEM 
UNPALATABLE TO HUNGRY PREDATORS. RESEARCHERS TELL HOPES FOR NEW MEDICINES.

<P>
 Life in the waters off this icy continent is anything but a dream. The only 
way some animals stay alive, in fact, is through bizarre manipulation of 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some species of fish produce antifreeze 200 times more effective than what's 
in a car radiator. 
</P>
<P>
 A small, shrimp-like animal called an amphipod carries an even smaller 
pteropod, a sea butterfly, clamped on its back to keep from being devoured. The 
kidnaped pteropod harbors chemicals unpalatable to fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Brightly colored sponges on the bottom of McMurdo Sound contain chemicals that 
make them, unlike some of their drab relatives, distasteful to sponge-eating 
starfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise defenseless nudibranchs -- "naked snails" -- have unique bioactive 
compounds in their bodies that prevent Antarctic fish and starfish from taking 
bites. 
</P>
<P>
 A yard-long Antarctic sea worm covers itself with slimy, toxic mucus that 
turns predators away. The substance is so acidic that it leaves marks on 
divers' gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to flee, gaudy orange corals fill the water surrounding them with a 
chemical halo that scientists think broadcasts a clear message to predators: 
"Don't even think about tasting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Why these things happen are mysteries being explored by several teams of 
scientists, supported by the National Science Foundation. "It's an interesting 
detective game," said Mark H. Slattery, a graduate student in marine ecology at 
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 The underwater sleuths have plenty to challenge them in the frigid, 
little-explored seas surrounding Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can any organism stand water so cold?" asked William J. Baker of the 
Florida Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most interesting and least publicized research is being done on 
creatures of the benthos, the plants and animals that live on the ocean bottom. 
The research holds hope for new medicines and other practical applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very different habitat than anything else in the world," said Paul K. 
Dayton, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La 
Jolla, Calif., who began poking around in the Antarctic ooze more than 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the younger, still-developing Arctic seas, Antarctica is 
ancient. It broke away from the prehistoric southern megacontinent of Gondwana 
40 million years ago and turned cold about 20 million years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have is a very interesting relict population" of plants and animals 
that became isolated 20 million years ago," Dayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a marriage of scientific disciplines, the co-leaders of Slattery's research 
team are chemist Baker and a marine ecologist, James B. McClintock of the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing rubber "dry suits" over layers of long underwear, the scientists dive 
for their specimens, disappearing beneath 6-foot-thick ice for 30 minutes or 
less at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 For those rugged enough to dive in McMurdo Sound's crystalline waters, 
visibility is "another order of magnitude" better than in the Bahamas, 
McClintock said. With the exception of a few weeks during the austral summer, a 
diver can see 1,000 feet in Antarctica, he said, whereas on a good day in the 
Bahamas visibility is about 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief summer science season ended at McMurdo Station, the largest U.S. 
scientific and logistical base on the southernmost continent, in late February. 
Research continues in stateside laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock and his team have known since 1989 about the sea butterfly, which 
flutters in abundance through the Antarctic water without so much as a nibble 
from hungry fish. "Clearly it's chemically defended," McClintock said, while 
its amphipod captor, if unprotected by the toxicity of the abducted mollusk, is 
an easy meal. 
</P>
<P>
 These amphipods may be Earth's only creatures to capitalize on another 
species' chemistry in this way. This year Patrick Bryan, one of McClintock's 
students, identified the substance that makes the sea butterfly repugnant to 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical defenses, often broadcast to predators by garish colors, are common 
in the world's oceans. But the bright red and green Antarctic sponges are a 
strange study in evolutionary development. 
</P>
<P>
 Most waters teem with fish that see the colors and read their warning, much as 
birds stay away from Monarch butterflies. But Antarctica has no visually 
oriented predators. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps starfish at arms' length from the colored sponges is chemicals. 
Because the pigments themselves are bioactive, there's no evolutionary 
incentive for the sponges to lose their color. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in solving such chemical puzzles is to grind up organisms in an 
electric blender in a McMurdo laboratory, separating their components. The 
components are tested further in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker and other chemists collaborate with pharmacological and agrochemical 
companies in the search for practical applications of marine chemicals. One 
substance from a bryozoan -- a moss animal -- is being tested clinically as a 
potential anti-cancer agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organisms don't make chemicals for no reason," Baker said. "The bottom line 
is that there's a lot of inherent bioactivity in each of the molecules that 
these organisms make. While the organism may have made it for the specific 
purpose of keeping a sea star from eating it, there may be other roles the 
substance can play." 
</P>
<P>
 The same might be said of the natural antifreeze compounds that protect 
certain Antarctic fish. The peculiar proteins were discovered by Arthur L. 
DeVries of the University of Illinois, who has been trying to unlock their 
secrets for more than 30 years. He and his wife, fellow biologist Chris Cheng, 
are still hard at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Their aquarium tanks at McMurdo are filled with large Antarctic "cod" -- not 
cod, actually, but Antarctic toothfish -- and small Antarctic eelpouts. 
Different types of proteins keep the fish from freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial interests are seeking ways to use natural antifreeze in such 
diverse places as salmon hatcheries, operating rooms, fruit orchards and 
vegetable fields. "There hasn't yet been any proven widespread application or 
usefulness of the antifreeze compounds," Cheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many questions that haven't been solved, and in the process of 
solving them you have new questions to ask," she said. "It will be a continuing 
process."

FIREMAN WHO GAVE BILLY JOEL A LIFT FACES DISCIPLINE CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of a city fire-rescue squad faces disciplinary action for giving an 
unauthorized lift to Billy Joel. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer was involved in a minor traffic accident March 17 on his way to a 
concert at the Richfield Coliseum, about 30 miles outside of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire rescue squad, led by Lt. Robert Readinger, responded to the call about 
the accident and Readinger agreed to give Joel a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the squad, one of only four available for all of Cleveland, 
made an unauthorized run outside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad initially told a dispatcher it was taking a patient to a hospital, 
but later told the dispatcher where it was really headed, city Safety Director 
William Denihan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Readinger, who was notified of the charges Thursday, could receive a 
reprimand, suspension, reduction in rank or dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 The lieutenant could not be reached for comment Friday.

FIRST BROTHER ROGER IS MARRIED IN TEXAS; NUPTIALS: THE PRESIDENT IS BEST MAN 
AND REASSURES THE NERVOUS BRIDEGROOM AT DALLAS CEREMONY. CHILD IS DUE IN WEEKS.

 The bride was serene in traditional white and the groom was anything but 
Saturday as First Brother Roger Clinton and Molly Martin recited their marital 
vows, just weeks before they are to become parents. 
</P>
<P>
 President and best man Bill Clinton gave his half-brother a reassuring squeeze 
of the hand when Roger reached out for a little encouragement as his pregnant 
bride marched up the aisle in a flower-filled tent at the Dallas arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking deep breaths and bouncing on his toes, Roger Clinton clearly was 
nervous, but also appeared to be playing to the crowd of about 400 people by 
exercising his flair for the dramatic during the 20-minute ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Minister John P. Miles, who came from Arkansas for the occasion, drew a 
chuckle from the crowd when he announced: "Roger didn't ask for a sermon, but 
he's getting one anyway. If he'd come to church more regularly, I wouldn't do 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles drew more laughs when he declared to Martin that "marrying Roger, there 
will be bad days." But then, in an equal time warning, he added: "Marrying 
Molly, there will be bad days." 
</P>
<P>
 When the bride turned sideways for the exchange of vows, several members of 
the audience could be heard remarking at the advanced stage of her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-minute cloudburst, complete with thunder and lightning, struck just as 
the wedding guests moved from ceremony to reception in the same tent.

 "We had already decided to get married," Roger told a local radio interviewer 
Saturday. "The baby sort of sped things up." The couple has been living 
together in Redondo Beach, Calif., for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another prenuptial interview, Roger said the couple decided to go slow 
because "we've never gone through this marriage thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to sort of, like trial and error, do the right thing at the 
right time," he told TV's syndicated "American Journal." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed by all the attention that comes with a wedding in the President's 
family, the groom wore blue jeans to Friday night's rehearsal dinner at a 
friend's home in north Dallas. About 40 guests -- including the President and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- munched on fajitas and guacamole and kept 
an eye on the TV as the Arkansas Razorbacks survived another round in the NCAA 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The President sent his younger brother into marriage with "not too much 
advice" and "lots of love and well-wishing," Roger reported as Friday night's 
party broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 That fits a pattern the two Clinton boys have followed throughout life: Bill, 
the steady elder sibling, always there for his free-spirited kid brother, the 
would-be rock star at age 37. The President will always be known as "Big 
Brother" to Roger Clinton, who spent a year in prison on a drug conviction in 
the 1980s after then-Gov. Clinton approved the probe that resulted in his 
brother's arrest. Roger Clinton says his brother probably saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had the same mother -- Virginia Kelley -- but different fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's father, William Blythe, died in a car accident before Clinton 
was born. His mother married the senior Roger Clinton when Bill was 4 years 
old. Roger Clinton Jr. was born six years later. The future President took his 
stepfather's surname when he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 25, plans to use the name Molly Martin Clinton. She works at a Marina 
del Rey software company. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the couple's musical tastes, the Cindy Horstman Jazz Harp Trio 
played before and after the ceremony, and the groom's longtime friend Bill 
Tillman -- whose band played for the couple's first date -- was performing at 
the reception.

EARLY NCR RETIREES GET OFFER TOO GOOD TO SKIP; LABOR: MANY AT COMPUTER FIRM 
WEREN'T READY TO STOP WORKING. BUT LUMP-SUM PAYMENT AND ENHANCED BENEFITS MEANT 
THEY COULD DO THINGS THEY COULDN'T AFFORD BEFORE.

 At 56, Norm Reeder wasn't ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer program analyst thought he would be on the job at NCR Corp. for 
at least six more years. But when the computer manufacturer decided last year 
to streamline its operations, it made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder was among 2,400 NCR workers who accepted the early retirement offer 
that includes a lump-sum payment of $30,000, insurance benefits for varying 
periods and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The package was offered to 5,500 NCR workers age 50 and older with at least 10 
years of service. The company employs 51,000 workers worldwide, including 
27,000 in the United States. The offer was extended only to workers in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 (NCR said Jan. 26 it will change its 110-year-old name to AT&T Global 
Information Solutions to capitalize on the identity of its well-known parent 
company. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. bought NCR in 1991.) 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder, who has worked for NCR for 15 years, said it was a tough decision. He 
wanted to stay with the company but feared being laid off if he refused the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't have any ill feelings to the company, but at the time I was 
hired I anticipated being there until I was 62," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said a deciding factor was the company's agreement to extend for 10 
years its health and medical coverage for him and his wife, Betty, who has a 
history of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reeders, who reared three daughters, live on a 14-acre farm north of 
Dayton, where they raise wheat and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said his wife, a retired schoolteacher, was worried about the financial 
impact of his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my wife and I, this was a pretty difficult decision," said Reeder. "But I 
felt I'd find something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take him long. After retiring Dec. 31, Reeder landed a temporary job 
with a contractor that administers NCR's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have made some contacts with some other contracting firms and friends 
of mine, and they feel I can probably continue in this capacity with another 
firm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend told me when one door closes, another opens," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lowell Rust, a 40-year NCR employee, the offer came at the perfect time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to retire at the end of January anyway," said Rust, 62, who 
managed trade shows for the computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was very definitely big-time icing on the cake. It certainly opened up a 
lot of things we can do now that we couldn't do before." 
</P>
<P>
 Rust said he and his wife had wanted to build an addition on their house and 
buy some property in Tennessee but were not sure whether they could afford it. 
The early retirement package will allow them to do that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rust plans to spend his retirement helping build homes for the needy, 
volunteering at Kettering Medical Center and playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not ruled out another job. He said he has heard from several companies 
that want him to help them set up trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
 NCR spokeswoman Patricia Allen said the company tried to make the early 
retirement offer attractive, but not so attractive that it would trigger a mass 
exodus of valuable employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be more competitive and strengthen our market position," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also offered 25,000 of its U.S. employees a "voluntary separation" 
package. If the employees leave their jobs, they will receive a lump-sum 
payment of $5,000 plus an additional sum based on years of service to the 
company. They will also receive insurance and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Worth, an NCR program manager who has worked for the company for 27 
years, accepted the voluntary separation offer. She said she wants to start her 
own desktop publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have wanted to work at home in my own business for several years, and I saw 
this as an opportunity to do that," said Worth, 57. "It just so happens I'm the 
right age and right place in life. So it seemed like a good idea."

FLOWERS, DRUMS END COOK ISLANDS ELECTION

<P>
 The leader of Cook Islands marked his election victory with flowers and drums 
on Friday, but one of his ministers headed for defeat for trying to bring a 
McDonald's to one of the most isolated spots in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumphant Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry said an opposition campaign 
highlighting allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement had little 
impact on the 11,000 voters in the 15-island group that stretches over 
thousands of square miles of ocean south of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 People were more concerned about health, education and jobs than charges of 
tax-haven swindles and mismanagement of the construction of a $50-million 
Sheraton Hotel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minister of Marine Resources Ben Toma lost the island constituency of Manihiki 
by five votes, but may win it back when special and postal votes are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Toma had campaigned to bring the McDonald's hamburger chain to the remote 
island, five hours flying time from Rarotonga.

SUDANESE REFUGEE'S JOYFUL ESCAPE ENDS BEHIND BARS; IMMIGRATION: MOSES CIRRILO 
ENTERED THE U.S. WITH FALSE PAPERS. HE HOPES FOR ASYLUM AS HE WAITS IN VERMONT 
JAIL WITH NO RECREATION, NO TELEVISION, NO LIBRARY AND NO REGULAR VISITING 
HOURS.

<P>
 After his village was set afire -- after his wife, son and brother died, his 
father was arrested and disappeared and his neighbors said soldiers were 
looking for him -- Moses Cirrilo decided it was time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he walked more than 300 miles from his home in southern Sudan to 
neighboring Ethiopia, where European aid workers got him false Ghanian papers, 
money to pay his way to Finland and a plane ticket from Helsinki to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 So began an odyssey that has ended, for now, in limbo: a tiny cell in a county 
jail in Vermont, a place far from home where the 30-year-old sub-Saharan 
African reads his Bible and watches the snow fall outside his window. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it coming down from the sky," he said slowly in English as his fingers 
did a descending dance in the air to demonstrate. He never has felt snow in his 
hands, or crunching beneath his feet, or melting on his cheeks. "I would like 
to touch it," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused of entering this country illegally, Moses Cirrilo has spent 11 months 
at the Lamoille County Detention Center, designed as a short-term lockup with 
no recreation facilities, library or regular visiting hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington 
said the INS has more than 5,000 aliens locked up on a typical day, many of 
them -- though she could not say how many -- scattered around the country in 
small, rural jails like Lamoille County's. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups that monitor immigration issues say dispersing detainees to rural areas 
frequently keeps them isolated from friends and family who have successfully 
entered the country, as well as from legal help. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont, about two dozen INS detainees currently are housed in Lamoille 
County and at the Orleans County jail in Newport, many of them sent north after 
they were arrested in New York and Boston, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirrilo says he has no money and no home he can return to safely. More than 
500,000 people are reported to have died in Sudan in the last 10 years in a war 
of ethnic cleansing waged by the Islamic government against black Christians in 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Anderson said in court papers that Cirrilo arrived 
at Kennedy Airport saying he was Peter Owusu, a Ghanian who had spent the 
previous six years in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after immigration officials determined that he had an altered 
passport that he told them he was Moses Cirrilo, a refugee from Sudan. Anderson 
said in court papers that "it should be noted that the petitioner has presented 
no evidence, other than his say-so, that he is Moses Cirrilo or that he is from 
the Sudan." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is asking the federal court in Burlington to deny Cirrilo the 
political asylum hearing he is seeking and order him deported. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyer Robert Bensing and paralegal Jean Lathrop of the Vermont 
Immigration Project are convinced. They have been working with Cirrilo since 
last summer, trying to lead him through the bureaucratic labyrinth in which 
many aliens deemed unfit for admission to the United States find themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that those fleeing oppression abroad frequently try to enter the 
United States with false papers. "If the government is after you, you can't 
very well go and ask it for the proper papers," Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "We think Moses has a very strong case. And the bottom line -- and 
this is what pushes us -- is, we really think there's a very good chance that 
he would be killed if he were returned to the Sudan." 
</P>
<P>
 A more immediate concern is the conditions under which Cirrilo and his fellow 
detainees are living. 
</P>
<P>
 INS pays the Lamoille County Sheriff's Department $47 a day for each of the 
dozen detainees in the lockup, said Sheriff Gardner Manosh. The department 
collected $160,000 in INS payments two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The overcrowded Vermont corrections system won't send inmates to Lamoille. A 
corrections spokesman said that the jail is considered geographically isolated 
even by Vermont standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Henry, the INS officer in charge in Vermont, acknowledged the jail's 
limitations. "It's designed for people to be there two or three months at best, 
maybe a lot less than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail has no recreation aside from television, no library, no workshop or 
kitchen where detainees can do something useful. Food is brought in from a 
nearby restaurant owned by the sheriff's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The food is not my food," Cirrilo said. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview in the stark, windowless room where detainees eat, Cirrilo 
said he had not been outside for exercise since arriving last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state corrections officials frequently let reporters tour cell 
blocks, Manosh would not, citing safety. Cirrilo said his cell was as long as 
the bunk bed that lines one wall, and also included a toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 Manosh said he didn't understand why there would be any complaint. "It's a 
warm jail, it's clean. They get three squares a day plus snacks. Their medical 
stuff is all met. They get emergency dental. . . . We have people living in 
this country who don't get that themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "If you were in jail in their country, you wouldn't be treated that 
well, I can guarantee you." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the jail has not soured Cirrilo on Vermont. If released he says he 
will stay here, near his friends Lathrop and Bensing, "and work and if I have a 
chance, to learn something in school."

CLEANUP OF TIMES BEACH FUELS A NEW SAFETY DISPUTE; ENVIRONMENT: THE FIRM 
RESPONSIBLE FOR RIDDING THE TOWN OF DIOXIN-TAINTED DIRT WANTS TO INCINERATE IT. 
NEARBY RESIDENTS FEAR FALLOUT AND PETITION AGAINST BURNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a decade after it was wiped off the map, Times Beach is more than 
just a bad memory. A battle is brewing over what to do with the very stuff that 
doomed the town -- its dioxin-tainted soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that is responsible for the cleanup wants to incinerate it; some 
nearby residents are resisting. 
</P>
<P>
 After a forthcoming series of public hearings, Syntex Agribusiness 
Technologies hopes to bring in a huge, portable incinerator to burn 130,000 
tons of contaminated soil from Times Beach and 26 other Missouri sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt would be burned at a rate of 30 tons per hour, 24 hours a day. The 
process is estimated to cost $118 million and take a year or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Pendergrass, coordinator of the Times Beach cleanup for Syntex, said 
incineration "is the only proven means to eliminate the dioxin." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of it will be (eliminated) and no longer pose a threat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thermal treatment is effective and can be performed safely," said Bob Fields 
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, known to colleagues as "Mr. Times 
Beach" because of his involvement in the project since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have not convinced Fred Striley or his Dioxin Incineration Response 
Group, which has sponsored a petition drive and informational meetings in 
opposition to the incineration. 
</P>
<P>
 Striley, who lives in Eureka, four miles west of what used to be Times Beach, 
contends the incinerator will blow dioxin residue all over St. Louis County and 
particularly the southwest portion of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced it's dangerous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that incinerators do emit a lot of toxics, and public health is 
endangered by the toxics. They know it's not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a surprising attitude; distrust is just as much a legacy of Times 
Beach as the contaminated dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much left of Times Beach. Barricades encircle the land where the 
town once stood. Most of the town's 800 homes, shops, restaurants and churches 
have been leveled. Tall grass and weeds grow in yards where children once 
played. Levees keep the tainted soil from the nearby Meramec River. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, former resident Kathy Sharp recalled, this was "a great place to have 
children, the kind of place you don't worry about locking your doors or letting 
the kids play outside." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the early 1970s, the town hired local waste-hauler Russell Bliss to 
spray its ballpark and gravel roads to control dust. In 1982, Times Beach 
turned up on a list of cities suspected of dioxin contamination; it turns out 
the oil that had been sprayed contained the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 Dioxin is associated with a range of health problems, including cancer. It's a 
byproduct of incineration of solid, medical and hazardous waste, and of the 
bleaching process used by the paper and pulp industry. It's also a byproduct 
created in the manufacture of Agent Orange, used as a defoliant during the 
Korean and Vietnam wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Marilyn Leistner said the EPA has determined dioxin is safe at 1 
part per billion; at Times Beach, the level was 1,200 parts per billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the government bought out the town. Times Beach ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the soil remained, and Syntex decided that incineration was the answer. 
Syntex's Pendergrass said that contaminated soil is dried and heated, with 
dioxin and other contaminants driven off as gases. The gases then enter a 
combustion chamber, where the dioxin is destroyed at a high temperature. After 
the gases are cleaned, they are released. Remaining ashes are cooled and stored 
for testing. Once safe, the ashes will be buried at Times Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said the EPA will perform test burns before the dioxin itself is 
burned. After incineration of dioxin begins, the EPA and Missouri Department of 
Natural Resources will monitor the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Striley maintains the test burns are fixed to ensure the incineration can 
go on. Pendergrass disagreed, saying the test burn "is certainly not a less 
stringent test -- it's a more stringent test." 
</P>
<P>
 Striley said there are other options to incineration. One method adds baking 
soda to the contaminated soil, which dechlorinates the material, making it 
safer to burn. Or the dioxin could be stored in bunkers protected by the levee 
system already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka Mayor Barney Nelson said he opposes incineration, but has given up the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That incinerator won't be there by my choosing," he said. "I now and would 
always favor storage in some type of bunker. But the federal government is 
going ahead with this project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get this behind us. It has been a weight on our back for years and 
years. Once it's gone, we can go back to normal."

AMISH MAN GOES ON TRIAL IN WIFE'S DEATH; PENNSYLVANIA: ALTHOUGH A LAWYER PLANS

<P>
 On the quiet Amish farms of northern Pennsylvania, violence is a foreign 
concept. That it could break out among their own in the form of brutal homicide 
was inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the community would do little for Edward Gingerich but pray after he 
killed his wife. Although a lawyer plans an insanity defense, neighbor Kim 
Kerstetter said that Gingerich probably feels in his heart he, too, can do 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection began Monday in the trial. Gingerich, who has a history of 
mental problems, was arrested March 18, 1993, walking down a country road 
carrying his 3-year-old daughter and leading his 4-year-old son by the hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, in his Rockdale Township farmhouse, lay the body of his wife, 
Katie, beaten to death and gutted like a deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Donald Lewis and Assistant Dist. Atty. J. Wesley Rowden would 
not respond to repeated requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mihelcic, an attorney in Arlington, Va., with Amish clients, said they 
see the court system as "English" -- the Amish term for all non-Amish -- and, 
therefore, foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see their view being, 'It's out of our hands. The English do what 
they need to do,' " Mihelcic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingerich's father seemed to confirm that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they decide. He just wants to get the trial over with," said Daniel 
Gingerich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish religion, which began in 16th-Century Switzerland, teaches its 
followers to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. The 
severest sin -- straying from Amish ways without repenting -- is punished with 
excommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 To back up the insanity plea, the defense is expected to argue Gingerich was 
affected by fumes he inhaled accidentally. The workroom where he used solvents 
was not ventilated, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful insanity defense is rare because a jury must be convinced the 
defendant was so insane he didn't know what he was doing, said John Burkoff, a 
University of Pittsburgh law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gingerich's religious background could work in his favor, Burkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's counter-intuitive to think of the Amish as violent, and so the defense 
will have that going for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports vary about exactly what happened in the Gingerich home just before 
Katie Gingerich was killed, but the basics remain undisputed. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple argued and Katie Gingerich sent the oldest child, a boy of 5, to a 
brother-in-law's house for help. The two younger children stayed and apparently 
were watching as she was slain and eviscerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Police took Gingerich to Warren State Hospital. He was moved in July to the 
Crawford County Jail, where he remains without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 For a year before Katie Gingerich was killed, her husband had complained about 
being disoriented. The couple begged their "English" neighbors, who were barely 
more sophisticated on the subject than they, for help finding a doctor who 
could treat him. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Gingerich was treated at a psychiatric hospital in Jamestown, 
N.Y., and given medicine. He returned home but stopped taking the pills after 
he felt better, his father said.

VIRGINIANS SINGING THE BLUES OVER LYRICS; SOUTH: SOME CITIZENS WANT TO REMOVE 
RACIALLY OFFENSIVE WORDS FROM STATE SONG, 'CARRY ME BACK TO OLD VIRGINIA.' 
OTHERS, INCLUDING A GEORGIA GROUP, CONTEND THAT DOING SO WOULD DETRACT FROM 
CONFEDERATE HERITAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Efforts to remove racially offensive lyrics from Virginia's state song have 
run into opposition from a Georgia group calling itself the Heritage 
Preservation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing that it will oppose attempts in the state Legislature to change the 
lyrics to "Carry Me Back to Old Virginia," the group has begun running ads in 
Richmond newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help us fight political correctness and preserve our Southern heritage!" said 
a quarter-page ad in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, paid for by the group, which 
has recently fought efforts to remove the Confederate battle banner from the 
Peach State's flag. The two-year-old Atlanta-based group has pledged to fight 
"anti-Southern discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 "What will they change next? Will they rewrite the lyrics to 'Dixie'? Will 
they remove our Confederate monuments?" says the association's ad, which also 
solicits members for an annual fee of $39.95 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Collins, president of the association, which began as the Georgia 
Committee to Save the State Flag in 1992, claimed support from about 25 members 
in a Danville, Va., chapter and some Richmond lawmakers, although he would not 
name names. He said the group also has chapters in Florida, South Carolina and 
California. Chapters are forming in Alabama, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. 
Membership is about 1,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Georgia flag controversy, Collins said, his group has tracked 
so-called "heritage violations," where symbols of the Old South come "under 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the association, those range from "a bigoted comment about the 
South," to schoolchildren being prevented from wearing Confederate symbols, to 
desecration of Confederate grave sites or monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said changing the lyrics of the Virginia song would amount to revising 
history by placing current value judgments on past deeds and thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have superior paints or canvases today. Does that mean we should repaint 
Mona Lisa? We just don't think history should be tampered with," he said, 
adding that, viewed in proper context, the lyrics to "Carry Me Back" would not 
seem racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carry Me Back," written by a black man, was adopted by Virginia lawmakers as 
the state song in 1940. It describes a freed slave yearning to return to his 
master and his home with words such as "darkey" and "massa." It has sparked 
controversy since at least 1970, when then-freshman state Sen. L. Douglas 
Wilder protested its romanticization of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Madison E. Marye (D-Montgomery), who is sponsoring a bill to change 
the lyrics and substitute race-neutral language, dismissed critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're misguided. I think they have a false sense of values," Marye 
said. "I'm trying to change the state song so . . . (people) can sing it 
together without embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 He challenged the idea that altering the lyrics would dishonor the region's 
past, adding that "Carry Me Back" was copyrighted more than a decade after the 
Civil War, in 1878, and that Virginia lawmakers previously amended it upon its 
adoption as state song. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly am very proud of my heritage," Marye said. "My grandfather was 
buried in his Confederate coat. But it's also time to change."

SMALL KEY DEER AND NEED FOR SCHOOL DIVIDE ISLAND'S INHABITANTS; WILDLIFE: RARE 
ANIMALS ARE PROTECTED IN THEIR HABITAT ON LAND THAT SOME PEOPLE WANT FOR AN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO ELIMINATE CHILDREN'S LENGTHY COMMUTES. 
</P>

<P>
 Brought back from the brink of extinction over the last 50 years, miniature 
Key deer represent a qualified success in the troubled history of people-animal 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 They appear in quiet neighborhoods here in the evening, hanging around houses 
like living lawn statuary. But there's an unpleasant side to this natural 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 or so Key deer, found nowhere else, are preserved in part by an 
extensive series of government-mandated protections, ranging from low (and 
strictly enforced) speed limits to restrictions on development. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the regulations was applied about 50 years ago, when people began 
to threaten the deer's existence. The 8,000-acre National Key Deer Refuge was 
established in 1957. The refuge comprises numerous keys, but Big Pine forms the 
largest part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody is happy about the sacrifices of time and money the deer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Marcus, assistant manager of the refuge, pointed out fresh graffiti 
along Key Deer Boulevard -- "Kids Before Deer" -- written in red letters. It 
reflects the view of those who would like to see a new school built on Big Pine 
Key. 
</P>
<P>
 Through second grade, the 280 school-age children living here can attend 
classes on Big Pine. But afterward they must travel an average of 12 miles, or 
about 40 minutes each way, including stops, according to Kerry Highsmith, 
director of operations and facilities for the Monroe County school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not against the school," Marcus said. "We're just against a school that 
might be detrimental to an endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service warned that the deer could suffer because 
the school would draw more people to Big Pine, increase traffic and reduce deer 
habitat even further. The school, for example, would have to be fenced, and 
that would restrict the animals' movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Key deer, which average just over two feet high at the shoulder, are closely 
related to the full-size Virginia white-tailed deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ages ago, scientists reason, deer wandered south from the Florida mainland. As 
the Wisconsin glacier receded, the sea rose, dividing the land into the Florida 
Keys and stranding the deer, which had to survive on less land, food and fresh 
water than their Northern cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually the deer either adapted or died," Marcus said. "Then through many 
years they sort of downsized." 
</P>
<P>
 They reproduce later than standard-size deer and are less likely to bear 
twins. But Key deer have reached a compromise with their changing environment, 
including an ability to tolerate some salt in their drinking water. Fresh water 
is precious in their habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were left to their own devices, they would get along quite well," 
Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he emphasized, the 1970 population in Big Pine of about 700 has grown to 
nearly 5,000 permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
 So the little deer must contend with such threats as lost tourists in rental 
cars, big dogs and poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus told of two 18-year-olds imprisoned for beating a Key deer to death 
with a baseball bat. He believes the victim must have lost its protective 
wariness of humans as a result of many snacks fed by well-meaning people. 
</P>
<P>
 Peg Riepe, who recently moved away from Big Pine, is a longtime champion of 
the diminutive deer. Over the years, she came to know many of them by names, 
such as Grandma, Dusty and Blondie, and can tell their life stories. 
</P>
<P>
 They collected at her home, visiting with her dog, greeting her when she 
stepped outside. One doe approached an unfamiliar reporter to sniff her hands 
and notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 Riepe said she used her nurse's training and natural remedies to care for 
injured deer, and she fed them, "but with intelligence." She lured them close 
enough to treat with a little grain, for example. In the wild, deer don't eat 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are beautiful, gentle creatures, and they should have as much of a 
chance as anybody else," Riepe said. But she recalled accompanying her own son 
to a 6 a.m. school bus; he spent a total of four hours in transit each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't equate, the deer in preference to the children," she said, adding 
that there is real anger about that on Big Pine Key. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who get very warm over it," said shopkeeper Edith Swinney. "I 
don't see why everybody can't live happily together with the deer." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they can. After weeks of mediation, the school board is considering 
buying a church and converting the sanctuary and classroom building, according 
to Highsmith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an existing development," he said. "The land is scarified already, so 
it's not Key deer habitat." Key Deer 
</P>
<P>
 * The present population of approximately 300 Key deer is about as high as can 
be expected, said Stuart Marcus, assistant manager of National Key Deer Refuge. 
The number of deer is limited by the amount of fresh water available. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 8,000-acre Key Deer Refuge covers numerous keys, but most of it is on 
Big Pine Key. The refuge was officially established in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 * As of March 1, 12 Key deer had died so far this year; nine were road kill. 
Last year, 68 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fastest you can legally drive on Big Pine Key is 45 m.p.h. on the main 
road, U.S. 1. At night, the speed limit on that road drops to 35, and it's 30 
or 25 m.p.h. elsewhere on the key. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 200 speeding tickets are written in an average month.

LOGGING BY HELIUM BALLOONS GIVES BORNEO RAIN FOREST AN ECOLOGICAL LIFT; 
ENVIRONMENT: AERIAL REMOVAL HAS BEEN USED IN SOME TIMBERING OPERATIONS IN THE 
WESTERN UNITED STATES AND CANADA FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. CONSERVATIONISTS 
SAY METHOD WILL HELP SUSTAIN AND REJUVENATE FORESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a giant hand reaching down into a tropical rain forest on the island of 
Borneo, a helium-filled balloon hovering above the treetops can raise tall 
timbers up, up and away. 
</P>
<P>
 When balloons or helicopters harvest the biggest and best hardwoods, tons of 
tree trunks that traditionally come crashing down can go up instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have your logs and save the rain forest too," said Illar Muul, 
president of U.S.-based Integrated Conservation Research, which advocates 
balloon-logging for the Malaysian forests of Borneo. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial logging has been used in some timbering operations in the Western 
United States and Canada for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Asia, conservationists call for 
ecologically correct logging methods -- not clear-cutting -- that will help 
sustain and rejuvenate forests. Some have even demanded that wood carry a 
certificate guaranteeing that it was harvested without harming the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southeast Asia, where most of the export of tropical wood now originates, 
selective aerial logging can be practiced, Muul said, because only about four 
or five trees per acre are mature enough to harvest at any given time. 
Typically, in Malaysian forests, about 30 to 50 species of mostly teak-like 
hardwoods are commercially valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting down desirable older trees from the ground destroys surrounding 
forest, or at least diminishes its ability to regenerate because of the 
construction of roads, skid trails and loading sites. 
</P>
<P>
 When a large tree falls, Muul said, it kills 50 to 75 smaller trees. Harvested 
trees are at least 150 feet tall and weigh 5 to 6 tons each. 
</P>
<P>
 Through balloon logging, like the more expensive helicopter technique, the 
health and commercial worth of trees can be better assessed from the air. 
Animals and ornamental plants such as orchids that thrive in the treetops can 
be rescued before the branches are cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 Muul has constructed rope walkways through the treetops to do research, 
supported in part by the National Geographic Society, on animals that inhabit 
the rain-forest canopies in Malaysia and China. The mammal diversity depends on 
tree diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 From a balloon, trees can be topped with chain saws by loggers who are lowered 
by tether. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a tree is topped like that it becomes like a gigantic telephone pole, and 
if it is felled it does minimal damage," Muul said. "But we plan to tie these 
trunks to the balloon and cut them while they're secured and hoist them right 
out of the forest." 
</P>
<P>
 The logs are usually 30 feet long. They are delivered to a river or some other 
loading site for further transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 A balloon built for tropical tree-logging would not have to do as much heavy 
lifting as those now used in Canada, where trees are larger and six trunks can 
be hoisted out at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Teardrop-shaped balloons, 100 feet in diameter, are able to harvest all kinds 
of conifers from terrain that is too steep and rugged to be logged by 
conventional methods, said Younas Mirza, a timber manager for British 
Columbia's Ministry of Forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Selective logging, whether from the air or ground, is generally more 
challenging and costly than the more extensively used and damaging 
clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial logging, Muul said, is not only a good conservation measure but an 
economic benefit, because it preserves the forest for future timber operations 
and other moneymaking activities such as nature tourism. "Six trees per acre 
would hardly be missed when there are thousands of trees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Muul recently observed Canadian balloon logging on Vancouver Island, he 
said he realized that balloons also could take nature tourists to the top of 
Malaysian forests. 
</P>
<P>
 "A balloon skimming essentially through the rain-forest canopy pulled by 
cables is much less intrusive in terms of the ecology than a cable-car system," 
Muul said. "But since we don't really know how the animals will react, I think 
we'll probably paint the balloon to make it look like a floating tree."

FIRE-SCORCHED WASTELANDS GIVE WAY TO WILDFLOWERS AND GRASSES; AFTERMATH: AREAS 
BLACKENED BY LAST FALL'S BLAZES ARE SUDDENLY BLOOMING WITH LIFE. THE RAPID 
GROWTH SURPRISES MANY. 
</P>

<P>
 Five months ago, more than 73,000 acres in the county were just blackened 
remains and ash-covered ground. But nature is moving swiftly, and now 
wildflowers and bright green grasses are taking over, turning the mess from 
last year's brush fires into thriving meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Green Meadow fire in Thousand Oaks, the slopes of Boney 
Mountain look fresh-scrubbed instead of scorched, from a distance like a newly 
planted lawn where rake marks are still visible through young grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in Aliso Canyon, which the 26,500-acre Santa Paula fire raced through on 
its way toward Ventura, burnt stumps and fallen trees still line the ridge 
behind Virgil Paxton's citrus orchard. But patches of green are appearing in 
the exposed soil around them and the trees on the edge of his lemon groves, 
singed by the flames, are thick with fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thought of everybody after a fire is that everything is destroyed," 
said Jaquie Stiver, a park ranger with the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. "It isn't. It's just changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiver leads monthly nature walks into Rancho Sierra Vista in the Santa Monica 
Mountains to observe the fire recovery. Accompanied by Boy Scouts and nature 
lovers, she studies the regrowth of plant and animal life. She has watched as 
Rancho Sierra Vista has changed from October's wasteland to March's 
wildflower-filled meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all fires are bad things," Stiver said. Their primary benefit, according 
to the park service, is the fresh start the fire gives some long-dormant native 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some species, like the chocolate lily -- a flower named for its brown color -- 
haven't been seen in the Santa Monica Mountains in nearly a decade, squeezed 
out by the dense chaparral. Others require the heat of a fire to pop open their 
seed jackets and germinate. These plants, called fire followers, thrive in 
burned areas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a walking tour in Rancho Sierra Vista last week, park service ecologist Ray 
Sauvajot said plants are thriving, in some cases doing better than the park 
service had expected after last fall's devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really happy to see the vegetation coming back," Sauvajot said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a dense patch of fire-follower Parry's phacelia, a lightly 
scented purple flower taking advantage of the ample space and nutrients in the 
soil along Big Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The herbaceous or non-woody plants are what really spring to life quickly," 
he said. "For the next two to five years, the herbaceous plants are going to 
have great wildflower displays. Then, as the shrubs begin to reassert 
themselves, you won't see as many flowers. There will be a secession to the 
woody plants and then the cycle will start all over again. The shrubs take 
over, setting the stage for another fire to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 The shrubs, or chaparral, are doing what Sauvajot calls stump-sprouting. 
Lifeless twigs of laurel sumac stick up as tall as five or six feet, while a 
riot of glossy green and red leaves begins to cover the ground around their 
base. The dead branches will hang on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "See across on that ridge?" asked Sauvajot. "That little dip where there is 
still chaparral? Those gray sticks are the skeletons of old shrubs, so you can 
tell a small fire came through there a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Because that area had burned fairly recently, it was mostly spared during the 
Green Meadow fire. But some of the chaparral in the Santa Monica Mountains 
hadn't burned in 37 years, which explains why it provided such good fuel for 
October's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the hillsides that look like bare soil from a distance are dotted with 
the sturdier flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to get out of the car to see the flowers," Sauvajot said. "They're 
hard to see from the distance." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 66 types of flowers are blooming in Rancho Sierra Vista alone, 
including three varieties of lupine, California poppies, blue dicks, encelia 
and Johnny-jump-ups. More are expected to blossom in the next few weeks, with 
late April expected to be the height of the wildflower bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, 30 acres in Newbury Park reseeded by the soil conservation service 
and Thousand Oaks Public Works department at a cost of $50,000 have been the 
slowest to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 A 250-foot-wide band from Wendy Drive down to Reino Road was hydro-seeded with 
a mixture of four native grasses and mulch, but a copolymer requested by the 
city to combat erosion and protect the homes below from mudslides has prevented 
their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat like a white glue that just sticks on the ground, the copolymer still 
hasn't dissolved despite several rainstorms. Until it does, the new grass 
cannot get through. From a distance, it looks like a blanket of light snow 
covering the hills of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very strong feeling among the experts that we're far better off 
letting nature takes its course," said engineer George Ehrhardt with the 
Thousand Oaks Public Works department. "But one big reason we reseeded was that 
there were large areas up there with absolutely no seed bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrhardt said the copolymer should break down after a few more storms and be 
replaced by a blanket of grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The path and strength of the fires is still evident in many places. In the 
canyons burned by the Steckel fire in Santa Paula, some trees on upward slopes 
are covered with rust-colored dead leaves, but their trunks are barely 
scorched. At the bottom of Big Sycamore Canyon, live oaks with blackened trunks 
are showing dense green growth on the bigger branches. Scorched leaves point 
west, a reminder that Santa Ana winds blowing from the east fanned the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire scars on the trunks will show for years, said Sauvajot. "But these trees 
are alive, they're coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Remains of a mudflow from the heavy rains that followed the fires show at the 
base of the canyon -- but even among the rocky rubble, poppies and lupine are 
growing. The fender of a Model T lies nearby, swept there from far up the 
hillside, according to ranger Bob Heidinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal life in the burn area, like plant life, is coming back smallest-first. 
Rabbits, moles and wood rats are rapidly repopulating the meadows. Birds of 
prey hang overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few hard months with not much food available, the new plant growth is 
welcome. The tender shoots of the herbaceous plants are not only high in 
nutrients, but they apparently taste better to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauvajot said they found only a few animals dead after the fire. Most of the 
rodents probably burrowed under the ground -- just a foot below the surface 
temperatures were low enough for them to survive -- while deer and coyotes 
found refuge in stream beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant the park service feared for most was the prickly pear, a cactus that 
generally dies after fire. Near the Satwiwa Cultural Center, an entire hillside 
is covered with the collapsed succulent, grayish leaves flattened against the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But here and there, a miniature red-tinged cactus appears, spiking off what 
looks like a dead surface.  
</P>
<P>
 "My suspicion is that it's because these are species that have lived in fire 
regions for a long time," said Sauvajot. "They've adapted." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of living in California, even the desert cactus has learned to 
come back from fire.

3,000 MARCH TO HONOR CHAVEZ AND MOVEMENT; LABOR: UFW OFFICIALS SAY PROCESSION 
MARKS REBIRTH OF CRUSADE. COUNTY MEMBERSHIP HAS SLIPPED TO A FEW HUNDRED.

<P>
 With a metal cane in one hand and a union flag in the other, Sebastian Perez 
shuffled Saturday past the row crops where he once toiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-year-old farm worker had marched dozens of times for Cesar Chavez, most 
recently in Delano as part of a memorial tribute to the farm labor leader who 
died last April. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's procession from Ventura to Oxnard, which drew about 3,000 farm 
workers and followers of the United Farm Workers union founder, was perhaps the 
most satisfying to Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at how pretty that is," he said, watching marchers tow a two-ton bust of 
Chavez along Gonzales Road, waving picket signs and red-and-black banners 
emblazoned with the UFW eagle. "My heart is swelled with pride." 
</P>
<P>
 To the marchers, this was more than just another symbolic bow to Chavez, like 
so many of the events held in his honor since his death. 
</P>
<P>
 UFW officials said Saturday's march represented the rebirth of Chavez's 
crusade to improve the working conditions of farm workers in Ventura County and 
across the nation. It was a dramatic setting for launching a campaign to resume 
organizing efforts in the fields, the approach that built the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing this to show that we are alive, that we are here, that we are 
going to raise the union in this area," said Jose Manuel Rodriguez, a UFW labor 
organizer in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death, Chavez regularly visited Ventura County, searching for 
office space as part of the renewed effort to boost union membership. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, UFW membership now stands at a few hundred workers, and the 
union only has contracts with three growers. But in the 1980s, at the peak of 
the farm worker movement locally, the UFW had more than 4,000 members in 
Ventura County and had negotiated more than two dozen contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, workers are coming to our office and they tell us how they have 
been dismissed for no reason, how they are paid sometimes less than minimum 
wage, how they have no benefits, no medical insurance," Rodriguez said. "They 
don't have holidays, they don't have nothing. It's worse now than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County growers deny those claims. "None of that has been substantiated 
by any of the regulatory bodies that have reviewed the situation in Ventura 
County," said Rex Laird, executive director of the county's Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers gathered shortly after dawn in a church parking lot in Oxnard's 
La Colonia barrio, where picket signs were dispensed from the back of a U-Haul 
truck. They boarded buses and rode to the starting point, roughly tracing the 
seven-mile route they would soon walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Saldana, 67 years old and a longtime union man, looked out the window 
of a yellow school bus as it lumbered past the upscale north Oxnard 
neighborhoods where fields used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to march to support my union," said Saldana, eagerly producing his 
UFW card. "I'm going to march just the way we used to." 
</P>
<P>
 The event started on Gonzales Road, between the flat green fields where many 
of the marchers still perform stoop labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bust, sculpted by a team of Ventura artists, was the centerpiece of the 
procession, which stretched the entire length of Gonzales Road, between Harbor 
Boulevard and Victoria Avenue. The California Highway Patrol estimated that 
3,000 people participated. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight pleased Father Ed Donovan, a former UFW worker who years ago stood 
toe-to-toe with Teamsters members on picket lines throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this is the start of people getting together again," said Donovan, 
spiritual leader of a Catholic Church in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers took turns grabbing hold of thick ropes and pulling a cart holding 
the Chavez sculpture. Others formed an "honorary picket line" along Gonzales 
Road and, as the sculpture passed, the picket line collapsed in behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers pushed strollers along the route. One boy rode his tricycle, four 
union flags trailing in the wind. A group of folk dancers, dressed in full 
costume, performed as they marched. 
</P>
<P>
 Roadside vendors sold T-shirts, buttons and Mexican candy along the parade 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva Chavez!" a lone voice screamed. "Viva!" the crowd responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicano!" someone screamed. "Power!" the crowd would finish. "Viva La 
Huelga!" ("Long live the union:") "Viva!" would be the response." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, marching got old quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not having very much fun," said one boy, who struggled to keep his union 
flag aloft. "This is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the procession entered the Oxnard city limits, some of the younger 
dancers were sitting in the bed of a pickup truck catching their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 UFW Vice President Dolores Huerta rode on the cart carrying the bust of 
Chavez. She talked about the union's shift in strategy that will put organizers 
back in the fields, enlisting new members and pushing for new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The UFW will begin a 330-mile trek Thursday from the fields of Delano to the 
steps of the state Capitol to kick off the new campaign. The trek, which 
retraces the steps of the UFW's first march, is expected to take three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Cesar was alive, there was a feeling that he would take care of things," 
Huerta said. "But since his passing, I think we are starting to see people take 
personal responsibility for improving the conditions in the fields." 
</P>
<P>
 The procession sliced through downtown Oxnard and made its way to City Hall. 
Many of the farm worker tenants who live in downtown boarding houses lined the 
sidewalks and joined the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the marchers made it over the 3rd Street bridge and into Oxnard's La 
Colonia district, where the bust was put on permanent display at Cesar Chavez 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Primitivo Garcia, 62, had been part of the march until his granddaughter, 
Vanessa, fell asleep in his arms. Garcia, who said he marched with Chavez many 
times, got a ride to La Colonia where he rejoined the procession. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a noble man who dedicated his life to fighting for farm workers," 
Garcia said of his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 When his granddaughter woke up, Garcia put her on the ground and made her 
walk. "Now you can say you marched for Cesar Chavez," he told her. "One day, 
I'll tell you all about him."

FAST LANE; SCHOOLS ACROSS COUNTY SLIP INTO HIGH GEAR AND MOVE ONTO THE 
INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY 
</P>

<P>
 Vowing not to let the future bypass public schools, Ventura County educators 
have begun hitching their wagons to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 From Ventura to Thousand Oaks, some pioneering teachers have strung phone 
lines to their classrooms and linked students via computer and modem with 
libraries, newspapers and other schools worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 At Buena High School, the push to modernize is moving into high gear with 
installation of a fiber-optics cable system that will give every classroom in 
the school access to electronic information networks by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing computer services such as Internet and America On-Line into the 
classroom allows students to become computer literate in an increasingly 
high-tech world, said Don Goetzinger, a science teacher at Thousand Oaks High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students, when they get to college, are going to find themselves out to lunch 
if they're not doing this," said Goetzinger, one of the first teachers in 
Ventura County to go on-line last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than increasing computer skills, the interactive technology makes the 
world more accessible and meaningful to students, said Susan Thee, another 
science teacher and Internet convert at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the technology allows students to independently investigate 
medical advancements by dialing up the latest research or test weather patterns 
around the globe by hooking into the database of a supercomputer used by 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't contain the books in this classroom that I can access on the 
computer," Thee said. "I'd have to stack books to the ceiling with no room for 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the need to start gearing schools for the 21st Century, the state 
has funded a training program for teachers, said Cliff Rodrigues, director of 
media, technology and bilingual education for the Ventura County superintendent 
of schools office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slowly, very slowly, teachers are getting into the superhighway," Rodrigues 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Renger, a Balboa Middle School teacher in Ventura, is one of 18 
teachers statewide chosen to be trained in the technology. A mobile computer 
lab will be driven around the state this summer so that teachers can be 
trained. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume and immediacy of information available through computer services is 
unmatched by any library, Renger said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Balboa, students began logging on to Internet in January to research term 
papers and chat with pen pals in San Francisco, Renger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grader Amanda Schneider said it's only been a few weeks since she and 
other students at Balboa began having electronic conversations about journalism 
with their peers in two Northern California schools. Next, the students hope to 
link up with a school in Australia, Amanda said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it before," she said. "It's cool that we can 
share ideas and communicate with people we don't even know." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, students are learning by correcting each other's grammar and 
spelling to make the best impression for their school, Renger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot de-emphasize the enthusiasm factor of (students) working with 
technology," Renger said. "It's the Nintendo generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do students benefit from the electronic messaging capabilities 
on-line, Renger added, but teachers can ask for help and share ideas with each 
other like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have something to teach each other," Renger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides tapping into library card catalogs and talking with people around the 
world, Internet and other information services allow students to retrieve the 
latest information from newspapers, magazines and research periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in a few years this will all be ho-hum, but right now the kids get 
bug-eyed when they see this stuff come over," said Bill Allmen, a computer and 
calculus teacher at Buena High School who chairs the school's technology 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some services provided through the system are more specialized. Offshoots, 
such as LabNet, are tailored to science educators. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thousand Oaks High School, students conduct experiments on global climate 
by shipping their data to a supercomputer at Lawrence Liverpool National Labs, 
a tool used by professional scientists in real-life experiments, Goetzinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, for instance, can study the effects on Africa if they were to raze 
the tropical rain forests in Brazil. The supercomputer supplies information on 
changes in temperature and precipitation that would be caused by the cutting of 
the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The students then must analyze the meaning of the raw data from the 
supercomputer by researching native plant and animal species in Africa and 
studying the climatological conditions that they need to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers in the past have taught students how to memorize information, but 
they need to know how to access it, how to utilize and analyze it," Thee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Thee's class said they learn better by seeking out information and 
applying it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it more interesting than reading it out of a book," freshman Peter 
George said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Redwood Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks use LabNet to conduct 
experiments and then swap data with counterparts in England or Russia, science 
teacher Craig Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Conejo Valley's youngest students are getting exposure to the latest 
technology at a few schools in Thousand Oaks, including Walnut, Banyan and 
Madrona elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 While her students were studying weather, Walnut Elementary School teacher 
Marie Galanda was able to discuss gulf streams and cold fronts by calling up 
that day's national weather maps and displaying them on a television set 
connected to the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five weeks into using the system, the youngsters conduct research on it 
and electronically ask questions of high school science teachers if they can't 
figure something out by themselves, Galanda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, every morning, it's, 'Do we have any (electronic) mail? Can we get 
on-line and see?' " Galanda said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although a lack of money has hampered efforts to bring technology into public 
schools the past 15 years, many districts have made it a priority to purchase 
computers, Goetzinger said. Beyond that, the modems and phone lines needed to 
connect computers with the outside world are not too expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One obstacle that prevents some schools from jumping on the superhighway 
bandwagon is that teachers often believe the technology will be difficult to 
learn or will add to their workloads, Goetzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is part of it, but I think the main problem is lack of willingness," 
Goetzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, officials are looking at ways to extend phone lines to 
classrooms inexpensively so teachers can subscribe to Internet, said Lowell 
Schultze, the district's technology director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking it a step at a time," Schultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard Union High School District, officials have brought four 
libraries on-line and a few computer labs have hookups, said Harold Venable, 
the district's coordinator of educational technology. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason more widespread hookups have not occurred is the limited number of 
access points, Venable said. More people jamming fewer entry points into the 
Internet system can cause slowdowns during peak hours of usage, Venable said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big problem with the information superhighway is that it's more like a 
rocky road with very few on-ramps and off-ramps," Venable said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buena High's Allmen sees a reverse scenario that could slow the ability of 
schools to use interactive technology. As the system evolves and grows, the now 
minimal cost of dialing into a system could become prohibitive, Allmen 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ongoing costs could be the biggest thing to slow people down," Allmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most school districts log on to Internet for the cost of a local phone call by 
dialing through an intermediary system at the Ventura campus of Cal State 
Northridge, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it can be hard to log on during busy times, once a connection is made 
there are no time or access limitations, Goetzinger said. Redwood Intermediate 
School teacher Craig Fox agreed that the Internet's advantages far outweigh any 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people start seeing its possibilities, they're going to start demanding 
it in their classrooms," Fox said.

VENTURA COUNCIL TO DECIDE CAPITAL PROJECTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A messy political battle is expected Monday when the Ventura City Council 
decides which capital projects should be funded for the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider a list of 111 proposed projects -- costing $117 
million -- that would improve or maintain the city's roads, water and sewer 
systems, and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will weigh the merits of building a new sewage treatment plant 
against the cost of replacing old sewer lines. They will decide whether to fund 
street maintenance or re-stripe intersections. And they will debate whether to 
spend money for new water wells or repairing aging reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects not geared toward preventive maintenance will be particularly 
scrutinized. And council members may grab millions of dollars set aside for a 
convention center and a pool to pay for other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to boil down to the essentials," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures 
said. "We're in a tight economic crunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the capital-project budget is scheduled in June, but most of 
the major decisions will be made Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to recommendations in a draft report, little money in the proposed 
six-year plan is set aside for new buildings, parks or other large projects. 
Most of the 111 projects are geared toward maintaining the city's 
infrastructure rather than adding significantly to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gun-shy on building new things that will mean a lot of maintenance 
costs," budget Director Mike Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Past Ventura councils and city staff have traditionally emphasized spending 
dollars on maintenance, Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't fix it now, you'll pay more later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study session held about two weeks ago, council members said they want to 
fund most of the projects recommended by staff. The council is also interested 
in spending an additional $13.5 million in street maintenance over the next six 
years, which means it will have to decide Monday where that money will come 
from. The council will also decide how to raise $23.2 million for more 
water-related projects, as well as a $7.8-million project to expand a major 
sewer line on the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can take the money from other projects, look at using reserves or go out 
and do some kind of financing," Solomon said. The new water-related projects 
will probably be financed by increasing water rates and issuing certificates of 
participation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom said he expects fireworks over the issue of dipping 
into the $9.6 million set aside for a convention center at the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds, and the $3.8 million set aside for a public swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going through bad economic times, we have to look at other dollars," 
Tingstrom said, referring to special holding accounts for the convention center 
and the pool. "However, those funds were raised for a particular purpose and 
once you go in and rob it, it's not going to be there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who has proposed scrapping the convention center 
project and allocating the $9.6 million for other projects, is expected to 
square off against Councilman Jim Monahan, who has consistently supported 
building the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another controversial project is the Bristol sewer line, which must be 
expanded to accommodate future development in Ventura's east end. But Tuttle 
and Councilman Steve Bennett have repeatedly voiced opposition to more 
development in that part of the city, and may push for developers to pay for 
expansion of the sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed spending plan also calls for allocating $41.7 million through the 
year 2000 on traffic-mitigation programs and road improvements. Big-ticket 
items heading the list include $8 million for an expanded Ventura Freeway 
interchange at Johnson Drive and $7.8 million for improving the freeway 
interchange at Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects include $250,000 for upgrading 25 traffic signals and $700,000 
for re-striping intersections to provide additional lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Water projects total about $38.5 million, mostly earmarked for reservoir 
repairs and new wells. The plan suggests spending $5.2 million for major 
repairs to a reservoir built in 1939, and $4.8 million for expanding a 
treatment plant. Replacing waterlines that are leaking would cost $8.7 million. 
About $1 million would be spent on engineering studies for a proposed 
desalination plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewer and sanitation projects total about $28.5 million. One of the major 
projects, building a new treatment plant, would cost $8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About $6.1 million is proposed for parks and recreation projects, including 
$1.8 million to construct a 5.5-mile Ventura River bike trail, which would 
connect the 3.5-mile Omer Rains Trail along the Ventura coastline with the 
9.5-mile Ojai Valley Trail. Under the plan, $1.7 million would be earmarked for 
future park projects and $495,000 would be allocated for replacing playground 
equipment at city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who want to revitalize the downtown, propose spending $2.3 
million for the area, as well as $1.5 million for landscaping, lighting and 
paving. 
</P>
<P>
 The $117 million to fund the proposed projects comes from several sources, 
including sales, property and gas taxes. Developer contributions, sewer and 
water fees and state and federal grant money also contribute to the city's 
capital-improvement budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fees and taxes can only be used for particular projects. For 
example, fees from residents' water bills are earmarked for water-related 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that all money set aside for projects will come under strict 
scrutiny," Monahan said.

FAMILY REBUILDS IN WAKE OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRE; RENEWAL: THE RASNOWS, WHO LOST 
THEIR HOME IN THE GREEN MEADOW BLAZE, ARE OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO ERECT NEW 
HOME AND PUT LIVES BACK IN ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Patches of green grass and shrubs have recently appeared on the blackened 
hillsides that surround Harman Rasnow's property near Thousand Oaks. Spring has 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Rasnow, 73, who lost his home in the Green Meadow wildfire last year, 
that's enough to keep him going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that everything else is moving along, and why shouldn't I?" he said. 
"We're part of nature. And so we'll ride along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasnow and his family were the first victims of the wildfires that swept 
through Southern California in October. Their home of 23 years and nearly all 
of their personal belongings were lost in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, Rasnow and his family are just beginning to get their lives 
back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, Rasnow and his wife, Eleanor, reached a settlement with their 
insurance company and met with an architect to discuss floor plans for their 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very slow process," said Rasnow, who along with his wife has been 
living since the fire at the condominium they own in Ventura. The couple's son, 
Brian, 32, and daughter, Tina, 35, also have homes on the ranch near Thousand 
Oaks, but theirs were spared. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is still upset with the county Fire Department, which they believe 
could have saved Rasnow's house. But Rasnow said he doesn't have the time or 
energy to look back anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to let emotions wear me down," he said. "I don't dwell on the past 
unless there's something I can learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, Rasnow said he will be prepared to fight the fire himself. "I will 
do whatever I have to to provide my own protection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Rasnow said he has learned to ride out the frustrations 
that come with rebuilding his life. He knows now, he said, that things could 
always be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent vacation to the Bahamas, Rasnow and his wife stopped at a 
convenience store to buy a newspaper and were robbed at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after returning home last Sunday, Rasnow said the couple were in their 
condominium in Ventura "wondering what else could go wrong when the ground 
started to shake." A 5.3-magnitude aftershock knocked him to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to laugh about it," he said. "What else can you do?" Besides, he 
said, "we're still here and in good health and good spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to losing his home, Rasnow said last year's fire also had a major 
impact on his post-retirement livelihood. His 200-acre hilltop ranch is home to 
a major communication network that had included 30 radio, television and 
cellular telephone antennae. Of those, however, six were destroyed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 While some media companies have replaced their equipment, others have chosen 
to scale back their operations, costing Rasnow a few thousand dollars a month 
in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost a few tenants," he said, noting that he has already begun talking to 
others interested in renting space on his property. "These are the kinds of 
things that we've had to deal with. It's a setback, but we'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasnow said he will spend the next few weeks finishing up plans for his new 
home, which he hopes will duplicate the one he designed and had custom built 23 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But rebuilding won't be easy. Rasnow's former home was built in sections at a 
mobile home factory in Oxnard and assembled on his ranch. The unusual 
5,000-square-foot structure was built around a courtyard with a swimming pool 
in the middle. A glass ceiling overhead collected solar energy used to heat the 
pool and the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very unusual house," Rasnow said. "One of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the house was considered a mobile home, Rasnow didn't need a building 
permit. Everything was pre-approved by the state. The only permit he needed 
from the county was to hook up his utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem Rasnow faces now is finding a suitable company to build his new 
home. The factory that constructed the old one went out of business several 
years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most factories won't do it at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Rasnow will have to decide whether he wants to have the home built in 
sections, complete with appliances, as well as heating and air-conditioning 
equipment, or simply purchase prefabricated walls that would allow him to 
customize the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice will be a difficult one because in his original home Rasnow was 
free to install his own appliances. State law now requires that each section or 
mobile home unit be completely built when it leaves the factory, greatly 
limiting the buyer's say in its design. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if we don't like something, then we have to take it out" and replace it, 
adding to the expense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he chooses to go with the prefabricated walls, Rasnow will be forced to get 
a building permit from the county; something he had been hoping to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dread that," he said. "That's why the manufactured home was appealing to me 
in the first place. I didn't want to fight the bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters further, Rasnow is involved in a legal squabble with the 
county over whether his property, which is actually on unincorporated county 
land, should have to abide by the development guidelines of the city of 
Thousand Oaks. A Superior Court hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's questionable whether we're going to prevail," said Rasnow, who is 
already contemplating an appeal. "They want to deprive me of all value of this 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Rasnow said he will push on with his plans to rebuild his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were weak and shaky and emotional I wouldn't have survived this," Rasnow 
said. "Old is creeping up on me. I don't have quite the fight and spirit I used 
to have. But there's enough left to get through this."

NAVY REASSIGNS CASE INVOLVING 3 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander of a Port Hueneme Navy base has withdrawn charges against three 
Navy security officers facing court-martial and turned the case over to naval 
investigators off base to avoid any perception of biased prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves three men, including a Navy whistle-blower who claims to be 
a victim of "vindictive prosecution" for his part in uncovering the misuse of a 
naval base in Bermuda by high-ranking Navy personnel at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. David J. Nash, the commanding officer of Port Hueneme's Naval 
Construction Battalion Center, announced Saturday that the case was being 
reassigned to an independent Navy investigator to guarantee that the three men 
are fairly treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allegations have recently been made that question the motivation for 
prosecution of the three cases," Nash said in a prepared statement. "A transfer 
to a convening authority outside of my command is necessary to remove any 
perception of bias." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement follows a defense motion filed by the attorney for three men 
accused of improper conduct for arresting a Navy deserter off the base without 
prior approval. In the motion, defense attorney Lt. Carter Brod alleges that 
Nash and other officers pursued the case to punish Senior Chief Petty Officer 
George Taylor, one of the defendants, for publicly blowing the whistle about 
misuse of the Bermuda base as a vacation spot for top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor went public with the story by appearing on the ABC-TV news program 
"Prime Time Live" in December, 1992. A crew from the TV show came to the base 
the day after Brod filed his defense motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a one-two punch," Brod said. "We filed our motion and the next 
day Sam Donaldson showed up. That's why they withdrew the charges." SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RESIDENTS URGED NOT TO PURCHASE EASTER BUNNIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Humane Society of Ventura County and one pet store chain are urging county 
residents not to buy baby rabbits during the Easter holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, as many as 20 Easter bunnies have been dumped on the Humane 
Society animal shelter in Ojai within weeks of the holiday, said Jolene 
Hoffman, director of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family members give children these baby bunnies and the parents don't want 
them," she said. "When the cuteness wears off, when they grow up, they don't 
want them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said the Humane Society does not allow rabbit adoptions during the 
Easter season, and discourages purchasing bunnies unless buyers are aware of 
the responsibilities involved with raising them as pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not get your relative or your child a rabbit or a chick or a duck unless 
you want to take care of it," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petco, a national pet store chain that has four stores in Ventura County, has 
decided not to sell rabbits during this Easter season. Instead, the chain plans 
to sell paper rabbits for $1. The proceeds will go to a nonprofit rabbit-rescue 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking the rabbits off the floor," said Petco public relations director 
Bonnie Burn. "We want to discourage impulse buys." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Holloway, owner of the Pet Company in Camarillo, said as long as 
people know what they're getting into, there's no harm in selling rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said his store provides bunny buyers with a five-page comprehensive 
guide on how to raise a rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to really educate people and make sure that's the choice they 
want to make in the long-term," said Kelly Brown, who works at Pet Company. 
"We're real careful and talk to people and make sure they know what they're 
doing." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RED CROSS CLOSES LAST RELIEF CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of the American Red Cross Saturday officially 
closed its last remaining service center for victims of the Northridge 
earthquake, winding down its emergency relief effort that started immediately 
after the Jan. 17 jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents needing further assistance should contact the Red Cross office in 
Los Angeles, county Red Cross Director Brian Bolton said. Individuals who still 
have urgent or basic needs that resulted from the quake are asked to call (213) 
739-4543 to speak with a Red Cross case worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Red Cross closed service centers in Fillmore and Simi 
Valley, the two Ventura County cities hardest hit by the quake. Those services 
were consolidated to the Red Cross' permanent office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office remains open and will continue to counsel a handful of 
individuals, any other post-disaster services will be handled by offices in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continuing to work with some families that have ongoing needs, 
basically relating to housing," Bolton said. But he said the local chapter 
needs to focus its efforts on education and preparations for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge quake, the county Red Cross chapter provided overnight 
shelter for about 700 people, counseled more than 1,100 individuals and spent 
more than $1 million, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we may have spent $400,000 for some floods in the '70s, but nothing 
has come close to this," Bolton said. "This is the largest single disaster this 
chapter has ever been involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton said he is proud of the professional response put forth by local 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with the work our chapter and the volunteers did," he said. 
"As we looked at what was going on in Southern California, we felt Ventura 
County was a little ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bolton added: "I hope we don't have any more of these." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OJAI SEEKING BIDS TO RUN TROLLEY LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ojai is soliciting bids to operate its new trolley, an 
antique-style streetcar that winds its way through downtown 13 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members have directed the staff to begin requesting bids to 
operate the streetcar system, which has for five years been administered by the 
private Ojai Trolley Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The new trolley, which can shuttle more riders than the aging olive-green 
vehicle, is scheduled to be delivered to Ojai this summer. The new streetcar 
will be paid for out of Clean Air Act grant funds made available to Ojai last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Daniel Singer told the City Council last week that a 
new operating agreement is necessary to update performance standards and comply 
with new federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the new agreement would allow for more competitive rates and 
routes that could be extended to Meiners Oaks or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents outside city limits told members of the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission and representatives from Supervisor Susan K. Lacey's 
office that they would support extending trolley service to Meiners Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would chip in an undetermined amount to fund the route extension, 
although no decision has yet been made. Singer told the council that he had 
received a letter from Lacey indicating she wants to pursue the plan. JEFF 
McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EMPLOYEES THWART RESTAURANT ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attempted armed robbery of the Charley Brown's restaurant in Thousand Oaks 
was thwarted early Saturday morning by two quick-thinking employees, Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, Ignacio Terrazas, a cook at Charley Brown's, was 
approached by an armed man while walking to his car after the restaurant 
closed, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man directed the 29-year-old cook at gunpoint to the front of the 
restaurant where they were joined by two other men. The three suspects held the 
cook until restaurant Manager William Sharrow unlocked the front door to let 
Emelio Quintero, a 17-year-old dishwasher from Moorpark, leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharrow, 32 of Burbank, saw the cook standing by the front door with one of 
the suspects pointing a handgun at him. The man told Sharrow not to move, 
officials said, but he darted back into the restaurant, locked himself in the 
office and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero also ran back inside and set off the motion detector, which sounded 
an audible alarm that scared the suspects away, officials said. The men fled on 
foot, leaving the unharmed cook in front of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 deputies responded to Sharrow's report of a hostage situation, 
including two with police dogs. A perimeter was set up around the restaurant 
but officers were unable to locate the suspects. The investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Terry Hughes said the employees' decision was risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know if it's smart or stupid until after it's done," Hughes said. 
In this case, he said, "what they did was smart." TRACY WILSON

ELECTIONS; DEMOCRATS' PLAN TO ENDORSE CANDIDATES RUNS INTO A SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan was simple. Democratic Party officials would huddle Saturday and pick 
their favorite local candidates for official party endorsement before voters 
cast their ballots in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope was to avoid messy primary battles by steering money and endorsements 
to one candidate who could focus on beating the Republican opponent in the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 But party officials failed to muster the support needed to endorse any of the 
legislative and congressional candidates in contested primary races. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag at the party's first Regional Pre-primary Endorsement Conference was 
that any candidate had to win 70% of the votes of party officials to get the 
official endorsement. And some delegates, most of them members of Democratic 
central committees and clubs, voted against awarding any endorsements before 
all Democratic voters had their say June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some very strong candidates in some very competitive races and 70% of 
the vote is a large threshold to obtain," said Terry Leftgoff, regional 
director of the Democratic Party. "I think it speaks to the quality of our 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftgoff presided over Saturday's caucus in Santa Barbara, attended by about 
150 delegates and party members representing Ventura, Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates at the caucus said they were uncomfortable with the 
pre-primary endorsement process because it discourages competition while 
maximizing the influence of party leaders on primary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer not to have this process, and I would recommend that to our 
party chairman," said Mindy Lorenz of Santa Barbara, a candidate for a state 
Assembly seat representing portions of Ventura County. "I think we should let 
the voters decide (who they want to represent the party). That's what primaries 
are for." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leftgoff said voters will still have their say at the polls in June, that 
the early endorsements are just another way to help voters measure the strength 
of a candidate's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we can focus on the general election, the more it helps the party 
and candidates themselves," Leftgoff said. "It provides them with the backbone 
for exposure before the party faithful. These are our hard-core volunteers who 
the candidates need support from to run effective races against candidates who 
are better funded." 
</P>
<P>
 In the balloting Saturday, Lorenz, a former Green Party congressional 
candidate, collected 13 votes, while opponent Bob Ream, a former aide to state 
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), garnered 29 votes. Five delegates voted 
for no endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates are competing for the 35th Assembly District seat being 
vacated by Democrat Jack O'Connell, who is running for Hart's seat. The 
district includes Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither candidate captured the party's endorsement, each said they 
were pleased with their showing of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not particularly close," Ream said. "So I feel good about that. It was 
a strong showing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lorenz: "It's a victory for me because Bob didn't get the endorsement. I 
think it's testament to the support that I've been able to build within the 
party. I think I did terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if her former Green Party affiliation might have hurt her in the voting, 
Lorenz said it's "clear I still have a lot of rows to hoe." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates competing in the Democratic primary for the 23rd 
Congressional District seat now held by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
also left empty-handed. The district covers all of Ventura County, except most 
of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Frank Stephenson, a college placement consultant from Ojai, failed 
to collect any votes, while opponent Kevin Ready, an attorney for Santa Barbara 
County, picked up eight. Another eight delegates cast their votes for no 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, a former member of the Green Party, said he believed it was too 
early in the campaign season and that many delegates are still unfamiliar with 
the candidates. He said he also had reservations about the pre-primary 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ready said he believed some delegates cast votes for no endorsements simply 
because they don't believe the party should be giving early endorsements to 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know for a fact of at least four people who voted for no endorsements are 
supporting my candidacy, but they don't support this process," Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ream said he believes that once people are more comfortable with the process 
that it can be effective, particularly in congressional races, where an early 
endorsement can give a candidate a big boost in terms of organizational and 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates managed to muster the votes for candidates running for 
legislative seats who are unopposed in the Democratic primary. They include 
O'Connell and Dorothy Maron, who hopes to unseat Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) in the 37th Assembly District that stretches from Oxnard to Thousand 
Oaks.

4 ARRESTED IN VENTURA GUN SHOW STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working undercover in a sting operation, Ventura police officers bought a 
variety of weapons Saturday at the Ventura County Fairgrounds Gun Show and 
promptly arrested the sellers for failing to observe the state's mandatory 
15-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun show has gotten the reputation as an easy place to purchase guns 
illegally," said Sgt. Carl Handy of the Ventura Police Department. "We just 
want to send the message that we're not going to allow that in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Handy said the sellers were walking through the crowded exhibit hall holding 
up signs advertising the sale of guns, ranging from a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol with a night scope, to a .357 magnum "Dirty Harry" 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellers were taken to the Ventura Police Station where they were issued 
misdemeanor citations and released. If convicted, each faces up to six months 
in jail or fines of up to $1,000, Handy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat McMann, organizer of the annual gun show, said he did not know anything 
about the illegal sales or the undercover operation. He declined to comment on 
the incident or the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun show featured hundreds of sellers and thousands of gun enthusiasts, 
Handy said. Only one of the individuals arrested Saturday had guns displayed at 
a booth in the exhibit hall. The three others arrested were not registered to 
sell weapons at the gun show. Instead, each walked through the crowd looking 
for prospective buyers, police said.

 A fifth individual, who was a registered seller, was issued a citation, but 
not arrested, for selling kits to convert semiautomatic weapons into fully 
automatic machine guns, police said. A semiautomatic weapon fires once and 
automatically reloads, while a fully automatic weapon fires continuously as 
long as the trigger is held down. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy said he still was unsure if the individual selling the machine gun kits 
was breaking the law. The sergeant said he would turn the case over to the 
state attorney general's office for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "California law is written in a funny way," Handy said. "There were people 
walking out the door with fully automatic AK-47s who didn't have to go through 
the 15-day waiting period because the weapons are stamped with a hammer and 
sickle and considered a collector's gun and not subject to the waiting-period 
law."

SCHOOL CONSIDERING UNIFORMS FOR STUDENTS; SIMI VALLEY: RECENT FATAL STABBING AT 
VALLEY VIEW JUNIOR HIGH HAS PROMPTED THE IDEA. BUT SOME ARGUE IT WOULD NOT 
AFFECT BEHAVIOR ON CAMPUS. 
</P>

 Ninth-grader Chad Hubbard's stabbing death nearly two months ago at Valley 
View Junior High School has jolted the staff, students and parents into an 
intense period of re-examining everything from discipline to the dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Simi Valley school plans to survey parents and teachers on 
whether its 1,050 seventh- through ninth-graders should wear uniforms to steer 
them away from street-style baggy pants and the casual attitude some think they 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea sprang from a meeting of teachers, parents and students -- one of 
many committees that have been looking hard at discipline problems and the 
school atmosphere since Chad was slain, allegedly by a schoolmate, on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things happen in life that force you to refocus on what you're doing," 
Assistant Principal Donna Freeman said. "Any major event or trauma in your life 
is going to force you to refocus your priorities, and we wanted to make sure we 
were refocusing (ours)." 
</P>
<P>
 The committees also are looking at security, parental involvement, difficult 
students and classes to help youths resolve conflicts peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the schools in Simi Valley are going through this now," said Don 
Gaudioso, Valley View's principal. "But we're doing a much more extensive 
review." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of Valley View students are taking more interest in their children's 
welfare -- in large part because Chad's death pushed the school to intensify 
and add to policy reviews that already were under way, Gaudioso said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, kids were able to assure parents that once they were in junior 
high, they were OK by themselves and they didn't want (parents) around any 
more," Gaudioso said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's sort of a motto we're trying to convey that, basically, junior high 
is not the time to drop out of your child's life," he said. "That's the time 
they need your support because of all the changes they're going through." 
</P>
<P>
 But by no means do all the teachers, students and parents agree on how to make 
Valley View a calmer and safer place to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code committee agreed to send out a survey on "school outfits" -- 
the term "uniforms" was deemed too negative -- only after long and spirited 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In one meeting last Thursday, talk bounced from the banning of hats to the 
idea that making students tuck in their shirts could simultaneously solve the 
dress-code no-nos of bare midriffs and low-slung, baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Students seem to pay less attention and misbehave more often when the dress 
code is relaxed or ignored, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula McCormack, the school's guidance counselor, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can change with fashion and with style," McCormack said. "But I 
don't want a going-to-the-beach look, I don't want a hanging-out-at-the-mall 
look. I want a going-to-school look." 
</P>
<P>
 Tightening the dress code to restrict or outlaw hats or baggy pants could be 
only a temporary fix because fashions may change by September, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To you, do all baggy pants relate to gangs?" asked Nicole Thiesen, 13, an 
eighth-grader on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They relate to school," Freeman answered. "They relate to what is the outlook 
of the child when they come to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Some adult committee members pointed out that misbehavior and even juvenile 
arrests have declined in uniform-mandatory schools in Burbank and cities such 
as Baltimore, where all public school students must wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole and Valley View classmate Ilene Squires, 12, said that students 
probably will break the code regardless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way you dress has nothing to do with how good you do in class," Ilene 
said of the proposal. "You guys are trying to enforce something that I don't 
feel will work. Kids'll go out and try to dress like that, but they'll change 
it so they can look like they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Michel, a Valley View parent on the dress code committee, added: "I don't 
care for this, and I think the kids -- the majority of them -- won't care for 
this either. You have 30 or 40 bad apples, so you're going to make a decision 
for 1,200 kids." 
</P>
<P>
 McCormack said the school probably will air the idea of school outfits this 
week in surveys that are mailed to parents and distributed to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other surveys are planned, including one teachers are filling out on what 
parents can do on campus to improve the learning atmosphere at Valley View. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, a survey given in homerooms asked students to list the three 
worst discipline problems at Valley View. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were fireworks, fighting and weapons, with smoking, drug and alcohol 
use, and disrespect close behind, according to the results of 725 surveys 
completed properly, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent events such as Chad's death and the detonation of a firecracker outside 
a classroom may have skewed results, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst discipline problem by far is disrespect for each other and for 
teachers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "I was very pleased, for the most part, with what I saw the 
kids write." The students surveyed urged school disciplinarians to punish their 
peers with penalties ranging from calls to their parents to arrests by police. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the students said they do not like ratting on their friends and 
would hesitate to report rule-breakers to teachers, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good about the fact that 50% of the kids would feel comfortable 
coming to a teacher or parent about these," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say they hope this period of soul-searching will lead Valley 
View to a better atmosphere for learning and a better life for its students.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to have an ongoing review of the policies and procedures," 
Gaudioso said. "We're not looking at it as a one-time procedure."

PANTHERS FIREFIGHTER SHOT TO DEATH AT PARTY; CRENSHAW: MAURICE WHITE'S VIOLENT 
DEATH IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO HIS WORK IN THE GROUP THAT CAME TO SYMBOLIZE THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. 
</P>

 Maurice White, an original member of the South-Central Panthers firefighting 
team, died earlier this month from gunshot wounds inflicted during a party in 
South-Central Los Angeles. He was 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton Division police said White was shot March 5 when a fight broke out at a 
house party on East 22nd Street. It was unclear if White was directly involved 
in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 White's violent death is in sharp contrast to his work in the Panthers, a 
group that came to symbolize the possibility for peaceful coexistence and team 
spirit among former gang members. White joined the Panthers last June when the 
job training program, co-sponsored by the U.S. Forestry Service, became 
available through the Crenshaw-based L.A. Unemployed Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen Panthers quickly attracted media attention because the one-time 
rival gang members learned to work side by side in life-threatening situations. 
The Panthers received national media coverage last fall when the team spent 
16-hour days battling the disastrous Malibu and Altadena fires. 
</P>
<P>
 White, called "Reesey" by close friends and family, was one of the most 
inspirational members of the team, recalled fellow Panther Clinzell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a really caring guy," said Washington. "If he saw you down, he would 
help you, pump you up, keep you going," said Washington. "He gave you this 
feeling that if he could do it, so could you." 
</P>
<P>
 White, a student at Compton College who said he most enjoyed philosophy 
courses, was also remembered for his constant espousing of black pride and 
discussions of how to improve conditions in African American communities. He 
frequently sported African beads, earrings and other jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Panther Clifton Dunlap said White, who had been involved with gangs, saw the 
Panthers as a perfect opportunity for black people to come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have had our differences, but we worked together," Dunlap said. 
"Maurice always thought positively about the black community. He used to work 
so hard fighting fires he'd always sleep the whole way back home on the bus. 
But he was a great motivator. We truly lost our brother."

DEVOUT PARISHIONER STANDS UP TO CATHOLIC CHURCH; MONTEREY PARK: EDDIE RAMIREZ 
IS LEADING A FIGHT AGAINST PLANS TO TURN HIS PARISH INTO A CENTER FOR 
EVANGELICAL OUTREACH TO THE CHINESE COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each morning, Eddie Ramirez slides a well-worn holy card into the left pocket 
of his shirt, snugly over his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The card depicts El Santo Nino de Atocha, the Mexican Child Jesus, whom 
Ramirez credits with saving his life when as a teen-ager he was given six 
months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 72, Ramirez isn't shy about whom to thank for his recovery from 
tuberculosis or the success that once seemed elusive to the son of immigrant 
cannery workers. Phrases such as "Praise Jesus" and "Thank the Lord" issue from 
him in loud, continual exclamations. In his dining room stands a makeshift 
altar complete with Bible, rosary and lighted candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone who knows him, including his pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas 
Church in Monterey Park, thought until recently that Ramirez would have sooner 
missed Sunday Mass than challenge the church. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramirez has metamorphosed from pious parishioner to strident critic. He 
led the fight against the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles' plans to turn 
his parish into a center for evangelical outreach to the Chinese community -- 
and wrung apologies and concessions from church leadership that at first flatly 
refused to change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, who dominate the membership at St. Thomas Aquinas, saw the outreach 
plan as an effort to take their church away from them, despite vows to the 
contrary by the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino parishioners were especially concerned because the plans called for 
transferring Father Brian Cavanagh, the one priest who spoke some Spanish, to 
bring in two Chinese-speaking priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting this takeover," Ramirez said. "It makes us feel that we're not 
important, that we've been denied representation as Spanish-speaking people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is still fighting, despite several compromises made by Cardinal Roger 
Mahony during a surprise visit to St. Thomas Aquinas: Cavanagh would stay on 
temporarily, the cardinal said, and parishioners would be involved in the 
outreach plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mahony's visit, some opponents pledged to work with the new priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Ramirez. That Sunday, he walked up to Mahony and called him a Pharisee, 
invoking a Biblical parable about hypocrites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus is on our side, and the Cardinal is not being righteous," Ramirez said 
one morning last week, sipping coffee in his home. "This is only buying more 
time, and it's a lot of rhetoric. I don't see anything of substance." 
</P>
<P>
 he archdiocese has had equally harsh words for Ramirez, whom it accuses of 
inflaming passions and spreading rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reading I get is that most of the parishioners are quite happy," said 
Father Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the archdiocese. "But 
there is this core group with Eddie Ramirez as their spokesman who are 
determined to get their own way." 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting with Mahony, Ramirez softened his words. He won't stop 
fighting for his people's rights, he said, but he will watch to see what the 
church has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's fight against the archdiocese isn't as out of character as it might 
seem for a devout Catholic. In 1970, long before affirmative action became a 
household phrase, Ramirez ran for governor in the Democratic primary against 
Jesse Unruh, who lost to Ronald Reagan in the general election. Although 
Ramirez knew he would not win, he entered the election to draw attention to the 
plight of Latinos, whom he believed were not adequately represented in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing 6-foot-1, with blue eyes and brown hair combed straight back, Ramirez 
cuts a striking figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has charisma, he can convince and motivate people," said Monty Villajin, a 
fellow parishioner at St. Thomas Aquinas. "We really appreciate what he did for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is used to beating back obstacles to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Sacramento to Mexican immigrants who worked in canneries, Ramirez was 
the only one of 11 siblings to receive a formal education. When the family 
moved to Los Angeles, Ramirez enrolled at Roosevelt High School, where he read 
so fast that teachers sent him to the library during reading lessons so he 
could plunge ahead on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he was one of about five Latinos to enroll at UCLA in 1940. 
Always good in math and science, he decided to become a pharmacist. To make 
ends meet, he sold fruits and vegetables door-to-door in East Los Angeles, 
lugging wooden crates filled with produce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, he developed tuberculosis and was sent to a Sylmar sanitarium, where 
doctors saw abscesses the size of silver dollars on each lung and gave him six 
months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But "our heavenly father had other plans for me," Ramirez said. His pious 
mother brought him a novena of the Santo Nino de Atocha, the Child Jesus. He 
said the prayers for nine days and sensed the tide turning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the presence of Jesus," Ramirez recalled. "I cried like a baby. I knew 
I was going to get well." Six months later the doctors told him his lungs were 
completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later he tried to return to college -- this time USC -- to finish 
his degree. When he was told there was no room for new students because the GIs 
returning from World War II had priority, Ramirez went back to his car and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 God spoke to him again, he said, as always at pivotal moments throughout his 
life: "The Lord lightened me up. He said, 'You're not a new student, you're a 
re-entering student.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez got out of his car, marched to the front of the line and told the 
clerk he was a re-entering student. He got priority over the GIs. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning his degree in 1951, Ramirez worked for others for two years, 
then decided to buy the drugstore where he had shined shoes as a child. He 
married a friend of his sister. He and his wife, Delores, have six sons and a 
daughter. All but one work as health professionals -- doctors, nurses, 
pharmacists. The youngest studies creative writing at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, the family moved to a newly built home on a Monterey Park bluff. It 
was mainly white and Latino then; today most of their neighbors are Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said Catholic clerics often visited his Boyle Heights pharmacy for 
free medicine, including the nuns from St. Vibiana parish Downtown, where 
Cardinal Mahony lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell my staff, 'Don't you charge my nuns,' " Ramirez recalled. "We 
took care of the priests for a long time too, but now they have insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) remembers the Ramirez pharmacy as the 
hub of neighborhood life. "It was the place where people would congregate and 
talk," Torres said. "He really had his finger on the pulse of what was going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, whose friendship with Ramirez goes back decades, called the pharmacist 
"a man of conscience, of deep faith and compassion" and said he is not 
surprised at Ramirez's full-bore attack on the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he feels there's a problem to be remedied, he seeks a solution to it," 
Torres said. "I have always admired that of him; he is an inspiration to young 
people to never give up a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's activities in Democratic politics go way back. In 1949, he 
campaigned for Edward R. Roybal, the first Latino elected in this century to 
serve on the Los Angeles City Council and later the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, ignorance about Mexican Americans ran so high that another 
councilman reportedly introduced Roybal as "our new Mexican councilman who also 
speaks Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez helped rally the Latino vote for President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 
election campaign and was rewarded with an invitation to the LBJ ranch, where 
he met Johnson and shook hands with the president of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Ramirez ran for Congress. Then in 1970 came his run for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican Americans will no longer sit silently and idly by while being 
bypassed by calculating and manipulating politicians," Ramirez told a local 
newspaper that year. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign speeches, he railed against the gerrymandering of political 
districts that split the Latino vote among Los Angeles County districts and 
diluted their political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez now jokes ruefully that he was 20 years too early. In 1990, a U.S. 
District Court judge ruled that Los Angeles County supervisors had 
discriminated against the county's 3 million Latinos in drawing district 
boundaries that fragmented Latino neighborhoods. Redrawn boundaries created a 
new, predominantly Latino 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ramirez nearly died from a hematoma of the lumbar plexus that put 
him in a wheelchair until he could learn to walk again. But his usual willpower 
and belief in God pulled him through. 
</P>
<P>
 "You resign yourself, you say, 'Jesus, I love you, I'm ready,' but it wasn't 
my time yet. The Lord had something else for me to do. And now I know what it 
is," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said that during his recovery, Father Cavanagh visited him at least 
three times a week at home. The two grew closer, but Cavanagh never dreamed 
that Ramirez would one day rise up against the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never a rabble-rouser," Cavanagh said this week. "He'd be the last one 
you'd think would do that. Eddie has always had a reputation for being an 
ultra-religious man. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only outspoken thing he had was religious language . . . People joked 
that he was trying to take the priest's job away, using all those religious 
metaphors." 
</P>
<P>
 The church's announcement about its plans for Chinese outreach brought 
Ramirez's dormant rabble-rousing instincts back to the fore. Close to 75% of 
the church's 1,200 families are Latino; about 20 families are Chinese American. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Latinos and several Asian Americans complained, the church was 
transferring a beloved priest who could minister to members in Spanish and 
erecting a Chinese Community Center on the church grounds that few in the 
congregation would use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The church reassured the parish that all Latino-oriented ministries, such as a 
Spanish Mass and Spanish prayer groups, would continue and that the move was 
meant to add to the parish, not push Latinos away. One of the new priests also 
speaks a little Spanish, the archdiocese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez emerged almost overnight as leader of the parish unity group 
protesting the changes, even though he had little experience in church politics 
and had only recently joined the parish council, a group of lay people who 
advise the pastor on issues that concern the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't sit down and vote him into office; it just came out that way," said 
Alfred Valdez, a parishioner who has long been active in church affairs. "He's 
a very devoted man. He's the most outspoken of all of us and has very good 
experience in how to get through to the media." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ramirez continues to wage his fight, his phone rings all day long and he 
switches fluidly from English to Spanish as he updates parishioners on the 
effort to thwart the archdiocese's plans. Most evenings are spent in prayer 
meetings or strategy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In CNN sound bites, Ramirez argued in his forceful, staccato style that it was 
ridiculous to remove a priest who could say Mass, preach and minister to the 
people in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped organize demonstrations in which hundreds of angry congregants 
marched in front of St. Vibiana Cathedral, carrying signs that read: "Why our 
parish, we want answers" and "How much will it cost to buy our church back?" 
</P>
<P>
 He framed the issue in political terms, accusing the church of bullying 
Latinos because it believed they wouldn't dare challenge the authority of their 
religious leaders. He said archdiocese attempts to reach out to the Chinese 
were having the opposite effect, as several prominent Chinese American 
parishioners vowed to leave the church over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters did their best to illustrate that St. Thomas Aquinas was already a 
multicultural church, where people of Filipino, Mexican, Chinese and Italian 
heritage worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the archdiocese stood firm, saying the church was not a democracy 
and the outreach plan was needed. But the controversy refused to die; it 
reached ever higher as local politicians, including Chinese Americans, offered 
support. In the past six weeks, Ramirez said his group has bombarded Mahony's 
office with 500 letters and hundreds of phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony, during his surprise visit to St. Thomas Aquinas earlier this month, 
apologized for not bringing parishioners into the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter read in English, Spanish and Chinese, the archdiocese agreed to 
back off its initial plan and create a planning committee to be chaired by 
Bishop Gabino Zavala, the new regional bishop for the San Gabriel Valley. 
Zavala will appoint nine parishioners -- three Latinos, three whites and three 
Chinese Americans -- to plan outreach to the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanagh will stay on as co-pastor until June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, however, wants a Spanish-speaking priest full time at St. Thomas 
Aquinas instead of a priest who visits each Sunday for Spanish Mass. 
Ironically, Ramirez now wants someone fluent in Spanish, unlike Cavanagh, who 
can minister to Latinos in their own language but considers himself far from 
fluent. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants to make sure any community center built on the church grounds 
would be open to all parishioners.  
</P>
<P>
 The man who took on the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and won at least a partial 
victory has no doubts he will succeed. Failure is not a word that exists in his 
vocabulary. And besides, he says, the Lord is on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never felt we were going to lose," Ramirez said. "I've always felt, 
I'm going to do this and I'm going to give it my best shot."

QUAKE GIVES PASSOVER NEW MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jews throughout Southern California marked the beginning of the eight-day 
Passover observance at sundown Saturday at traditional Seders, or ritual meals, 
that recounted the ancient biblical story of the Exodus of Jews from Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most celebrated the holiday at home with family and friends, about 
200 Jews gathered at a West Hills temple for a community Seder honoring 
Northridge earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passover is a season of rebirth and renewal for us in two ways this year," 
said Rabbi Harold Caminker of Temple Solael. "We want to express our hope that 
there will be peace between Israel and her neighbors and pray to Mother Nature 
after that jolt she gave us." 
</P>
<P>
 Caminker said many in his congregation were affected by the Jan. 17 quake and 
this Passover serves as a special reminder to them about the wonders of their 
God. 
</P>
<P>
 Madelon Cohen, 68, said the dining room of her Woodland Hills home was 
severely damaged in the earthquake, forcing her to cancel her traditional home 
Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dining room wall is caving in and it just wasn't safe to have 30 people 
come over," Cohen said, as she held her 2-year-old grandson's hand. "But I am 
grateful to be here. Solael is my temple and my home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seder begins as two candles are lit and the story of the Israelites' 
deliverance from Egyptian bondage is read from the Haggada.  
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic food is laid out on a platter -- a roasted lamb shank that symbolizes 
the lamb sacrificed on the eve of the Exodus; a roasted egg, which is a temple 
sacrifice made on all holidays; bitter herbs symbolizing the bitterness of the 
Jews' slavery in Egypt, and a mixture of ground apples, nuts and wine 
symbolizing the mortar out of which the slaves made bricks. The last food is 
parsley, a sign of spring or rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 A stack of matzo, or unleavened bread, is placed beside the platter, 
representing the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, and a dish of 
saltwater for dipping is provided, signifying the tears of the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 For young Jews such as Rachel Caminker, 10, the Seder is a time to be with 
family and friends. Although Passover is her favorite holiday because of the 
stories read from the Haggada, Caminker had one complaint. "I don't like the 
part about not eating any bread for seven days," the rabbi's daughter said. 
"It's too long." 
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging also held a community 
Passover celebration for about half of its 750 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi William Gordon led residents, ranging in age from 85 to 107, in a Seder 
celebrating the customs of the Ashkenazic Jews, or European Jews. Tonight, the 
practices of Sephardic Jews, who have their roots in Spain and countries along 
the Mediterranean, will be observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Turner, spokesman for the Jewish Home, said although a few residents 
will be joined by their families, most depend on the home to provide them with 
the spiritual celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here have outlived some of their children," said Turner, noting that 
20 residents are over 100. "We are trying to make this home their family now." 
</P>
<P>
 Struck by the rejuvenation theme, Valley residents who experienced the 
earthquake are just happy to have some place to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel closer because of the earthquake," said Ceena Holzer, of 
Calabasas, who attended the community Seder at Temple Solael with her husband, 
Stephen, and their three children. "This extended family is as important as the 
ones you are related to."

HOMELESS SHELTER'S COOKING CLASSES ARE A RECIPE FOR HOPE; JOBS: STUDENTS WHO 
COMPLETED CULINARY ARTS COURSE EARN RESTAURANT POSITIONS. ONE PROUD GRADUATE 
SAYS HE'S READY TO MAKE A NEW START. 
</P>

 Marvin always had a fascination with food. He even dreamed of one day owning a 
Cajun restaurant specializing in the spicy delicacies he savored as a child. 
But life on the streets forced many of his dreams to take a back seat to other 
demons haunting his life. 
</P>
<P>
 For more months than he wants to remember, the 36-year-old Los Angeles native, 
who asked that his last name not be used, wandered the streets between homeless 
shelters -- not caring about his future, not certain of his next meal. 
</P>
<P>
 That all began to change when he stepped into the New Image Emergency Shelter 
at Grand Avenue and 18th Street in Downtown Los Angeles and enrolled in a 
program teaching residents the culinary arts. Twenty-two students signed up, 
but only six completed the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The first graduating class received their diplomas in a special ceremony 
during which guests were entertained with live jazz and given the opportunity 
to sample a sumptuous meal of prime rib, chicken breasts, baked potatoes and 
vegetables, topped off with peach cobbler for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I feel I'm about to get myself focused," said Marvin proudly, certificate 
in hand. "I'm ready to make a new start." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin's new start will come in the form of a job. For completing the program, 
all of the graduates are assured work in a restaurant in Los Angeles or Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the creation of William Berkley, an experienced chef who has 
worked in restaurants across the country from Denny's to Hilton hotels. Berkley 
runs the shelter kitchen that feeds about 300 homeless people a day with the 
help of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berkley noticed that many of his kitchen helpers volunteered in exchange for 
extra food, but others seemed fascinated with the cooking arts. "They wanted to 
learn what happens, they were interested and that's all it took," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of shelter administrators, he put together a program of classes 
for students who prepare meals for shelter residents. The program was backed 
with instructional material and other assistance from Los Angeles Trade 
Technical College, Crown Plaza Hotel and the Queens Restaurant of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants worked from sunrise to sunset learning about setting tables, 
sanitation, food preparation, portion sizes and the dangers of bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone can run a kitchen," said Brenda Wilson, New Image's executive 
director. "The primary focus is to help them get back into the mainstream, back 
to independent living." 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnnie Turman, 50, who made his way to Los Angeles on a freight train, it 
was more than a chance at a new start. "A lot of times when you are homeless, 
you don't know where your next meal is coming from," he said. "Now I do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the graduation ceremony, a band played, and politicians and their 
representatives handed out awards. Guest speaker Marla Gibbs, entertainer and 
community activist, delivered an inspirational message. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs told the graduates that the road to success often begins at the bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't look down on service jobs," she said. "It's part of a team effort. . . 
. I expect to see you guys in the best places. I expect to be eating in your 
restaurants one day." 
</P>
<P>
 For Linda Williams, the top graduate of the class, the message had special 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been living in shelters since arriving in Los Angeles last year from 
Texas. She and her husband now have jobs preparing meals for residents at 
another homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm a whole person," she said. "Maybe my husband and I will have a house 
someday. God has been good. I could still be on the streets. I'm truly 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 After the graduation, the students traded in their caps for culinary uniforms 
and marched into the kitchen to finish preparing the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, Berkley reminded the students of an old saying: "Give a man a fish 
and you feed him for a day, but teach him how to fish and he can feed himself 
for a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Berkley made the saying a little more personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do you know how to fish, but you can also prepare it too."

AID LOGJAM LEAVES NERVOUS WRECKS; QUAKE: MANY LANDLORDS ARE RUNNING SHORT OF 
PATIENCE AND MONEY. A FLOOD OF APPLICANTS HAS DELAYED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After major heart surgery and nearly 40 years nurturing a small, family-run 
string of Los Angeles apartment buildings, Kenneth Shaffer was sailing smoothly 
toward retirement last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But his dreams ran violently aground in January's squall of seismic activity, 
which left one of his buildings destroyed, another shaken from its foundation 
and others battered enough to scare off tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the 73-year-old landlord is struggling to stay afloat as he navigates the 
Small Business Administration disaster assistance program, the main channel of 
relief for owners of thousands of damaged rental units. Inundated with a record 
number of business and homeowner loan requests -- already more than the 
combined total of applications in the Midwest floods, Hurricane Andrew and 
Hurricane Hugo -- federal officials acknowledge that paperwork is backing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a month and half after filing his application, Shaffer finally 
completed the first leg of approval -- meeting with a federal appraiser to 
verify his damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get much sleep. . . . The delays in this are just amazing," said 
Shaffer, who has lost nearly a quarter of the 250 rental units he accumulated 
over a lifetime's work. 
</P>
<P>
 With post-quake bills piling up and cash flow down, it's nail-biting time for 
many mom-and-pop apartment owners such as Shaffer, already squeezed by three 
years of recession and declining rents. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, private landlords make up the bulk of apartment owners. How they fare 
with the Small Business Administration could affect the post-quake dynamics of 
the local rental housing market, government and housing industry officials say. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 50,000 apartment units declared uninhabitable in Los Angeles, 
authorities fear that thousands of rental units could be lost, pushing up rents 
in some areas and shrinking the availability of affordable units. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how serious that threat is remains unclear, officials and industry 
leaders say. But the risk that large numbers of units could be abandoned 
increases the longer it takes landlords to patch together refinancing 
agreements with the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SBA is the key to everything," said Los Angeles housing department 
manager Gary Squier. "They are the ones with (low-interest) money . . . the 
primary vehicle for assisting (apartment) owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been (two months) since the earthquake. If the SBA program is going to 
be effective, we should start seeing loans being made very shortly. This is 
sort of a critical time." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials echo that anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are . . . trying to pull their assets back from the brink of 
disaster," said Bill Shaw, president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles. "There's a lot of anguish out there. (The SBA) is certainly slower 
than most people hoped it would be. It's very cumbersome for some people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials say they are moving as quickly and responsibly as possible to 
process the unparalleled load of more than 140,000 applications, with the 
number swelling by thousands per day. At the two-month mark after the disaster, 
the agency had reached a decision on less than 25% of the loan requests, 
compared to 85% in the Midwest floods and 75% in Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are enormous . . . completely outside of anyone's experience," 
said Bernard Kulik, the agency's assistant administrator for disaster 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are sensitive to landlords' needs, agency officials note that 
they are lending taxpayers money that must be repaid, unlike the emergency 
assistance grants rushed to victims immediately after the earthquake. As such, 
the agency is performing a case-by-case balancing act: trying to help 
applicants get back on their feet with 4% interest loans but ensuring that 
public funds can be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, many apartment owners were in precarious financial 
conditions after years of soft rental markets and evaporating equity. Most 
could not afford earthquake insurance, which makes them eligible for agency 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency has approved more than 20,000 loans, totaling about $600 
million, only several hundred involve apartment operators. The overwhelming 
majority are going to homeowners, who also rely on the Small Business 
Administration for reconstruction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a tiny fraction of that money has made it to business applicants, 
including apartment owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an instantaneous process. . . . We are not an immediate response 
(agency)," said Gretchen Fournier, an agency spokeswoman. "This is a loan 
program that takes financial analysis, which takes some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews show that landlords are having a range of experiences with the 
agency, and not all of them negative. "I am very delighted. They handled me 
very well," said a Westside retiree, who had received the first $10,000 
increment of a $150,000 loan to repair his red-tagged, 10-unit apartment 
building.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Tang, whose four-unit Hollywood building is a total loss, said the only 
frustrating part of his dealings with the agency was the chaos and long lines 
at the Disaster Assistance Center in the first days after the earthquake. After 
that, he was "pretty satisfied" with the pace toward approval of his $474,000 
request, although he decided last week to forgo an agency rebuilding loan 
because the soft rental market makes the project too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't add up," said Tang, who hopes to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Other anxious apartment owners are finding an infuriating mix of delays in the 
far-flung, multistaged process that extends to a massive center in Sacramento 
and a check writing facility in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm emptying my bank account. I'm juggling my credit cards. . . . I'm afraid 
I may lose (my) building," said retired teacher Richard Daukas, who has run a 
gantlet of jammed phone lines and message machines trying to get a $186,900 
loan to repair his 15-unit Sherman Oaks building, a retirement investment. 
</P>
<P>
 With broken drywall, flooded apartments and severely damaged stucco, Daukas 
raced to get his Small Business Administration application completed three days 
after the earthquake. Two weeks later, he was told that his loan was approved 
and that formal agreements would arrive in days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been calling and calling and calling. They keep telling me that it's in 
the legal department. . . . They said there's been some kind of glitch. They 
don't know what exactly," Daukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Daukas said the loan papers had finally arrived and he 
anticipates a two- to three-week wait for his check. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, officials indicated that loans would be approved one to three weeks 
after a complete application was filed. "It became evident very quickly . . . 
we could not meet that," Kulik said. Officials said apartment and business 
loans are taking an average of four weeks to approve, although clearly some are 
taking far longer. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the backlog has been the need to hire and train the hundreds of 
additional loan processors, Kulik said. Previous disasters have been largely 
handled by a core of employees who are familiar with the agency's procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays in Shaffer's request appear to be abnormal, officials insisted, a 
casualty of the huge volume of paperwork and inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even after approval is received, it can take two or three weeks more to 
complete legal documents and have the first loan funds issued, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucratic delays are only part of the problem landlords face in dealing 
with the agency. Even with low-interest borrowing, some buildings do not pencil 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has "never dealt with multifamily (housing) so laden with debt," 
said Bob Moncrief, a city housing official who is working with the federal 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, records show that nearly half of the SBA business loan applications, 
which include apartment operators, have been denied or withdrawn thus far, many 
of them because they could not show adequate cash flow to make payments. 
</P>
<P>
 That is hardest to show for those newer to the apartment market, who tend to 
start with less expensive, more marginally profitable buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that really need help aren't getting it," said Shaw, of the 
apartment association, recalling one immigrant couple who approached him 
frantically at a recent refinancing workshop. They had sunk their assets into a 
building that suffered major quake damage and it now seems nearly impossible to 
qualify for any loan program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was everything these people had. It was gone," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, Carl Lambert managed an unsalvageable 15-unit building that 
was denied a $850,000 reconstruction loan from the agency. It concluded that 
historic rents, which are controlled by the city, did not justify the cost of 
rebuilding, Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials are finalizing legislation to allow landlords to 
increase rents to pay for some earthquake-related costs, and Lambert plans to 
reapply. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism, agency officials say they are offering a bigger assistance 
package than ever. In addition to reconstruction loans, apartment owners for 
the first time are eligible for separate low-interest loans to cover lost 
income from reduced rents and other losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to help save as many marginal buildings as possible, Los Angeles city 
officials are setting up a $30-million loan program for landlords who are 
rejected by the SBA. The program would seek to cover part of landlords' debts 
so they could qualify for agency assistance. Payments on those city loans can 
be deferred until the building turns a profit or is sold. The loans will be 
coordinated with the federal agency, but as yet no loans have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Shaffer -- his dreams of easing into retirement now buried in worries 
about bills, construction delays and debt restructuring -- the end is nowhere 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally got an agency appraiser to his property last week, after 
complaining to city officials about delays. The good news: The appraiser 
indicated that his losses appeared to be at least the $1.3 million he had 
sought, Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But time is money, and Shaffer worries that it could be several weeks before 
he receives his first money and can begin rehabilitating his buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 After borrowing money to make repairs on his buildings that sustained cosmetic 
damage, Shaffer is searching for additional short-term bank loans so repairs 
can begin on his flagship building. The three-story, 37-unit Sherman Oaks 
structure rocked off its foundation and is vacant, listing like a beached 
freighter and sealed off by chain-link fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer has decided to turn back to the lender his 17-unit building, also in 
Sherman Oaks, that partially collapsed off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible. Terrible. The (SBA) delays mean delays all the way down the 
line," Shaffer said. No Small Steps 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Small Business Administration, the primary vehicle for disaster 
assistance to small business owners and homeowners, has been swamped with an 
unprecedented number of applications. Some business complain of long delays in 
the loan process. Officials stress that they cannot guarantee time lines, but 
ideally this is how it should work: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Applicant obtains an application at a disaster assistance center, fills it 
out and returns it with documentation, such as three years of federal tax 
returns, insurance policies, copies of deeds, etc. The SBA says most delays are 
because of incomplete information. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Within a few days, the applicant should receive a postcard acknowledging 
receipt of the file. 
</P>
<P>
 Within five to 10 days, an SBA appraiser should meet with the applicant to 
verify and estimate the amount of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The packages moves to a loan processing center, typically a huge facility 
in Sacramento. Two weeks to one month after filing the application, a decision 
should be made and the applicant notified. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Within a few more days, the applicant should receive final loan documents 
in the mail. They may be completed and returned by mail, but processing can be 
expedited at an SBA processing center. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Once the loan documents are returned and reviewed, a check should be mailed 
to applicant within two to three weeks of being ordered.

STORE CLERK KILLS MAN DURING THEFT ATTEMPT

<P>
 A North Hollywood convenience store clerk shot and killed a robber and wounded 
his alleged accomplice after the two stole cases of beer and then attacked the 
clerk, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano Chaidez, 23, died outside the Circle Seven Food Mart at about 11 p.m. 
Friday after a struggle during which the store clerk shot him in the chest, Los 
Angeles Police Lt. Len Hundshamer said.The clerk also shot and wounded a 
17-year-old who was taken to a hospital and arrested on suspicion of murder 
under a state law allowing murder charges when a death occurs during the 
commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, whose name was withheld by police, was not arrested. The 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone believes their life is in danger and they perceive they are going 
to be hurt, he has the right to defend himself," Hundshamer said. "That's one 
of the things the detectives will be looking into here." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Chaidez and the 17-year-old entered the convenience store about 
10:45 p.m. and attempted to steal two 18-packs of beer. When the clerk tried to 
stop them, Hundshamer said, the 17-year-old threw one of the cases at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk chased the two out of the store and fired warning shots with a 
pistol, Hundshamer said, after which Chaidez apparently threw the other case of 
beer at the clerk, punched him several times in the face and tried to wrest 
away his gun, which the clerk fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the wounded 17-year-old three blocks away. His name is being 
withheld because he is a juvenile. KURT PITZER

FBI'S HONDA PROBE IS NO BIG SURPRISE TO INDUSTRY; INQUIRY: THIRTEEN FORMER 
EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING SEVEN WHO LIVED IN O.C., ARE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH 
ALLEGED KICKBACKS AND BRIBES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When consumers were clamoring for Honda's highly dependable cars in the early 
1980s, longtime Southern California car dealer Bob Estes put in his bid for a 
Honda franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 With his Beverly Hills location, solid financing and 40 years' experience 
selling Volkswagens, Porsches, Lincolns and Mercurys, Estes figured he would 
land a dealership with ease. "I'd known Honda since they first came to the 
country, and they loved my facilities," said Estes, who has since retired but 
still holds a dealer license. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations took an unexpected twist, though, when another dealer described 
"a little deal" that he said required new dealers to pay a surcharge of $150 a 
car to a Honda sales executive in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to kiss off," said Estes, a past president of the California 
Motor Car Dealers Assn. "I was insulted that they'd come at me that way. . . . 
I'd never bought a dealership in my life, and I wasn't going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators on March 14 said they had filed criminal charges against 
13 former American Honda Motor Co. executives, including seven who lived in 
Orange County, in connection with alleged kickbacks and bribes during the 
1980s. Estes says he wonders now whether "I should have gone along for a little 
while and then rung a bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda executives this week would not comment on Estes' allegation or an 
ongoing FBI investigation. Federal agents allege that as many as 13 Honda and 
Acura division executives defrauded Torrance-based American Honda out of $10 
million. Since October, eight former Honda and Acura executives have pleaded 
guilty to fraud-related charges and five more former executives have been 
indicted on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes and others in the automobile and motorcycle sales business say that they 
were not surprised to learn of the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it has taken this long for the issue of dealer payoffs to Honda 
to come to light is nothing short of amazing," said Don Moery, national sales 
manager for Yamaha Motor Corp. until 1990. "These payoff stories have been out 
there for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrants, indictments and other court papers generated by the yearlong 
FBI investigation are peppered with allegations of bribes and kickbacks, 
including $750,000 linked to a Moreno Valley dealership, $50,000 to a 
dealership in Round Rock, Tex., and $100,000 to an Acura franchise in Cocoa 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also allege that the former executives pocketed funds earmarked 
for dealer advertising campaigns, took kickbacks from vendors who supplied 
training programs for dealers' employees, and earned under-the-table profits by 
reselling damaged cars to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda said its internal investigation into possible fraud uncovered 
"isolated policy violations." But the complexity of the schemes "made it 
difficult for us to immediately detect and identify them as interrelated," the 
company stated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estes said he told Honda Motor Co.'s founder, the late Soichiro Honda, 
about the alleged kickback scheme shortly after abandoning his own attempt to 
win a dealership. "I let him know (through an interpreter) what was going on," 
Estes said. "I told him of my dissatisfaction, so the company knew what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents and federal authorities outline some of the alleged schemes in 
search warrants, indictments and other documents. Some of the schemes they 
describe were relatively simple: Executives bought damaged cars from the 
company at a discount, investigators say, and generated thousands of dollars in 
illegal profits by reselling them to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other operations were more complicated. Court documents allege that Newport 
Beach resident Edward A. Temple, a former Honda zone manager who now owns Costa 
Mesa Honda, played a key role in at least two schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, a Honda employee from 1981 to 1989, pleaded guilty in October to one 
count of conspiracy in connection with the fraud investigation. His office 
referred questions about the investigation to Honda officials in Torrance, who 
would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments and other papers filed in U.S. district courts in Santa Ana and 
Concord, N.H., portray Temple as "a close confidant" of S. James Cardiges, 
formerly the top sales executive in the Honda division, who was indicted on 
criminal fraud charges on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that Temple, Cardiges and others at American Honda 
steered potentially lucrative Honda and Acura franchises to "straw dealers," 
groups that had no intention of remaining in business. After American Honda 
awarded dealerships to the bogus groups, court documents state, the exclusive 
franchises were sold, generating kickbacks ranging from $250,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators say that Temple, Cardiges and other Honda executives 
also took illegal stakes in partnerships that were competing for Honda and 
Acura dealerships. In 1987, investigators allege, Temple and Cardiges steered a 
dealership to a businessman in Arkansas in return for a 25% stake in the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda executives each received checks for $162,000 after the dealership 
was sold, according to court documents. Cardiges subsequently demanded that 
Temple prepare a fraudulent promissory note to mislead Honda's internal 
investigation, federal investigators allege. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges, arrested March 11 at his home in Laguna Hills, is scheduled to 
appear later this month in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire. Cardiges' 
attorney, Philip D. Israels, has declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that Cardiges also worked on illegal schemes with several 
other former Honda sales executives, including Corona del Mar resident Mark L. 
Benson, who was Honda's assistant zone manager in Connecticut until 1991. In 
October, Benson, who also has declined to comment on the investigation, pleaded 
guilty to one count of mail fraud in connection with the awarding of 
dealerships in Connecticut and New York state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related search warrant unsealed March 14 in Santa Ana, investigators 
allege that Benson received $250,000 after helping to steer a franchise to a 
dealer in Auburn, N.Y., and $150,000 and a $40,000 Porsche in return for 
influencing the outcome of an application in Westerly, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Honda executives, investigators allege, also misused millions of 
dollars in advertising and dealer-training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators maintain that Cardiges and former Honda executive Dennis R. 
Josleyn, who lives in Southern California, took about $2.5 million in kickbacks 
in 1991 and 1992. Josleyn and Cardiges could be sentenced to 30 years in prison 
if convicted of racketeering, mail fraud and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that the two men steered funds from Honda dealers across 
the country to an unidentified company that provided direct-mail advertising 
and marketing programs -- and kicked back payments to the Honda executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Josleyn, a nine-year Honda veteran whose last position was West Coast manager 
for the Acura division, was unavailable for comment. Honda officials would not 
comment other than to state that executives are prohibited from taking gifts or 
investing in companies that have transactions with the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 But court records show that the former Honda executive's brother was the head 
of an advertising agency that did business with the Honda and Acura divisions. 
Josleyn claimed to be owed $200,000 from a now-defunct Yorba Linda advertising 
agency that went bankrupt in 1992. The agency, Garey & Associates, was owned by 
his brother, Don Gary Josleyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and early 1992, the advertising agency did business with Honda 
and Acura, said Carolyn Davis, credit manager for Colorgraphics, a Los Angeles 
printing company that is still owed more than $100,000 by the failed agency. 
"We knew that (Don Gary's) brother worked for Honda," Davis said. "It was no 
secret." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the work we did (for Garey) was related in one way or another to 
Honda and Acura," Davis said. Colorgraphics also printed a sales brochure for 
Worldwide Dyve Inc., a now-defunct sports apparel company owned by Cardiges.

JAMES FLANIGAN: A STABLE MEXICO STILL GRAPPLING WITH CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Mexico chronically unstable? Is there something really wrong there? 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem that way to many Americans and to even more worried Mexicans as 
the country has been hit with one breakout of violence after another, 
culminating last week in the killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential 
candidate of the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution, or PRI, which has 
ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the PRI, set up to represent a consensus of farmers, workers 
and other major groups, has ruled since 1929 in the name of stability. Now that 
stability is breaking up because change, as it must, is coming to an economy 
that has been run on political patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 For clues to what is really happening, look at the Soviet Union, another 
society that was ruled for seven decades by a single party and where today 15 
separate republics are struggling with economic reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's PRI, to be sure, has not been a vicious, totalitarian ruler like the 
Communist Party. But just as the party in the Soviet Union ruled every village 
and town through local bosses, so the PRI official in every town in Mexico had 
part ownership in most of the industry and power over practically all the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's industry for decades has been heavily state-influenced, and often 
state-owned. And the country has remained grievously underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 30% of Mexico's people are even listed in the labor force -- where 
more than 40% of most developed countries' people are in the work force (the 
U.S. figure is 47%). 
</P>
<P>
 It has been an economy of farm labor and small manufacturing, with a river of 
subsidies from the central government keeping people in jobs but not really 
employed. Official statistics say that one quarter of Mexico's workers are 
underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, coming off a feudal system of landed estates and serf labor that was 
overthrown in 1910, Mexico knew spurts of progress. But the economy stalled out 
in the 1960s. Change might have come then but oil was discovered in the Bay of 
Campeche. Mexico had an oil boom in the 1970s, at which time it also borrowed 
heavily from U.S. and international banks.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, after world oil prices fell, Mexico had a spectacular bust in 1982. 
That's when change began, with the economic modernization programs of President 
Miguel de la Madrid, who served from 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 1,155 state-owned companies in Mexico when de la Madrid took 
office; today there are about 200, and they are being sold into private hands 
under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's companies are being forced to compete with global industry -- a 
change underlined this year as Mexico entered the North American Free Trade 
Agreement with the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Change can be painful. "This is the first recession in 50 years in which 
Mexicans actually lost their jobs," says Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist 
and author who teaches at universities in Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, jobs were financed by tax revenue. Now subsidies are being phased 
out and there is pain in Mexican villages. Muttering is heard that Salinas' 
market-oriented reforms, like those of Boris Yeltsin in Russia, are leaving the 
poor behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexicans fear unrest in those villages. They recall Mexico's history 
after the 1910 Revolution, when the country was torn by bloody civil strife. 
The PRI was set up in 1929 to bring an end to that strife. 
</P>
<P>
 But such fears are overblown. Modern Mexico has been adapting to change for 
more than a decade. The industrial improvement is well along, helped by more 
than $4 billion a year in foreign business investment -- part of a far larger 
annual total of foreign investment in Mexican stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The current hard times result in part from the long recession in the United 
States, which is the best customer for Mexico's exports and also a haven for 
Mexican laborers who come north for work and send money back home. Now that the 
U.S. economy is growing again, Mexico will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, questions arise. Why isn't Mexico growing on its own; why haven't years 
of foreign investment created jobs to replace those displaced by reform? 
</P>
<P>
 The country wasn't ready to receive the investment. Mexico still lacks 
infrastructure for modern industry. The road where Colosio was killed was 
unpaved, as are so many roads in Mexico because successive governments have not 
made the necessary infrastructure investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead money went to subsidies. Agriculture was subsidized to keep food 
prices low for industrial workers in the cities. Poland, under communism, tried 
the same scheme -- which failed in Poland as it has in Mexico. Now both 
countries are trying to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In other ways, the Mexican economy never grew up. Land was distributed to the 
peasants in 1910 but as a sacred trust. They couldn't borrow against it to set 
up a business, nor could they sell their small holdings. So credit never grew, 
small business finance was stunted. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple contrast to South Korea and Taiwan speaks volumes. In those 
successful Asian economies, private industry has funded almost all research and 
development. Companies have developed technology and are globally competitive. 
In Mexico, private industry has contributed almost nothing to R&D; government 
has done the spending, but it has been an ineffectual pittance. 
</P>
<P>
 But if all this is so, why are U.S. companies, and all of world business, so 
interested in Mexico? Because of the country's imminent promise. The 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, noting the investments 
that have been made to modernize Mexico's economy, predicts surging growth for 
the country in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government has made some smart moves -- such as investing 13% of 
its budget in education. As a result, almost 90% of Mexico's population is 
literate -- a far higher ratio than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's 88 million people have the potential to become a tremendous consumer 
economy. Do the math. Mexico today has economic output per person that is only 
one-sixth of such smaller countries as Spain or New Zealand or tiny Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet unlike those countries, Mexico has a special relationship with the United 
States thanks to NAFTA -- and that means open access to the world's largest 
market and flows of investment from the world's largest financial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Mexico unstable? No, it is going through the pain of entering the modern 
world economy, which may be less forgiving than the subsidized system of the 
past, but will be far more rewarding and more secure.

THE CHANGING FACE OF AVIATION; FLYING IN FORMATION; U.S., FOREIGN AIRLINES 
GLIDE INTO NEW MARKETS BY PAIRING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What airline are you flying?" is becoming a more complicated question for 
international travelers as U.S. and foreign carriers rush to forge global 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways passengers from Phoenix to London begin their journey aboard a 
USAir jet. After buying a Northwest Airlines ticket between Amsterdam and 
Detroit, passengers end up with a seat on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. American 
Airlines sells round trips between New York and Johannesburg -- but a South 
African Airways jet does the flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing international passengers and routes represents a dramatic new 
direction for many major U.S. airlines that previously had expanded overseas by 
flying solo. Saddled with a slow-growing, money-losing domestic market, many 
U.S. carriers have decided that it is cheaper, faster and less risky to move 
into rapidly expanding international markets by teaming up with foreign 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to invest in new airplanes. You don't have to hire new pilots 
and flight attendants. You can piggy back off somebody else," said Daniel 
Kasper, vice chairman of the transportation industry program for Coopers & 
Lybrand. "As a practical matter, (this is) the only realistic economic 
opportunity in the short and near term." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the government may soon give such pairings a big boost. Last year, a 
federal aviation commission proposed that Congress relax regulations limiting 
foreign ownership and control of U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliances of foreign carriers now being woven together are considered by 
many analysts a phase in the evolution of world aviation. From a highly 
regulated industry of protected government carriers in most of the world, the 
business is becoming a galaxy of freely competing, privately-owned airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, global airline partnerships take many shapes and forms, ranging 
from simple joint advertising agreements to outright ownership by one airline 
of a stake in another. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sought after and far reaching pacts include so-called code-share 
agreements on international connecting flights. Code-sharing allows both 
British Airways and USAir, for instance, to easily promote and sell tickets on 
their connecting Phoenix to London trip via Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Such arrangements long have been used by major U.S. airlines to offer 
connecting service with smaller commuter carriers. On a global scale, the 
agreements allow two carriers to jointly market and sell fully connecting 
international service between their two countries and other countries as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, code-shared flights are among the first listed in computerized 
airline reservation systems, so they attract the notice of travel agents -- and 
result in more ticket sales for the allied carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their promise, however, global alliances have not produced automatic 
success or profits. In fact, many of the partnerships remain costly money pits 
that have sucked in hundreds of millions of dollars in investment while 
producing little return. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliances are also highly vulnerable to turbulence in international and 
domestic aviation. Last month, aviation treaty disputes threatened to ground 
separate cooperation deals between USAir and British Airways, and between 
United Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, although the deals offer consumers the allure of "seamless travel" on 
a single ticket, automatic transfer of baggage and access to new frequent flyer 
programs, the notion of dividing overseas travel between two carriers still 
makes many travelers wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, customers don't like it," travel agent Thomas Nulty said. 
"Most travelers would rather fly with one carrier." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the drawbacks, both large and small airlines have sought global 
partners to tap into the rapid growth and fat profits promised by the explosion 
of international travel. Contrasted with the stagnant U.S. domestic market, 
international passenger traffic is projected to grow 38% between 1992 and 1997, 
according to the International Air Transport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, both carriers benefit," explained David Hoppin, an airline 
consultant at MergeGlobal in Arlington, Va. "In an environment of weak traffic 
and overcapacity, U.S. airline executives might ask themselves, 'Do we really 
need to have another seven flights to the Stockholm market or do we sign a 
deal?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is a marked departure from that of the 1980s and early 1990s, 
when the largest U.S. carriers -- American, Delta and United -- expanded 
overseas primarily on their own, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to 
buy routes to Asia, Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift began in earnest last year as several major carriers announced 
worldwide partnerships, including USAir and British Airways, Continental 
Airlines and Air Canada, and United and Lufthansa. Even tiny commuter carrier 
AirL.A. joined forces with Mexico's largest carrier, Aeromexico, to offer joint 
Los Angeles-Tijuana service. 
</P>
<P>
 And the trend has continued into 1994. On a single day earlier this month, 
Delta Air Lines agreed to expand an existing partnership with Varig Airlines of 
Brazil and announced the start of a new relationship with Vietnam Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us an immediate presence in a place we have not been before," said 
Clay McConnell, a spokesman for Delta. "It's very important for us." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most intimate global alliances knits Minneapolis-based Northwest 
together with KLM. Code-sharing lets Northwest offer its customers service to 
more than 30 European cities. In return, KLM, which owns 49% of Northwest, can 
sell tickets to nearly 40 cities served by its U.S. partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest flies from San Diego to Geneva via Detroit and Amsterdam -- at least 
in airline-reservation computers. In the real world, however, Northwest flies 
from San Diego to Detroit, where the passenger climbs aboard a KLM flight to 
Amsterdam and then changes to another KLM plane to Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The carriers have gone further, recently announcing the launch of new business 
class cabins and service on international routes. A single, worldwide 
advertising campaign will promote the service, and the business class cabins on 
KLM and Northwest jets will include the same seating, decor and amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is to make sure that the customer doesn't know which 
airline he is flying," said Barry A. Kotar, Northwest general sales manager. 
"The customer will know us as a single product." 
</P>
<P>
 But code-sharing -- domestic and international -- is not without its critics. 
U.S. consumer groups in the early 1980s grew concerned about domestic 
code-sharing as misleading passengers into believing they were flying a single 
carrier instead of two. In response, the government required airlines to reveal 
the nature of code-share flights on domestic and international trips. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stempler, executive director of Washington-based International Airline 
Passengers Assn., says his group has received few complaints about 
international code-share flights. But that could change as the alliances grow 
and U.S. passengers find themselves being handed off from a familiar domestic 
carrier to an unknown foreign airline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where some of the shock comes in," Stempler said. "We haven't got into 
international code-sharing problems -- yet. I think it's still too new." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some airlines involved in code-sharing recognize the potential for 
customer confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, code-sharing in and of itself is a bit potentially confusing 
and misleading," said Tim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman. "The reality 
of the marketplace is that it's there and it's done. To be competitive, it is 
the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of airline alliances and code-sharing has sparked international 
disputes and opposition from several foreign countries -- ranging from the 
Czech Republic to Germany -- and their carriers. Many suspiciously view 
code-sharing as a loophole U.S. carriers are flying through to enter their 
once-closed markets, some international airline and legal observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those countries with airlines that are less efficient, less competitive than 
U.S. carriers, all of a sudden have a problem with this code share," said 
Thomas McLain, who heads the international law practice at Perkins Coie in 
Century City. "It has never been a problem before. Now, this is a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. airlines also feel threatened by the code-sharing alliance of 
British Airways and USAir. American and Delta in particular have lashed out at 
the partnership as giving British Airways unfair access to the United States 
even as U.S. carriers continue to face severe restrictions in Britain and at 
London's Heathrow Airport -- the crossroads of international aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the lack of progress in U.S.-British aviation talks almost 
led the U.S. Department of Transportation to revoke its approval of the 
USAir-British Air code-share plan. Instead, the department granted the two 
carriers a one-year extension on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Various airline partners have suffered financial problems as well: 
</P>
<P>
 * British Airways, which bought a 24% stake in USAir for $400 million last 
year, has frozen plans for further investment until its financially troubled 
partner can restore profits. The two airlines carried only about 6,500 
passengers on their code-share service during the last seven months of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * KLM wrote off its $400-million investment in Northwest last year as the U.S. 
carrier narrowly avoided bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continental Airlines and Scandinavian Airline Systems continue to code share 
even though SAS lost a large investment in Continental when the Houston-based 
carrier reorganized under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't hurt anything," aviation consultant Michael Boyd said of global 
partnerships. "But in terms of contributing a lot to the bottom line, there is 
not much there to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Any substantial payoffs from the airline alliances will not start flowing for 
several years, say industry analysts. By then alliances will be in a good 
position to take advantage of movement in Canada, Europe and Japan to 
deregulate air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the deregulation of worldwide aviation might lead to the break down 
of some airline alliances and code-sharing, because carriers would be free to 
fly wherever they chose. Until then, aviation observers say that partnerships 
and code-sharing will play a growing role, despite their drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now their only choice -- and it might not be a real choice -- is to 
code share," Kasper said. Global Linkage 
</P>
<P>
 More and more American and foreign airlines are sharing passengers, revenues 
and flights through "code share" agreements. These deals allow carriers to 
expand their service without adding planes by sharing airline flight numbers 
and codes in computer reservation systems. For example, Northwest Flight 196 
from San Diego to Minneapolis also appears as KLM flight 196 in reservation 
computers. So a European passenger traveling within the United States can enjoy 
the familiarity -- if not the reality -- of booking a European carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines (based in Chicago) 
</P>
<P>
 Has code-share agreements in place or under development with airlines in Asia, 
the Caribbean, Europe, and South America. United, the largest U.S. airline, 
soon will begin extensive code share with Lufthansa German Airlines, the 
largest carrier within Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 United's international partners include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lufthansa German Airlines (based in Cologne) 
</P>
<P>
 * Thai Airways International (Bangkok) 
</P>
<P>
 * Transbrasil, (Brasilia) 
</P>
<P>
 * British Midland (Derby, United Kingdom) 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunaire Express Airlines (Caribbean) 
</P>
<P>
 * ALM Antillean Airlines (Caribbean) 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines (Dallas) 
</P>
<P>
 International partnerships are fewer and smaller in scope than its U.S 
competitors'. The carrier is looking for other foreign partners, particularly 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 American's international partners: 
</P>
<P>
 * British Midland (Derby, United Kingdom) 
</P>
<P>
 * Gulf Air Co. (Bahrain)  
</P>
<P>
 * Quantas Airways, Sydney (Australia)  
</P>
<P>
 * South African Airways (Johanesburg, South Africa) 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines (Atlanta) 
</P>
<P>
 Has numerous code-share agreements, but most involve service to only a few 
cities. Delta, Swissair and Singapore Airlines own 5% of each other's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's international partners include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Singapore Airlines (Singapore) 
</P>
<P>
 * Swissair (Zurich) 
</P>
<P>
 * Sabena Belgian World Airlines (Brussels) 
</P>
<P>
 * Malev Hungarian Airlines (Budapest) 
</P>
<P>
 * Varig Brazilian Airlines (Rio de Janeiro) 
</P>
<P>
 * Vietnam Airlines (Hanoi) 
</P>
<P>
 * Aeroflot (Moscow) 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines (Minneapolis) 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have one of the world's most extensive 
airline alliances. KLM owns 49% of Northwest; their code sharing involves 
nearly 40 cities in the United States and more than 30 in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Northwest's international partner: 
</P>
<P>
 * KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (Amsterdam) 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines (Houston) 
</P>
<P>
 Has a longstanding code-share relationship with Scandinavian Airline Systems 
(SAS); the airlines share terminal operations at Newark International Airport. 
Air Canada owns 20.5% of Continental, but those don't yet code share. Has 
linked its frequent flyer program with Air France under a marketing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental's international partners include: 
</P>
<P>
 * SAS (Stockholm) 
</P>
<P>
 * Air Canada (Montreal) 
</P>
<P>

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT; HI SENATOR! WHAT'S THE GOOD 
EUPHEMISM? 
</P>

<P>
 In Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass," Humpty Dumpty tells Alice: 
"When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor 
less." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is full of Humpty Dumptys. These men and women prod and poke the 
language to avoid unpleasant realities. If you don't say what a thing really 
means, they figure, the voters won't get mad at you. 
</P>
<P>
 Each governmental department can generate wonderful illustrations of English 
under stress. The Pentagon, for instance, always avoids any hint of bloodshed 
or death when it talks about military matters. When you bomb civilians by 
mistake, it is "collateral damage." The super-killer nuclear missiles deployed 
in the 1980s were the "Peacekeepers." 
</P>
<P>
 When a contractor messes up and has to repay some money to the government on a 
tank or plane project gone bad, the official word is "consideration." Nothing 
so naked and tawdry as a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress and banking regulators faced a crisis when hundreds of savings and 
loans failed in the 1980s. Government insurance protected deposits up to 
$100,000, an unbreakable pledge. So the legislators created an agency to pay 
off the depositors. A truthful name would have been something like, "The 
Department of Bail-Outs." Instead, they gave it a name to conjure up visions of 
a marble-pillared bank -- the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone soon called it the RTC, and the agency's own reputation for clear 
speaking has been mixed at best. A business owner who struggled in vain for 
four years to get an RTC contract was told: "We've put your application in our 
'nonpriority file.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But all these examples are minor league compared to the work of the geniuses 
who write the federal budget documents, regardless of political party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politics of the budget are so difficult because nobody wants to call a 
spade a spade or admit to a tax increase or a spending increase," said Stan 
Collender, director of federal budget policy at the Price Waterhouse accounting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is why we have all these euphemisms and budget sleight-of-hand," 
Collender said. N"Within minutes, people here in Washington who follow these 
things know what they are, but the regular voter -- the ordinary citizen who 
doesn't follow it day to day -- can be easily fooled." 
</P>
<P>
 President Reagan was swept into office as an enemy of big government and never 
wanted to admit when he was asking for higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, his budgeteers invented "revenue enhancement" as a substitute for the 
T-word. Their overly optimistic forecast of future revenues was called a "rosy 
scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is the mirror image of Reagan. "Where the Republicans never 
liked to admit to higher taxes, the Democrats have to find new ways to describe 
spending increases without admitting what they are doing," Collender noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investment" is the magic word for President Clinton. He has asked Congress 
for more money for Head Start, high-performance computing, mass transit, food 
inspections and water-treatment plants for rural areas. All these programs, 
with nothing in common, are lumped together on a long list of "investments" in 
the proposed budget for the fiscal year starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The President can get away with it, because there is no generally accepted 
definition of a government "investment." The Clintonites are like the 
Reaganites. "Things they find important they can justify in their own minds," 
said Collender, who first learned about euphemisms from a high school teacher 
who used the word party whenever he announced a test. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Churchill became Britain's prime minister in 1940, after the Nazi 
armies had roared through Europe. His powerful use of the language became an 
inspiring weapon of war. 
</P>
<P>
 He told Parliament: "You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by 
land, sea and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has 
given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the 
dark and lamentable catalogue of human crimes. That is our policy." 
</P>
<P>
 If Churchill were speaking today in Washington, his words might come out like 
this: "Our objective is the employment of tactical weapons in all theaters of 
combat, backed by maximum effort supplemented by the impact of divine 
assistance, in order to achieve a successful outcome in suppressing completely 
the condign opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's not just to blame government for the disease of weak and obscure 
language. Business does it, too. After all, if my bosses don't like this 
column, the next time the company is "downsized," I might get "outplaced."

BUTTE: OUT OF THE PITS; CITY REAPING A BONANZA AS OLD MINE OOZES POISONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FLORENCE WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Williams is a freelance writer in 
Steamboat Springs, Colo. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Peoples leans out over the viewing station of the state's deepest lake. 
Well, not a lake, exactly; it's a gaping, open-pit mine half filled with toxic 
water -- 17 billion gallons of it, and rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an awful-looking sight out there," says Peoples, an entrepreneur who 
was the city's mayor during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched the copper mine shut down in 1982, leaving 5,000 people unemployed 
and the mile-wide Berkeley Pit smack in the middle of uptown Butte. Now, what 
Peoples used to consider a liability -- the pit and the town's subsequent 
designation as a Superfund site -- he now considers an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "That water down there contains 28 different contaminants," he says, almost 
boastfully. "Butte is the perfect laboratory for the study of environmental 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Butte has turned trash into treasure, attracting millions of federal 
and corporate dollars in the race to design remediation technology. Where this 
Rocky Mountain city of 32,000 people once prospered by making a mess -- as the 
world's top producer of copper -- it now thrives by cleaning up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from hiding its unsightly legacy, Butte markets it, celebrating an 
environmental overhaul that is directed by Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield 
Co., which owns the area's old Anaconda copper mines. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has the extent of pollution we do," says Peoples, president of MSE 
Inc., one of many new technology firms in town. "We are part of the largest 
contiguous Superfund site in the country. We have more different kinds of soil 
and water pollution, with more variety of contaminants, than practically 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 That status -- though hardly the stuff of the typical Chamber of Commerce 
brochure -- has helped the city rebound from 20% unemployment in 1985 to a 7.6% 
jobless rate today. Two years ago, Butte gained population for the first time 
in 40 years. The environmental technology field, including construction and 
earthmoving jobs, out-employs the one remaining copper mine 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having all this pollution may be a dubious distinction, but we see it as an 
advantage," said Evan Barrett, director of the Butte Local Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 One example: In the last few years, over a dozen technology companies have 
come here to test innovative cleanup methods and vie for contracts. The 
companies offer high-paying jobs -- including earth-moving and construction 
work for some of those who were displaced by mine closures. 
</P>
<P>
 One such company is MycoTech. Founded in 1990, the 32-employee, privately held 
firm is developing "fungal biotechnology" to tackle the creosote, coal tar and 
fuel oil residues left from Butte's mining days. MycoTech's prize fungus, known 
as white rot, appears to be adept at breaking down stubborn chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for environmental remediation is immense. Nationwide, 200,000 
inactive mine sites are leaking contaminants, according to the U.S. Bureau of 
Mines. And mines still operating generate another 2 billion tons of waste every 
year, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to innovations in Butte, the cleanup soon may become one of Montana's 
staple industries, along with agriculture, timber and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated Butte and its surroundings 
as a Superfund site in 1987. Although most of the area's mining and smelting 
pollution occurred during the long reign of the Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 
Arco -- which purchased Anaconda in 1977 -- is responsible for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Arco has spent $148 million to move piles of tailings, replace 
contaminated soil and study the many problem areas that remain. The cleanup 
could cost $2 billion, Peoples says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's bad news for Arco is good news for Butte. "The cleanup is not going to 
happen in just five or 10 years," said Bill Rautio, marketing director of the 
local Chamber of Commerce. "This could be a multi-generational, high-tech boom. 
Our problems are that massive." 
</P>
<P>
 Indisputably, Butte's biggest environmental problem is the Berkeley Pit, which 
is filling at a rate of 5 million gallons daily. The water had been pumped out 
when the mine was operating, but now, some 3,000 miles of underground shafts 
feed into the pit, discharging lead, arsenic and trace metals. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxic lake sits safely at the bottom of the groundwater system, but that 
will change as the water level rises.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race against the clock to find a solution," said Tom Malloy, manager 
of MSE's resource recovery project. "Whoever comes up with the best technology 
may get the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 MSE, with 300 employees and $27 million in annual revenue, already receives 
funding from the departments of Energy and Defense and the EPA to field-test 
waste treatment technologies. The company's favorite, called the "plasma arc 
furnace," converts organic waste into glass in a super-hot, rotating tub. 
</P>
<P>
 But, adds Malloy, his goal is not merely to clean up Butte, but to market the 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not as improbable as it sounds. The glassy residue can be used in 
industrial aggregates. In nearby Anaconda, a proposed Jack Nicklaus golf course 
will use blackened, vitrified slag from an old smelter site in its sandtraps. 
And metals extracted from contaminated water and soil can be sold to mining 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Such mining of old mines has set off a buzz around Butte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was heartbroken when the mines closed," said 83-year-old Dave Piper, a 
mostly retired engineer. "This is a new era in Butte. I'm terribly excited to 
see it come back."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: Q & A; LOAN RULES CAN BE BENT FOR SOME 
HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Federal National Mortgage Assn., a major force in the residential mortgage 
market, recently said it will commit $1 trillion to help finance low-income and 
minority housing over the next six years -- the biggest single commitment of 
its type ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae, which has already helped to finance more than 10 million home 
purchases, says it will reach out to renters, recent immigrants and central 
city residents who in the past have been ignored by the major mortgage lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you tap the agency's largess, and what should you expect to receive if 
you do? Here are some answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is Fannie Mae doing, and how will it help me buy a home? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The agency has a national "community home buyers" program that does three 
things. It lowers required down payments to as little as 5% of the price -- and 
up to 2% of the down payment may be borrowed elsewhere or received as a gift by 
the buyer. It raises another key lending guideline, the "housing 
expense-to-income ratio," so that a buyer can qualify for a bigger loan than 
his or her income ordinarily would allow. And it establishes a review board 
that will take a second look at loan rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that mean in dollars and cents? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you wanted to buy a $70,000 house, you would normally have to earn more 
than $30,000 and have roughly $8,400 cash to close the deal, including down 
payment, closing costs and "mandatory cash reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the community home buyers program, you could qualify for the loan with 
an income of $25,782. And the amount of cash required to close the loan would 
be just $7,000, according to Fannie Mae. Additionally, a portion of your down 
payment could come from a "soft second," which is a loan from a state or city 
housing agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where would I find a soft second? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Look in the phone book for housing assistance agencies, or ask a lender or 
loan counselor. Most major cities have at least one agency that makes loans of 
this type to low-income families that are attempting to buy their first homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, for example, you'd call the Los Angeles Housing Department. 
Some community groups, such as Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services and 
Community Build, are also working closely with Fannie Mae, says Scott Van 
Dellen, a Fannie Mae official who concentrates on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the purpose of the review board? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Its aim is to ferret out discriminatory rejections -- loans that could have 
been approved if the lender had used slightly more flexible lending guidelines. 
(All lenders have some flexibility in accepting or rejecting borrowers who 
don't meet certain strict criteria, but a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study 
found that lenders were more likely to be flexible when the applicant was 
white.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I apply for one of these loans? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The first step is to call (800) 7-FANNIE and request an information packet. 
The information packet will include a booklet called "Opening the Door to a 
Home of Your Own," which includes a self-test to help you figure out whether 
you're likely to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The packet also includes the names of participating lenders. (Fannie Mae does 
not make loans directly to consumers; it works through banks, savings and loans 
and mortgage banking companies such as Countrywide Funding and Fleet Mortgage.) 
Once you've determined that you're a good prospect for the Fannie Mae program, 
you simply can visit or call one of the lenders identified in the packet and 
tell them you want to get a loan through the Fannie Mae community lending 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about the interest rate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Interest rates would vary, depending on the lender, market conditions and 
whether you choose a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan. Current conforming 
loan rates start at about 5% for an adjustable-rate loan and at about 8% for a 
fixed-rate loan. (You can get a lower rate if you pay points -- an up-front fee 
calculated as a percentage of the loan amount.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would make me a good prospect for Fannie Mae's community lending 
program? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally speaking, you must be a good credit risk, which means you usually 
pay your bills promptly and don't have major negative items -- such as 
bankruptcies and foreclosures -- in your credit history. You also need a steady 
source of income, but under this program that doesn't necessarily mean a long 
time spent at the same job. In other words, if you've switched jobs frequently 
but have maintained roughly the same -- or rising -- wages, the changes won't 
be counted against you. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for the community lending program, you generally can't earn more than 
115% of the median income in your area. And your loan amount can't exceed 
$203,150 -- unless you're buying a home in Hawaii, where lending limits are 
substantially higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I find out the median income in my area? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Fannie Mae provides its lenders with a booklet giving median household 
incomes and community lending limits for more than 500 cities. When you visit a 
lender to ask about the program, you can ask to see the median income in the 
city where you live (or the city closest to you). 
</P>
<P>
 The median income is $44,600 in the Los Angeles and Long Beach metropolitan 
area; it is $56,500 in the Anaheim-Santa Ana area.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: EXCESS SAVINGS MAY STILL BE INSURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I goofed and allowed more than $100,000 in savings to accumulate in a bank 
that recently failed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bank's insurance does not cover the excess and I lose the money, may I 
write off the loss? Is there anything I can do or place I can appeal to prevent 
the loss of that money? -- E.L.Y . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You should consider any loss a non-business bad debt. You may write it off 
against any capital gains you have from investments, with any excess deductible 
against up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, despite the size of your account, you may still qualify for full 
insurance protection. It all depends on how many accounts you have, the type of 
accounts and how the accounts are held. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance coverage rules are detailed and complicated. The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. publishes a free pamphlet explaining the rules to consumers. 
Send a postcard requesting the pamphlet to the FDIC's Consumer Affairs 
Division, 550 17th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20429. Consumers may also call the 
FDIC Consumer Hot Line at (800) 934-3342. Rules on Claiming a Home Profit 
Exemption 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My late husband sold a house prior to our marriage and used his $125,000 
profit exemption. Now I am about to sell my house. Am I entitled to use my 
$125,000 exemption or did I lose it because I married someone who had already 
used his? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I briefly rented out my house several years ago. Does this ruin my 
ability to use the exemption? -- F.P . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Assuming that you never used a $125,000 exemption in the past, now that you 
are a widow, you are entitled to claim one. As long as you were married to 
someone who had already used an exemption -- even though it was prior to your 
marriage -- you were not entitled to one. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that you are single, and assuming no prior use, you may claim the 
exemption so long as you meet the qualifying criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 You must own the home you are selling; it must be your principal residence, 
and you must have lived there for three of the last five years. Community 
Property Weighs on Trust Value 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife and I have a revocable trust and have put all of our property into 
it. Will those assets be revalued as of the date of death of one of us? 
</P>
<P>
 These assets are community property, but I am unsure if the fact that they are 
held in a revocable living trust affects whether they qualify for a step-up in 
value. Please help. -- B.H.M . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If these assets are truly community property, the fact that they are now in 
a trust changes nothing. They should be treated to a full step-up in value upon 
the death of one of the spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely establishing a trust for your assets does not change their essential 
nature. And, in fact, common language used in most trust documents clearly 
states that the assets in the trust retain the character they had prior to the 
establishment of the trust. Gift Tax Limits More Taxing Than They Seem 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column, you discussed the amount a couple could give to their 
son and his wife without triggering gift tax consequences. I am a single woman 
without parents or children. How may I take advantage of giving $10,000 to 
someone? -- S.P . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Any taxpayer, regardless of marital status, may give any other taxpayer up 
to $10,000 per year without setting off gift tax consequences. There are no 
limits on the number of people you may shower with your generosity each year, 
but there is a ceiling on the amount you may give away without tax 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does this really mean? Contrary to some mistaken beliefs, giving away 
$10,000 to a family member or friend does not entitle you to a $10,000 tax 
deduction. These gifts are not charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they are gifts you make with money on which you have already paid 
income taxes. The recipient pays no taxes and does not have to report its 
receipt. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit, such as it is, to the donor is that these annual gifts of up to 
$10,000 are not considered a part of the $600,000 all of us are allowed to give 
away over our lifetime (and at death) outside of the grasp of estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, to the extent that your estate will exceed $600,000, you may want to give 
it away in small chunks before death to keep Uncle Sam from getting a piece of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, giving away more than $10,000 to any one person in any single year is 
hardly the end of the world. If you do this, you are required only to file a 
gift tax report to the Internal Revenue Service, which results in the amount 
over $10,000 simply being deducted from your $600,000 lifetime exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 No additional taxes are levied immediately for this burst of generosity. But 
if you exceed your $600,000 lifetime exemption, the excess in your estate will 
be subject to estate taxes. Cut Bond Liability by Staggering Redemption 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have several Series HH savings bonds that will soon mature. Because these 
bonds were purchased by rolling over proceeds from Series E savings bonds that 
were never taxed, I face a tax liability on $675 of every $1,000 bond I have. 
</P>
<P>
 How can I cash in these bonds and pay the least amount of income tax? -- N.N.P 
. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Your only option is to stagger the redemption of the bonds over several 
years to insure that their proceeds do not push you into a higher income tax 
bracket or force you to pay more taxes on any Social Security income you 
receive.

KOLL SAYS IT MAY OWE $21 MILLION IN BACK TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group Inc., the real estate holding and development company 
that owns the Bolsa Chica wetlands, said Friday it may owe $21 million in back 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Pacini, chief financial officer of the Newport Beach company, said the 
shortfall resulted from tax-sharing agreements with two New Hampshire companies 
-- aerospace firm Abex Inc. and refuse company Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. 
The two companies and Koll Real Estate are all former subsidiaries of Henley 
Group Inc., also based in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Abex notified Koll that a tax payment might be due, Pacini said. "We are 
evaluating whether we do owe what they say we owe and potential sources of 
financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll, which had an estimated $17 million in revenue last year, also owns 
properties in San Diego and some coastal property in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Friday, Koll Real Estate Group's stock fell 6.25 cents a 
share to close at 28 cents.

2 STUDENTS NEAR DEATH AFTER CARJACK SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL and DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 19-year-old Marymount College students -- one a Japanese national and the 
other a U.S. citizen who grew up in Japan -- were on life support Saturday and 
not expected to survive after being shot by a gunman during a carjacking 
outside a San Pedro supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crime that sparked immediate outrage in Japan, Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura 
were each shot in the head with a handgun about 11 p.m. Friday as they got out 
of a white 1994 Honda Civic in the parking lot of a Ralphs supermarket at 
Capitol Drive and Western Avenue, said Los Angeles police spokesman Don Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman drove off in the car, which has an "I Love NY" bumper sticker and 
California license plate number 3GPM186. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are searching for the car but have few leads on the gunman. 
Anyone with more information should call detectives at (213) 485-2129, or (213) 
485-2504 nights and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura were in extremely critical condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center, but have remained on life support systems while family members of the 
two young men were en route from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 College President Thomas McFadden, who paid several visits to the hospital 
Saturday, said Ito is a Japanese citizen from Sakura in Chiba prefecture, east 
of Tokyo, and Matsuura is a U.S. citizen, although police said he grew up in 
Japan. Both were freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time anything like this has happened at this college," 
McFadden said. "It's a small community and a close community and we're just in 
a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Flags were at half-staff Saturday at the small secluded campus, where news of 
the deaths spread quickly. Marymount is a two-year liberal arts college on the 
affluent Palos Verdes Peninsula with a spectacular view of the ocean and 1,100 
students, more than 25% of whom are from foreign countries. The largest number 
of the school's international students come from Japan. Friday was the last day 
of classes before spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident has scared a lot of people," said Tomotake Maruyama, 21, a 
freshman at Marymount. "It makes me want to transfer. . . . They were very good 
students, very nice and so kind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ralphs parking lot Saturday was filled with members of the Japanese news 
media, which featured the shootings prominently on broadcasts today. The 
shootings are the latest incidents of violence involving Japanese in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is huge news," said Takayuki Yamauchi, a Los Angeles-based correspondent 
for Nippon Television Network -- one of several Japanese reporters covering the 
story. "We have been very concerned about violence here, especially with guns." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, a 16-year-old Japanese exchange student in Baton Rouge, La., 
was fatally shot when he went to the wrong house looking for a Halloween party. 
The man who answered the door said "Freeze!" but the youth, Yoshihiro Hattori, 
did not understand the term. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Peairs, 40, was acquitted of manslaughter because he said he mistook 
Hattori for an intruder. The case drew worldwide attention as an example of the 
consequences of lax gun control in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network in Japan, which led its noon 
broadcast today with the shootings, reported that Mieko Hattori, the mother of 
Yoshihiro Hattori, said in Nagoya: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no word but regrettable that once again students from Japan have 
been killed with pistols. The Japanese government should take some kind of 
measure, like instructing students going overseas how to react if they are 
involved in an incident." 
</P>
<P>
 After their son was killed, the Hattoris launched a campaign to appeal to the 
United States to ban the possession of handguns. Their campaign gained 
nationwide attention in Japan. During a visit to Japan during an economic 
summit in July, President Clinton phoned the couple to express his sorrow over 
Yoshihiro's death. 
</P>
<P>
 NHK reported that 27 Japanese were killed in overseas incidents last year. 
More than half of the overseas incidents involved guns. 
</P>
<P>
 NHK reported that both Marymount students came to Los Angeles in August to 
study art-related subjects. They became friends after meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumiko Ito, Takuma's mother, was shown on NHK saying: "When he left, he said 
he knew there was a possibility of getting involved in an incident like this 
one. But he was going to study in America that he liked so much. He did feel an 
uneasiness, but his hopes and dreams more than overwhelmed the uneasiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's mother said her son had told her he was making it a point to use his car 
as much as possible and never walk anywhere alone. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden said the issue of crime in the United States comes up when dealing 
with the families of prospective students from overseas, who pay about $17,000 
a year in tuition, room and board and other fees. The college has an extensive 
English-as-a-second-language program, and emphasizes small classes and 
personalized education to help prepare students for transfer to four-year 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the parents are aware of some incidents that have happened in the 
U.S. with international students," McFadden said, "but we try to convince them 
it's safe to be in Rancho Palos Verdes and the community here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, students and friends kept a constant vigil Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuda Kozo, an executive of JAL Trading America, said he was asked to make a 
trip to the hospital to check on the condition of Ito, whose father works for a 
subsidiary of the same company in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called us from Japan and asked us to find out what had happened," Kozo 
said as he stood in the lobby with two other associates. "All they have told us 
so far is that it is very serious. It seems very sad." 
</P>

Los Angeles and Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this story.

A RARE LOOK INSIDE FILES ON SEX HARASSMENT IN LAPD; POLICE: BEHAVIOR RANGES 
FROM INSULTS TO ALLEGATIONS OF FORCED SEX. A BAWDY HISTORY IS COLLIDING WITH 
THE PRESENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, This story was reported by Times staff writers Greg 
Krikorian, Bettina Boxall and Jim Newton. It was written by Krikorian. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The envelope contained a photo of an unidentified male Caucasian bending over, 
exposing his bare buttocks and genitalia to the camera. The note stated: 
"Here's the photo you took of me at your place last week. I hope you enjoy it, 
as much as I do."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Internal Affairs File No. 93-550 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing would have blown over two years ago if the former commanding 
lieutenant of West Los Angeles detectives had just gotten rid of that 
photograph -- the one a male subordinate left on a female detective's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, after giving the culprit a warning, the former boss tossed the photo 
in his desk. Then he retired and the next thing you know, the new boss found 
the picture and opened an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, a formal complaint was filed -- followed by a 15-day suspension. 
"The department has made it abundantly clear through training and notices that 
conduct such as that . . . will not be tolerated," concluded the official 
report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the starched blue shirts and badges, the men and women of the Los 
Angeles Police Department are much like those they are sworn to protect and 
serve. They can drink too much, push too hard, make bad jokes and break the 
law. But in one important way, the police are different because it is their job 
to uphold the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for the first time, the Los Angeles Police Department began keeping 
a separate file on gender-related complaints. There were 43 of them, snapshots 
of behavior ranging from everyday insults to allegations of forced sex at the 
Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases, outlined in confidential files obtained by The Times, provide a 
rare, unvarnished glimpse inside the squad rooms and patrol cars of the LAPD -- 
into a subculture where a bawdy, male-dominated history is colliding with a far 
less forgiving present. A Risque Slide 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of the training was homicide investigations. As part of the 
training, (male detective) . . . displayed a slide presentation that contained 
a number of photographs of homicide victims. One of the slides . . . depicted a 
live female in the ocean surf with a wave breaking over her. The female was not 
wearing a top.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Internal Affairs File No. 93-0118 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, police stations are not your average place of business. A 
city's horrors funnel through the doors every day. And cops sometimes respond 
with crude jokes or juvenile pranks. There is a lot of history in that, not all 
of it proud, but much of it hard to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 The law describes sexual harassment as behavior of a sexual nature that is 
unwelcome and has the purpose or effect of creating a hostile, intimidating 
work environment. Although 43 complaints in a department of 10,000 employees is 
not statistically large, many women officers and their advocates contend that 
the number of unreported incidents is far higher. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Lt. Karen Kimball, the department's women's coordinator, tell it, 
"very, very few" of the cases logged last year "would rise to the level of true 
sex harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, she said, they involve alleged words or actions that were "certainly 
inappropriate and we certainly want to nip them in the bud before they rise to 
harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 The department has pledged to make the LAPD more hospitable to women -- about 
1,100 officers, or 15% of the force, are women. And it is doing so under the 
watchful eye of the City Council's Personnel Committee, which on Tuesday will 
hold its second hearing on harassment in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say there is only so much that can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, this has always been a macho job," said author Joseph Wambaugh, a 
former LAPD officer whose books have chronicled the department's culture for 
the outside world. "It has been a way of life that has been absolutely riddled 
with machismo, and all kinds of locker room banter and gallows humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Wambaugh said, harassment should be measured in "common sense" 
terms, not with sweeping mandates that brought a departmental warning to the 
detective who showed the slide of the topless woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad I'm not in the department today," he said, "not if it has come 
to that." Against Their Will 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the trailer, (the sergeant) locked the door. He attempted to 
repeatedly kiss her and she continuously pushed him away and turned her head 
away from him. (He) put his hand under her shirt and began to fondle her 
breasts. It was evident to her (he) was determined to have sexual intercourse 
with her. . . . Afterward, she stated that from now on, when she said, "No," 
she meant "No."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Complainant's allegation Internal Affairs File No. 93-1053 
</P>
<P>
 Some conduct in the LAPD's files raise straightforward questions about 
acceptable behavior. Then there are complaints detailing allegations that, if 
true, could land someone in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, The Times reported that in the past five years there have 
been at least eight cases of female LAPD employees alleging sexual assaults by 
co-workers. None has resulted in criminal prosecutions although three are being 
reviewed by the Internal Affairs Division, and could be forwarded to the 
district attorney's office. Two other cases are the subject of pending 
lawsuits. In a third lawsuit, a commander was recently cleared of alleged rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cases under internal review involve a police officer in the Hollywood 
Division under investigation for allegedly raping two female counterparts while 
off duty. He is accused of inserting a 9-millimeter pistol into one woman 
during what began as consensual sex. In the other case, he is accused of raping 
a woman and shoving an ice cube into her vagina. 
</P>
<P>
 The third case under investigation involved sex at the Hollywood station -- 
encounters that a woman officer calls rape but a male sergeant says were part 
of an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal Affairs found the encounters -- in the boiler room and in a command 
post trailer -- inexcusable whether or not they were consensual. And even if 
"the whole truth . . . may never be known," investigators said, the sergeant 
had to shoulder responsibility for the misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 He awaits a disciplinary hearing. When Words Fail 
</P>
<P>
 The statement regarding laying of hands is a common one used by religious 
leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Internal Affairs File No. 93-0762 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a reserve chaplain found himself atoning for his words after 
telling a woman officer: "Lay hands on me and pray for me." 
</P>
<P>
 She read a sexual meaning into his remark. Although he was cleared, he told 
the commanding officer he would choose his words more carefully in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Hollenbeck Division, two sergeants drew suspensions -- one for five 
days, the other for two -- after the first made an admittedly stupid remark and 
the second failed to report it. 
</P>
<P>
 During a late-night roll call, the first sergeant, in a room full of officers, 
thought he would give a pep talk. Before finishing, he looked at one female 
officer, a new one, and asked: "Are you going to go out there and show us that 
you have the ovaries to get this job done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, a number of officers called him on the remark. "1.81, 1.81, 
sexual harassment," they shouted, citing the code number for a personnel 
complaint. But the sergeant already knew he had blown it, as he said in a 
letter to Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was her first night in a one-person car. My intention was to ensure that 
everyone backed each other. At the same time, I wanted to inspire and give her 
encouragement. I failed in my objective," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "My remark was spontaneous and the minute it was said, I wanted to reach out 
and pull it back." The Thin Gray Line 
</P>
<P>
 "She stated that (the male officer) arrived at her residence, very 
intoxicated, and made unwanted advances toward her . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Internal Affairs File No. 93-0730 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped by her place in Sun Valley at 1:30 in the morning, after four or 
five beers at J.P.'s Bar & Grill. And it did not take long, she claimed, for 
her friend since childhood, a fellow officer no less, to cross over the line. 
</P>
<P>
 She called it harassment. He called it a misunderstanding. And because there 
were no other witnesses, the department could not decide who was telling the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, it comes down to this. His word against hers. Or one group of officers 
saying this, another saying that. Just like on the streets, where a dozen 
witnesses can give you a dozen different explanations of what happened before 
the accident, or after the gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, two female officers complained that a male detective they 
encountered on a courthouse elevator kept nudging them and pushed the back of 
his shoulder into one officer's breast. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Internal Affairs classified it "not resolved" because the detective 
said he stumbled and two male partners on the elevator backed him up. But a 
deputy chief reviewed the case and gave the detective a 10-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "To suggest (the female officers) both grossly misinterpreted and overreacted 
to an accidental stumble," he said, "would be to indict their own judgment and 
integrity." Dinosaurs 
</P>
<P>
 Detective ------ is an individual whose background and culture clearly place 
him on a collision course with modern day thinking. He has repeatedly voiced 
his opinion on his preference not to work with, or under, female employees.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Internal Affairs File No. 93-1204 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks would call them dinosaurs -- cops who are stuck in the old school, 
who still think that they can get away with harassing women whether they are 
fellow officers or not. The detective who does not like working with women was 
named in a complaint by a female colleague while they both worked in the Harbor 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The way she told it, they were starting the day shift May 13 when he unpacked 
his belongings, pulled out a jar of Vaseline and told her: "See, I'm thinking 
about you." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied the statement, and there were no witnesses. So the department 
dropped the case but decided to keep a close eye on the detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual banter may be routine in the police fraternity, but if it makes women 
feel like sex objects rather than officers, it creates a hostile environment, 
said Judith Kurtz, managing attorney of Equal Rights Advocates, a public 
interest firm specializing in sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't look at what has been tolerated in the past. Look at it in terms of 
what a reasonable woman would find acceptable behavior -- then you figure out 
if it's discrimination or not." Kurtz said. "In most any instance, I think if 
you ask how the officer would feel if that happened to his daughter or wife, I 
think they would feel it's offensive." Stepping Forward 
</P>
<P>
 (Male detective) stated on numerous occasions that (female detective) has 
walked around the detective squad room with a banana in her mouth, sliding it 
in and out simulating oral sex. (Female detective) would smile as she committed 
the "banana act."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Complainant's allegation Internal Affairs File 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints are filed by women against men, but sometimes the 
reverse is true. And often, women allege that the charges are retaliation -- 
pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the female detective in the Harbor Division filed a complaint about the 
Vaseline comment, she also reported that a photo of herself on her desk had 
been crudely defaced. 
</P>
<P>
 But in November, months after she had filed the two complaints, records show 
that the detective was herself accused of harassment by a male colleague, who 
turned in a nine-page typewritten letter detailing her alleged sexual comments 
and antics. 
</P>
<P>
 The male detective, whose witnesses include a colleague who had been named in 
a complaint filed by the female detective, said he was so upset by her 
innuendoes that it affected his job and health -- even driving his weight up 
above 300 pounds. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Another female officer, accused of misconduct, claims that charges against her 
were trumped up after she charged a male officer with sex harassment during an 
Honor Guard trip to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The male officer, she claimed, was vulgar, made sexual advances and used an 
"anatomically correct" dog balloon to make lewd suggestions. The officer 
countered that she was drunk and some witnesses agreed, claiming she bumped 
into walls and rode through a lobby on a luggage cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators reported conflicting stories after interviewing everyone they 
could -- including a restaurant waiter who confirmed that a male officer said 
she "needed to get laid." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Internal Affairs recommended she get a 10-day suspension and that 
he get two. But when the cases landed on Chief Williams' desk, he concluded her 
punishment was too severe and that his was too light. His ruling: Each officer 
got a five-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Williams' action shows how murky cases can get. But others see 
something more troubling. It is, they say, a cautionary tale about stepping 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the female officer, who is on a stress disability leave, is 
contesting her suspension. She also has sued the Police Department, alleging 
that what happened in Sacramento typified the harassment and discrimination she 
experienced during her decade with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "(She is) not alone in this," her attorney said when filing the case. "There 
happen to be a lot of women in the same position she's in." 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: Because this story is based on confidential files, The Times is 
not publishing the names of those involved in the complaints. Harassment Cases 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to crack down on sexual harassment in its ranks, the Los Angeles 
Police Department last year created a new gender-related category for Internal 
Affairs complaints. The following is a breakdown of what was reported and what 
actions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 COMPLAINTS REPORTED 
</P>
<P>
 * 26 inappropriate comments 
</P>
<P>
 * 5 assaults 
</P>
<P>
 * 5 inappropriate pictures, photos, video or actions 
</P>
<P>
 * 4 inappropriate touching incidents 
</P>
<P>
 * 3 instances of inappropriate touching and comments 
</P>
<P>
 (Thirty-nine complaints were against men. Four complaints were against women.) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTCOME 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD, citing the confidentiality of the records, refused to disclose the 
outcomes of the cases. The following is based on Internal Affairs 
recommendations in files obtained by The Times. * 
</P>
<P>
 * 13 suspensions ranging from one to 66 days 
</P>
<P>
 * 4 exonerations or unresolved cases 
</P>
<P>
 * 4 reprimands or admonishments 
</P>
<P>
 * 1 warning 
</P>
<P>
 * 2 case files include no Internal Affairs recommendation 
</P>
<P>
 * 9 cases in which the recommendation could not be determined from records 
</P>
<P>
 * 10 recommendations for Board of Rights hearings (Two concluded with 
suspensions for the accused officers. One resulted in a not guilty finding. 
Other outcomes could not be determined.) 
</P>
<P>
 What Is Harassment? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for 
sexual favors, and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature 
when: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Submission to such conduct is either explicitly or implicitly made a term 
or condition of an individual's employment; 
</P>

BAN ON WELFARE BENEFITS FOR NEW BABIES STIRRING DEBATE; REFORM: CALIFORNIA 
CONSIDERS THE PLAN, WHICH NEW JERSEY IS TRYING. ETHICAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE 
INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Marisol Gonzalez, who has been collecting welfare checks since she emigrated 
from Puerto Rico five years ago, is an unlikely cheerleader for New Jersey's 
reform experiment, which withholds the added cash usually received by mothers 
who have children while on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes people on welfare more disciplined," said Gonzalez, 23, who had a 
daughter out of wedlock before moving to the mainland. "If I have another 
child, I know that the child will have to depend on me and not on welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's words are music to the ears of welfare reformers in New Jersey, who 
are the first to implement a program that is gaining popularity around the 
country and is a key component of California's proposed welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Now President Clinton is wrestling with whether to embrace the family cap, as 
the policy is known, in the national welfare reform package he hopes to send to 
Congress in April or May. The family cap touches so many legal and ethical 
nerves that the senior officials designing the Administration's plan left the 
decision to the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not this is the right approach, it is very important to do 
something to discourage young mothers who have gone on welfare from having a 
second child," said White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, co-chairman 
of Clinton's welfare reform task force. "That second child makes it much more 
difficult to find child care, finish school and get through training programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The heated debate over the issue shows the complications faced by welfare 
reformers as they try to push adults to be more responsible without hurting 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents claim that the family cap would indeed enforce the fundamental goal 
of welfare reform: encouraging recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children to take responsibility for supporting themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real message is: You've got to make some decisions about getting yourself 
out of poverty," said Marion Reitz, director of New Jersey's Division of Family 
Development. "You can't keep having more children and expect to be supported by 
AFDC." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents respond that it would violate recipients' most basic rights and 
throw families ever deeper into poverty. Martha Davis, legal counsel for the 
National Organization for Women, compared the family cap to China's policy of 
fining people for having more than one child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very troubling thing about this program is the intent of government to 
use government benefits to pressure or coerce people into making certain 
reproductive decisions," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 NOW and the American Civil Liberties Union are helping eight New Jersey women, 
who were denied monthly increases in their welfare checks after having babies, 
to challenge the family cap program in court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the George Bush Administration that approved the New Jersey experiment. 
The Clinton Administration followed that lead by permitting Georgia to operate 
a similar program, considering requests from California, Arkansas, Maryland and 
Wisconsin to do the same and discussing possible applications from several 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This debate is going on in almost every state Legislature," Reed said. "It 
does save money, and so it is a way to offset some of the costs of welfare 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports on the New Jersey program, which went into effect in August, 
show a significant decrease in the number of births. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reformers nationwide, desperate to find ways to save money in the face 
of burgeoning caseloads, have kept a careful eye on New Jersey's initially 
promising results, although welfare administrators caution that it is too early 
to make conclusive judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, births among New Jersey welfare mothers have been down at least 
10% each month compared with the same month the previous year. Parents of 1,825 
babies have been denied the $64 a month that they receive for their brothers 
and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the program say they are unimpressed by the statistics. Births are 
declining in New Jersey for all women, they say, and welfare mothers are no 
longer motivated to report births because they receive no extra benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, they disagree that women on welfare irresponsibly get 
pregnant time after time simply to collect fatter benefit checks. In fact, they 
say, women receiving AFDC have an average of 1.9 children -- precisely the 
average for all women. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ethics, Gonzalez and the 18 other welfare recipients taking an 
office-skills class in this city of 50,000 in an agricultural region of 
southern New Jersey, say the family cap has made them more careful about birth 
control and more sober about the prospect of an unwanted pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Hutchinson, a welfare recipient, admitted that it had had no impact 
on her 21-year-old daughter, who also receives public assistance and is about 
to have a second child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything will make her responsible," Hutchinson, 38, said with 
a shrug. "I don't think it means anything to her that her checks will not 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials say they believe that the policy could help turn 
the welfare mind-set from reliance on government to a desire to be independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends a clear message that the intent of the President's welfare reform is 
to have people take responsibility for their own lives," said Walter Broadnax, 
deputy Health and Human Services secretary and a member of Clinton's welfare 
reform working group. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can call anything social engineering, including using stop signs," 
Broadnax said. "In every society there are a certain set of values the 
government tries to promote with its policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's rights advocates and welfare experts who oppose the family cap argue 
that, for reasons ranging from rape and incest to failed birth control 
techniques, women do not always control whether they become pregnant. The 
mothers of the resulting children, they argue, should not be penalized by a 
freeze on their AFDC payments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vineland, that argument resonates even among welfare recipients who favor 
the family cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores DeJesus, 19, who has a 9-month-old daughter and is taking training 
classes to get off welfare, uses a surgically implanted contraceptive called 
Norplant. "If I get pregnant again, I would like some help," she said. "There's 
no way I could support another child, but I don't believe in abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 But abortion, say some opponents of the family cap, is exactly where the 
policy is likely to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two women in (the New Jersey lawsuit) seriously considered having abortions 
but decided for religious and other reasons not to," said David Sciarra, a 
legal services lawyer. "Do you want to create a strong compulsion to push 
people into terminating pregnancy?" 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the case of a third plaintiff in the lawsuit, who was receiving $424 
a month for herself and her two children but got no increase when she became 
pregnant again and bore triplets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say: 'Go out and get a job,' but how can a woman with three infants do 
that?" Sciarra said. "The kids are really harmed in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Greenberg, a welfare specialist at the Center for Law and Social Policy 
in Washington, said politicians find the family cap attractive because it makes 
them appear to be serious about welfare reform without spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become increasingly difficult to claim with a straight face that 
someone would choose to have another child to get an additional $50 to $60 a 
month," he said. "The virtue of this issue is that it becomes an easy way for 
politicians to talk about how they're discouraging irresponsible behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 But California's welfare commissioner, Eloise Anderson, says the policy is not 
political posturing but an essential component of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're saying is that while we're helping you, we don't want you having 
any more babies," Anderson said. "What's wrong with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Working women do not get automatic raises when they have children, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should our expectations of a women on AFDC be any different than any 
other woman?" she said. "Do we think they're stupider or less capable of being 
rational?"

PILGRIMAGE TO MARK STRATEGY SHIFT FOR UFW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retracing the path of its first march 28 years ago, the United Farm Workers 
union will begin a 330-mile trek Thursday from the fields of this farm town to 
the steps of the state Capitol to announce a major shift in strategy -- a 
change that could hasten the union's death or return it to the glory days of 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer will the grape boycott be the centerpiece of the UFW, as it has been 
for the past decade. The union's leadership has decided to return to the 
fields, to the blood-and-guts work of organizing farm laborers, enlisting new 
members, confronting growers and pushing for new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a gamble for a union that has suffered years of defeat and infighting 
and the death last April of its leader, Cesar Chavez. These fields can be 
unforgiving in more than one way. Hoisting its black Aztec eagle flag, the UFW 
will find out quickly if farm workers will heed the call to action or if the 
union is a mere token from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is just the kind of gamble Arturo Rodriguez, Chavez's son-in-law and 
successor, believes he can win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a risk. But we're not going to lose," he said recently. 
"Everywhere we've gone this past year, farm workers are tired and fed up with 
abuse from growers and labor contractors who have no respect for them or their 
families. People are ready to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades after Chavez walked this same path -- a pilgrimage that turned 
the tiny campesino and Delano into national symbols -- the UFW hopes to work 
the same magic. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilgrimage or peregrinacion will begin Thursday, on the 67th anniversary 
of Chavez's birth, and end three weeks later in Sacramento on the first 
anniversary of his death -- 24 days through the vineyards and fruit orchards of 
California's agricultural heartland. There will be a Mass each morning and a 
rally each night. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all its religious symbolism and 1960s spirit, the march signals a 
wrenching departure from the recent strategies of Chavez. After all, it was the 
grape and lettuce boycott that brought growers to their knees in the 1970s. It 
was the boycott that compelled the state Legislature in 1975 to pass the 
Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the landmark law that gave farm workers the 
right to collective bargaining and the right to seek redress for unfair 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boycott is a way to level the playing field and engage the consumer in 
the plight of farm workers, and it will always be a tool for us," said 
Rodriguez, 44, seated in his simple office at the union's compound in the 
Tehachapis, 100 miles north of Los Angeles. "But the boycott alone is not 
enough to bring about labor contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the union had contracts with 80% of the grape growers in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Today, not a single contract remains. At its height, the union 
had 100,000 members; now there are fewer than 15,000. It hopes to enlist 10,000 
new members by the end of the march. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in strategy is welcomed by longtime supporters and former top 
organizers of the UFW. For the past decade, some have decried the union's 
retreat from the fields and its singular dependence on the grape boycott and 
the issue of toxic pesticides as the way to pressure growers to improve the 
farm worker's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boycott and organizing the worker in the field go hand in hand," said 
Jerome Waldie, a former U.S. congressman from Contra Costa County and a 
longtime UFW supporter. "Cesar should have never abandoned one for the other." 
</P>
<P>
 If the union did jettison its organizing efforts, Rodriguez said, it was 
because the Agricultural Labor Relations Board -- the state agency set up to 
enforce the 1975 law -- stopped protecting farm workers who had joined or 
wanted to join the UFW. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very law to protect us has been turned into a tool against us," he said. 
"This began under Gov. Deukmejian and has continued under Gov. Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime critics of the UFW said the latest grape boycott, launched in 1984, 
has proved a resounding failure and the union is desperately seeking some new 
strategy, which happens to be an old strategy, to breathe life into a dying 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care by what stick you want to measure it -- the price to the 
growers, the volume of grapes moved -- this last boycott has been an absolute 
disaster," said Bruce Obbink, president of the California Table Grape 
Commission, a grower marketing and promotion group that has fought the UFW long 
and hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we hear they are talking about returning to the field and organizing. I'm 
not sure they have the juice. They haven't done it for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the boycott may not have generated contracts in the field, Rodriguez 
contends that it was by no means a failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should downplay the risks of pesticides and no one should downplay the 
UFW's role in publicizing those risks. Our pressure played a role in getting 
some grape growers to change their toxic ways and getting the government to ban 
certain chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the union not having juice, Rodriguez pointed to the throngs of people, 
an estimated 35,000, who turned out for his father-in-law's funeral. "It 
reminded us of our wellspring of support, the flame that is still there. Now we 
need to go out into the fields with this peregrinacion and fan that flame." 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-day pilgrimage is also a look inside the soul of the UFW and an 
acknowledgment by those who served under Chavez that they could have done more. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us were guilty of looking to my father and saying, 'Cesar will handle 
it. Cesar will take care of it,' " said Paul Chavez, 37, who worked beside his 
father for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This march is not only a way to renew the struggle and sign up new members 
along the route, but it is about penance." 
</P>
<P>
 The photos from the first Delano-to-Sacramento pilgrimage in the spring of 
1966 show a 38-year-old Cesar Chavez, hair jet-black and cheeks puffy, carrying 
a huelga (strike) flag and leading a procession of 10,000. Before the march was 
over, the union had won its first contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The decade that followed was a heady one. The union forced growers who had 
sworn never to deal with Chavez to join the bargaining table. Schenley. Gallo. 
Steinberg. Giumarra. Pandol. Zaninovich. When those contracts came up for 
renewal in the mid-1970s, the growers shunned the UFW and made a pact with the 
rival Teamsters. Chavez felt that the Teamsters, a white-run organization, did 
not understand the plight of Mexican farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 From Coachella to Fresno, the vineyards were the scene of massive walkouts and 
bloody confrontations. Two UFW strikers were killed in Kern County. San Joaquin 
Valley jails filled with UFW protesters. Chavez eventually prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late 1960s and early '70s, the UFW was like water running downhill," 
said Jerome Cohen, the union's former attorney. "There was no way you could 
stop us and it all flowed from Cesar." 
</P>
<P>
 For those inside the union, the pilgrimage marks a passing of the torch from 
the legendary Chavez to Rodriguez. And the official announcement of the union's 
shift in strategy on the steps of the state Capitol April 24 will be 
Rodriguez's unveiling. The son of a sheet-metal worker and a high school 
teacher, he has spent half his life preparing for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in San Antonio and, unlike Chavez, he never had to toil in the 
fields. In 1971, he graduated with a degree in sociology from St. Mary's 
University, where he began working on UFW grape boycotts as a student 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he met Chavez and a year after that married his daughter, 
Linda. After receiving his master's degree in sociology from the University of 
Michigan, Rodriguez joined the union full time, working his way from field 
organizer to top management. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he headed to Porterville, a town on the San Joaquin Valley's eastern 
citrus belt and the third stop on the march. There, he met with 200 farm 
workers and union organizers to drum up support for the pilgrimage and the 
summer of organizing that will follow. Before he left, he spent five minutes at 
the grave of Chavez, a simple grass plot in the middle of the union's La Paz 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to him everyday," he said. "For us, he is still living." 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive to Porterville, he described the harsh conditions in the field 
and how the grower has insulated himself morally and legally by using labor 
contractors to hire and fire farm workers and handle the payroll and taxes. 
These middlemen, almost exclusively Latino, often charge the farm workers 
exorbitant fees for everything from rent to transportation to sodas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have set some basic standards that are met by a majority of the industry. 
Toilets in the field, fresh water, breaks. But the labor contractor system is a 
vicious, vicious system. And the grower washes his hands clean. He says: 'It's 
not me. If there are any abuses, it's the labor contractor who's to blame.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wages have leveled off and in some cases dropped during the past decade, he 
said. The typical wage ranges from $4.25 to $6 an hour, down from a high of 
$7.50 an hour in some areas in the late 1970s. Because more than half of the 
state's farm workers are jobless at least 20 weeks a year, their annual income 
averages about $6,500, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 As he entered the dance hall in Porterville, the 200 men, women and children 
rose to their feet and clapped like a train picking up speed, faster and 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva Arturo Rodriguez! " the man with the microphone screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva!" chanted the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Uranday, a UFW member since 1963, watched Rodriguez assume center 
stage. "We are seeing something in Artie that we saw in Cesar. Some light," she 
said, her eyes misty. "He is our leader now." 
</P>
<P>
 His speech was a call to arms. He said the success of the pilgrimage depended 
on their willingness to recruit fellow farm workers to join them and to cook 
food and provide housing for the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every worker is an organizer. We are not the organizers. You are. Every 
victory we have is because you have done it," he told them in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Se puede? " (Can it be done?) 
</P>
<P>
 "Si, se puede!"  
</P>
<P>
 Jose Carmona-Ramos, a 45-year-old orange picker who sometimes makes less than 
$3 an hour, said he supported the union but the attitude in the fields is much 
different now. "People are just happy to have a job. There are a lot of young 
workers coming up from Mexico who don't care about a union. They are young and 
shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 In private, Rodriguez acknowledged the difficulty in winning contracts at a 
time when the state labor relations board is headed by a general counsel 
"averse to the plight of farm workers." But the union has no choice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers are already angry and frustrated and upset. From there, it takes 
a life of its own. It's funny. We are reliving this all over again. We have 
another opportunity to make it work with the growers. It will be interesting to 
see how they respond. Will they say: 'Let's work it out?' Or will the 
relationship be an antagonistic one? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have every reason to be concerned," he smiled.

DEFIANT KADAFI BACK TO HARD LINE AGAINST WEST; LIBYA: STUNG BY SANCTIONS, HE 
WON'T TURN OVER LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS. ALSO, HE INVITES MIDEAST PEACE FOES FOR 
TALKS.

<P>
 A German merchant ship made its way into the harbor of Tripoli not long ago 
and was boarded by a troop of police who wanted to know if the ship was 
carrying weapons. Hoping for a laugh, the sea captain responded with a dirty 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Libyans weren't smiling, and the captain spent a week in jail, 
released only after the intervention of the German Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time earlier, several Europeans living at an expatriate workers camp 
near the Libyan capital were sentenced to several weeks in prison when their 
wives placed a large mail order for poppy seeds. The women said the poppy seeds 
were for baking. The Libyans said they were for merrymaking, perhaps suspecting 
the seeds would be used as an opiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun isn't a marketable commodity in Libya these days. Last month leader 
Moammar Kadafi imposed Islamic law throughout the country; one of its dictates 
makes it a crime, punishable by imprisonment, to "make rumors or harmful jokes 
about society or the Koran." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in an interview last week here in the homeland of his desert tribe, 
Kadafi spoke in defiant tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling under tightened international sanctions that have halted air travel to 
and from Libya, slowed delivery of key commodities, forced the country into 
arrears on its bill payments and sparked a slow exodus of foreign companies, 
Libya is no longer striking a pose of conciliation with the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi, the mercurial Libyan leader who last year was trying to court the 
West, this year is alarming his Arab neighbors by threatening to set up a 
"peaceful Islamic state" in his North African desert country, inviting 
opponents of the Middle East peace process for consultations in Tripoli and 
announcing that he has no intention of handing over two suspects accused in the 
1988 downing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no circumstances whatsoever under which we can turn them over," 
Kadafi said in the interview. "Even if there is a war." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi, who as a young colonel rode the crest of Arab nationalism in 1969 to 
topple the pro-Western monarchy and establish Libya as one of the West's most 
enduring headaches, hasn't mellowed with age. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Libya hosted a meeting of radical Arab organizations dubbed 
the "Democratic Arab Revolution," and Kadafi, who is in his early 50s, said he 
was considering inviting terrorist leaders Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Western intelligence analysts say at least five terrorist training camps 
remain operative in Libya, and several years after an international uproar over 
a purported chemical weapons plant forced Libya to halt production, the German 
press last month showed photographs of tunnels dug deep into a mountainside at 
Tarkhounah, south of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports said German companies were aiding in the construction of a new 
manufacturing plant for chemical, and possibly biological, weapons. Libyan 
officials said the tunnels were being dug for the Great Man-Made River, a huge 
project for transportation of water from desert aquifers to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as worrying, Libyan opposition sources say, they now have eyewitness 
reports that Libya was behind the disappearance of Mansour Kikhiya, a Libyan 
opposition leader and human rights leader who disappeared in Cairo in December 
while on his way to a meeting with a Kadafi contact. Kikhiya has since been 
seen alive in Libya, former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid Bakoush, now a 
key figure in the Libyan opposition, said in an interview in Cairo last week. 
He suggested that Kadafi has returned to the days of terror of the mid-1980s, 
when the Libyan regime hunted down its opponents all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kadafi has been calm for the last few years not because he gave up but 
because he had other problems to take care of, and because the international 
market of terrorism was in recession," Bakoush said. "He has gone on television 
again calling for the enemies of the revolution to be killed, because 
imprisoning them is doing them a favor. . . . We see that with these sanctions 
he has gotten into a mess, and now he is making the mess worse." 
</P>
<P>
 "For several months, he was trying to be nice about (President) Clinton and 
(British Prime Minister John) Major," said a European diplomat in the Libyan 
capital, referring to Kadafi's charm offensive launched against the leaders 
last year. "All that has stopped. Now he's started shouting again about the 
Jewish and Christian crusading conspiracy. He's become very violent in his 
speeches. He's furious at not being taken seriously, not by the West or even 
his Arab brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi, weakened by the international air embargo, a freeze on his assets 
abroad and a halt on spare parts supplies for some oil equipment, at the moment 
does not appear to have the wherewithal to return to the freewheeling days when 
Libya offered financial and logistic support for a wide array of international 
terrorist groups and national liberation movements, from the Irish Republican 
Army to the Abu Nidal organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an interview at the modern hotel complex in Sirte, constructed for 
international conferences, Kadafi repeatedly called for an end to violence in 
the Middle East, although he refused to rule out further support for violent 
opponents of the Middle East peace process. George Habash, head of the militant 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which has mounted a series of 
attacks in the Israeli-occupied territories aimed at derailing the peace talks, 
arrived in the Libyan capital last week for consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a real peace process, we will support it fully," Kadafi said, 
sitting quietly in a modern office dressed in the traditional robe of North 
Africa. "We will wait for the result. If the result brings about peace, then it 
is good." 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Kadafi sat slumped over slightly in an elegant chair, talking in 
a low monotone interrupted by occasional sighs. Frequently, his eyes would scan 
the ceiling as if seeking a way to make the world see the dreamscape on the 
backside of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't just talk about recognizing Israel. Things cannot be put in 
that way. Because if you ask one party to recognize Israel, then you have to 
ask Israel to recognize the other party. When are they going to recognize 
Palestine? Are we seeking peace, or just the recognition of Israel? If it is 
just the recognition of Israel you're after, then we have to sacrifice peace. 
This is what has delayed the peace process, and we may never achieve peace in 
the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 The peace process has failed so far, he said, because Israel has focused its 
efforts on coming to terms with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman 
Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abu Ammar does not represent all the Palestinians," he said, using Arafat's 
nickname. "The armed groups and organizations are not part of this process, and 
so peace is in danger. Abu Ammar's organization is not a fighting one. Any 
agreement with that organization will not end the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi defended his ongoing contacts with purported terrorist leaders. "When 
the British government agreed to meet with the IRA, does that mean they 
encouraged them to continue violence?" he asked, clucking his tongue with 
irritation. "And when the leaders of the United States received Salman Rushdie, 
were they encouraging him to attack Islam? If we do a meeting with these 
people, it's considered evil. Even if I was trying to convince them not to 
continue fighting, you condemned us in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi said he has challenged the West to provide evidence that he is still 
engaging in terrorism, and he raised questions about why the West continues to 
talk about Libya and terrorism. "Is it because I posed a threat to you in the 
past?" he asked. "What is the basis of these accusations? If you go to 
interview the president of Italy, would you ask him if he is dangerous? These 
are wrong accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any terrorist operation that was carried out by Libya? I challenge 
them to provide evidence for even one terrorist act which Libya has committed. 
. . . These are just colonialist designs on our countries. They would like to 
subject all the peoples of the world to surrender and become beggars. This is 
the difference between me and them, and terrorism is only a cover for that 
difference between them and us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Libyan leader defended an invitation to Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdul 
Rahman, spiritual leader of an organization that is trying to bring down the 
Egyptian government and whose followers were convicted in the bombing of the 
World Trade Center in New York. He said he has asked the radical preacher to 
set up a peaceful Islamic state in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still insist on my request that the United States government should release 
Omar Abdul Rahman and he should come to Libya," he said, "in order for us to 
convince him to put an end to the violence in Egypt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We are against all kinds of violence: that used by the Islamists and the 
fundamentalists, by the Americans against the Indians. We demand from the 
Israelis, the fundamentalists and the Americans to put an end to violence. They 
should be convinced that dialogue is the only way. They should put away their 
arms and recognize the existence of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this talk may sound as though Kadafi has become a reasonable man. But 
the pacific overtures have a tinny ring when they come to the case of Kikhiya, 
a former foreign minister and one of the most outspoken critics of the Kadafi 
regime as well as founder of the Libyan Organization for Human Rights. Kadafi 
insists that Kikhiya was kidnaped by the CIA to damage relations between Libya 
and neighboring Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We officially accuse you of it as Americans," he said, grinning cheerfully as 
he calculated the effect of his words. "American intelligence is responsible 
for what happened to Kikhiya. He is a Libyan citizen and the Libyan authorities 
will follow up the matter to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was deceived and manipulated by the CIA when he said in a recent 
report to Congress that Libya still poses an enormous threat to the United 
States, Kadafi contended. 
</P>
<P>
 The Libyan leader and the entourage around him seem to have almost dreamlike 
hopes about Clinton, the successor to two Republican administrations thoroughly 
loathed in Tripoli. One Kadafi aide said the Libyans particularly admire 
Clinton for his avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War. At one point, 
Kadafi, noting his belief that Clinton is the victim of a CIA conspiracy, 
offered to send an armored car to Washington to protect the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that came in this Clinton report (about Libya), Clinton cannot be 
responsible for it," he said. "It was imposed on Clinton. Clinton is a victim, 
just like us. He is a victim of the CIA and imperialism, and we're concerned 
about him, that he might face the same destiny as JFK" -- a reference to 
President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 With his country increasingly squeezed by international sanctions, Kadafi has 
reason to be worried about himself. According to diplomats in Tripoli, Kadafi 
uncovered an assassination plot from within the military last October, only a 
day before his motorcade was to have been attacked in the steel-producing town 
of Misratah. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details are not clear, an uprising began about the same time in 
the town of Bani Walid, reportedly spurred by a tiff between Kadafi and the 
powerful tribal leaders in the area and military cadets who, like many other 
public employees, have gone unpaid for six or seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that Kadafi's closest lieutenant, Staff Maj. Abdelsalem Ahmed Jalloud, 
was behind the coup plot have been fed by reports that Jalloud is under virtual 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some unrest in the army camps, and at the same time a group of high 
professional officers, really well-educated people, planned to ambush him," one 
diplomat said. "One of the group betrayed them, so they were all picked up in 
one day. Most of them were shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers have been shown on Libyan television in the last two weeks 
confessing to being spies for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always rumors. One version has it that 2,000 people were rounded 
up, and 300 were executed, 80 by Kadafi himself," said one Western envoy in the 
Libyan capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi himself said the four men on television "admitted they were recruited 
by the CIA" to spy on the Libyan regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now look what America is doing to destroy the world," he added. "If we did 
something like that, what would they say about us? When they do it, it is 
legitimate. How can the problems of the world be solved by such a mentality? 
They consider the people of the West are human beings and the people in the 
East are donkeys." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kadafi said he is adamant about not handing over the Lockerbie 
suspects, he repeated past statements that the two men are free to turn 
themselves in. Most analysts in the Libyan capital believe there are no 
conditions under which the two men will be released for trial in the United 
States or Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm much more pessimistic now than a year ago. Because there is no sign 
whatsoever that Kadafi is prepared to deliver these two persons," one European 
envoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kadafi appears to be preparing for a long showdown. With his assets 
frozen abroad, he worked quickly to transfer overseas funds into accessible 
accounts before the latest sanctions and has since brought large quantities of 
cash into the country, in $100 bills and treasury bonds, according to 
diplomatic sources. Reserves now are said to total a full year's oil revenue, 
or about $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to pay public salaries over a period of several months is driving 
out an increasing number of foreign workers but is getting the Libyan populace 
prepared for hard times, with the prospect of a full oil embargo, depriving 
Libya of virtually all outside revenue, under probable consideration by the 
United Nations over the summer, these analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their policy for the future seems to be to spend as little as possible from 
their reserves," said a foreign envoy. "I think they're preparing for a long 
siege." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi seems to be taking the long view too. "The struggle of my nation is 
continuing," he said with a quiet sigh, staring into space. "It's carried over 
from one generation to another. And that's what we're doing. It's not a matter 
of win or lose. The question is, what is the correct thing to do? To continue 
to struggle for our right to life."

WHITEWATER'S UNDERCURRENT OF CASH FLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitewater, the Arkansas land deal that has stirred so much controversy for 
the White House, is often dismissed by President Clinton as nothing more than a 
hapless effort to make a modest profit by building a dream retirement haven in 
the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an investment I made 15 years ago that lost money instead of made money 
because the property market turned around at home," Clinton said recently. 
"It's a simple, straightforward thing, and it'll be shown to be." 
</P>
<P>
 But new evidence made public last week, taken together with what was already 
known, makes it clear that Whitewater was not quite that simple. While the 
President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- as they insist -- may have 
known nothing about any wrongdoing, federal investigators have found 
substantial evidence suggesting that the land development firm was entangled in 
something that went well beyond selling lots for houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater project, investigators now believe, was part of a labyrinthine 
system of financial juggling and speculation operated by James B. McDougal, a 
Little Rock, Ark., real estate developer who was the Clintons' financial 
partner in the Whitewater deal and the head of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Federally insured funds from McDougal's S&L, which eventually collapsed at a 
cost of at least $47 million to taxpayers, allegedly moved so freely among his 
various enterprises -- including the Whitewater project -- that one federal 
investigator called the whole scheme a "massive check-kite." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact nature of the Clintons' involvement in the overall enterprise, and 
the extent of their knowledge about its affairs, remain uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Clintons' public statements and tax records indicate that they 
lost $46,635.75 as a result of their investment in the Whitewater endeavor, 
they were named as "possible beneficiaries" of McDougal's activities in 
documents forwarded to the Justice Department by officials of the Resolution 
Trust Corp., which investigated Madison Guaranty and related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, as McDougal struggled to conceal the fact that his financial 
empire was going bankrupt, as much as $100,000 was diverted from Madison 
Guaranty to the Whitewater project -- money that taxpayers ultimately had to 
make up. 
</P>
<P>
 And with many of the records now missing, one investigative source speculated 
that "it may be that McDougal, in his head, has the only complete record of 
where the money came from and where it went." 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a step-by-step guide to what is known and what is not known 
thus far about a relatively minor business investment that has turned into the 
most dangerous controversy in Clinton's career: Not-So-Equal Partners 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the Clintons became partners with McDougal and his then-wife, Susan, 
in purchasing 230 acres of land along the White River in northern Arkansas. 
Together they obtained loans totaling $203,000 to buy the property. The money 
was borrowed at 10% interest, meaning that the partners were obligating 
themselves to pay at least $20,000 a year to keep from defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of their own pocket, the Clintons put up $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the development was said to be a 50-50 partnership between the 
McDougals and the Clintons, there was no signed contract between them, and the 
two couples never seem to have shared equally in profits or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 By Clinton's own account, the McDougals had contributed $268,000 and withdrawn 
$175,800 by 1992, for a net investment (and loss) of $92,200. That is almost 
twice what the Clintons claim to have lost on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to repaying the two initial loans they took out to acquire the 
property, the partners had other Whitewater-related expenses. In the first two 
years after creating the Whitewater project, it has been reported that they 
spent $40,000 dividing land into 44 parcels, building gravel roads and printing 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the loans and expenses were covered on a monthly basis is not 
entirely clear. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lots did not sell as quickly as the owners had hoped, land sales did 
generate a steady stream of income for the company. Yet even after they 
officially shifted the ownership of the property into the newly created 
Whitewater Development Corp. in 1979, the McDougals and the Clintons say they 
frequently were forced to use personal funds to cover business debts and 
current expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978 and 1979 alone, the Clintons claim to have paid more than $22,120.60 
in interest payments on the initial loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1980, Hillary Clinton borrowed another $30,000 at 20% interest from 
the McDougal-owned Bank of Kingston, Ark., in order to construct a model home 
on Whitewater lot No. 13. She borrowed it in her name; McDougal's bank was 
prohibited by law from making loans directly to any of his own business 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The model home was sold in 1981 for $27,700, but it came back to them in 1988 
after the buyer declared bankruptcy and died. Because the Clintons still owed 
$13,000 on the initial loan, they paid $8,000 to reacquire the property. It was 
then resold, and the Clintons reported a $1,640 capital gain after paying off 
the note. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have said they were passive partners in the Whitewater project 
and that it was McDougal who ran the business on a day-to-day basis. But they 
have never explained why they did not share equally with the McDougals in 
Whitewater losses. A Wider Scheme? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these seemingly complex transactions, mixing personal and corporate 
obligations, are typical of closely held enterprises, but in other ways 
Whitewater seems to have been anything but a normal small business. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government investigators, tens of thousands of dollars passed 
through Whitewater accounts that bear no obvious relationship to the real 
estate development itself. These transactions are the source of the 
government's keen interest in the Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they believe McDougal was using Whitewater Development -- as 
well as many of his other companies -- to drain federally insured money from 
Madison Guaranty in a scheme that may have robbed the thrift of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. In a memo released last week, an RTC investigator 
estimated at least $100,000 in Madison Guaranty funds were funneled into 
Whitewater Development. 
</P>
<P>
 What portion of these funds from Madison Guaranty may have been used to pay 
Whitewater debts is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the individual transactions appear to be perfectly legal. For example, 
the directors of a Madison Guaranty subsidiary company paid $30,000 into a 
Whitewater account in April, 1985, as a "bonus" to McDougal. Since McDougal 
controlled the company, he had a right to award himself a bonus, but the timing 
suggests what his purpose may have been: At the time, Whitewater Development 
owed a payment on its outstanding debt, and its account was overdrawn by 
$28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other transfers of money from Madison Guaranty to Whitewater Development raise 
unanswered questions. The RTC's chief investigator indicated that Whitewater 
Development also received "unauthorized" loans from Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 One such transaction is already well known. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 8, 1985, McDougal sent a check for $7,322.42 to the Security Bank of 
Paragould as a payment on the money originally borrowed by Hillary Clinton for 
the model home. Two years earlier, the Clintons had refinanced the then-unpaid 
balance of $20,000 on the loan through Security Bank, apparently to obtain a 
lower interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McDougal made the payment from Whitewater funds, the corporate 
account was nearly empty at the time. So he covered the check with a transfer 
of $7,500 in funds from a Madison Guaranty subsidiary that investigators say 
they believe was often used to siphon money from the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 This transaction is cited by Clinton's critics as evidence that federally 
insured thrift money was improperly used to pay obligations owed by the 
Clintons. If so, the critics reason, the President and his wife are responsible 
for a small portion of the $47-million bill left behind for the taxpayers to 
pay when Madison Guaranty was declared insolvent in 1989. Profit or Loss? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when Clinton was running for President, he asserted that he had 
advanced a total of $68,900 to Whitewater Development -- most of it in payments 
on loans taken out on behalf of the company -- and received nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, he lowered that figure to $43,635.75. He said he had 
mistakenly included in the Whitewater total a loan of about $20,000 he took out 
to help his mother buy a house -- a transaction completely unrelated to the 
Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons still adhere to the judgment of attorney James Lyons of Denver, 
who reviewed their Whitewater finances in 1992 and concluded that they had 
received no profit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known how much, if any, Whitewater money was used to pay off debts 
Clinton had incurred in his own name, but critics have suggested such funds 
should have been treated as income by Clinton and reported on his tax returns. 
The President did not list these payments as personal income on his taxes, 
apparently because he viewed them as corporate -- not personal -- debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's critics are intrigued by a statement that McDougal made in 1992 
suggesting that the Clintons' obligations may have been satisfied entirely with 
corporate funds. "Every bit Clinton put in," McDougal said, "was income they 
didn't report." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, McDougal disagrees with much of the Clintons' accounting, but the 
credibility of the mercurial former thrift owner is itself in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have already acknowledged they had erroneously claimed a tax 
deduction for Whitewater-related interest payments totaling $5,133 in 1984 and 
1985. They said the mistake occurred because they personally received interest 
statements from the bank that should have been directed to Whitewater 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, these contradictions have caused Clinton's critics to question 
the President's arithmetic as well as his claim that the Whitewater project was 
a simple investment in which he lost money. On Thursday, Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa), who is conducting his own Whitewater probe, posed these questions: 
</P>
<P>
 "Did . . . the Clintons ever receive income from Whitewater? Why do the 
records show only that the McDougals did? How many personal interest payments 
did Whitewater make on the Clintons' behalf? Did the Clintons know whether 
other McDougal-related companies infused capital into Whitewater, and does this 
make the former governor indebted to McDougal's other partners or complicitous 
in any improper activities they might have been engaged in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent losses, Leach and others claim, the Clintons received 
something of value from the Whitewater project, at least in the form of debt 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 If the McDougals sustained losses larger than the Clintons' in an equal 
partnership, they also ask: Should the difference be considered a gift to the 
governor from the owner of a state-regulated business? 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Clinton's critics note that the President benefited in another 
way by taking an $8,000 income tax deduction for interest payments he claims to 
have made on Whitewater-related loans. Postscript 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Clintons sold their share of Whitewater Development to McDougal 
for $1,000. But they did not claim any Whitewater losses on their income tax 
filing that year, as they frequently did when they sold other unprofitable 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said the Clintons lacked the necessary documentation to 
claim a deduction. Neither Whitewater Development nor McDougal has filed tax 
returns for all of the years involved, also apparently because of a shortage of 
documentation.

RHETORIC FUELS CRISIS OVER KOREA; NUCLEAR DISPUTE: TAUNTS BETWEEN NORTH AND 
SOUTH ESCALATE. U.S. CALLS SITUATION SERIOUS BUT NOT 'BRINK OF WAR.' PYONGYANG 
ALSO THREATENS JAPANESE LEADERS WITH 'DIGGING OWN GRAVE.'

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord pronounced the Korean peninsula 
"in a serious situation" but not on the "brink of war," North and South Korea 
continued to escalate their fiery rhetoric Saturday, exchanging martial taunts 
and warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the conflict over North Korea's refusal to allow complete 
inspection of its nuclear facilities, Lord said, "It's a time for firm resolve, 
patience, preparedness, but it's not an imminent crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, angry words from both sides served to fuel a crisis-like 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, Prime Minister Lee Hoi Chang was quoted by a Korean news 
agency as admonishing his troops at a military camp near the border to 
"faithfully do their best to drive off any North Korean aggression with just 
one stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, North Korea, speaking through its official news agency, condemned 
South Korea for placing its armed forces on alert and called the decision a 
"very dangerous development which may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean 
peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Koreans said they had readied their troops only after North Korea 
put its much larger army on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea maintains a military force of more than 1 million, while South 
Korea has armed forces of 650,000, bolstered by 35,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan also drew a sharp rebuke from the North Koreans for supporting a 
hard-line stance against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Workers Party daily, Rodong Sinmun, the main newspaper in 
Pyongyang, warned that "if the situation on the Korean peninsula gets worse and 
a war breaks out, Japan will never be safe either." 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata for demanding more inspections of North Korea's nuclear 
facilities, Rodong Sinmun said, "The reckless military action of the Japanese 
reactionaries against the Korean people will result in digging their own 
grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, who is in charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State 
Department, said in an appearance on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday" that the 
Clinton Administration's own display of words and diplomacy in the conflict is 
at a "perfect pitch, perfect level of rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of negotiations at U.N. headquarters in New York and Geneva 
last year, U.S. officials believed that they had persuaded the North Koreans to 
abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and allow inspections of their 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA has been trying to determine whether North Korea is diverting the 
plutonium that comes out of its nuclear power plants for use as fuel in nuclear 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said "most in the intelligence community think there's a better than 50% 
chance that they have one or two bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 But when inspectors arrived in early March, the North Koreans refused to grant 
them access to all their nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the IAEA board of governors in Vienna announced that it could not 
guarantee that North Korea had no clandestine nuclear weapons program, and the 
agency referred the issue to the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States then suspended talks with North Korea and introduced a 
resolution in the Security Council calling on Pyongyang to submit to full 
inspections of its nuclear facilities within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 China, an ally of the Communist North Korean regime, has balked at the 
resolution. Because China has a veto, the Security Council cannot act unless 
China agrees or abstains. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on the news show with Lord, both Donald Gregg, who was the George 
Bush Administration's ambassador to South Korea, and Rep. Gary L. Ackerman 
(D-N.Y.) suggested that the Administration should do more to defuse the 
situation since North Korea is, as Gregg put it, "the strongest conventional 
military threat that we face anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg suggested that the Administration needs to open a new channel of 
communication with the North Koreans. With its official negotiations now 
suspended, the United States apparently has relied only on public statements 
made in Washington and at the United Nations deploring North Korea's refusal to 
allow the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said, however, that while there have been no behind-the-scenes contacts 
with North Korea, the Clinton Administration is trying to reach influential 
North Koreans with a public message that they have a choice: "They can stay in 
isolation and possible confrontation or they can take the diplomatic track 
we've offered them and look to better economic and political relations with the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord acknowledged that the Administration had been hampered by the Chinese 
refusal to support a Security Council resolution calling for North Korean 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lord said he hoped that the Chinese might agree to another form of 
pressure -- perhaps a statement, rather than a formal resolution -- urging 
North Korean cooperation. A statement, however, lacks the moral or legal force 
of a resolution.

COLUMN ONE; INSURANCE FALLS PREY TO GENETIC BIAS; THE DNA REVOLUTION IS A 
BLESSING AND A CURSE. IT TELLS SOME THE POTENTIAL FOR DISEASE, BUT ALLOWS 
COMPANIES TO DENY COVERAGE. SOME FEAR THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A HUGE 
ETHICAL DILEMMA.

<P>
 Eight-year-old David Manikian has a mutant gene -- a small bump on his X 
chromosome that makes him different from other boys. When he was just a 
toddler, his parents noticed he was slow to learn. The wonders of modern 
genetic research revealed that David has Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder 
that impairs mental development. 
</P>
<P>
 But modern genetics was as much a curse as a blessing for this little boy, his 
parents and three sisters. Although it was a comfort to know what was wrong, 
the same sophisticated blood test that identified David's condition cost this 
rural New Hampshire family their health insurance after a clerk stumbled across 
the test results in the boy's files two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 David's mother, Jamie Stephenson, tried desperately to fight the cancellation. 
As a writer for a political science quarterly and the wife of a dentist, 
Stephenson knows a little about health care, and a lot about public policy. She 
bent the ears of anyone who would listen -- her state's assistant insurance 
commissioner, a disability rights lawyer and a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Fragile X is not a disease; it is a developmental disorder, she told them. 
Besides, no one else in the family was affected. Surely, she insisted, the 
insurance company could not do what it had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Stephenson recalled, "everybody I contacted who was in any position of 
power said: 'They can do this. Our hands are tied.' And then I was faced with 
the reality that we were not covered. And I had these four little children. We 
were without insurance for four months, four nail-biting months. It was summer. 
Every time I took my kids to the beach in the car, all I could think of was, if 
we had a car accident, we would lose our home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Manikian family finally got health insurance, but only after four 
companies turned them down. Their experience highlights what may become the 
bitterest irony of the DNA revolution: genetic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Manikians were held hostage by heredity, they are not alone. Experts 
estimate that either as a result of sophisticated new genetic tests or a family 
history of inherited illness, thousands of Americans are being discriminated 
against because of something over which they have no control: their genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurers, observers say, do not want to take the risk of covering someone 
who may require expensive medical treatment and are laying bare their genetic 
biases. So too are employers and adoption agencies. All of this is occurring in 
a legislative vacuum; because the issue is so fresh, only a few states have 
laws barring genetic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 And some predict that as genetic tests are developed for more diseases, the 
number of discrimination victims could explode in the not-too-distant future. 
As one bitterly complained: "Your credit history has more protection than your 
medical history." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Michigan market research analyst whose two brothers had colon cancer 
decided to have a colonoscopy -- a test to see if she is at risk for the 
disease, which is known to run in families. Researchers recently pinpointed two 
genes that they believe cause the familial form of colon cancer. The woman was 
tested several times. Each test came back fine. But when she attempted to 
purchase health insurance, she was turned down -- the fact that she had been 
tested at all was a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Louisiana couple had a child with cystic fibrosis, a potentially fatal 
genetic disorder that leads to chronic lung infections. When the wife became 
pregnant, prenatal testing revealed that the second baby carried a mutant gene 
associated with the disease. When the couple said they would have the baby 
anyway, their health maintenance organization told them it might not cover the 
pregnancy, and might also withdraw coverage for their first child. The couple 
threatened to sue; their coverage remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Arizona man was hired for a manufacturing job. During a physical 
examination, the company doctor asked about blood he spotted in the man's 
urine. The man said that years before, his family had been tested for Alport's 
syndrome, a genetic kidney disorder. Although he had been instructed to keep an 
eye on his blood pressure, he otherwise had no medical problems and was not 
sure if he had the disease. He lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Indiana woman who is at risk for Huntington's disease, a degenerative 
brain disorder, did not want to take the chance of passing on the Huntington's 
gene to another generation. She and her husband decided to adopt. They had 
completed counseling and were halfway through a pre-adoption home study when 
the agency they were working with asked them to withdraw because of her genetic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should I be judged by a disease that I am only at risk for and that may not 
develop for some years to come?" she wrote in angry response to a survey 
conducted by researchers studying genetic discrimination. "Does this make me 
any different than anyone with diabetes or cancer, for example, in their 
ancestry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul R. Billings, clinical geneticist in Palo Alto who collected these and 
other case histories, sees them as a troubling harbinger. Billings is one of a 
handful of geneticists who is studying genetic discrimination, particularly in 
health insurance. He has been outspoken, calling not only for health care 
reform but for laws to protect the privacy of genetic information. 
</P>
<P>
 His work has not endeared him to his fellow scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them hate me for it," he said. "It often gets portrayed that I am 
somehow trying to throw cold water on the explosion in genetic testing and 
genetic information, that I am trying to bring genetic research to a halt, 
which is complete bunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic research is proceeding at such a rapid clip that it would be nearly 
impossible to bring it to a halt. Over the last decade, using sophisticated 
techniques that allow them to examine DNA, scientists are isolating new genes 
faster than anyone can say "deoxyribonucleic acid." Already, researchers have 
identified more than 5,000 genes linked to specific disorders. Over the last 
five years, more than 50 new tests for genetic conditions have been developed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the National Institutes of Health, the genetic equivalent of Christopher 
Columbus' voyage is under way as scientists race to map the entire genetic 
blueprint of the human body. The Human Genome Project, a 15-year, $3-billion 
effort, is set for completion in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 The research holds great promise for diagnosing, averting -- and, scientists 
hope, eventually curing -- myriad inherited afflictions. Already, the magic of 
genetics is changing lives. The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease, a fatal brain 
disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews, has declined more than 90% since 1971, 
when genetic screening became available. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 1 million people have taken tests for the disease, which 
occurs when both parents carry the Tay-Sachs gene and which usually kills 
children by age 3. Many couples have terminated pregnancies to avoid bearing 
Tay-Sachs babies. And in a novel program run by Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn and 
Israel, young people who are tested for the Tay-Sachs gene submit the results 
to a central registry. When they are dating or considering marriage, they can 
phone the registry to see if the match is compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, most conditions for which genes have been identified are, like 
Tay-Sachs, Huntington's disease and Fragile X syndrome, relatively rare. But 
researchers recently isolated two genes for colon cancer, and they are closing 
in on a gene for a highly hereditary form of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts warn that as genes are identified for such common illnesses, the 
general population could become a target of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the watershed point," Billings said. "We are at a point where the 
basic science is (such) that we are going to see an explosion in genetic tests 
which are applicable to a large number of people. Either this is going to mean 
real improvements in people's health . . . or the incidence of discrimination, 
segregation and what I call mismanaged care will increase enormously." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Volner is health policy director for the Alliance of Genetic Support 
Groups, an umbrella organization that represents more than 200 associations. 
She says there is a not-so-funny joke running around the genetics community 
today: 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, we will come to the point where only one person in the United States 
has insurance anymore, and the reason is he was the one person who had never 
been tested." 
</P>
<P>
 It is black humor, she admits, but it may not be too far from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists engaged in genetic research face a terrible irony: After 
painstaking years of laboratory work, their efforts might hurt the very people 
they are intended to help. For those at risk for a genetic disease, the specter 
of discrimination creates an agonizing dilemma: to test or not to test? 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Aylstock is a Roseville, Calif., woman whose son has Klinefelter's 
syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality that gives boys the physical 
characteristics of girls and is often linked with mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Catch-22," she said. "If you don't find out that your child has this, 
then you are not going to get the services that you need. And if you do find 
out, and your insurance cancels you, then you are not going to get the services 
that you need." 
</P>
<P>
 The Catch-22 is a frequent topic of discussion among genetics counselors, who 
make their living by advising people who are considering testing. Most tell 
clients to get their personal affairs in order -- health and life insurance, 
potential career moves -- before getting tested. They often suggest that 
patients keep insurers in the dark by paying for tests themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 One genetic counselor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles describes 
an elaborate dance he performs with insurance companies that ask for too many 
details. He sends only a letter confirming that the patient had a genetic test. 
Never does he send medical records containing results. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they say: 'I need more information in order to pay this bill,' I say: 
'What information do you need?' " said the counselor, who asked not to be 
identified. "They say, 'Everybody else just sends us medical records.' Well, if 
you send them medical records, you are sending them a lot more information than 
they really need. They do not need to know what's going on to pay the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Morelli, an Ohio civil rights lawyer, has become a crusader for 
legislation to protect genetic privacy. She receives so many phone calls from 
people who have lost health insurance and other benefits as a result of genetic 
testing that she has taken to calling herself "the Ann Landers of genetic 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get at least two calls or two letters a week from people all over the world 
saying, 'This happened to me. What can I do about it?' " she said. "People come 
up to me in the grocery store, the bank. One person told me she was going to 
flee to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 But most do not want any publicity. They are afraid to talk openly about their 
genetic status. Morelli and others lament this reluctance, saying it 
contributes to a "dirty little secret" atmosphere reminiscent of the days when 
people were afraid to talk about cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I need people to testify in front of the legislature, it's horrible," 
Morelli said. "Most people refuse to go -- not that I blame them. They say, 'My 
employer will find out. My family will find out.' The trouble is that the 
legislators want to see faces. They think you're being anecdotal unless you 
present a few horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of many of these "horror stories," experts say, are deep 
misunderstandings about what genetic tests mean. Insurance carriers, and the 
public, equate having a gene for a certain disease with an automatic doomsday 
sentence. Often this is not the case. Like nearly everything else in life, 
illness can be a function of both nature and nurture. Genes can predispose 
people toward certain diseases, but lifestyle may play an equally important 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most conditions where you find a genetic marker, you can't predict the 
severity of the disease or when the disease is going to occur," said Jonathan 
Beckwith, a Harvard University geneticist who advises the Human Genome Project 
on ethical issues. "It is not precise information. And yet insurance companies 
are already using that information to deny insurance or hike insurance rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal access to health insurance, the centerpiece of President Clinton's 
health care reform plan, is one possible fix. In a report issued in May, 
Beckwith and other members of a group called the ELSI (Ethical, Legal and 
Social Implications) Committee of the Human Genome Project favored universal 
insurance, which would require insurers to provide coverage whatever a person's 
medical condition. But the ELSI group did not endorse the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 State laws are another answer. In the absence of health care reform, Ohio and 
Wisconsin have laws prohibiting health insurance firms from using genetic 
information to deny medical coverage. California and New York have similar laws 
on the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans With Disabilities Act, adopted in 1990, offers some protection 
against discrimination on the job, but Billings and others say it does not go 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry insists it has the right to use genetic information to 
deny applications for certain plans, particularly disability and life 
insurance, where payouts are often large and where a purchaser may buy a policy 
knowing he or she has a serious genetic disorder and will need to make a claim. 
The industry's response is less clear with regard to health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Insurance Assn. of America, an industry trade group, supports 
health reform and universal coverage -- a move that would effectively prevent 
companies from considering genetic information for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But, spokesman Harvie Raymond said, the group opposes state laws that would do 
the same, on the grounds that they are premature and will only attack the 
problem in piecemeal fashion. Raymond said that until health reform is in 
place, his group believes it is "inappropriate and unfair" for insurers to be 
prevented from using genetic information in decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, medical ethicists, geneticists and legislators are grappling with 
even stickier questions: Should genetic information be used to deny 
applications for disability plans or life insurance, which are not considered 
as much of a "right" as medical coverage? Should employers consider genetics 
when hiring? Should adoption agencies use genetics in selecting prospective 
parents? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really looking at the technology zooming ahead of public policy," said 
Nachama Wilker, executive director of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a 
Boston-based group that is trying to draft laws to combat genetic 
discrimination. "The big issues that are out in front of us right now are: How 
is our society going to deal with genetic information? How important is it 
going to become, and who is going to have access to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In New Hampshire, Jamie Stephenson is asking herself the same questions. 
</P>
<P>
 She worries, in particular, about her daughters, ages 6, 10 and 12. They, too, 
carry the mutant gene for Fragile X syndrome, although their sex spares them 
the condition. (Unlike boys, who carry one X and one Y chromosome, girls have 
two X chromosomes, which enables the chromosome with "good" genes to cancel out 
the bad.) 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughters have this on their medical records," Stephenson said. "What's 
going to happen to them when they become adults and they try to get jobs, or 
health insurance?" 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers a conversation she had with Nobel laureate James Watson, former 
head of the Human Genome Project who, as co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, 
helped spawn the genetic revolution. She met him at a conference on the science 
of genetics, and when she asked him about the future, the picture he painted 
was bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he fears a new underclass evolving of people with genetic conditions 
who are going to be discriminated against, just like people with the wrong skin 
color used to be discriminated against," Stephenson recalled. "Is this what my 
daughters will be? When they get to be adults, are they going to be the new 
underclass?" 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: How insurance companies decide what to cover. Testing Genes 
</P>
<P>
 Once scientists discover a defective gene that causes disease, they are able 
to test for it. Since the late 1980s, more than 50 new genetic tests have been 
developed. Some can be done prenatally, or almost immediately after a baby is 
born. Here is a partial list of genetic disorders for which tests are 
available: 
</P>
<P>
 * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). A degenerative disease 
of the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beta-thalassemia. Prevalent in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and 
Southeast Asia. Causes a breakup of the red blood cells, leading to anemia, 
spleen enlargement and sometimes abnormal growth of bones. Fatal in early 
childhood if untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charcot Marie-Tooth disease. Causes foot and hand deformities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cystic fibrosis. The most common lethal genetic defect, causing chronic lung 
infections and an inability to absorb fats and other nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Major form of muscular dystrophy in children, 
which causes progressive degeneration of the muscle fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fragile X syndrome. Chromosomal disorder causing mental impairment, ranging 
from subtle learning disabilities to severe retardation and autism. Symptoms 
are generally more pronounced in boys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaucher's disease. A disorder common to Ashkenazi Jews. The most severe form 
appears in infancy, causes central nervous system impairment and death within 
the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington's disease. A degenerative brain disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marfan syndrome. Disease of the connective tissue that often strikes 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Myotonic dystrophy: Most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retinoblastoma. Inherited eye tumors in children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tay-Sachs disease. A brain disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews. Causes 
death in early childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coming soon: A genetic test for familial colon cancer. Researchers recently 
identified two genes that account for more than 90% of this inherited form of 
cancer.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON'S BRIEF TERM IN HOUSE LEAVES 
CONTROVERSY; POLITICS: SOME REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY THAT HE DID NOT WAIT LONGER 
BEFORE PURSUING HIS AMBITIONS. OTHERS CARRY A GRUDGE FROM HIS 1992 DEFEAT OF 
LONGTIME CONGRESSMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a lot of work, but Chet Dotter has fond memories of the spring of 1992 
when he and Michael Huffington drove throughout the rolling green hills of 
California's Central Coast and talked politics with local ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a Republican and former Texas oilman, was the citizen candidate 
with fresh ideas that Dotter thought was desperately needed in Congress. He was 
also a multimillionaire who could finance his own campaign and take office 
without any debts to the traditional powerbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dotter shared much of the credit when Huffington narrowly beat a veteran GOP 
incumbent in the June primary. But when the freshman congressman announced only 
a few months after taking office that he would abandon his new House seat to 
challenge U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Dotter felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it would not have happened," the retired Los Angeles aerospace 
executive says. "I told him, 'It looks to me like you've become one of them.' . 
. . The whole point of the campaign was that he would be a different type of 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington is certainly a different type of candidate. Most statewide hopefuls 
spend years building a hometown base to use as a springboard, but Huffington's 
brief political tenure has left him a controversial subject in his 22nd 
Congressional District, which stretches along the Central Coast from Santa 
Barbara to San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Dotter, are disappointed that he did not wait longer before 
pursuing other ambitions. Others are still angry at Huffington for his 
$5-million campaign that unseated Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, a Republican who 
represented the area for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Independent newspaper has picked up on the Republican rancor 
in a column called the Angry Poodle Barbecue. The column's irreverent author 
includes a regular "Huff Watch" with a front-page logo. And he refers to 
Huffington as the area's "alleged congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Huffington's sharpest critics have even threatened to organize a 
"Republicans for Feinstein" committee if he wins the primary. Barney Klinger, a 
conservative activist who has been host to two Republican Presidents at his 
Santa Barbara estate, pledged to raise at least $100,000 to "guarantee that we 
will deliver his congressional district for Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and many GOP leaders downplay the controversy, and most party 
officials continue to support the incumbent congressman, whom many expect to 
win the Republican Senate nomination June 7. But they acknowledge that he 
remains a delicate subject for the local party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell you everything is hunky-dory, but there is a division left and 
it is pretty bitter," said Boyd Larson, chairman of the Santa Barbara 
Republican Party. "There's a lot of downright hate. . . . I've been trying (to 
bring the sides together) and I haven't had much luck. It's beginning to take 
its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 In a close primary battle between two leading Republicans seeking Huffington's 
House seat, both candidates have kept a distance from their party's incumbent. 
"I think any candidate, in my mind, would want to stay clear of that particular 
controversy, especially before the primary," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the congressional candidates, Santa Barbara County Supervisor Mike 
Stoker, has instead referred to himself as a Lagomarsino-style candidate. And 
his rival, state Assemblywoman Andrea Seastrand (R-Pismo Beach), said she has 
heard from campaigning door to door that Republican voters are still divided 
over Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hear that people are scratching their heads about why he said he was 
going to be their congressman and as soon as he gets in office, he runs for the 
Senate," said Steve Decker, a Santa Barbara Republican candidate for state 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 46, said he believes the complaints are limited to a small but 
vocal core of activists and that the overwhelming majority of voters support 
his Senate campaign. He also contends that most of his critics are Republicans 
still loyal to Lagomarsino, who has made no secret of his bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, most people are apolitical," Huffington said in an interview. "The 
majority of people back in the district, I'm sure, don't have a problem with my 
running." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22nd Congressional District is one of those politically quixotic parts of 
California where voters usually elect Republicans and Democrats on the same 
ballot and where Ross Perot's presidential campaign had one of its best 
showings. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington actually lost Santa Barbara County to Lagomarsino in the 1992 
primary, but he won the race by taking San Luis Obispo County, an area that was 
added to the district during reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge the extent of the Huffington controversy among the 
district's voters because there have not been any recent elections or polls. 
Huffington said he bases his judgment by the reception he gets on visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the perception is, Huffington's unsettled home turf is certain to be 
an issue in the Senate race. Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager, said: 
"We're delighted that the people who have followed his record the closest, the 
people who know him best, are the people who are going to quite vocally oppose 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein knows well about the scrutiny given to a statewide candidate's home 
turf. In her unsuccessful 1990 campaign for governor, she boasted in television 
commercials about her success in lowering crime rates while she was mayor of 
San Francisco. At the same time, Republican Pete Wilson's commercials attacked 
her for raising the city's taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, Huffington's chief rival in the Republican 
Senate primary, has pointed to his lopsided elections in conservative Orange 
County -- 75% support in 1986 and 1988 -- as proof of the resonance in his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's district is getting plenty of scrutiny from reporters seeking to 
learn more about California's most unknown major candidate. But it is not an 
issue many local Republicans want to talk about, especially the candidates on 
the ballot in Santa Barbara this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve MacElvaine, a candidate for state Senate, recently joked to a Republican 
club dinner that he was glad to see Huffington and Lagomarsino supporters 
finally sitting in the same room together. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stoker, one of the Republicans seeking Huffington's seat, admits he 
has developed a short fuse when he is asked about the incumbent. Stoker is 
endorsed by Lagomarsino and he declined to say whether he would support 
Huffington against Feinstein in the general election. But he is trying to unite 
the party behind his campaign and he is losing patience talking about the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Read my lips. I don't think of Mike Huffington," he said. "If I'm going to 
spend my time thinking about what Mike Huffington's image is in the district, 
I'm going to lose a congressional race."

INVESTIGATE AN OUTBREAK OF CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA, BUT CHANCES OF ANSWERS ARE SLIM

 Connie Smith lives with the horrifying thought that in trying to make a better 
life for her family, she may have put her son in the remorseless grip of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after the Smith family moved to this seaside suburb north of San 
Diego, 1-year-old Kenneth Smith Jr., known simply as Junior, fell mysteriously 
ill and was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which kills more 
children than any other disease in America. 
</P>
<P>
 As Junior began treatments, Smith met other parents of cancer-stricken 
children and together they discovered a startling fact that had gone undetected 
by doctors: An unusually large number of Oceanside-area children had been 
discovered to have leukemia about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing to fight rather than grieve, Smith and the other parents banded 
together to persuade public health officials that they had discovered a cancer 
cluster in Oceanside and urge an investigation into the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of babies getting sick and I don't like it," said Connie 
Smith. "My son is already sick but maybe there are other babies that we can 
help save if can we find out what's causing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Although cancer is common, clusters are not. The Oceanside cluster, now being 
probed by county and state health investigators, is one of only a handful of 
cancer clusters discovered in California in the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to panic anyone but we want answers," said Charlotte Barry, 
whose daughter, Laura, is undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 For Connie Smith and her husband, Kenneth, the unlikely road to becoming 
public health activists began two years ago when they decided to leave the 
community of Signal Hill near Long Beach. "I didn't want my kids to die in a 
drive-by shooting," Connie Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family moved to a small apartment in a tidy corner of Oceanside. Kenneth 
was willing to endure the long commute to his job in Los Angeles as an oil 
company mechanic so that Junior and his sister, Kristian, 6, could grow up 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oceanside, Junior developed an unshakable cough, began to bruise easily and 
became chronically tired and cranky. Distraught and frantic for explanations 
for her son's sudden decline, his mother accused a baby-sitter of mistreating 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 After being found to have leukemia, Junior began rigorous treatment at 
Childrens Hospital in San Diego, one of the nation's leading hospitals for 
treating childhood cancer. During the many hours at the hospital's hematology 
unit, Connie Smith began talking to other mothers of children undergoing 
leukemia treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the women had known one another before their children began undergoing 
the anti-cancer therapies that are part of a leukemia patient's daily rigors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connie Smith, Charlotte Barry, Maryanne Smith, Linda Cotov and others 
began to suspect that there were an unusually high number of childhood leukemia 
cases in the area where they lived. The area, which has an approximate 
five-mile radius, includes the northeast section of Oceanside and adjoining 
parts of Vista and Bonsall. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Smith and the others compiled a list of neighborhood children who were 
sick with leukemia and, after finding the public health agencies unresponsive, 
they took their list and their plea for help to the local media. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know God is protecting Hank, but if we can do something to help protect 
other children, that would be great," said Maryanne Smith, whose son, Hank, 
needs a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 The public health system has concluded that the mothers were right: Seven 
children under the age of 3 were found to have leukemia during the middle 
months of 1993, a rate two to three times higher than the national average for 
the disease, a rate high enough to be considered a cluster. 
</P>
<P>
 In medical circles, there is considerable disagreement about cancer clusters 
and whether a cluster's existence is anything more than a statistical anomaly, 
a random event. Some researchers even assert that it is medical folly to look 
for causes and that cluster investigations only cruelly raise the expectations 
of cancer patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts from the San Diego County and California health departments, although 
committed to an investigation, have nevertheless warned the parents and press 
that the chances of pinpointing a cause for the Oceanside cluster are 
extraordinarily small. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents know this but are convinced that something is dreadfully wrong in 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm boiling mad but it doesn't do any good to stay mad," said Ernie Haro, 
whose son, Steven, needs a bone marrow transplant. "Somebody out there has to 
know something about what is in our soil or in our air that's making our kids 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 The cluster list compiled by the mothers actually included a dozen children 
dating to 1991 who had contracted the disease. State and county health 
officials have limited their cluster investigation to the seven cases from 
1993, including one child who died. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer cluster has become the talk of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 After the story was first aired on KFMB-TV, the local CBS affiliate, hundreds 
of calls from parents and would-be home buyers flooded the television station 
and the San Diego County chapter of the Leukemia Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "One caller said she was about to close on a house in Oceanside and asked 
whether she should go ahead or back out," said Sharon Murphy, the chapter's 
executive director. "It's not right that people have to live with that kind of 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy hopes to get approval for an epidemiologist from the group's national 
office to join in the county and state investigation. She is advising parents 
and others not to leave Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Ross, whose 3-year-old daughter, Meghan, died of leukemia in November, 
1992, lives near Charlotte Barry and Maryanne Smith. She said a neighbor called 
her at 6:15 one morning after reading about the cancer cluster in the Oceanside 
Blade-Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really panicked," Ross said. "She said, 'Do you think we should 
move?' I don't think it's time to panic but it's time for concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said that she and her husband could never understand how their daughter 
had been so healthy when the family lived in Anaheim but became so sick just 
months after moving to Oceanside. "We couldn't come up with an answer," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blade-Citizen's coverage of the cancer cluster, praised as factual and 
restrained by parents and doctors, has nevertheless raised the anger of some in 
the business community. One real estate agent told the paper, "I have 
compassion for these people, but to make it look like Oceanside is the cancer 
capital of the world is unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The cluster investigators will start by comparing medical histories of the 
seven children to look for similarities in tumor size and physiology and for 
any common problems experienced by their mothers during pregnancy. Comparative 
biopsies are a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In more advanced cancer cluster investigations, like those undertaken by the 
federal Centers for Disease Control, air, water and soil samples are taken. If 
the Oceanside investigation gets that elaborate, environmental suspects abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the homes are in new subdivisions on former agricultural sites, 
where pesticides were used for decades. Others are near high power lines. An 
abandoned dump site is in the area. Two victims lived near Camp Pendleton, 
where hazardous materials are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is the "new town theory" held by some scientists who believe cancer 
clusters happen for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory, based on cancer cluster research in England, holds that certain 
diseases occur in higher proportions in new communities because people, in 
effect, lose their natural immunity when they move from more densely populated 
urban centers. The phenomenon was first detected among young polio victims in 
the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen Waterman, chief of community disease control for San Diego County, 
puts the odds at finding a cause of the Oceanside cluster at less than one in a 
thousand. Others are less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a cause found for a leukemia cluster," said Kenneth 
Rothman, editor of Epidemiology magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the very meaning of clusters, and whether they are anything more than 
statistical blips, is hotly debated among epidemiologists, whose specialty is 
the investigation of the causes of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cancer clusters are one of the issues that have tortured epidemiologists for 
years, particularly with leukemia," said Dr. Dimitrios Trichopoulos, chief of 
epidemiology at Harvard Medical School. "It challenges common sense; if there 
is a cluster, there must be a reason. But so much in medicine, like in life, is 
just chance or bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman wrote an article for the American Journal of Epidemiology, "A Sobering 
Start for the Cluster Busters Conference." In it, he doubted the scientific 
wisdom of spending time and resources investigating most cancer clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services takes a somewhat contrary viewpoint. 
Dr. Raymond Richard Neutra, one of the department's cluster hunters, wrote a 
spirited rejoinder to Rothman in the same academic journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Neutra, Dr. Eva Glazer, a state health department cancer expert who is 
working on the Oceanside cluster, takes the long view. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the cause of the Oceanside cluster remains unknown, the information 
gleaned may someday contribute to cracking the mystery of clusters, Glazer 
said. She notes no new cases have been diagnosed since October, which tends to 
support the random-event theory. 
</P>
<P>
 The long view, of course, is hard to accept for parents whose children have 
gone bald from chemotherapy, are subject to a daunting list of infections and 
complications, and whose chances for survival are listed at less than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie and Kenneth Smith have moved from Oceanside, saying they want to escape 
the overhead power lines -- although there is no proof that electromagnetic 
fields from power lines cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughter, Kristian, is being educated at home for fear that she might 
bring home an infection from school that would kill Junior, who is recuperating 
from a bone marrow transplant. Kristian was the transplant donor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryanne and Chuck Smith, initially buoyed by the news that Hank was 
responding marvelously to chemotherapy, were crestfallen recently when their 
doctors told them that Hank will need a bone marrow transplant after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Barry's daughter, Laura, is adjusting to weekly chemotherapy 
sessions that leave her weak and nauseated. "She has a very strong body and a 
resilient soul," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda and Steve Cotov have moved so their daughter, Courtney, who is not yet 
2, is closer to Childrens Hospital. "If we could find a cause for this, maybe 
it would be easier to bear," Linda Cotov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie and Valerie Haro are waiting for a bone marrow donor to be found for 
2-year-old Steven. Unfortunately, no family member is a match. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so young and he may not ever get a chance to hit a home run or kiss a 
girl at the beach," Ernie Haro said. "I just want to know the reason."

ON CALIFORNIA: CREEPING TOWARD NORMALCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The healing of Los Angeles will not happen at once. There will be no single 
breakthrough event to end this long, bleak passage -- no snip of a ceremonial 
ribbon, no pounding of a last golden spike. Instead, progress toward normalcy 
will come slowly, almost imperceptibly, a journey of halting steps forward and 
occasional stumbles back, a serial of small moments. 
</P>
<P>
 One such moment was unfolding here last week. With no great fanfare, a 
shopping mall knocked out by the Northridge earthquake was, two months later, 
finally creeping back to life. Last weekend, about 30 of the Fashion Square 
mall's 130 stores reopened. Shoppers who lined up Saturday morning for the 
moment applauded as the doors unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "People kept coming up Saturday and saying how happy they were to have us open 
again," said Marti Devore, who sells men's clothing in the mall at a store 
founded by her father half a century ago. "They were so anxious to have their 
community spot back. After the earthquake, they would call all the time, asking 
when, when, when, when, when?" 
</P>
<P>
 Marti is a friend. Her husband is a colleague at this newspaper. Over the 
years, she has tried to teach me a bit about fashion, and never has there been 
a more needy pupil. I also have gained from her some sense of the perils of 
running a retail business, especially amid a recession. Last Christmas had been 
a good one for the store, the first in a while. She felt perhaps a corner had 
been turned. What she could not know, of course, was that a few weeks away, on 
the other side, an earthquake waited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the quake I made it to Fashion Square. Marti's store had 
survived, but the mall in general was a stunning jumble of scattered 
merchandise, toppled mannequins, broken glass, flooded storefronts. Recovery 
was difficult to imagine. I remember telling myself then that maybe Marti had 
sold her last pair of pants. And I remember sensing something in her demeanor, 
a certain flatness to her spirit, that suggested she thought the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess," Marti acknowledged Thursday, "I was pretty depressed at first." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy, though, in the immediate aftermath of crisis, to underestimate 
people -- friends, strangers, even ourselves. Before too long, Marti was 
packing clothes out the back door to deliver to customers by car. "Customers 
still kept calling," she said. "They still needed ties to match their shirts." 
Similarly, out in the mall, what had seemed an irredeemable mess slowly was 
being put back together, one piece at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no handbook for how to rebuild a mall after an earthquake," Saul 
McCormack, the manager of the mall, said Thursday as he stood in the center of 
Fashion Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," interjected Steven L. Carter, the lead contractor on the repair job, 
"there is now." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were proud of their progress. They spoke of 16-hour days, filled 
with fast work and followed by rounds of inspections and reinspections, of 
every system, every weld, every foot of crawl space. Not all the repairs were 
to the structure, which, cosmetic damage aside, had escaped pretty much intact. 
Work, too, was needed on the psyche of merchants. Some seemed almost paralyzed 
at first, as though, McCormack said, they "had fallen off the earth, had just 
lost the plot." He might have been speaking about the whole city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth here, as everywhere, is hardly complete. On Thursday two huge 
cranes loomed over the mall. The parking garage was in a pile, waiting to be 
hauled away. Inside, painters and electricians roamed the main corridor, and 
the whine of electric saws competed with peppy instrumentals on the sound 
system. Among the trickle of shoppers were a few who seemed almost stricken by 
the number of stores still closed for repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really sad," one mother said as she watched her 16-month-old daughter 
stare into the still-closed Disney Store. The little girl was transfixed by a 
mechanical Minnie Mouse. The mother had her eye on the drywall barricades that 
blocked entrance to the majority of storefronts. "Maybe they should have waited 
until more stores were ready or something. Even the drive here was depressing. 
You see all those apartment houses with so much damage. It just feels like 
nothing is ever going to be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 But it will be, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she said, after a pause, "I guess it will." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't happen at once. It won't happen soon enough. And yet, eventually, 
slowly, piece by piece, moment by small moment, a house here, an off-ramp 
there, a coffee shop, a bank, a mall -- it will happen. It is happening.

STAKES HIGH IN POST-COMMUNIST UKRAINE ELECTION; POLITICS: IN TODAY'S VOTE, 
WIDESPREAD APATHY COMPETES WITH FRUSTRATION TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT'S INABILITY 
TO STOP THE ECONOMIC HEMORRHAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a historic but wildly confusing exercise in democracy, Ukrainians head for 
the polls today to try to elect their first post-Communist Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest could bring an end to the chronic political chaos that has plagued 
and impoverished this new nation of 52 million. Or it could doom a 
still-nuclear country the size of France to more infighting, corruption and 
political paralysis, deeper regional rifts, and even disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes have not been higher -- nor the political terrain more bewildering 
-- since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in August, 1991. A 
staggering 5,833 candidates from 29 parties are competing for 450 seats. But 
the election law is so Byzantine that the contest may not produce a quorum of 
301 lawmakers even after a runoff election scheduled for April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 If this occurs, the entire election might have to be repeated, prolonging the 
political turmoil. President Leonid Kravchuk has said that under such a 
scenario, he would ask the old Parliament to approve a draft constitution; seek 
expanded presidential powers, and postpone the presidential and regional 
elections now scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
 If the elections do manage to produce a new Parliament, it is not clear 
whether it will be any more progressive or competent than the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to be optimistic in view of the recent elections in Lithuania, 
Poland and Russia," in which Communists and nationalists scored big gains, one 
Western diplomat here said. "Unfortunately, much of the population identifies 
change and reform with what's already happened, and they're not very impressed 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread political apathy competes with profound frustration with the 
government's inability to stop Ukraine's economic hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communists who repainted themselves as democrats and fathers of the Ukrainian 
rebirth promised us meat and fat, and then for two years they did nothing but 
loot Ukraine and take planeloads of hard currency," Sergei I. Shuvainikov, 
chairman of the Russian Party of Crimea, said in summing up the views of many 
Ukrainians. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll found that 84% fault the government's disastrous handling of the 
Ukrainian economy. Production in the state sector shrank by 25% last year, and 
inflation went into orbit at 6,000% to 10,000%, according to various estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, most Ukrainians want to throw the incumbents out. Although 
52% had not decided whom to vote for, 62% vowed to vote against the incumbent 
lawmakers. About 150 of the 450 members of Parliament are standing for 
reelection, and many are in deep trouble. If voters bother to turn out, some of 
Ukraine's biggest political names could find themselves unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 But to choose a better bunch of representatives, the inexperienced electorate 
will have to grapple with issues far more complex than those faced by voters in 
most Western democracies: 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the path to economic salvation? Many wonder whether Ukraine can 
launch long-delayed free-market reform without inviting "shock therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 * How can the nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking Western region, which mistrusts 
Russia and seeks economic and military integration with Europe, be reconciled 
with industrial, Russified eastern Ukraine, which seeks closer economic ties 
with Russia? 
</P>
<P>
 * Should Ukraine continue to implement the nuclear disarmament agreement 
Kravchuk signed with the American and Russian presidents in January, despite 
concern about rising Russian nationalism and separatist movements in the Crimea 
and the eastern region of Donetsk? 
</P>
<P>
 "America is doing everything possible to weaken Ukraine," said Viktor Melnick, 
a leader of the Ukrainian National Assembly, which favors keeping Ukraine a 
nuclear power. The hard-line nationalist group has candidates running in 70 
districts, sympathizers in 80 more, and its own paramilitary organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the last warhead is taken out of Ukraine, then armed conflict will 
begin," Melnick said. "It will create major instability in the heart of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, support for such dire views is slim. Moreover, the election 
system, which consists of 450 individual races and requires that at least 25% 
of all registered voters in each district vote for the winning candidate, 
prevents the emergence of a national extremist leader like Russia's Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 But a strong showing by nationalists in the west, Socialists and Communists in 
the east or separatists in Crimea could accelerate dangerous forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials in the Donetsk region called a referendum on making Russian as 
well as Ukrainian an official state language, making Ukraine into a federation 
of its regions, and becoming a full member of the economic union of the 
Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimean residents will also be asked to vote to give their strategic peninsula 
more autonomy, a move some see as a precursor to secession from Ukraine and 
reunification with Russia. After legal squabbles with Kiev, both referendums 
were downgraded to legally non-binding plebiscites. Although the proposals 
outrage Ukrainian nationalists, they are expected to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting for the mainstream vote are two new coalitions that each claim the 
reformist mantle. The voice of the east is ousted Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, 
now leading the Interregional Bloc for Reform. Kuchma argues that the West 
doesn't care about Ukraine, so partnership with Moscow is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think that if they re-establish ties with Russia, everything will be 
fine," said Kravchuk adviser Mikola I. Mihalchenko, who argues that Russia has 
enough industrial white elephants of its own to have designs on the obsolete 
metals plants and inefficient coal mines of eastern Ukraine. "It cannot be, 
because neither Ukraine nor Russia are what they were before." 
</P>
<P>
 The voice of the west is nationalist Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the Rukh 
movement and a veteran of the Ukrainian independence drive. Chornovil and his 
Ukrayina Democratic Coalition have fielded 342 candidates and hope to claim a 
fifth of the seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy for voters to even figure out who's who. Three-quarters of 
the 5,833 candidates are running as independents, even though they may have 
party ties. The average ballot will list 13 names, and voters will have to 
cross off every candidate they don't want in order to elect the one they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the obstacles, "this is the first election where the Communist 
Party does not control all the levers of power as it did before," said former 
U.S. diplomat Myron Wasylyk. 
</P>
<P>
 That is no guarantee that the new Parliament will be a paragon of civic-minded 
reform, but Wasylyk believes it will be better than the last legislature, in 
which Communists held 239 of the 450 seats, Democrats and centrists believed 
"compromise" meant "sellout," and none could cooperate with Kravchuk, a former 
Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be worse," Wasylyk said. "It just can't be worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of election law violations, petty and less so, have poured into Kiev. 
In Dnepropetrovsk, candidates were warned to mind their campaign-trail manners 
after some promised voters free funerals -- an attractive offer fo impoverished 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Poltava region, gasoline prices dropped abruptly after the chairman of 
the State Commission on Oil and Gas announced his candidacy there, according to 
Elections 94, a Kiev-based watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 On election eve, a candidate from the Ukrayina coalition was accosted in the 
eastern region of Dnepropetrovsk by four attackers who stomped on his Ukrainian 
flag and shouted anti-Ukrainian slurs. Two of his supporters were hospitalized 
and two attackers jailed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were also signs of a real attempt to make the election fair. A young 
Rukh activist who in past elections had voted for himself and for his parents 
went to cast an absentee ballot on the outskirts of Kiev on Friday. Election 
officials handed him a huge list with 25 candidates to choose from, but they 
would only give him one ballot.

THOUSANDS OF GERMANS PROTEST FIREBOMBING OF SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Germans shamed and enraged by the Passover-eve synagogue 
firebombing that recalled Nazi pogroms poured into Luebeck's streets Saturday 
as political leaders urged mass protests. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,500 people rallied before noon in Luebeck's market square, 
observing a five-minute silence over the Molotov cocktail attack by suspected 
neo-Nazis early Friday that left the city's synagogue charred and its tiny 
27-strong Jewish community in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars pulled to a stop, bridges were closed off, and many people in the 
northern port city stopped what they were doing in a gesture titled "A City 
Holds its Breath." 
</P>
<P>
 "38/94 Synagogues Are Burning Again -- Finally Ban All Nazi Organizations," 
said one banner brought to the rally. On Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi thugs burned Jewish 
homes, businesses and synagogues across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin, about 1,000 people held a 15-minute vigil and then marched to the 
Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Six occupants, including the synagogue's cantor, a survivor of the Nazi 
Holocaust, escaped unhurt in the blast. But the attack wounded the 
sensibilities of Germans frustrated by a violent minority of Nazi revivalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel called on Germans to show their disgust with the 
intolerance of rightist militants with demonstrations and candlelight vigils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans must make it clear abroad that these attacks are serious isolated 
incidents. . .of which we are ashamed," Kinkel told the Bild newspaper. 
Authorities offered a $30,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was widely reported as the first synagogue firebombing in Germany 
since the Nazi era, although a firebomb was thrown onto the steps of an Essen 
synagogue Feb. 28. It burned itself out without doing damage. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said it had found no leads as to 
attackers.

A CLASH OF STYLES, GENERATIONS FOR UKRAINE VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a chilly, darkened schoolhouse that bears witness to the energy crisis that 
is sapping Ukraine's economic vitality, Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko 
looks as worn as his old gray overcoat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had more attention been paid to Ukraine's energy supplies two or three years 
ago, then our economy would not be in such a terrible state today," the 
42-year-old physical chemist said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stump speech that contained more unpleasant "truth-telling" than most 
Americans might hear from politicians in a lifetime, Kostenko blamed his own 
government for incompetence and said Ukraine is being hijacked by "horrible 
corruption and Mafia clans that are uncontrollable and that, together with the 
executive branch, are making decisions that are disastrous for the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kostenko is a respected democrat and longtime activist in the Rukh 
independence movement. But only 15 voters braved the damp, raw evening to come 
hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the district, Semen V. Yufa was engaged in a different 
kind of "truth-telling." The 33-year-old businessman, one of Kiev's most famous 
entrepreneurs, had rented a downtown movie theater to meet with voters who were 
drawn in by street hawkers with megaphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want us to live like human beings at last, for us to tell each other the 
truth," said Yufa, who looked like a young Donald Trump in a snazzy blue 
double-breasted blazer with gold buttons, a crisp white shirt and a 
power-yellow tie that probably cost several times the average monthly salary 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we not only don't love each other, we hate each other," Yufa said. "We 
lie to each other constantly, and we think this is normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in the crowd of more than 100 nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 To his fans, Yufa is a tycoon, living proof that a creative, energetic person 
can succeed despite a business climate that remains decidedly hostile. To his 
enemies, he is a Mafiosi, a term used loosely here to describe anyone from a 
racketeer to an entrepreneur who cuts bureaucratic corners or avoids taxes, as 
nearly all private businesses must do. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest between Kostenko and Yufa, who are competing with 21 other 
candidates for their district's seat in the new Parliament, is as much a clash 
of generation and style as of ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostenko, like virtually all Ukrainian intellectuals, was educated in the 
Russian language, but as a political statement he will speak only in Ukrainian 
or not-quite-fluent English. Yufa, a former cook turned restaurant owner, then 
trader and investment fund manager, addressed his voters in Russian, the native 
language of most of Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
 Election law specifies that no candidate can spend more then $150 on his or 
her campaign. Kostenko claims that Yufa's slick color campaign brochures alone 
cost more than that -- but so far no one is enforcing the new campaign finance 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men support a free market and nuclear disarmament. But Kostenko, a 
nationalist, is concerned that Russia is not fairly compensating Ukraine for 
the value of the metal in Kiev's dismantled nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Yufa is more concerned about the stifling Ukrainian tax code, which he calls 
disgusting, and the inequities in the proposed privatization plan. His campaign 
goal has universal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want very much to live in a country where everyone is rich," he said.

ISRAEL TROOPS DISARM SETTLERS AS HEBRON VIOLENCE SEETHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual show of force, Israeli soldiers disarmed and detained several 
Jewish settlers after a confrontation Saturday at the Cave of the Patriarchs, 
where a settler killed about 30 Palestinian worshipers last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, meanwhile, said he would not move settlers out 
of the tense city of Hebron "at this stage" but hinted that he might later. 
</P>
<P>
 In several neighborhoods in Hebron, soldiers clashed with Palestinian 
stone-throwers Saturday after the army lifted a monthlong curfew imposed to 
quell protests after the Feb. 25 massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of youths pelted troops from behind barricades made of scrap metal and 
burning tires. Three Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers also fired tear gas to disperse several hundred Palestinians gathered 
at the ruins of an apartment house leveled this week in an army raid in which 
four gunmen from the Muslim militant group Hamas were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 21 people were hospitalized after inhaling tear gas, including 15 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lifting of the curfew, most of Hebron remained shuttered in 
mourning for the slain Hamas gunmen. Masked Hamas activists, carrying 
Palestinian flags, marched to a wake, chanting, "Oh, martyrs, your blood shall 
not be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 In clashes elsewhere in the occupied lands, about 30 Palestinians were hurt 
Saturday. Israel Radio said an Israeli officer was shot and wounded while on 
patrol in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cave of the Patriarchs, which has been closed to Muslim and Jewish 
worshipers since the massacre, angry Hebron settlers confronted soldiers after 
being barred from praying at the site, the army said. The site is revered by 
both Muslims and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Police disarmed and detained five settlers, Israel Radio said. Troops wrote 
down names of other settlers involved in the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 The action against the settlers was unusual, particularly in light of past 
complaints by Palestinians that soldiers have ignored settler vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO has demanded that Israel move the more than 400 settlers out of Hebron 
to reduce friction. Rabin said Saturday they would stay put for now but hinted 
he might act against the six Jewish enclaves in Hebron later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that at this stage we are intending, or at least I don't intend 
to move out the Jews who live in Hebron. All the rest is not something that 
should be said or discussed publicly," he said.

DE KLERK, ZULU CHIEF MEET 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South African President Frederik W. de Klerk said after a meeting with Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi on Saturday that he is more optimistic that 
free and fair elections can be held in the volatile Natal province next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men met as further killings scarred South Africa's Zulu heartland, 
torn by fighting between Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and its main black 
rival, the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and monitors said at least nine people, including two children, were 
killed in Natal and the KwaZulu black homeland Friday night and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was more optimistic about the prospects for South Africa's first 
all-race poll in the Natal region, De Klerk said, "Yes, although the challenges 
which we face on the ground are formidable." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 people have died in violence in four years of apartheid reform, 
many of them in Natal.

A CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY HANGS OVER MEXICAN ELECTIONS; POLITICS: FOLLOWING THE 
SLAYING OF LUIS DONALDO COLOSIO, CONGRESS QUIETLY PASSES REFORM PACKAGE. 
CRITICS SAY THE CHANGES ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GUARANTEE CLEAN VOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexicans began the traditional Easter week vacation Saturday under a cloud of 
uncertainty caused by the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio and apprehension about 
its effects on Aug. 21 federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about whether the elections will be free of fraud and how voters will 
react if they are not have been fueled by Wednesday's assassination of Colosio, 
presidential candidate of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of the nation mourned Colosio last week, the Mexican Congress 
quietly passed a long-anticipated electoral reform package aimed at ensuring 
that those elections will be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms were originally considered a response to demands for democracy 
raised by rebels who briefly took several towns in the southern state of 
Chiapas on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have taken on an added significance in the wake of Colosio's death 
and the questions it has raised about the Mexican political system, which is 
dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that has stayed in 
power for six decades through a combination of patronage, co-optation and vote 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were the most extensive of the three reform packages enacted 
during President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration. But they are not 
enough to guarantee the clean elections needed to democratize the country, some 
critics have said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Saturday, some of Mexico's most prominent political 
figures paraded through Salinas' office in the presidential residence in a 
condensed version of the traditional consultations that precede the nomination 
of the ruling party's candidate for president. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those who spoke with Salinas would comment on their conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the PRI has not lost a presidential election in its 65-year history, 
the party's nominee automatically becomes the front-runner, making the 
selection a matter of intense national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to a radio talk show made pitches for their favorite potential 
candidates, while some party activists publicly declared support for PRI 
Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana -- even as party leaders insisted on silence 
about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI leaders issued a statement from Ortiz Arana "disauthorizing any expression 
of support in favor of any person whatsoever until the party . . . sets the 
terms for its internal process." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, the Defense Ministry denied accusations made by the southern 
rebels that the Mexican army has bombed areas in guerrilla-held territory or is 
planning a new attack. The ministry reiterated its support for efforts to find 
a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Government peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis said he has passed that message on 
to the rebels, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas said in a communique Friday that they have broken off their 
consultations with grass-roots supporters on last month's government peace 
proposal because they believe the army plans to attack them. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing problems in Chiapas and disquiet over the selection of the new 
PRI candidate cast a cloud over the traditional Easter week holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators had hoped that the special congressional session called to approve 
electoral reforms would have provided reassurance that the country was moving 
toward a democratic opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate majority leader Carlos Jimenez Macias said the reforms, approved late 
Thursday, had promised to foster "a climate of respect, tolerance, dialogue and 
the adoption of agreements that guarantee the widest civil liberties and solid 
social stability in the Aug. 21 elections." But he added that "the deplorable 
exercise of violence that cut short the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio resurrects 
a grave risk of political backsliding." 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms give citizens not affiliated with political parties the majority 
of votes on the 11-person Federal Electoral Commission, the agency that will 
run the election. 
</P>
<P>
 They also provide for a limited audit of voter registration lists and a 
special prosecutor to enforce stricter penalties for election fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms submitted to the Mexican Congress were reached in negotiations 
among the Interior Ministry and the three major parties: the PRI; National 
Action Party, known as PAN, and Democratic Revolutionary Party, known as the 
PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who many 
Mexicans believe lost the 1988 presidential race because of fraud, said the 
reforms do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support measures that will guarantee clean elections," he said, "but I 
cannot recognize as such measures that pretend to assure clean elections on 
Aug. 21 when they are nothing more than limited changes that do not correct at 
their roots the rigidity and partiality of electoral structures and 
mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas presented a seven-point objection to the reforms, including concerns 
that the interior minister will still be on the electoral commission -- 
limiting its independence from the government.

FIRST BROTHER ROGER IS MARRIED IN TEXAS; NUPTIALS: THE PRESIDENT IS BEST MAN 
AND REASSURES THE NERVOUS BRIDEGROOM AT DALLAS CEREMONY. CHILD IS DUE IN ABOUT 
A MONTH.

 President Clinton's free-spirited brother Roger turned into the traditional 
stammering groom for a few minutes Saturday as he wed Molly Martin, with the 
President looking on approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 20-minute ceremony at the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, Roger 
Clinton struggled for words, and at one point grabbed his brother's hand for 
reassurance. He danced around on his toes in a nervous manner as the ceremony 
proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 His pregnant 25-year-old bride, meanwhile, looked on with unruffled serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 And after presiding Minister John P. Miles of Arkansas finally announced: "And 
now I present you Mr. and Mrs. Roger Clinton," the groom gave a deep sigh and 
broke into a broad smile. When the vows were completed, the couple embraced in 
a long kiss -- followed by a second kiss for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clinton, a 37-year-old rock 'n' roll singer who has faced his share of 
troubles in the past, has always looked to his brother for guidance and 
support. On this occasion, the President played the role of best man, nodding 
approvingly as the minister spoke of the spouses' obligations to comfort and 
support each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The President joined other guests in a light-hearted laugh when the minister 
explained why he was going to insert an unsolicited sermon into the ceremony 
for Roger Clinton. "If he'd come to church more regular," Miles said, "I 
wouldn't have to do one." 
</P>
<P>
 The bride wore a simple white dress with chiffon sleeves, but no veil. Roger 
and Bill Clinton and other male members of the wedding party wore black tie 
tuxedos with white boutonnieres. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting in the front row to the right of the center aisle were First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter, Chelsea. In the front row to the left of 
the aisle was the bride's mother, Emilie Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony took place before a crowd of about 450 guests in a white tent 
behind a stone mansion, the DeGoyler House, on the arboretum grounds. A popular 
wedding spot, the house is bordered by a swathe of tulip beds and overlooks 
White Rock Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has been living together in Redondo Beach, Calif., for about a 
year. They decided to get married about a month before they are to become 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the baby is a boy or a girl, its first or middle name will be Cassidy 
-- which is Roger Clinton's middle name and his mother's maiden name. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, who is the daughter of a Highland Park, Tex., police officer, will 
go by Holly Martin Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clinton told a radio interviewer that the couple had planned to get 
married before they learned that Molly was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby sort of sped things up," said Clinton, who met his wife at an 
Arkansas racetrack two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She works at a Marina del Rey software firm. His principal job is playing in a 
band that warms up studio audiences at TV shows produced by Clinton friends 
Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. He also appears on the lecture 
circuit, where he talks about his family and his past struggles with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony Saturday was traditional, as was the music. The Cindy Hostman 
Jazz Harp Trio played before and after the wedding. A rock band led by Bill 
Tillman, a longtime friend of the groom, played rock music at the reception 
that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clinton said earlier that he drove from Dallas to visit his mother's 
grave in Arkansas last Thursday. Virginia Kelley died of cancer in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just needed to see her before I get married," he told an interviewer, 
adding that he "told her some things I needed to get off my chest."

IN CUBA, LIFE UNDER CASTRO IS DISSOLVING; ECONOMY: EVEN BEING GOVERNMENT 
LOYALISTS ISN'T ENOUGH FOR FAMILY TO HAVE LEVEL OF EXISTENCE THEY SEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ena Santamaria's home is a theater showing the daily life of Cuba, a microcosm 
of a land that combines sadness and joy, promise and disillusion, dreams and 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tiny room, formerly the entry to what had been a three-bedroom house 
in Miramar, which was the neighborhood of Cuba's elite before Fidel Castro 
officially ended social distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ena, a clerk in a store catering to foreigners and Cubans with dollars, is 
lucky to live in lovely, embassy-dotted Miramar, even in overcrowded conditions 
in a house that looks abandoned, so overgrown is its yard, so shabby is the 
exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ena's parents, Marta and Pablo, her two sisters, a brother, two uncles and an 
assortment of cousins and friends occupy the same house. One day this month 
Ena, Marta, Pablo and a guest sat side by side on the single piece of furniture 
in the room, a couch-bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sleep in shifts," Ena said. She shares the couch with a sister at night; a 
brother and his wife use it in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dimness of a fading afternoon sun, no lights came on. Electricity is 
severely rationed, with most neighborhoods receiving no more than eight hours a 
day, two to four hours at a time. During the long summers, the allotment is 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Candles were lighted, and a bottle of rum appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Ena and her family are Castro supporters and argue that much of what is wrong 
in Cuba is the fault of the United States and more than three decades of the 
trade embargo put in place when Castro established a Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 As blacks they said they felt less discrimination than what they read about in 
the United States, and they spoke proudly about one of Ena's brothers who works 
as "an official" in the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 And the family seemed well-educated and well-informed. All said they could 
read and write -- Marta and Pablo attended adult literacy classes in 1962 -- 
and the level of discussion was sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was clear from their lifestyle and what they said they needed -- 
especially food, clothing and transportation -- that being Castro supporters 
wasn't enough to maintain the level of existence they felt they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, all of Cuba seems to be living a life that is dissolving. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the Havana of March, 1994, is a trip of visual despair. Gracious old 
homes and office buildings stand in near-derelict condition with window glass 
missing and shutters hanging as if from incomplete amputations. 
</P>
<P>
 What paint there is droops in strips or clings in patches, the uncovered wood 
and mortar cracked, rotting and covered with oily grime. Only those structures 
reserved for tourists, diplomats and a handful of foreign business people are 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ena's home shows, Cuba suffers from a major housing deficit. Houses once 
inhabited by a single family now are crammed with five families, and often 
more. Three- and four-member families live in 45 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Only diplomats, foreigners and privileged Cubans, especially government and 
Communist Party officials, enjoy space and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 So little gasoline and spare auto parts are available that traffic jams are 
unknown. It is safe to walk down the middle of the most important streets 
without fear of being run down by anything but Chinese-made "Flying Pigeon" 
bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Water from a system that has not been upgraded or repaired since the 
pre-revolutionary days of the 1950s is undrinkable, by government admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Most restaurants used by ordinary Cubans are closed (other restaurants exist 
clandestinely or are open only to tourists). Grocery stores stand empty. 
Theaters function only on weekends, and only when there is electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba is out of almost everything. Meat has long disappeared from the market, 
as has most vegetables and fruits, baked goods, milk, eggs, cooking oil and 
fuel. A pound of potatoes, if it can be found, costs twice what a minimum-wage 
worker earns in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is available is severely rationed. According to a government 
proclamation covering March, each person will get a quarter pound of cooking 
oil, six pounds of rice, 30 ounces of beans, three pounds of sugar and three 
pounds of evaporated milk for the month. The ration for milk and beans, 
however, includes portions not delivered in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Small shares of fresh milk and meat are allotted specially to children and 
expectant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the so-called dollar stores, which serve only foreigners and the 
relatively few Cubans who can acquire dollars, are facing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent Saturday, the baked-goods store serving the wealthy foreign 
residents of Miramar was out of bread. The cheese department also was empty. 
Neither had received any products from the central distributing agency. 
</P>
<P>
 People line up for nearly everything -- to use phones, enter clothing stores, 
buy food at the infrequently open street stands and, most of all, catch a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 In every part of Havana, and all along the roads in the countryside, people 
stand looking expectantly into the distance for a bus. There seems to be no 
schedule. At one intersection on the road south out of Havana, about 75 people 
waited more than an hour for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 When a smoke-belching dinosaur of an East German-made bus did arrive, it was 
so jammed that only about eight people were able to cram aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 People at bus stops and elsewhere were surprised to meet an American, but when 
they did they seemed to have only two questions: "Do you like Cuba?" and "When 
is the blockade (as the embargo is called) going to end?" 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, they talked matter-of-factly about their hard lives, but with more 
resignation than bitterness and often with a risque sense of humor. They 
laughed easily at cautiously humorous remarks about Castro, particularly in 
reference to his lengthy speeches and his legendary sexual potency. A visitor 
is bombarded with offers of a special Cuban pill that "will make you the equal 
of Fidel in the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no evidence of Stalinist-style political repression -- Cubans 
complain about the shortages and inconveniences even to strangers -- people shy 
from discussions that raise questions about Castro's enormous power or that 
move toward the possibility of a major change in the system here. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that freedom of expression exists in any way familiar to 
Americans or Western Europeans. The United Nations and international private 
human rights groups constantly condemn Cuba for abuses. And the media are 
totally controlled by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and foreigners living here say the only truly efficient sector of 
Cuban life is the government's large security apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a small human rights group exists here, and a handful of independent, 
anti-Castro journalists print pamphlets and semi-underground journals even 
though what they do is to little effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have to realize," said a European diplomat, "is that little by 
little, Cuba is changing. It is in transition. Castro and his people know that 
with conditions as bad as they are, they have to create safety valves to keep 
the place from blowing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you even have academics now cautiously discussing the merits of other 
systems, seeking books even from the United States. It isn't a free society, 
and Castro could always crack down," he said. "But right now what the Cubans 
refer to as 'that old stuff' seems to be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety valve theory is used by critical diplomats to explain the economic 
reforms and policies put in place over the last three years that have eased 
some problems, particularly gasoline shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have any more fuel this month than they did last fall," said one 
diplomat. "But they permitted more to be sold, and they put a few more buses on 
the streets when they sensed people were becoming seriously frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also use this (tactic) as a means of control," he said. "They allow some 
relaxation, then they pull back. It's manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sense in Cuba, not even among the few U.S. officials present here, 
that Castro faces serious opposition or is in danger of falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something could spark a problem," one Western diplomat said. "A policeman 
could do something stupid and start a violent reaction, you can't dismiss that. 
But the reality is that Castro is in control and likely will remain so as long 
as he's alive." 
</P>
<P>
 And whether by manipulation or because of remaining revolutionary idealism, 
there are some achievements that allow Castro, 67, and his supporters to claim 
continued popular backing. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cuba was one of the Caribbean's best-educated countries even before 
Castro, with a literacy rate of 86% in the mid-1950s, he talks proudly of 100% 
literacy, of sending every child to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's educational system separates it from nearly every other Caribbean and 
Central American country. Attendance is mandatory, and it is enforced. During 
school hours, children are in classes, not on the streets. There are few of the 
begging preteen urchins that plague Santo Domingo or Caracas or San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Population growth is under control, and infant mortality remains one of the 
lowest in the world, because nearly every Cuban has easy, free access to a 
fully trained doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 And while life may have collapsed for the middle class in Cuba, there is 
little of the abject misery found among large segments of the populations of 
most other Caribbean and Central American nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But foreign experts say there is a shortage of medicine and school supplies, 
not to mention amenities that would result from a functioning, modern 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's crucial sugar crop, which is overwhelmingly Cuba's main economic 
engine, was victimized by poor planning and destructive weather and produced 
only 4.2 million tons by official count. Diplomatic and private sources say it 
fell closer to 3.5 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Even by the official estimate, sugar was 30% below predictions, which were 
some of the lowest in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a successful sugar crop, and with a soft market for its few other 
natural resource products -- even the export of high quality cigars fell 
drastically in 1993 and this year -- Cuba is broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transportation is at 10% of what it was before 1989, when the collapse 
of the Soviet Union and its Communist allies ended billions of dollars in aid 
and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking markets, only about 20% of Cuba's industrial capacity is in use. The 
government debt is 30% of the total economy; average workers earn from $13.50 a 
month to a rare high of $30 a month; the value of exports was under $2 billion 
in 1993, and imports totaled $1.7 billion, half of which was for oil products. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, there is no unemployment, and every citizen is guaranteed an 
income. But there is little work available in factories, many of which are 
closed, and furlough pay and guaranteed wages have been cut dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 What earnings there are have been steadily debased by inflation and the 
introduction of the dollar as a legitimate currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments are endless about what is to blame for Cuba's condition: a 
romantic political and economic system driven by an ideology that has collapsed 
worldwide; the end of a $6-billion-a-year barter and aid relationship with the 
Eastern European Communist world; or the unrelenting antagonism, including the 
three-decades-old economic embargo, of the world's most powerful nation toward 
this country of 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether the cause is one or all of those factors, Cuba is 
unlikely to change much in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia recently spoke of low-key recovery 
for 1994 based on improved sugar harvests, higher nickel exports, increased oil 
availability and growth in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 But international economic experts and diplomats here say Rodriguez's modest 
assessments are in doubt, but even if he is correct it will, as one envoy said, 
"just keep them from falling further." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuba has no money and no real way of getting any," an international official 
here said. "As long as things stay the way they are, the people here will 
survive, but that is about as optimistic as I can be."

PAYROLL TAX FOR HEALTH PLAN A POSSIBILITY; REFORM: ROSTENKOWSKI ADMITS 
INCLUSION OF SUCH A LEVY WOULD BE DIFFICULT. HE EXPECTS $1.25 CIGARETTE TAX 
WILL BE CUT BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, offered more clues Saturday to the direction of health care reform 
legislation, saying a payroll tax might be needed to pay for the reforms while 
a proposed $1.25-per-pack cigarette tax almost surely will be scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski acknowledged that the payroll tax, considered and then abandoned 
by a Ways and Means subcommittee, would be highly controversial and difficult 
to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's going to be a need for (a payroll tax) and if I can get the votes 
for it -- that's the big question -- I could see a payroll tax. But there is a 
lot of apprehension about that," he said in a TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski also said that while he hopes his committee will design a health 
care bill that closely follows President Clinton's recommendations, he will 
insist only on universal coverage and cost containment as essential elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the President will have to rely almost entirely on Democrats in 
the House to get a health care reform bill approved, Rostenkowski said his 
chief aim will be to devise legislation to attract the needed 218 votes in the 
House. His committee is scheduled to begin work on health care reform next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Ways and Means Committee is only one of four panels drafting health 
care legislation, it has jurisdiction over taxes, Medicare and other key 
elements in the health care reform effort. Eventually, all the bills will have 
to be reconciled, but financing clearly will be crucial in determining the 
shape of the final bill put before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Ways and Means chairman, widely recognized as a master at the art 
of crafting legislation, has long been able to achieve a consensus among 
Democrats on his panel through close consultation and compromise -- in return 
for unwavering support for the bill that finally emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks on health care legislation, made during an interview on CNN's 
"Evans & Novak" program, indicated that he will pursue the same strategy this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Within his committee, he said, he will take whatever course will gain the 
support of the Democratic members of the panel. He expressed doubt that 
Republicans would vote for any tax increase for health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's health 
subcommittee, dropped a proposal for a payroll tax from a health care bill when 
it became apparent it would not get enough Democratic support for passage by 
his panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen" if such a plan could be revived in the full committee, 
Rostenkowski said. "It's going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stark-backed bill, forwarded to the Ways and Means Committee on a 6-5 
vote, embraced Clinton's proposal that every employer be required to contribute 
up to 80% of the cost of workers' health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try and retain as much of that as I possibly can," Rostenkowski 
said, but he added that it is uncertain whether even this fundamental part of 
the White House proposal could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has long been clear that the President's proposal has virtually no 
chance of being passed in its entirety, Rostenkowski said that he is going to 
use it as a starting point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good proposal," he said. "Now, you know, what I think is a 
good proposal isn't necessarily going to get enough people in my committee to 
agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan to deliver health care through government-organized purchasing 
cooperatives, called regional alliances, was rejected by Stark's subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski indicated he might support the President's proposal for a 
75-cents-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes over the present levy of 24 cents. 
But he cast some doubt on whether a proposed $1.25-a-pack increase, approved by 
Stark's subcommittee, would survive in the full committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can secure revenues elsewhere . . . I'm trying to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who recently won renomination in a hard-fought primary election, 
said the President should expect substantial congressional changes in his 
original plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bill Clinton, who I admire greatly, is going to (heed) the advice of Danny 
Rostenkowski, he's going to claim victory with whatever comes to the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 The President on Saturday advocated congressional action on his health care 
plan during his weekly radio address, which was delivered from a children's 
hospital in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can do better simply by building on what works in the current 
system: using the workplace to guarantee private insurance for every American," 
Clinton said. "It is the foundation of our plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Stark bill, Clinton said: "In spite of all the special 
interests and TV ads, the committee made an important statement. After 60 years 
of gridlock, the American people are being heard. They want us to take care of 
their important business, like health care reform, and now we're beginning to 
do that."

FLORIDA AIR BASE TORN BY 1992 STORM REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flag is flying again over Homestead Air Force Base, which reopened 
Saturday for the first time since Hurricane Andrew nearly wiped it out in 1992. 
Only now it will be an air reserve base. 
</P>
<P>
 The 482nd Fighter Wing's F-16 jets returned in formation for the first time 
since they were evacuated before the storm tore apart the base's buildings and 
aircraft on Aug. 24, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. flag flaps atop a new 80-foot pole donated by local business groups 
so motorists whizzing past on the turnpike could see life at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted people to know this base is open," said Maj. Bobby D'Angelo, 
spokesman for the Air Force Reserve wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its days as an active duty base are over, the base will officially be 
renamed Homestead Air Reserve Base this week. The former host unit, the 31st 
Fighter Wing, will relinquish command to the 482nd Fighter Wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve unit will occupy just a third of the old base's acreage. The rest 
will be turned over to Dade County, which has plans for aviation and other 
business uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, the damage inflicted by the powerful hurricane is evident. Many 
buildings have been restored or torn down, while others have gaping holes, and 
all 1,600 housing units stand empty, awaiting demolition.

CONSTRUCTION WORK LINKED TO N.J. PIPELINE EXPLOSION

 Construction work done long ago may have caused a rupture in a natural gas 
pipeline and led to an explosion that ignited into a fireball and leveled eight 
apartment buildings, federal investigators said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said they believe an asphalt plant now at the site of Thursday's 
blast was built after the steel pipeline was installed. They said work with 
heavy equipment such as backhoes could have gouged the line.

FORCED STUDENT TRANSFER PLAN ROILS DISTRICT; EDUCATION: PROPOSAL TO SEND 100 
BREA OLINDA CHILDREN TO A LESS-CROWDED BUT HALF-LATINO SCHOOL UPSETS SOME 
PARENTS IN MAINLY WHITE DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan that could force some students of predominantly white elementary 
schools to transfer to a school where half the students are Latino is being 
considered by the Brea Olinda Unified School District in a controversial effort 
to ease campus overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, about 100 students from Arovista, Fanning and Mariposa 
elementary schools could be transferred, most going to Laurel Elementary 
School, where some parents are refusing to place their children because of its 
ethnic makeup, district administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a small number of the district's 5,458 students would be 
directly affected by the plan, administrators say the controversy exemplifies 
the heated debate that often arises when districts begin changing attendance 
boundaries to balance school enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The honest people have said, 'Quite frankly, I don't want my kids exposed to 
the Hispanic element" at Laurel,' Assistant Supt. Gary D. Goff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district "could never accomplish balancing the school ethnically," Goff 
said. But the Board of Education would like to make the district's nine schools 
reflect its ethnic breakdown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the district's schoolchildren, 68% are white, 18% are Latino, 8% are 
Asian and 2% are black, according to officials. At Laurel, more than 160 of the 
322 students are Latino, Goff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way as far as (appreciating cultural diversity) over the 
years, and yet in Brea Olinda, we haven't come very far," Supt. Edgar Z. Seal 
said. "We want to build a diverse community at all our schools, but parents 
don't want to take their children to Laurel, where the (Latino student 
population) has become the majority, because they feel that it's a Mexican 
school, and that is unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a Board of Education meeting last week, more than a dozen parents whose 
children could be sent to Laurel said their concerns center around the safety 
and education of their children, not on racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with who my kid goes to school with," parent Chris 
Joslan said. "I don't think it's a racist issue. I think it's a safety issue. 
In my eyes, it's all about safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Joslan and other parents said they believe students who walk to and from 
Laurel could be in danger if they have to cross major streets. Some parents 
said the school does not provide the same "educational opportunities" that the 
rest of the district's schools offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials point out that no student has been hit by a car while 
walking to or from Laurel. And Seal said the district has spent more money on 
educational programs at Laurel in the past few years than at any other 
elementary school in the district. Class sizes are smaller as well, he said. 
The classes at Laurel average 29 students, while the more crowded schools 
average 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Villarreal, whose two daughters attend Laurel, said criticism of the 
school is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girls are receiving the same education at Laurel that the kids in other 
Brea Olinda schools do," she said. "I don't feel they are academically deprived 
at all. The class sizes are small, the teachers are excellent and my kids are 
not just a file there. They are known as individuals by the whole staff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Margie McMillan, who served as Laurel's Parent Teacher Assn. president last 
year and whose two children graduated from Laurel, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics "can call (their concerns) whatever they want, but I'm calling it 
racism and bigotry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Principal Tim Harvey, who also is principal of Olinda Elementary School 
and served as Fanning's principal for 10 years until last June, said Laurel is 
not lacking academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very comfortable with Laurel, safety- and academic-wise," he said. 
"There's no difference in standards or programs here than at other district 
schools. We don't have anything less than any of the other schools. But I 
understand parents' concerns about change and I invite them to call me and 
visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda school board members considered changing attendance boundaries 
five years ago but decided against the move after parents complained, Goff 
said. Now, it has been eight years since the district last changed the 
boundaries. The new shift is necessary because of current and future 
residential development that has and is expected to overcrowd Mariposa and 
Arovista schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would like to solve overcrowding problems by changing boundary 
lines so each of its six elementary schools ends up with between 450 and 650 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan recommended by the School Boundaries/Future Growth Committee, 
about 60 students from Mariposa Elementary would be transferred to Fanning, and 
Fanning would transfer about 30 students to Laurel. In addition, about 20 
Arovista students would go to Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say forcing the children to attend another school under the proposed 
boundary changes will be "disruptive and traumatic." But proponents of the 
boundary changes say many parents have taken their children out of Laurel 
because Latino students have become the majority there. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Prebeg, an opponent with three children at Fanning, said she is 
outraged and offended by people who call such parents racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no prejudice in my body. My children have friendships (at Fanning). . 
. . I do not want to uproot my children from their familiar school," Prebeg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boundary changes are very emotional," school board member Lynn Doucher said. 
"Kids get attached to schools, and nobody wants to disrupt a child's life. . . 
. But we have to have breathing room at each school, and that's where the 
problem comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we look into the future and take care of the (overcrowding) problems now?" 
she added. "There are lots of modifications we could consider, but no one on 
the school board has made up their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 A board vote on the boundary change proposal is expected sometime after a 
public hearing April 18.

TODDLER'S DEATH LEAVES NEIGHBORHOOD IN SHOCK; FATALITY: EIGHT DAYS AFTER 
SUFFERING A SKULL FRACTURE, 22-MONTH-OLD BOY RETURNS TO HOSPITAL AND DIES. 
DOTING MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND, WHO BABY-SAT THE CHILD, IS ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Karey Jaeger didn't take her son, Tyler, to day care Friday because she 
worried that other children might play too rough while he was recovering from a 
serious head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the single mother left the 22-month-old boy in the care of her 
boyfriend at her Newport Beach home, and went to her job as a special-education 
teacher, neighbors said. That was the last time Jaeger saw Tyler alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Jaeger's boyfriend after the toddler was pronounced dead 
Friday at Hoag Hospital, just eight days after the boy was admitted to the same 
hospital with a fractured skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, a 32-year-old house painter who lived with Jaeger, was 
arrested on suspicion of corporal punishment or injury to a child, and released 
Saturday after posting $10,000 bail, police said. A police spokesman said 
Friday that more serious charges may be filed after an autopsy report. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could this happen to a perfect mother?" asked Jaeger's next-door neighbor 
and friend, Carole Delbrook. "She lived her whole life for Tyler. Everything 
she did, she did for him. We're just devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Laudenback, Brian's father, said his son was arrested because he had 
spanked Tyler on Thursday, the day before the boy died. Tyler's death, he 
surmised, likely was due to complications from the previous head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County coroner's office conducted an autopsy early Saturday, but 
the cause of Tyler's death was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian's the baby-sitter for everyone," said the elder Laudenback, a dentist. 
"He loved the boy and the lady, and she loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, Jaeger's small, white house stood empty, just a few 
blocks from the beach. The front yard was bare of Tyler's toys; Delbrook's 
husband had stored them in a garage for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, Delbrook talked about Friday's events as her own 14-month-old 
daughter, Camille, happily splashed water in a blue inflatable pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback had gone to Jaeger's house and put Tyler down for a nap Friday 
morning, she said. Jaeger had left for work in the San Gabriel Valley city of 
Glendora, where she teaches youths with disabilities. Later, Laudenback walked 
next door and asked to borrow the Delbrooks' car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Tyler's acting kind of funny, I've got to take him to the doctor.' 
" She offered to drive. When Delbrook saw the toddler's yellow, jaundiced skin, 
she said she knew something was wrong. She sped through traffic to get Tyler 
and Laudenback to the hospital, but physicians could not revive the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, on March 18, Tyler had to be taken to the hospital for a large bump 
on his head that turned out to be a fractured skull. He got the injury while 
Jaeger was at work and Laudenback was baby-sitting, neighbors said. They said 
Laudenback reported that Tyler had slipped off a plastic table, hitting his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the injuries were consistent with such a fall, so the hospital 
released the boy to his mother March 20.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyler had bruises on his face from that fall, Carole Delbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that on Friday he had additional bruises on his backside. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors described Laudenback, a former bartender at Newport Beach and Balboa 
nightspots, as someone who seemed to like children and was liked by children in 
return. It is a tightknit neighborhood, they said, with many young families who 
often look after each other's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger had made several friends in the area since moving there in November, 
and they described her as a dedicated mother. She began dating Laudenback in 
late December, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcie Madsen, a neighbor, said Tyler could often be heard crying and was 
sometimes fussy, but she never heard the couple argue or yell at the boy. 
Often, Jaeger would play catch with Tyler outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw her without him," Madsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Delbrook, Carole's husband, remembered Tyler fondly. "When I came home 
every day, he would stand at the front gate and say 'Hi John. Hi John. Bye 
John. Bye John,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter and Tyler used to play together, and Jaeger often joined her 
neighbors to take the children to zoos and parks. On Saturday, Carole Delbrook 
held a photograph, in which Tyler wore red high-top shoes and laughed as his 
light-brown hair poked out from under a Mickey Mouse baseball cap turned 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler likely will be buried at sea, Carole Delbrook said sadly, citing a talk 
she had with Jaeger earlier in the morning. "He just loved the ocean."

A BREAK IN THE MAYHEM; FREEWAY FENCE HELPS END PEDESTRIAN DEATHS NEAR 
CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The warnings first appear just south of the checkpoint here and continue 
almost as far north as the San Onofre nuclear power plant. Well known by now, 
they depict the silhouette of a man, woman and child dashing east to west 
across a yellow background. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawing symbolizes the real people who make the grim run for their lives 
across Interstate 5 as they try to elude the U.S. Border Patrol.  
</P>
<P>
 Until last August, when a seven-mile-long, eight-foot-high fence was erected 
in the median strip from Las Pulgas Road in Camp Pendleton to the edge of the 
checkpoint, the warnings went largely unheeded -- both by fleeing illegal 
immigrants and streams of speeding motorists, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the U.S. Border Patrol and the California Highway Patrol say the 
$458,000 fence has begun to have an impact. No pedestrian fatalities or 
injuries have occurred along an 18-mile stretch, which encompasses Camp 
Pendleton property just north of Oceanside to the checkpoint -- located three 
miles south of San Clemente -- since March 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence, however, is hardly viewed as a panacea. More than a year of good 
luck has also been a factor, said Karl Hansen, spokesman for the CHP, which 
documents pedestrian fatalities near the checkpoint. Hansen and others also 
attribute the fluctuating number of deaths to a series of random factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP and the Border Patrol "tend to celebrate anything that's had a 
positive impact," he said, "which the fence certainly has. But it's not the 
foolproof answer. Next week, we could have five or six people hit. We hope and 
pray it continues to work. But the problem remains." 
</P>
<P>
 "What was so different in 1991 when we only had two fatalities, as compared to 
1990, when we had 15 -- our worst year ever?" Hansen asked. "Luck does have a 
certain amount to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hansen and others credit an aggressive public relations 
campaign carried out by the CHP's Mexican liaison office for having spread the 
word about the dangers of Southland freeways to the migrant labor camps of San 
Diego and Orange counties and the rural communities of northern Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics bear out the random nature of the problem -- four fatalities in 
1993, before the fence was completed in August; seven in 1992; two in 1991; 15 
in 1990; 14 in 1989; six in 1988, and five in 1987, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to control the problem, the CHP in 1992 received a federal grant 
to station three more officers along the 18-mile stretch, but in that year 
alone, seven illegal immigrants were struck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, the funding was cut. And before the fence could be 
completed last August, four fatalities had occurred, along with one serious 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrian fatalities near the checkpoint have long had an impact on hospitals 
in south Orange County, which ended up with scores of trauma cases the severity 
of which doctors rarely see. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Shaver, director of trauma services at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo -- where many of the victims were treated -- 
has been an outspoken critic of the federal government for, in his words, 
helping to create the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver favors an El Paso-like blockade at the San Ysidro port of entry, under 
which all available agents would be deployed at the international border. Under 
that plan, any would-be immigrants who somehow make it across would be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a blockade could spell the end of the San Clemente checkpoint, which 
Shaver sees as playing a fatal role in most of the incidents involving 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole point is, why create a dangerous obstacle 66 miles" from the border? 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver noted that the average cost of treating one patient admitted to a 
trauma center is $22,000. Should a severe head injury result, he said, the 
average cost per person jumps to $250,000. Long-term rehabilitation sends the 
cost even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the patients are uninsured, the cost is borne entirely by 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-year-old Mexican boy died in 1990 in a scene that bears an uncanny 
resemblance to that depicted on the signs: Clutching his mother's coat, he was 
struck by a car while trying to cross the freeway in the southbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get these patients, they are so violently injured because of the 
impact that, you work hard, but the outcome . . . is never satisfactory," he 
said. "It will never make them physically or mentally whole, nor will they ever 
be gainfully employed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaver praised the fence for creating at least a stopgap deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a fence can help stop that," he added, "it has to be viewed as a step in 
the right direction. If it's helped to stop the loss of life, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of authorities, the fence appears to have halted, however 
temporarily, what extra personnel and flashing warning signs could not. The 
wire barrier is applauded by state and federal officials, who have no intention 
of closing the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the fence as having a dramatic impact," said G.C. Geer, the agent in 
charge of the San Clemente Border Patrol Station. "But other factors have 
helped too. Warning signs went in (1991), and Caltrans started stripping away 
vegetation in the median" in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the same year the CHP launched a speed-reduction campaign that the 
agency believes has also helped cut down on fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no measure has eliminated illegal immigration near the checkpoint. Geer 
said that more than 50,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended there in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has appropriated $30 million for the first phase of a new 
16-lane freeway checkpoint proposed for the Horno Canyon area, next to the Camp 
Pendleton Marine Corps Base. The checkpoint would have 16 electronic gates for 
traffic flow, added truck scales and booths for Border Patrol agents, who now 
stand unprotected on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new checkpoint is not expected to open for at least another decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, statistics support the notion that the fence is having a 
continued impact. So far this year, not a single fatality or injury has been 
reported anywhere between Las Pulgas Road and the Orange County border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued from the very start that if you could keep (pedestrians) out of the 
southbound lanes, which is where the problem is, you could cut down drastically 
on the problem," Geer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the northbound lanes are more accustomed to seeing the signs and 
slowing down, and of course, the checkpoint operates only in the northbound 
lanes," Geer said. "Drivers in the southbound lanes know they don't have to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The average speed of drivers in both directions in the area near the 
checkpoint is more than 70 m.p.h. at most times of the day or night, CHP 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geer estimates that 90% of those trying to head north -- illegal immigrants, 
drug smugglers or anyone else attempting to traverse the dark stretches of 
Interstate 5 -- are now staying east of the freeway, reducing even the 
potential for harm.

METROLINK COMING FOR COMMUTERS WITH 3 TRAINS; TRANSIT: THE REGIONAL LINK TO 
L.A. EXPANDS SOUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH SERVICE THAT STARTS MONDAY. RIDES 
ARE FREE THROUGH THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Taking the train in Orange County is about to get a whole lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, not one, not two, but three Metrolink commuter trains will 
start serving the county as the regional Metrolink system expands south of Los 
Angeles for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service -- free through Thursday -- replaces the single commuter train 
that currently plies the route from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles once 
each morning and returns to Orange County once in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the single commuter train between Orange County and Los Angeles 
already has Metrolink markings, these were its only connection to the regional 
commuter rail network. It was not considered part of Metrolink because it was 
operated by Amtrak crews under a contract with the Orange County Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 16,000 boardings per month on the existing commuter train, 
which last year began using periwinkle-and-white Metrolink equipment. Most 
passengers have been white-collar workers commuting from South County to jobs 
in Fullerton or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Metrolink, some rail passengers will be paying slightly higher fares, 
others less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a monthly pass for trips between Fullerton and Los Angeles will 
increase by $18 to $144. But a monthly pass for travel between San Juan 
Capistrano and Los Angeles will drop $38, to $208. 
</P>
<P>
 The big change for Orange County: an expanded, more convenient train schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Amtrak runs nine trains of its own daily in each direction, it is 
considered a cross-country railroad not geared to providing commuter-style 
service. Amtrak tickets cost about 50% more, and Amtrak trains don't serve as 
many stations along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'll be able to use the (cheaper commuter) train at least some of the 
time," said Nicole Branca, a lawyer from Irvine. "Before, (the evening commuter 
train) left L.A. too early for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Branca is still not completely satisfied. She and others who work in Los 
Angeles would like Metrolink to run trains later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Amtrak trains leave as late as 9 p.m., commuters don't want to pay 
a premium to leave later. Besides, the Amtrak evening trains skip Orange and, 
depending on the hour, Irvine, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several rail passengers said, three commuter trains in each direction 
are better than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Each weekday, Metrolink trains will start for Los Angeles from Oceanside and 
wind their way northward with stops in San Juan Capistrano, Irvine, Santa Ana, 
Orange, Anaheim, Fullerton, City of Commerce and Union Station in downtown Los 
Angeles. Return trips will stop at the same stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters at the San Juan Capistrano rail depot can choose from Metrolink 
train departures at 5:22 a.m., 6:04 a.m., and 7:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrivals in Los Angeles will be at 6:45 a.m., 7:24 a.m. and 8:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Return trips will depart Los Angeles at 4:30 p.m., 5:37 p.m. and 6:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next three years, stations and stops will be added in San Clemente, 
Mission Viejo / Laguna Niguel, Buena Park and Tustin. The new Metrolink route 
is the longest in the regional system, extending 87.3 miles between Oceanside 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is based on the honor system, but fines of $250 can be levied for 
failure to display a ticket when asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices will depend on how many fare zones a traveler passes through, 
and whether he or she buys a 10-trip booklet or a monthly pass. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a trip from Fullerton to Los Angeles would cross three zones at a 
maximum cost of $10 per round trip, or $144 with a monthly pass -- a savings of 
$56 assuming 20 round trips. 
</P>
<P>
 A journey from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles would involve crossing five 
zones at a cost of $14 per round trip. At $208 with a monthly pass, the savings 
is $72, assuming 20 round trips. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a round trip from Long Beach to Los Angeles on the Metro Rail 
Blue Line -- a distance of 22 miles -- costs $2.20, or $42 per monthly pass, a 
savings of $2. But Blue Line cars are smaller and less comfortable than 
full-size commuter rail cars. Also, Blue Line trains serve more stations and 
run on surface streets along most of the route, with stops for traffic lights 
at intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Before OCTA started providing commuter rail service to Los Angeles in 1990, 
Amtrak trains served the same route but did not stop at every station along the 
way. The same is still true and Amtrak will continue to offer nine trains per 
day in each direction, although Amtrak tickets cost about 50% more. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Amtrak's round-trip fare between Los Angeles and Irvine is $19, 
versus $12 on Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake crumpled several freeways, Metrolink 
drew national attention for providing a much-needed alternative. Although the 
surge in Metrolink ridership has declined sharply since the temblor, it is 
still far above pre-quake levels. In Orange County, post-quake ridership was 
above year-ago levels, but down from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail critics contend, however, that passenger service will never justify the 
huge subsidies now used to cover the cost of providing the service -- more than 
$30 per trip on Metrolink, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, transportation planners are hoping that rail service will make a dent 
in traffic congestion. Their argument: A freeway's saturation point can be 
avoided if only 3% to 4% of motorists stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the marketing problem is immense in Southern California's car culture. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why Metrolink service in Orange County is being offered free for 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no better way . . . than by offering free rides," said Anaheim 
Councilman Irv Pickler, who serves as both an OCTA board member and vice 
chairman of Metrolink. "While some people will only show up for the free ride, 
many others will see how convenient and reliable the trains are and become 
regular riders." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a certain amount of hoopla planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, besides a press conference in Los Angeles, receptions are planned at 
each train station to celebrate the arrival of the last of the three morning 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, stations will have roving Metrolink "ambassadors" to assist newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA shuttle buses link local train depots to major employment centers, and 
the shuttle service will be free for Metrolink passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the free ride is over -- beginning Friday -- passengers will buy train 
tickets from automated vending machines at each station. The machines accept 
cash, credit cards and bank automated teller machine cards. They dispense 
tickets for one-way and round-trip rides, as well as monthly passes and 10-trip 
coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new pricing, seniors 65 and over, as well as passengers with 
disabilities, can ride for half price.  
</P>
<P>
 What's next? By 1996, officials hope to provide at least two Metrolink trains 
in each direction between Riverside and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, transportation planners are considering a proposed 28-mile, 
intra-county, urban rail route between Fullerton and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Link to Los Angeles The Orange County Transportation Authority offers 
connecting bus service from all Orange County train stations to major 
employment areas. The shuttle service is free to those who transfer to or from 
a Metrolink train. This service is not free, however, to passengers of the nine 
Amtrak trains that now run through Orange County each weekday. A Threesome of 
Trains Serving O.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The three commuter trains that start serving Orange County Monday will create 
the fifth and longest Metrolink corridor, with service extending 87.3 miles 
between Oceanside and Los Angeles. Fare System 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers purchase their tickets or passes at the station's ticket vending 
machine or at the Los Angeles Union Station ticket office before boarding. The 
honor system will be used, but if commuters fail to produce a ticket when 
asked, they can be fined up to $250. 05,16,09,12,16,14 Zones traveled One-way

VERDICT ON REPAIRS WORRIES MERCHANTS; SAN FERNANDO: COURTHOUSE WORK WILL TAKE 
14 MONTHS, AND SHOP OWNERS FEAR LOSS OF BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The verdict is in on the San Fernando courthouse, and for many of the 
merchants near the building on Maclay Avenue, it feels like the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-year-old structure, which was red-tagged after the Northridge temblor, 
will remain closed for another 14 months for a $15-million rebuilding program, 
Los Angeles County officials announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the area's small businesses, which have come to depend on 
courthouse clientele for survival, 14 months might be too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the day it closed, the whole town just died," said Nick Yohanna, owner 
of Maclay Cleaners for the past 18 years. "I never knew it affected things this 
much. Every day is Sunday now." 
</P>
<P>
 Yohanna said he lost about 40 customers after the courthouse was shuttered, 
mostly lawyers, county sheriff's deputies and marshals whom he knew by name.  
</P>
<P>
 Kira's Russian restaurant on Maclay and Third Street used to be packed with 
attorneys and court clerks during the daytime. While the quaint, family-run 
operation still does good business during the lunch hour, it is empty most of 
the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too much for us," said owner Garnik Mehrabian, who works in the 
restaurant along with his wife, daughter, son, sister and brother-in-law. "We 
lost business during the recession, and the courthouse was the largest part of 
our business left before the earthquake. There is no profit anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehrabian said he didn't feel the loss of courthouse customers for the first 
few weeks because the restaurant attracted a steady stream of FEMA workers. Now 
that most of them have moved on, he said he will need help from the government 
for Kira's to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the courthouse has already hurt the tiny city's economy, said San 
Fernando Mayor Dan Acuna. Several businesses affected by the closure have 
already sought his help, and he is worried about the future.  
</P>
<P>
 "The courthouse means a lot to this city," said Acuna, who was originally told 
the building would take six months to repair. "The longer the courthouse is not 
in operation, the more damage that will cause to our economy. I'm real 
disappointed that they're talking about 14 months." 
</P>
<P>
 A structural evaluation by a private engineering firm found that 16 support 
columns and numerous concrete walls, stairwells and pipes were damaged during 
the Jan. 17 earthquake, said Jim Abbott, general manager of construction and 
real estate for the county Internal Services Department, which is in charge of 
repairing county buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the building systems are damaged to one extent or another," he said. "I 
thought it was going to take $30 million." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to repairs, the existing tile roof will be replaced, standard 
seismic and fire safety upgrades will be installed, and the energy systems will 
be improved, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more detailed analysis of the courthouse, which will take 14 to 15 weeks to 
complete, was begun Wednesday. The architectural firm that will conduct repairs 
has not yet been chosen, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, judges and clerks are mostly scattered between the San Fernando 
Municipal Court building and Van Nuys Superior Court, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys are sharing space with their with Van Nuys counterparts, and some 
clerks are working out of the old San Fernando police station.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the chaos, most San Fernando court cases are being tried on 
schedule and none have been dismissed or transferred, said Judge Judith M. 
Ashmann, who supervises the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a diaspora," said Ashmann. "But the judges I work with in San 
Fernando have just a wonderful attitude about it. To be a judge, all I need is 
my robe."

ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER -- AGAIN; NEWHALL: SUPERVISOR SEEKS HELP FOR 
ESTABLISHMENTS THAT SURVIVED THE QUAKE ONLY TO FACE FAILURE DUE TO A DETOUR'S 
IMPACT. 
</P>

<P>
 There are a handful of Newhall business owners who thought they had escaped 
the worst, only to discover it waiting for them around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Their establishments survived the Northridge earthquake, but they are finding 
themselves unable to endure its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners can no longer board their dogs at Calgrove Kennels, and only half 
as many customers walk through the doors of Carrows Restaurant and the Oak Tree 
Gun Club since the Jan. 17 quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when The Old Road was transformed into a bypass to keep the 
Golden State Freeway open, making it nearly impossible to reach the businesses 
that sit off the road or off nearby Calgrove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a case in which creating road access for the masses has come at the cost 
of annihilating access for a few businesses, who can't even get emergency aid 
since they are not considered to be direct victims of the quake. In an effort 
to help the proprietors, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
presented a motion before the Board of Supervisors this week seeking emergency 
state or federal legislation to compensate them before they go broke. The board 
is expected to vote on the motion Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a unique problem to this particular earthquake," said Jo Anne Darcy, 
senior field deputy for Antonovich. "These businesses have been put into near 
bankruptcy because of a necessary change by CalTrans to benefit a greater need 
for mobility to and from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a remedy that for some has been a tough pill to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Lovingood stared out her kitchen window at the source of her 
discontent: the cars that whiz by her home and the dog kennel she operated with 
her husband, Mike. The rerouting put a freeway in front of their property, 
making it more than difficult for the Lovingoods to get in or out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was an act of God, but this was not. . . . It's man made," 
Lovingood said as she watched the endless stream of cars and trucks zoom by on 
what used to be a country back road. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeding traffic has polluted the air with noise and fumes that would have 
scared visiting dogs and threatened their health the same way it is effecting 
the Lovingood's own pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs are all stressed out and you can smell and taste the exhaust fumes," 
Mike Lovingood said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the kennel, customers would have had to employ the same stunt-driver 
tactics that the Lovingoods now risk when they pull into and out of racing 
traffic to enter and exit their narrow driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 They are risks that the local mail carrier and the couple's dog-food and 
propane suppliers consider too great to take. They are no longer willing to 
make deliveries to the kennel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm losing everything I've worked for," Lovingood said. "I'm really angry 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lovingoods said the latest word they received from CalTrans is that the 
The Old Road detour will remain in place until at least June 8, when freeway 
construction near their home is scheduled to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the couple has been living off their savings, and they are 
estimating it may take them as long as a year and half to get back on their 
feet even if they are compensated for their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Mike Lovingood said, "The question now is: Is it worth staying here?"  
</P>
<P>
 Just south of the kennel, business at the shooting range that Judy Schuelke 
manages has dropped 50% after access and traffic problems on The Old Road 
forced the owners of the Oak Tree Gun Club to close during the evenings, which 
slashed operating hours in half and prompted the layoff of four part-time 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say that CalTrans did a great job of putting the detour in," 
Schuelke said. "It's just not helping us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to spot the entrance to the driveway that leads to the range has proved 
to be a tough task for first-time customers in freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be quick and it's dangerous," Schuelke said. "If customers 
don't know where we are -- then goodby, the business is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuelke said that CalTrans officials have also sought aid to compensate the 
owners of the shooting range for their losses, but so far they have been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not wiped out yet," Schuelke said. "But we will never recover without 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 To the north of the shooting range, workers at the Carrows Restaurant, which 
is located off the now closed Calgrove Boulevard exit of the Golden State 
Freeway, face a similar scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 A bad situation has become worse at Carrows, where nearly 30 workers have been 
laid off since the Calgrove exit was shut down as a result of the detour. 
Patrons must now drive a few extra miles to reach the restaurant by taking the 
Lyons Avenue exit off the freeway and then heading south on Wiley Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting lines to get a table at the restaurant during the lunch rush vanished 
after the quake, and in the evenings workers watch as long lines of cars and 
trucks sit stranded on the nearby freeway, unable to exit for a bite to eat 
while they wait out the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so convenient for people to come in here and eat and then go to work, 
but now who wants to come all the way in and then drive all the way out back 
onto a packed freeway?" asked Mario Asencio, the restaurant's general manager. 
"I wish they'd find a way to work this out."

POLITICS '94 / GEBE MARTINEZ: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S 
POLITICAL LIFE ; HUFFINGTON SEEKS VOTES OF FISCAL CONSERVATIVES WITHIN THE 
PEROT CAMP 
</P>

 Removing labels: Conservative Republicans aren't in love with Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who is heading into the Republican primary for 
the U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Huffington, 
however, is trying to win the backing of Orange County's fiscal conservatives 
-- those who supported Ross Perot's 1992 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington recently met in Costa Mesa with Roland A. Boucher, one of the local 
coordinators for Perot's United We Stand America, hoping to line up support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people in United We Stand are either former Republicans or conservative 
Democrats, and that's the group I am reaching out to," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher said the former Perot supporters are in demand because they made up 
almost one-fourth of all the votes cast in Orange County in the last 
presidential election. One Republican candidate in the June 7 primary for the 
Senate seat, Riverside County businesswoman Kate Squires, also has approached 
the group. But the third GOP candidate, former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of 
Fullerton, hasn't called in yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher said that while the group won't be endorsing candidates this year, 
they are making plans to set up a forum for statewide candidates.

 Aire Caliente: The exporting business can be pretty tricky and complicated, 
especially when it comes to the esoterica of utility companies. Now, with the 
dawning of NAFTA, where can a state assemblyman get a crash course on how to 
help California companies export cogeneration and wind-powered equipment for 
utilities? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, in Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just where Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and other members 
of the Assembly and state Senate utility committees traveled last year for two 
weeks, courtesy of a San Francisco nonprofit group called California Foundation 
on the Environment and the Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy recently reported the $7,447.13 trip on the annual economic disclosure 
form required of all legislators. It was the biggest gift reported by local 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip featured meetings with cabinet ministers and other politicos from 
those countries to discuss a variety of issues dealing with utilities. Pete 
Conaty, Conroy's chief of staff, said the assemblymen also explored the 
potential of sharing cross-border utility services under NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He enjoyed the trip," Conaty said, adding that "it was mainly business. They 
kept a very busy schedule." 
</P>

<P>
 Wishful thinking?: Republicans may rule in Orange County, but the Democratic 
Party has trotted out a poll that attempts to scuttle GOP dreams of domination. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, commissioned by the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, suggests 
that residents of Democrat-rich central Orange County have an overall favorable 
opinion of President Clinton (50% favorable versus 42% unfavorable) as well as 
Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls Kathleen Brown (42% to 13%) and John 
Garamendi (50% to 14%). The same poll found that county residents look 
unfavorably at Gov. Pete Wilson (42% to 47%). 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 70% hadn't heard of state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), and of those 
who did, only 10% thought he was doing a good or excellent job compared to the 
21% who rated his performance as fair or poor. Assemblyman Curt Pringle also 
got crummy marks -- only 19% felt he was doing a good or excellent job, while 
33% ranked him as fair or poor. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the results, Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes noted 
that polls can be skewed by how one asks the questions. He also suggested that 
the only important number is voter registration, where Republicans hold a 
200,000-voter countywide edge over Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always hear the puff from local Democrats about how well they are going to 
do," Fuentes said. "Then, the day after the election they're running for cover 
with their tails between their legs."

 Being neighborly: In an unusual move, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. 
Antonovich is reaching across the county line to help Huntington Beach 
Councilman Jim Silva in his campaign for the Orange County supervisorial seat 
now held by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich recently mailed out a letter stating Silva is the best candidate to 
help reverse the "anti-business trend of government." UPCOMING EVENTS

VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS CHRISTEN CULTURAL MEETING HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanking God for the good weather, an auxiliary bishop blessed the new meeting 
hall of the Vietnamese Cultural and Social Center here Saturday in front of an 
outdoor gathering of several thousand Vietnamese Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain had stopped because "God must be Vietnamese," the Most Rev. Michael 
Driscoll said, to loud applause from the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the dream that eventually there would be a home and place for the 
Vietnamese community to gather to keep their culture and make it part of 
American culture," Driscoll told the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diocese of Orange is hoping the renovated cultural center will become a 
focal point for the county's 30,000 Vietnamese Catholics, said Msgr. Nguyen 
Tien, the director of the Vietnamese Catholic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new center will be a great help to build our ministry and to continue the 
training of the leaders for different activities among Vietnamese Catholics," 
Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese Catholic organizations, such as a Vietnamese chapter of the Legion 
of Mary, and the Eucharistic Vietnamese Youth Movement, have been meeting at 
the center in the 1500 block of North Century Boulevard for about seven years. 
But now the drab-green buildings are being torn down and replaced with more 
spacious beige buildings that resemble a Vietnamese temple. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only the project's first phase is complete: the meeting hall, intended 
to hold 800 people. The second phase of the project, whose overall cost is 
expected to total $5.2 million, will involve completion of an administrative 
wing, which will include living quarters for several of the diocese's 13 
Vietnamese priests. The third building will be a chapel to hold 200 people, 
along with a shrine to the 117 Vietnamese Catholic saints who were martyred for 
their faith under Vietnam's rulers in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's new landscaping, which will include plants and flowers from 
Vietnam, is not yet complete, so families decked out in their Sunday best who 
came Saturday to see the building's inauguration had to walk gingerly over 
carpets hastily laid down over thick, slippery mud. 
</P>
<P>
 During the morning ceremony, church dignitaries honored local Vietnamese 
Catholics who donated money to help build the new center and chapel.  
</P>
<P>
 A Mass and another inauguration ceremony were held in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 An architect, Don Tran, helped design the center's three buildings and grounds 
to make them look like Vietnamese structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intended to do that because we would like to retain the culture of our 
society," Tran said. "And the children, when they're growing up, they won't 
forget their roots."

SICK AS A DOG FROM VALLEY FEVER; HEALTH: AT LEAST 22 PETS IN EASTERN PART OF 
VENTURA COUNTY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SINCE QUAKE. THERE'S NO MEDICARE FOR CANINES, 
OWNERS LAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 A month ago, Wolfie started acting strange. The 3-year-old dog developed a 
persistent, hacking cough and stopped eating. When her Simi Valley family took 
her to a nearby clinic, a veterinarian determined that the petite brown-haired 
shepherd mix had valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak of valley fever in the eastern part of Ventura County hasn't been 
restricted to the human population. At least 22 dogs have been infected by the 
respiratory illness since January and vets across the county are keeping a wary 
eye out for additional cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of this point, there were 16 lab-confirmed cases in dogs in the Simi 
Valley area and six in the Thousand Oaks area, and these numbers can always 
change," said Dr. Richard Spiegel, a veterinarian for the Atlanta-based Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel recently spent two weeks in Ventura County studying cases of valley 
fever in dogs and humans to determine what has caused the surge in infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, at least 170 people have contracted 
the illness. A Simi Valley man died from valley fever in early March. Medical 
experts speculate that the quake may have kicked up dust carrying the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical authorities have noted that the illness occasionally crops up in such 
creatures as cats, cattle, sheep, pigs and horses. But dogs are more 
susceptible, Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley veterinarian Dr. John Anderson, a former CDC physician who 
specializes in fungal illnesses, said dogs are especially at risk because they 
always have their noses in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found that the hunting dog, the sniffing dog, is more prone," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to Anderson's Simi Valley office that Ruth Morrill brought her dog, 
Wolfie, for treatment last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real listless and having trouble breathing," Morrill said. "I thought 
she might have some sort of flu." 
</P>
<P>
 A blood test determined that the dog had valley fever, which surprised 
Wolfie's owner. "I thought they were joking," Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfie's symptoms were typical of a valley fever-infected canine: a dry, 
hacking cough, fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, veterinarians had diagnosed few dogs as having valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since 1984, I've seen probably four total," said Dr. Karen 
Martin, a veterinarian at the Conejo Valley Veterinary Clinic. The clinic has 
treated three dogs with valley fever since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steve Watase, a veterinarian the Anza Animal Clinic in Westlake, is 
treating a dog that was infected with valley fever about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here in Westlake for a year, Ventura for three years, Agoura a year 
before that and that's the first case I've seen," Watase said. But until now, 
he said, vets in Ventura County typically don't look for valley fever in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin expects to see such cases increase in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, we are looking more for it," she said. "When you see pneumonia, 
the first thing you think of is running a fungal screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Public-health officials are concerned that the heightened medical attention to 
the disease will drive up the number of reported cases and create unnecessary 
public concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have a higher number of cases, but what does it mean? Nobody 
knows," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of the Los Angeles County Health 
Department. "It's their general impression, it's their gut feeling and they may 
be right, but they don't have any basis for saying so." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said the increase in valley fever cases has more to do with an increase 
in testing than an epidemic created by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stir up the community so everybody who has had a cough in the last two 
months goes out and gets tested," she said. Humans and dogs can have valley 
fever and not know it because symptoms don't always develop, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson said there's no harm in being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfie's owners are relieved that their dog was diagnosed before the illness 
could mature. Antibiotics and the expensive drug used to treat valley fever 
have eased Wolfie's discomfort, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's almost back to normal now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most uncomfortable aspects of the illness is the cost of treatment 
for pet owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest problem is dogs don't have Medicare and it's very 
expensive to treat," Watase said. A blood test, which is the only way to 
determine if a dog has valley fever, runs between $35 and $70, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most expensive aspect of treatment is medication, Anderson said. 
Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal drug used to treat a wide spectrum of human 
illnesses, is prescribed to treat dogs with the virus. Individual pills cost 
about $4, and the prescribed treatment is usually two pills a day, Anderson 
said, depending on the dog's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real shock to find it was $95 for 30 pills," Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said treatment for an infected dog could run from six months to a 
year.

SWALLOWS DAY PARADE DRAWS MANY TO ENJOY FLOATS, BANDS 
</P>

<P>
 Organizers estimated that 30,000 people turned out for the 36th Annual 
Swallows Day Parade on Saturday to watch as nearly 200 floats, bands, and 
equestrian units moved down Del Obispo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city offices were getting scads of calls in the last few days asking if 
we were going to cancel the parade," said Don Tryon, a parade organizer."We 
told them it would happen, rain or shine. Luckily, it shined." 
</P>
<P>
 One float, in particular, caught the crowd's attention. Members of the Rios 
family, who have lived on the seven acres their ancestor, Feliciano Rios, 
received in a grant from the Spanish Crown 200 years ago, built a replica of 
their adobe home near Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festivities, a large group of enthusiastic members of the Juaneno 
tribe walked behind the carriage of this year's grand marshal, Teeter Maria 
Romero. Romero is a Juaneno businesswoman who is a past president of the 
Capistrano Indian Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's parade and street fair capped a week of activities that began last 
weekend with the return of the swallows to the city. LYNN FRANEY

EVICTED BARBERS SWEEP UP FOR LAST TIME; NORTH HOLLYWOOD: PARTNERS WHO WERE 
FORCED OUT LEAVE THEIR LONGTIME SHOP AND THEIR PROFESSION. 
</P>

<P>
 The century-old, out-of-tune piano is gone. So are the twin barber chairs and 
time-worn seats where customers at Jim & Tom's Barber Shop once sat to shoot 
the breeze and leaf through men's magazines like some blue-collar scene from 
Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-painted barber pole still stands with its descending red stripe. So 
do the massive wall mirrors where so many men sternly appraised their new $6 
haircut with head turned this way and that. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tom Wilson can only look into those mirrors and ask himself how it 
happened: After more than three decades of doing business at the same North 
Hollywood location, near the corner of Magnolia and Laurel Canyon boulevards, 
he and partner Jim Carcioppolo, 79, have been forced to close their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the deadline -- the barbers must be out of the shop they have called 
home since the 1950s, heeding an eviction that has become the unkindest cut of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 They were ordered out earlier this month by a landlord who grew weary of the 
homeless men and women who used to frequent the shop -- including Russ Turner, 
a 43-year-old washed-up jazz musician who used to play the old piano so well it 
brought tears to the barbers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The last haircut was this week -- ironically of a homeless man, to the cheers 
of his fellow street dwellers who had pitched in to pay for the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeless all came and got drunk and left their bottles around," said 
Wilson, pointing to an empty bottle of Fleishmann's vodka, small enough to fit 
into a coat pocket. "Now we're the ones who are homeless. We've joined the 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has spent the week cleaning up the shop, scraping the yellowed 
newspaper clippings off the walls. The old blue-and-white parquet floor is 
littered with mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 A 76-year-old with a delicate mustache and seafarer's cap, Wilson is saddened 
by the eviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those homeless people didn't hurt anybody. They'd come maybe three or four at 
a time to hear Russ play the piano and to say hello. They didn't stay long. But 
hell, they're human beings, too. They shouldn't just be run off like stray 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, the barbers gave Turner -- a former studio musician who claims 
to have once played with Frank Sinatra and Buddy Rich -- a home to store his 
meager belongings. Now those things are gone, along with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors complained that the homeless frightened women customers at the 
dress shop nearby. "We're glad the problem is gone," said one nearby shop 
owner, who asked not to be identified. "But, to tell you the truth, we miss 
those barbers already. They were really a part of this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Now all Tom Wilson has left are the scraps of hair his homeless helpers used 
to sweep into the corner. And memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best one is of the people who patronized me," he said. "Some of them have 
come by to say goodby. Some cried. I didn't, but purt-near." He shakes his head 
slowly. "It's a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Carcioppolo has quit barbering for good. But Wilson, who next plans to fix his 
earthquake-damaged fence at home, says he may cut hair again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call us a couple of old dogs. But we just didn't like to be dictated as to 
whose hair we could cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a tiny sign hangs in the window directing passersby to a nearby shop. But 
a would-be customer enters the shop without seeing the hand-scrawled message. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean you're closing?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it. They ran us off," Wilson responds sadly. "No, we're not gonna 
move. We're just gonna quit."

MAN TOSSED FROM CLUB ACCUSED OF FIRING AT BOUNCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Tustin man -- angered over his ouster from Kokomo's nightclub -- 
returned early Saturday morning and allegedly fired four shots toward the 
security guards who ejected him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two guards ducked for cover at the sight of the .22 caliber handgun, 
escaping injury.Police said the shooting happened about 1:20 a.m., shortly 
after Nicholas Vacalopoulos was ordered out of the nightclub at 19727 MacArthur 
Blvd. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Vacalopoulos had been forced out because he had been drinking 
heavily and creating disturbances. As he left, police said, he made threats to 
the security guards who removed him. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later they saw him again, armed with the handgun. The gunfire 
drew the attention of a police officer who was near the parking lot. According 
to investigators, Vacalopoulos ran away along MacArthur Boulevard, where he 
tossed the gun into some bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacalopoulos was later arrested and charged with assault with intent to commit 
murder. He was being held in the Costa Mesa city jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.

REINECKE SCORES HARD-WON ENDORSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Reinecke, who says he "was raised under the principles of Ronald Reagan," 
won an important endorsement Saturday from a staunchly conservative Republican 
group in the hotly contested June 7 primary race for the 70th Assembly District 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 During an all-day convention at the Sheraton Newport Beach Hotel, the Orange 
County Coordinating Republican Assembly, considered the most conservative wing 
of the party and a key factor in county politics, also voted to endorse 
Republicans Virgel L. Nickell in the 69th Assembly District and Tony Nottke in 
the 67th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 But the convention's most fervent battle came in the struggle for an 
endorsement in the 70th District, being vacated by Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach) after five terms. Ferguson is stepping down to seek the seat of state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke, 34, an attorney and Ferguson's own choice to be his successor, won 
the endorsement on the second ballot over Irvine City Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond and Marilyn Brewer, a former aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 With Brewer considered a more moderate candidate and not in attendance 
Saturday, it came down to a faceoff between Reinecke and Hammond for the 
endorsement to represent the district, which generally runs along the coastline 
from Newport Beach to Laguna Beach, includes all of Costa Mesa and runs inland 
to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke wound up winning handily because of his grass-roots efforts, he said. 
He strongly believes in the conservative principles of the CRA, he said, 
including less government, lower taxes, individual freedoms and property rights 
and school choice "because parents know what's best for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, Reinecke, the son of former Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, told 
assembly's delegates, "We don't need any warmed-over liberals in Sacramento." 
Afterward, he said he was "proud to have the endorsement. Our race is a 
grass-roots campaign of the people who believe in the principles of Ronald 
Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she attended the convention and sought the group's support, six-term 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) lost out on an endorsement to Nottke in 
the 67th Assembly District, a sprawling district which includes Cypress, La 
Palma, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach, Huntington Beach and parts of Anaheim, Buena 
Park, Garden Grove and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nottke, a partner in an environmental consulting firm who has lived his entire 
life in the district, says the most important issues "are the issues of 
personal freedom." And rather than regulating guns or weapons, "the only way 
you will stop crime is by taking criminals off the streets," Nottke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who many believe may also be eyeing a future battle with Ferguson for 
Bergeson's vacated Senate seat, said the outcome was "not surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this was Gil Ferguson's party. This was his scenario, but I wanted 
to be here," Allen said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District, a heavily minority area of the central county 
where the Republicans hope to grab the only Orange County legislative seat now 
held by a Democrat, businessman Nickell eked out a slim victory over Jim 
Morrissey, the president of a manufacturing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell, whose said his mother is "half Spanish," called himself "the people's 
candidate" who "can't be controlled by politics." 
</P>
<P>
 In the county supervisorial races, the group endorsed Huntington Beach 
Councilman Jim Silva in the 2nd District. The CRA chose not to endorse 
Bergeson, the only candidate in the 5th District, nor any candidate in the 4th 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Republican candidates who failed to win an endorsement was the 
embattled Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), who is under federal investigation 
for alleged campaign spending irregularities during his 1992 election campaign. 
After a lengthy discussion, the group chose not to endorse any of his four 
challengers either. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would the group endorse Sheriff Brad Gates, who is seeking his sixth term 
as the county sheriff-coroner, despite the fact Gates spoke to the convention. 
Gates is a proponent of the forfeiture of the assets of suspected criminals, 
even though they have not been convicted, a position the CRA adamantly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue there is due process of law, which needs to be protected very 
carefully," said Doug Thomson of Orange, the group's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the county CRA also endorsed incumbent Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove) in the 68th Assembly District, incumbent Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) in 
the 73rd Assembly District, incumbent state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and 
a slate of conservative congressional incumbents, including Ed Royce 
(R-Fullerton), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside).

CATCHING THE WATER BEFORE IT TRICKLES AWAY; RESOURCES: NATURAL SPRINGS ON THE 
UNIVERSITY HIGH CAMPUS PRODUCE 20,000 GALLONS A DAY. A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
PANEL HOPES TO RECLAIM THE WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN CRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time you finish reading this story, 39 gallons of potentially drinkable 
water will have flowed from the campus of University High School into the 
gutters -- but that's just a drop in the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 580,000 gallons dribbled away at the West Los Angeles school; last 
year, 7.3 million gallons were wasted. In the week after the Northridge 
earthquake, when water problems abounded on the Westside, an estimated 140,000 
gallons were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not to mention the 43.8 million gallons lost during the six years 
of drought that ended last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of all of these lost gallons: natural springs on the northern side 
of University High. One spring feeds into a charming man-made waterfall at the 
northwest corner of the soccer field. The other supplies a pair of ponds in the 
agricultural portion of the campus, between Wilshire and Santa Monica 
boulevards, just west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, all of the water winds up in the storm drains that lead 
to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all going down the drain today, just as it did every day of the 
(post-earthquake) crisis," said Jon Shaughnessy, executive director of the 
fledgling West Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which organized in September. 
"We basically have a leak that needs fixing, but no one has spent the time and 
money to make sure this is a usable source of water in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the West Los Angeles chamber has formed a disaster preparedness 
committee that will make development of the springs one of its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, however, is whether businesses will pony up the necessary cash. 
Shaughnessy said preliminary estimates of the cost of installing equipment to 
pump the spring water into a holding tank run about $20,000. Thus far, no one 
has stepped forward with financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main project is to get financial support to cap the springs off," 
Shaughnessy said. "A lot has to do with how much of the work we can have done 
pro bono." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when a West Los Angeles community organization applied for federal 
funding under the Urban Forestry and Gardening Grants program to reclaim the 
water from the springs, the cost was estimated at $54,000, not including labor. 
The grant request was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had much information, so we just kind of ball-parked some numbers," 
said Raymond Scott of RS Engineering, the Santa Monica development firm that 
provided this estimate. "No one ever gave us a real plan. Someone just got a 
bug for the idea and gave us a call." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the colorful history of the springs -- the Tongva Indians had a 
village at the site 200 years ago -- it is perhaps surprising that they have 
never been thoroughly studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only measurement of their flow rate was by a volunteer who timed 
how long it took to fill up a pail and figured that 20,000 gallons bubble forth 
each day. The lack of solid information, however, makes an accurate estimate of 
development costs a near impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could spend about anything on something like this," Scott said. "It's a 
shame to have it go to waste, but there's no verified supply and we don't 
really know if (the water) is reclaimable. Then you'll need a reservoir, a pump 
to get it to the tank. (You'll need to) decide how many gallons you want to 
keep in reserve at all times. Do you want to employ it every day? Can it be 
used for irrigation, or for the flush toilets at the school? There are so many 
variables because nobody's really done anything with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power conducted an 
informal feasibility study of the springs but chose not to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at it from a supply perspective, and we didn't think it was 
worth the while," said Peter Kavounas, a DWP hydrologic engineer. "It just 
didn't seem like there was much water to be had, and what there was had enough 
quality problems that it would need treatment to make it potable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't cost-effective, because we have to live up to national health 
standards. If (the West Los Angeles Chamber) doesn't have to meet national 
health standards, it might be more feasible for them than it was for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kavounas, who has not seen the springs, said DWP research suggests that the 
water contains a lot of iron. This is typical of springs that form when 
rainwater in nearby mountains percolates into the ground and resurfaces after 
passing through formations containing iron and other minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it would take (to tap the springs) is to be in a different part of the 
country," he contends. "In Southern California, when it rains it pours. You 
never really have the less-intense rains that go on for days at a time. That 
means the reservoirs it takes to capture such large, sudden rainwater amounts 
have to be very big facilities, and that's very costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Kavounas said the DWP has no claim to the water rights, which would fall to 
the owner of the property -- the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have suggested that the district could use the springs for irrigation and 
thus cut down on filtering expenses and the number of gallons it purchases from 
the DWP. The district's department of architectural engineering reportedly 
studied the matter two years ago, but its deputy director, Robert Donald, did 
not return phone inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Rene, assistant principal at University High, said experience indicates 
that an on-campus water source might help the school save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the district is paying for irrigation, but I know that from 
time to time it has been very expensive," she said. "We've got a large campus, 
and right now we're not able to irrigate every single area on campus. If we 
could use this supply of water, I think it would help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Rene would like to see the water used as an emergency supply for the 
school's 2,000 students and staff members. Shaughnessy of the West Los Angeles 
Chamber had the same thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Jan. 17, when the National Guard asked if they could put a hose up and get 
some water and the answer had to be no, their response was, 'Thanks anyway,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's easier to truck it in from Tehachapi than it is to pick it up 
in a plastic bucket, and we don't want that to be the case when the next quake 
hits."

YOUTH BOXING CLUB SOON MAY BE DOWN FOR COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its run-down warehouse where sunlight can't pierce the grimy windows, an 
Alhambra boxing club has become a place where youths who are struggling to stay 
out of trouble learn not only about jabbing but also about self-esteem and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the nonprofit club, which also sponsors a 10-week Toastmasters public 
speaking program for youths, is fighting to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where next month's rent will come from," said Antonia Tellez, 
47. She and her husband, Rudy, a 47-year-old former boxing manager, opened the 
club in July, 1991, with $3,000 of their own money and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers boxing instruction and a safe place to go for youths who might 
otherwise end up in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds began to dry up in December when the city stopped paying the $1,100 
monthly rent on the club's South Palm Avenue warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had agreed to provide the first year's rent at the site, the club's 
third home in three years. A $2,500 grant from Pacific Bell was exhausted last 
month, leaving the club with $500 a month from the county probation service to 
pay the rent and bills.  
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials praise their efforts, the Tellezes say they have been 
offered nothing more than a loan this year. City officials say they have 
already paid $11,000 in rent and cannot favor the club over other community 
programs.

AIRPORT NEIGHBORS' FEARS RAISED AFTER CRASH; AVIATION: THE SECOND INCIDENT IN 
LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS RENEWS CONCERNS ABOUT LARGER AIRCRAFT AT SANTA MONICA 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second plane crash involving Santa Monica Airport in less than four months 
has renewed neighborhood criticism of the busy facility, with some residents 
insisting it is only a matter of time before a much larger aircraft goes down 
-- with catastrophic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is the big, old jets," said Virginia Ernst, a longtime critic of 
the airport who lives on Sardis Avenue near the east end of the runway. "I'm 
scared to death one of those things is going to come down and wipe out an 
entire neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents suggested that the March 11 crash of a four-seat, 
propeller-driven Piper 28 into a vacant South Barrington Avenue house could 
provide the impetus for a grass-roots coalition that would work to address 
issues from jet fumes to helicopter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two people aboard the aircraft was killed in the crash, which occurred 
after the plane developed engine trouble as it attempted to land at the airport 
about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was Greg Leslie, a 35-year-old rock musician and airplane mechanic 
who was seen before the crash working on the plane with his friend, David 
Thompson, 22, of Culver City, who was the pilot of the aircraft. Thompson was 
released earlier this week from UCLA Medical Center after treatment for a 
broken leg and second-degree burns on his hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials maintain that the airport, one of the busiest single-runway 
facilities in the nation, is exceptionally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever been killed on the ground as the result of an incident 
involving the 75-year-old airport -- a record that Manager Tim Walsh said 
"speaks for itself." But that record has been tested of late. Aside from the 
recent crash, which set a house ablaze, a small plane struck an apartment house 
in Santa Monica in November, killing the two men aboard the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the airport and even some of its critics cautioned this week 
against reading too much into the latest incidents, with some neighbors 
expressing resignation that the risks associated with living near an airport 
will never be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be some chance in hell that something is going to go 
wrong with an airplane," said Stan Dounn, a tenants' activist at Lincoln Place 
Apartments, a 795-unit complex in Venice just west of the airfield. "You live 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Dounn said he hopes the crash spurs scattered Westside 
neighborhoods to address airport issues such as noise and fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may galvanize us into some sort of coalition," he said. In the past, 
neighborhoods have pressured the airport "at different times in different 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Century City resident Karin Machleder also hinted at a grass-roots campaign, 
which may involve the distribution of leaflets to protest the dangers posed by 
the seemingly endless procession of aircraft flying into and out of the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be getting louder, lower and bigger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate jet traffic, which has grown dramatically in recent years, has 
fueled fears of a major accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little plane that got in trouble, and that happens," Ernst said. 
"I'm concerned about the big ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh countered that corporate jets are safer than single-engine planes; they 
require significantly more pilot training to operate and have better safety 
records than commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance of a jet crashing into a Westside neighborhood, he asserted, is 
highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, airport officials insist that the airport, which predates most of 
the houses around it, has worked hard to reduce noise and other nuisances. They 
say it remains one of the safest facilities of its kind in the nation. The 
airport averages about one crash per 200,000 takeoffs and landings -- about one 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The general aviation accident rate is 10 times higher, or five incidents per 
100,000 takeoffs and landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the airport remains a source of worry and aggravation for residents who 
live below the flight path, a zig-zagging corridor between Century City and the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials strongly deny it, a number of neighbors insist that airport 
management, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Santa Monica Airport 
Commission often look the other way when violations occur -- partly because a 
number of the so-called regulators are flyers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to take the trouble to enforce their own rules," said West 
Los Angeles neighborhood activist Brookie Westbrook.

WILL THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM STAY?; DOWNTOWN: THE FACILITY GETS CITY'S OK TO TAKE 
OVER ADJACENT LOS ANGELES MALL. BUT OPERATORS ARE WEIGHING OPTIONS, INCLUDING 
MID- WILSHIRE SITE.

<P>
 The long-awaited expansion of the Children's Museum appeared to take a step 
forward last month when the City Council approved, in concept, a years-old 
proposal under which the museum would take over operation of the bedraggled, 
city-owned Los Angeles Mall that adjoins it. 
</P>
<P>
 But although city and museum officials say they are proceeding with the plan, 
museum officials are also keeping themselves open to other options for 
expansion -- including the possibility of leaving Downtown for another site. 
</P>

 Museum officials said the Los Angeles Mall plan, in the works for five years, 
is the favored option. But museum officials have also had talks with the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art about moving part or all of the Children's Museum 
to property the county facility hopes to buy in the Mid-Wilshire area for its 
own expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vincent Beggs, Children's Museum executive director, said another entity, 
which he declined to identify, recently offered the museum an alternative 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials say they want to find the best location for the 225,000 
visitors they draw annually. "We're looking at all options right now," Beggs 
said. "Our biggest concern is, how can we best serve our constituency?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old museum began assessing future needs in 1985. It was already 
feeling squeezed in the 15,000-square-foot space at 310 N. Main St., at the end 
of the Los Angeles Mall, which was always meant to be a temporary site, Beggs 
said. "The space we're in was originally designed for a restaurant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the city in 1989 put out a call for new operators to take over the 
mall, which runs under City Hall East between Main and Los Angeles streets, the 
Children's Museum responded with its proposal to expand into the mall and take 
over its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the City Council approved a letter of intent to lease the mall, 
negotiated by city staff and Children's Museum supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, the Children's Museum would expand to 80,000 square feet for 
an estimated $20 million. The museum would also renovate the underground 
shopping center, expected to cost $10 million, and take over mall operations 
and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum would lease the mall for $1 a year for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit museum could also benefit from mall revenues, which would go 
toward operating expenses and which donors hope will recoup their investment. 
In a 1990 evaluation, consultants estimated that the mall made a profit of 
$66,000 on revenues of $676,000 that year. 
</P>
<P>
 City administrative officials herald the plan as a way for the city to get out 
of the mall business. The 20-year-old mall is in desperate need of repair that 
the city hasn't been able to afford, and the Children's Museum would pay for 
the renovation as well as hire a management company to run the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the improvements the mall needs, according to city officials, are new 
access ways for visitors with disabilities, new paving and air conditioning, 
and basic repairs and replacement of fixtures such as the fountains, drains, 
planters and electrical system. Asbestos clearing may also be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials believe that the renovations and a better mix of tenants will 
boost business at the mall, which empties on weeknights because it is dependent 
on government and business workers. The museum itself draws visitors on 
evenings and weekends, and that could translate into more mall business, said 
museum board member David Houk. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials are now in the middle of a 60-day inspection period during 
which they are checking the mall's structural features to determine whether it 
is feasible to proceed with the project or pull out. If museum officials decide 
to go ahead, the city and museum will spend the next year negotiating detailed 
lease agreements and other necessary documents to solidify the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum must also secure $3 million in donor pledges during that time to 
demonstrate its ability to raise money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the contract documents are approved, the museum would launch its 
fund-raising campaign and have a year to draft design plans for both the mall 
renovation and its own expansion. Once it begins, construction is expected to 
take 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost or extent of repair work needed at the mall could conceivably scare 
museum officials away from the project. Beggs acknowledged that the vast 
changes in economic and real estate conditions since the project was first 
proposed could affect the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the County Museum offers a central location with good access. The 
museum is working to buy the vacant May Co. building next door on Wilshire 
Boulevard and is talking to a number of arts and cultural organizations about 
using that space or building its own structures on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary analyses have indicated that there is room for a 
35,000-square-foot building at the Wilshire site, which would drop the 
Children's expansion cost to about $10 million but may not be enough space for 
the entire museum, Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Wilshire location for a second, auxiliary facility is another 
option, Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Children's Museum opts to back out of the mall plan, the city will 
continue to look for an operator to take over the shopping center, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the museum has been the only operator so far willing to pay for the 
renovation as well as run the mall, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers worry that a move out of Downtown by the Children's Museum will 
hurt the area's already struggling public image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be good for Downtown, especially when we believe that 
'Downtown's Back,' " said Carol Schatz, vice president of the Central City 
Assn., an organization of Downtown businesses. "With (the renovations of) 
Pershing Square, the Convention Center, the Central Library and the Disney 
Concert Hall, . . . there are all these forces for positive change happening 
now."

SWAPPING INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR MAKING SUDS; BUSINESSES: MARK VANLEEUWEN 
SCRAPPED HIS THRIVING PRACTICE TO OPEN A BREW-PUB. HIS ESTABLISHMENT SERVES AS 
THE CITY'S FIRST MICRO-BREWERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime in January, Mark VanLeeuwen began drinking on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drink more beer than I used to," the 33-year-old entrepreneur admitted on a 
recent afternoon as he knocked back a malty pint of Railroad Porter ale. He 
paused, and said, "But around here, we call that quality control." 
</P>
<P>
 VanLeeuwen recently scrapped a thriving insurance practice to open Santa 
Clarita's first micro-brewery. He said the move was more a calling than a whim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love good beer," the unlikely brew master said, guiding a tour of the 
brewery's stainless steel bowels and copper arteries. "Even as a teen-ager I 
saved my money to buy the imported stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 VanLeeuwen, who runs the upstart Santa Clarita Brewing Co. with his wife, 
Sheila, had been toying with the idea since he visited one in Hopland, Calif., 
in 1986 -- one of the areas where the micro-brewing trend has its roots. He 
later visited numerous facilities throughout the northwest, all the while 
gathering ideas for one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe the lack of brew-pubs happening in L. A. County," he 
said, adding that the demographics in suburban Santa Clarita suggested that the 
city would support such a venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in the black since the day we opened," VanLeeuwen said. "But it's 
still a white-knuckle kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At any one time the brewery has four fresh brews on tap, including Golden Oak 
Ale, Beale's Bitter, Railroad Porter and Tumbleweed Wheat ale. The restaurant's 
menu offers standard pub fare, and for entertainment there's a pool table, 
darts, a big screen TV and live music on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing that's real nice about this place -- it's a family place," 
customer Janet Miller said recently. "My kid wants to have his birthday here." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the brew-pub opened three days before the Northridge earthquake, 
VanLeeuwen said it has attracted everyone from blue-collar workers to aerospace 
engineers, the common denominator seeming to be a thirst for suds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Miller, a pub regular who works as a mechanic at a local gas station, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place gets all kinds, all ages, as long as they're beer drinkers," 
Miller said. "But the bottom line is that the pub is fun place to come to." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing pensive as he quaffed a pint with a group of friends, Miller said he 
thought the new brew-pub served a nobler purpose as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're teaching Americans that there are different kinds of beers out 
there," he said, wiping the frothy telltale foam from above his lips, "not just 
the stuff the big companies are trying to ram down our throats."

HOT PROPERTY: ACTOR LANDS IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 TREAT WILLIAMS, who co-stars with Shelley Long in the upcoming CBS sitcom 
"Good Advice," and his wife, actress-dancer Pamela Van Sant, are leasing a 
Santa Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good Advice" is about a divorce attorney (Williams) and a divorced marriage 
counselor (Long) who share an office suite but not the same philosophy, as the 
counselor tries to mend the type of dysfunctional relationships from which the 
lawyer makes his living. 
</P>
<P>
 The series was due to have its season premiere last fall, but it was postponed 
because of Long's bout with the flu. Since then, 13 episodes have been filmed 
and are expected to air shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 42, also co-starred with Kelly McGillis last year in the TV movie 
"Bonds of Love," and he previously portrayed J. Edgar Hoover and Jack Dempsey 
in TV bios, played Stanley Kowalski in the TV version of "Streetcar Named 
Desire" (1987) and appeared in the TV movie "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story" 
(1990). He also starred in the 1979 movie "Hair." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has several planes that he rents to the studios, for use in films, 
through his Cine Flights, and he is a pilot. Early in his acting career, 
Williams flew planes for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 The house that he and his wife leased, for about a year at $6,000 a month, was 
built in the early 1940s and has four bedrooms in about 3,000 square feet. It 
is a red-brick home with white columns and green shutters. The couple owns a 
condo in Manhattan and a farm in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses were represented in their lease by Chrys Stamatis of Jon 
Douglas Co.'s Brentwood office, and the house had been listed by Coldwell 
Banker in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress/writer PAMELA MASON has listed her longtime Beverly Hills home at $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1926 for silent film star Buster Keaton and owned in the early '40s 
by Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton, the estate was purchased by Pamela and James 
Mason in 1946, the same year he won the Motion Picture Award, the British 
equivalent of an Oscar. James Mason earned three Academy Award nominations 
before he died at age 75 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masons were both born in England, and she was an heiress to a 
wool-manufacturing fortune. The couple, who had two children, was divorced in 
1964, but she continued to live in the Beverly Hills home, on 1.5 acres with a 
tennis court, pool and two-story guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used to broadcast (her syndicated, TV talk show) out of the living room 
of the main house," said listing agent Shirley Wells of John Aaroe & 
Associates, a newly formed Beverly Hills firm. The 10,000-square-foot house has 
six bedrooms and a ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has said, 'I raised my children (Portland and Morgan) and had many 
wonderful experiences here, but it's time to move on,' " Wells said. Besides 
doing a talk show, Pamela Mason wrote a movie column and several novels. As an 
actress, she made her stage debut in 1936 and last appeared in the '85 TV movie 
"My Wicked, Wicked Ways -- The Legend of Errol Flynn." 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to move to Las Vegas, where she owned a vacation home at one time. 
"She's a night person, and she loves it there," Wells said.

YOUR MORTGAGE; GUIDELINES AIM TO REDUCE LOAN DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group.

<P>
 Large numbers of minority and other mortgage applicants may get a fairer shot 
at obtaining a home loan this year, thanks to new guidelines to lenders from 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers and mortgage lenders warn that the reverse might occur as well: 
Some minority and non-minority applicants could be rejected out of hand -- or 
pay higher than necessary loan fees -- as an unintended result of the 
anti-discrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Here's a quick update on the not-always-so-simple rules of equal 
opportunity home lending: 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month 10 federal financial regulatory and housing agencies 
released long-awaited guidance to mortgage lenders on how to avoid illegal 
discrimination. The 22-page statement sought to cover lenders' most frequent 
questions about what they can and cannot do under fair housing and equal credit 
opportunity statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with the basic prohibitions. Under federal law, mortgage applicants 
cannot be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, national 
origin, sex, marital status, age or disability. Just about everybody knows 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 But what constitutes "discrimination?" Lenders cannot on the basis of race, 
sex, creed, etc.: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide different information or services regarding application procedures, 
lending standards or credit availability; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vary the terms of their mortgage credit, whether interest rate, fees, size, 
length or type of loan; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Subtly discourage or encourage borrowers to inquire or apply for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can mortgage lenders discriminate against a borrower because of the 
"present or prospective occupants of the area where the property to be financed 
is located." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders violate the law whenever they provide "disparate treatment" to 
applicants -- especially in regard to those whose credit histories and incomes 
rank them as "marginal," not squeaky clean but not clearly unqualified for a 
loan either. It's in situations like this, according to the federal agencies, 
that even the most subtle differences in approach by the lending officer can 
make a huge difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not an applicant qualifies," said the policy statement, "may 
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides in preparing an 
application. The lender may, for example, propose solutions to problems (of 
credit, income, expense ratios) on an application . . . and provide 
encouragement to the applicant." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if a loan officer offers helpful suggestions to marginal 
borrowers who are white, but intentionally or unintentionally offers little or 
no help to marginal applicants who are African Americans, that's illegal 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But mortgage companies may also discriminate by virtue of seemingly innocuous 
loan policies that nonetheless have a "disparate impact." That is, they have a 
sharply more negative effect on one group of potential applicants than another 
-- whether intentionally or not. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a mortgage company that prefers not to make loans below some set 
figure -- say, $50,000 or even $100,000 -- may be violating federal law. That's 
because the effect of its policy is to discourage loans in areas with 
lower-cost real estate, which in its market area happen to be predominantly 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The new federal guidelines do not absolutely rule out minimum loan size 
policies. But they warn lenders that they will need to have a solid "business 
necessity" to justify their continued use of such a standard. Translation: 
Unless you want trouble with the feds, forget minimum loan amounts. Or keep 
them as low as you can possibly go. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, major mortgage lenders and their trade associations welcomed 
the new federal interpretations. But in private discussions, some lenders 
questioned whether the rules might be counterproductive in certain situations. 
One mortgage executive, who asked that he not be identified, said that the 
government's heavy focus on "disparate" treatment of marginal applicants could 
lead his firm to a totally new policy: Don't bother with any marginal 
borrowers. Reject them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (government regulators) are going to be counting to see whether we approve 
more loans to white applicants who are borderline (credit risks) versus 
minorities," he said, "maybe it's not worth the legal risk (to consider any 
applicant who's borderline). If we turn down everybody who's marginal, then by 
definition we won't be discriminating against any particular group." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts active in the mortgage industry agreed the guidelines could have 
unintended side effects. Washington attorney Laurence E. Platt of Brownstein 
Zeidman & Lore, cited the prohibition against "disparate treatment" on mortgage 
rates and fees as an example. Many lenders traditionally have been open to 
competitive negotiations on their loan quotes and fees with knowledgeable 
applicants, or they maintain sliding scales of rates and "points" keyed to 
factors such as borrower credit ratings. (A point equals 1% of the loan 
amount.) 
</P>
<P>
 But if they fear federal attack on their system of pricing, says Platt, "they 
may play it safe and be less open" to loan pricing variations or negotiated 
rates. If so, the bottom line for some borrowers -- whatever their race, creed 
or color -- could be higher costs at closing.

LIVING WITH LEAD'S RISK; FOR HOMEOWNERS WITH LEAD HAZARDS, FINDING A QUALIFIED 
CONTRACTOR IS NOT EASY. CONVENTIONAL PAINT-REMOVAL METHODS, SUCH AS SANDING AND 
SCRAPING, SPREAD TOXIC DUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ordeal of childhood lead poisoning began for Christa Hathaway and her 
husband, Joe Gonzales, when a routine blood test showed that their infant son 
had nearly enough of the metal in him to make him sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic with concern for their baby and toddler daughter, the Santa Barbara 
couple tested their home for lead hazards. The results showed that dust from 
deteriorating paint inside the 1920s-era house contained high levels of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began calling a bunch of people to try to figure out how to get the lead 
paint out," Hathaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there was no easy fix. Conventional paint-removal methods, such 
as sanding and scraping, create more toxic dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The family then started a search for an expert in lead-hazard removal. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a growing number of property owners with similar lead hazards are 
becoming well aware, finding a qualified abatement contractor is nearly 
impossible in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no state-approved certification or licensing programs for such 
workers and only a few programs that teach a curriculum approved by the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Hathaway hired a man who seemed to understand lead-abatement work. His charge 
for the job: $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh my God!' " she said of the cost. "But it's got to be done for 
the safety of my children." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it all backfired badly. The man she hired wasn't a contractor, as she 
had believed. And the people he hired as subcontractors weren't qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the workers spread so much toxic lead dust in her home and yard 
that the property became uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests run after the workers left found highly toxic levels of lead dust 
everywhere. Her son's new crib showed dust carrying more than 1,100 parts per 
million of lead. Any level above 200 ppm on the floor and 800 ppm in window 
wells is considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The soil in her yard measured 15,000 ppm -- soil with more than 1,000 ppm is 
classified as hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, family members who own the house shelled out another $15,000 just to 
clean up the workers' mess and make the home and property livable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hathaway's story is a common one that illustrates just one problem with 
lead-hazard abatement today -- while there are a growing number of policies 
governing the removal or mitigation of lead hazards, there is as of yet no 
uniform training or standards for California workers and no way to prohibit 
dangerous lead-abatement practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many questions about lead-hazard reduction techniques," said Ellen 
Widess, executive director of Lead Safe California, a nonprofit organization 
that's helping shape lead-hazard policies statewide. "What's effective? How 
often should it be done? Who does them? That still needs to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, lead paint hazards are often compared to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who dealt with the asbestos problem early probably spent two to three 
times what they would have spent if they could've waited three to four years 
for the market place to catch up and regulatory agencies to catch up," said 
Rick Warren, a San Francisco commercial property attorney also working to 
develop statewide policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, it's estimated up to 3 million children now have elevated blood 
lead levels. Lead paint is considered the main source of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition, which shows no obvious symptoms except in the most extreme 
cases, can permanently damage the development of the brain and nervous systems 
of children. At it's worst, it can cause coma and even death. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now in California and nationwide, policies regarding lead-hazard 
abatement vary widely, from nothing at all in some communities to strict, 
full-abatement requirements, such as is the case in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Total abatement can be quite difficult for a homeowner to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost is so high it's scary," Janet Comey, chief of the Lead Poisoning 
Abatement Program for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services, 
said of full abatement procedures. "I don't know what people are going to do, 
especially the small property owners . . . who basically are just making their 
monthly mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
 Private property owners faced with lead-abatement orders must make their own 
financial arrangements for the often costly work. 
</P>
<P>
 The only safe way to remove the paint is through sophisticated and expensive 
abatement methods that few contractors are familiar with. And the dearth of 
qualified workers means continued high prices for the specialized work. 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances, however, covering the paint under sheet-rock, paneling and 
floor tiles, or completely removing and then replacing lead-tainted objects, 
such as doors and window fixtures, is the most sensible and cost-efficient 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that people cannot, at the drop of a hat, spend $10,000 on 
abatement," said Bob Schlag, head of the Lead Hazard Reduction Department of 
the California Department of Health Services. "There are a lot of things you 
can do to reduce exposure that doesn't involve removing the paint. Sometimes 
removing it can be more damaging than controlling it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlag said routine damp mopping of hardwood floors keeps lead-dust levels 
down. Lead-tainted soil around the outside of the home should be covered with 
grass or another ground covering. Removing shoes before entering the house, 
routinely washing hands, which is especially important for children, and just 
being aware of potential sources of lead contamination also help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodwork tends to be high in lead concentration and tends to chip off," he 
said. "If you see any chips, pick them up immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 But in many other cases, a more aggressive approach is necessary but, 
depending upon the areas contaminated in a particular house or apartment, even 
encapsulation can prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Jung, an engineer and a Los Angeles landlord, is doing battle with Los 
Angeles County officials over the costly abatement orders they've put on a 
rental house he owns in a downtown-adjacent, working-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 His house is worth only $39,000, according to Jung, but the lead-hazard work 
ordered by the county -- which involves encapsulating all the inside and 
outside walls of his house and removing or replacing all the painted doors, 
door frames and door jambs in the four-bedroom, two-bath home -- will cost 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say I had the money to fix it up, that I hit the Lotto jackpot and fix 
it," Jung said. "Does it guarantee that the child will be lead free? No. The 
answer is, there is no guarantee. Whatever you do, there is no guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
 And this recent lead-cleanup order is the second one he's received. A year 
earlier, the county, which now has about 400 such orders active throughout Los 
Angeles, told him to cover the lead-contaminated soil in his back yard. That 
cost him about $4,000. "I've been a good citizen," he said "The first time 
around I complied. I'm not a big-time landowner. I'm just a guy working and 
trying to invest something and it's going down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 Jung considers the L.A. County policy "well-intended" but says its enforcement 
could in the end hurt families, like those living in his house. Jung said it 
will end up being more cost-effective for him to evict his tenants so he can 
raze the house and build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I evict them, what are they going to do?" he asked. "Each family is going 
to pay $500 or $600 for a one-bedroom tenement house. So it's not just me who's 
going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, he said, several families split the $1,050 monthly rent for his 
2,500-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Jung believes county efforts would be better spent educating parents on the 
dangers of lead and how they can minimize their children's exposure to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona resident Elizabeth Jimenez is still reeling from the financial losses 
she suffered in getting her house lead safe. The $25,000 abatement bill ate her 
entire retirement account and the college money she'd saved for her five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jimenez -- who was at the same time administering care to one of her 
lead-poisoned twin daughters -- spent days just trying to find someone she 
thought could do the job safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other property owners with lead-contaminated property, the only 
assistance Jimenez found in getting the job done was a long list of HUD 
guidelines detailing the do's and don'ts of lead-paint abatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, there will be more support for property owners faced with 
lead hazards. Title X of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act 
of 1992 requires each state to develop a program to create a trained and 
qualified work force. California officials hope the state's program will be 
ready by July.  
</P>
<P>
 And a new state law that took effect in January requires California to comply 
with federal law mandating uniform training, certification and standards for 
lead-abatement work. 
</P>
<P>
 Title X also refocuses national lead efforts on short-term, interim efforts, 
since most strict abatement policies have proved too overwhelming for many 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Rochlin, owner of Venice-based Lead Tech, a lead-paint inspection and 
abatement firm, said interim plans can work. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochlin, who got his lead-paint abatement training and certification in 
Massachusetts, does everything from full abatement jobs to designing plans that 
enable clients, like Christa Hathaway, to live safely with lead paint in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 After cleaning up the toxic mess in Hathaway's home, Rochlin developed a daily 
plan requiring that she clean areas of her house with a special vacuum designed 
to pick up the tiny lead-dust particles and that she wash walls and other 
potentially contaminated surfaces with special cleansing products. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no substitute for 100% abatement, but I think in-house management is 
what's going to be happening," Rochlin said. "If you have a wall intact and 
lead paint on it, you just have to be careful. Lead paint intact is not a 
gremlin. It's not going to come out and grab you. It's a problem when it's 
disturbed, but it's also something you can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 But the contamination in Jimenez's home was so widespread that she had to take 
major steps. Her search for a contractor led her to an Oakland company that 
charged her $600 to test her house and provide her with a breakdown of 
abatement steps for every contaminated wall and window in her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I called different contractors and showed them the guidelines," she 
said. "They'd tell me, 'Don't worry, we'll knock the wall out.' And I'd tell 
them no and explain to them that the dust created would be worse than the paint 
on the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Jimenez happened upon a person she considered qualified to do the 
work, which included covering the walls and ceiling with drywall, removing all 
the dust-laden carpeting (shampooing doesn't remove the dust and vacuuming with 
a conventional vacuum only spreads it around), laying new tiles in the kitchen 
and removing and replacing all the wood cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kitchen basically had to be redone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-month job she and her large family set up camp in her master 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caused tremendous mental stress," Jimenez said. "Five kids and a 
baby-sitter. We had our microwave and refrigerator in there and that's how we 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as Jimenez followed the exacting HUD guidelines, the next-door 
neighbor's home was getting a face-lift by a painter who sanded the entire 
outside of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he knew if it was lead paint because the dust he was creating 
was coming into my daughter's bedroom window," Jimenez recalled. "I called the 
city and found Pomona had no ordinance, that there was nothing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Widess of Lead Safe California says given the practical limits of 
technology and the financial limits of most property owners, the top priority 
should be minimizing the most hazardous sources of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody concerned with this problem realizes there is not enough money in 
this country to remove all the lead everywhere," she said. WHAT YOU CAN DO 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things you can do to reduce exposure that don't involve 
removing the paint. Sometimes removing it can be more damaging than controlling 
it." -- Bob Schlag, head of the Lead Hazard Reduction Dept. of the California 
Dept. of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 FLOORS -- Damp-mop hardwood floors to reduce lead-dust levels. 
</P>
<P>
 WALLS -- Wash walls and other potentially contaminated surfaces with special 
cleansers. 
</P>
<P>
 CARPETS -- Remove all dust-laden carpeting. Shampooing doesn't remove the dust 
and cleaning with a conventional vacuum only spreads the dust around. 
</P>
<P>
 YARD -- Cover lead-tainted soil in yards with grass or another ground cover. 
Remove shoes before entering the house. 
</P>
<P>
 VACUUM -- Clean floors and woodwork, especially doors, window frames and 
sills, with a special vacuum cleaner designed to pick up the tiny lead dust 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
 HYGIENE -- Wash hands routinely. Especially important for children. 
</P>
<P>
 WOODWORK -- Pick up any loose paint chips from painted surfaces in house. 
</P>
<P>
 COVER -- Covering the lead paint under sheet rock, paneling or floor tiles is 
advised by some experts. 
</P>
<P>
 REMOVAL -- Replacing lead-tainted elements (doors, windows, cabinets) is a 
sensible and cost-efficient remedy, experts say.

 When a Hollywood special-effects job lured Jim Mini from New York, the biggest 
decision facing Mini, his wife and two children was where to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a process of elimination," said Mini, whose family finally ended up 
choosing Thousand Oaks, a city of 105,000 on the eastern edge of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 During the search, the Minis considered, and decided against, Orange County 
(too crowded), Van Nuys (too polluted), Woodland Hills and Calabasas (too hot). 
</P>
<P>
 When they moved to Thousand Oaks, the Minis found they had moved to a place 
where "the family comes first," Mini said. "You can't go more than a half-mile 
without seeing a community park. You see lots of mothers and fathers playing 
with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the good news. But, when the family was ready to purchase a home, 
they got what Mini called "sticker shock." Their 2,200-square-foot home in Hyde 
Park, 75 miles north of New York City, sold for $160,000. But their 
2,800-square-foot home in Thousand Oaks cost them $298,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mortgage is twice what it was in New York," Mini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news/bad news aspects of Thousand Oaks are familiar to Wally Malesh, 
a realtor with Coldwell Banker Town & Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Malesh is happy about the highly rated public schools, where his own two 
children have been educated. The Ohio native is excited about youth soccer, 
youth football, the "strong sense of family." And he's aware of the cost of it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Thousand Oaks) tends to be a little bit on the pricey side," Malesh 
admitted. "It's not necessarily the most affordable community to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recent figures show the median listed price for a home in the area to be 
$279,000, with a median selling price of $264,000. Starting at about $85,000, 
you can get a modest two-bedroom, one-bath condo in Thousand Oaks. 
Single-family homes start about $150,000 and go all the way up to the 
multimillion-dollar range. 
</P>
<P>
 And as they have elsewhere in the Southland, home prices in Thousand Oaks have 
fallen over the last few years. But that doesn't worry Gene Maiden. He bought 
his home 21 years ago for $40,000 (which, he said, "seemed like a lot at the 
time") and has seen its value soar to $250,000, and then slide downward quite a 
ways. But so what, he figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it goes down to $10, it doesn't make any difference," Maiden said. "I 
don't have any plans to go any place." 
</P>
<P>
 While neighbors driving by Maiden's 2,000-square-foot, single-story ranch may 
not know it, the inside of the home has been transformed, with a marble entry 
hall, a couple of Greek columns and a new fireplace with a carved wood mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 What Maiden, an antique print dealer and a bachelor, likes about the area is 
the rural feeling, the proximity to entertainment in Los Angeles and the ocean 
breezes that swoosh through from the Santa Monica Mountains every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 That Maiden is still satisfied with Thousand Oaks is significant, considering 
he has seen the population increase from 15,000 when he first came to town 
almost 30 years ago, to more than 100,000 today. "It's still a very pleasant 
place to live," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have also noticed how pleasant Thousand Oaks is. A recent survey by 
Zero Population Growth named Thousand Oaks one of the best places in Southern 
California for children, second only to Huntington Beach. And the city 
consistently places at or near the top of the list of the country's safest 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sgt. Ray Nagel of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the 
area's low crime rate is because of two factors: 1 -- strong policing, and 2 -- 
support of the community. "There's no way we can do it on our own," Nagel said, 
citing support by merchants, the city council, Neighborhood Watch groups and 
the Crime Stoppers program. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, though the area is safer than most, "We are not immune to gang 
activity," Nagel said. Indeed, the community was shook up when a gang-related 
shooting last year left three local teen-agers wounded and one dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to most accounts, these problems are new and not yet 
overwhelming. Even though it's only 25 miles from one of the largest 
metropolitan centers in the world, Thousand Oaks still feels calm and safe. 
(The city suffered only "minimal damage" in the Northridge earthquake, realtor 
Malesh said. Some 1,200 homes were inspected by the city; only 10 needed 
repairs to restore them to habitability.) 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit for Thousand Oaks evolution as a pleasant place to live 
goes to the Janss family, which developed about 20% of the land in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Janss Corp.'s idea in the late 1950s -- when the land that would become 
Thousand Oaks was mostly large ranches -- was to create a "total community" on 
its 10,000 acres of ranch land. By 1961, the area had a population of 17,000 
and two shopping centers, an industrial park, schools, churches and a four-year 
liberal arts college, California Lutheran University. The walled neighborhoods 
were built around parks and elementary schools. Since the City of Thousand Oaks 
was incorporated in 1964, the concept of planned development has remained 
strong.  
</P>
<P>
 All this has been fine for Walt Schaedle, who moved his family to Thousand 
Oaks in 1963 from Van Nuys, when a doctor thought it might be smog that was 
causing the hay fever and asthma that brought Schaedle's wife and daughter so 
much misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Thousand Oaks) was pretty smog free," Schaedle said of those days. "You 
could probably count the number of smoggy days in a year on one hand." 
</P>
<P>
 After Schaedle's children grew up and his wife died, he remarried, sold the 
family home and moved to a townhouse in nearby Westlake Village. There, he 
enjoys his electric boat, catch-and-release bass fishing, the soft green of the 
weeping willows and watching someone else cut the lawns. At one time an 
engineer, Schaedle now owns a courier company in Thousand Oaks and has served 
as chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and as president of the historical 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a lot out of the community," Schaedle said. "I decided to give a 
little back." 
</P>
<P>
 While Schaedle is pleased with Thousand Oaks' rural feeling, he also favors 
what he calls "good, orderly development," especially to perk up the business 
climate. The area has lost some big employers in the last few years, including 
Northrop, which moved out and took with it 1,200 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Big employers still in the area include Jafra, GTE Systems, Blue Cross and 
Baxter Pharmaceutical. Another Thousand Oaks pharmaceutical company, Amgen 
Inc., recently announced it expects to add 1,000 jobs during 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a job that brought Bob Hammer and his family West from Kansas City in 
1985. To be sure, the job with First Interstate Bank was enticing, but it was 
not the main impetus for the move. "We accepted the position largely because of 
Thousand Oaks," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's main desires were for a safe community and good schools. "And, in 
fact, we were right about that," said Hammer, whose oldest daughter is 
attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and whose youngest daughter is finishing up 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hammer's opinion, the city's commitment to its rural flavor goes a bit far. 
"Frankly I think we could open up a little more," he said. "I'm concerned with 
creating jobs. There are a lot of people here who are not doing well, who are 
laid off from aerospace jobs, who'll never work in that industry again." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the laid-off workers could open small businesses and help build the 
economy, Hammer believes, if the city officials would be a bit more helpful. 
And officials are becoming more so, he said. "They're starting to listen to 
small-business people now, because that's where the jobs come from." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he now works as an international banking consultant and could live 
anywhere, Hammer has no plans to leave Thousand Oaks. "We happen to like where 
we're at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the exact sentiment of Maiden, who travels the globe looking for 
antique prints. "I can't think of anywhere else in the world I'd rather be," he 
said. At a Glance

RENT WATCH: IS EXTRA 'NON-REFUNDABLE' DEPOSIT LEGAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times; This column is prepared by Project Sentinel, a rental 
housing mediation service in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My landlady finally agreed to my request to remove the wall-to-wall 
carpet and uncover the beautiful hardwood floor in my apartment. In return, she 
asked for a non-refundable deposit of $100, in addition to the deposit I paid 
when I moved in. She wants this extra money to cover what she calls "inevitable 
scratches and other damages to the floor." Since this money was not included in 
our original agreement, does she have the right to charge me this fee? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: A security deposit may be increased during a month-to-month tenancy, 
provided that a 30-day notice is given or that there is a mutual agreement and 
provided that the total amount does not exceed two months of rent at the 
current rate. However, according to California Civil Code, Section 1950.5, no 
part of the deposit can be considered as non-refundable. Landlords are 
permitted to deduct money from a security deposit at the end of a tenancy only 
for the following reasons: damages caused by tenants that are beyond normal 
wear and tear, unpaid rent and necessary cleaning. If none of these conditions 
applies, the tenant is entitled to a full refund of all money on deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 This may become an issue only when you move out and the landlady must deal 
with the refund of the deposit. If you do scratch or damage the floors, she's 
entitled to charge you for the damages. If not, you will be entitled to a full 
refund, including the additional $100 added to your deposit. Tenants Fear 
Having Disabled Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have decided to rent an apartment in my complex to three people with 
mental disabilities. The neighbors object to these new tenants because they 
fear for their own safety. I know the law states that I cannot discriminate 
against people with disabilities, but I am afraid I am going to lose good, 
longtime tenants if I ignore their complaints. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The established tenants in your building who complain about the possibility 
of having disabled neighbors represent a part of the NIMBY (Not in My Back 
Yard) Syndrome. These individuals believe that the neighborhood, or in this 
case, the apartment complex, will decline in respectability and take on an 
element of danger if people with mental disabilities move in. You may need to 
remind your established tenants that, as an owner, you are obligated to uphold 
state and federal law by renting to a diverse population of qualified renters, 
and that you are correct in welcoming these new tenants. It may help all 
involved to realize that, although people initially express concern, they 
usually adjust to the new circumstances after they have had a chance to know 
their new neighbors. Some Suggestions for Apartment Sharing 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Although I prefer to live alone, I now need to get a roommate to help pay 
the rent. Do you have any suggestions about sharing an apartment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, you need to get your landlord's approval, preferably in writing. If 
having a roommate is acceptable, your landlord may want to add the new person 
to your current rental agreement as an additional occupant or to create a new 
agreement naming both of you as tenants. Your landlord may also give you the 
option to sublet the apartment and assume all the responsibilities of a 
landlord for your new roommate. This means you and your roommate will have a 
separate rental agreement, your roommate will pay you rent, and you will pay 
the full monthly rent to the landlord. If you become your roommate's landlord, 
you have certain responsibilities including providing proper notices for all 
rental agreement changes and respecting your roommate's right to privacy. Be 
sure to do a credit check and collect a security deposit, even if the person is 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you are a landlord and tenant, or just roommates, it is important to 
lay down some basic ground rules. Establish a clear understanding about sharing 
food and utility expenses, overnight guests, parking, laundry, housecleaning 
rules and most importantly, agree in advance about which of you will move out 
if the agreement is not successful. These agreements should be in writing for 
everyone's protection and will establish a business-like foundation for your 
new relationship. Diverse Tenants Are a Challenge to Manage 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tenants in the complex I manage come from all over the world. As a result, 
I have had to try to resolve misunderstandings over everything from cooking 
odors and child-rearing practices to the appropriateness of performing various 
rituals on site. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I really enjoy working with such a diverse group of people, sometimes 
I feel that it was easier to be a manager when my tenants were more alike. I 
also worry that someone may accuse me of discrimination if I am not absolutely 
fair to everyone. Do you have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It sounds as if you are trying your best to be a fair and thoughtful 
manager. Continue to maintain your neutrality and encourage your tenants to 
identify why it is that other tenants' lifestyles or cultural practices annoy 
or inconvenience them so that they may begin to work toward some resolution of 
specific problems instead of complaining about "differences" in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation and compromise are necessary ingredients in any community and you 
as a manager can be responsible for only part of this process. You have to deal 
with noise and parking complaints and other problems affecting the well being 
of the complex and its residents, but some of the issues you describe might 
well be referred to a community mediation or dispute resolution service. 
Encourage your tenants to use these services when they are unable to resolve a 
"neighbor to neighbor" problem for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For more complete information about good management practices as they 
specifically relate to discrimination in housing, contact your local fair 
housing agency.

REMODELER'S DIARY: ONE PROJECT LEADS TO NEXT . . . TO A HOT TUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN DELANY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; When not hot-tubbing or free-lance 
writing, Delany, a resident of Pismo Beach, has another life as a member of the 
San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My odyssey to a hot tub began the day after the house officially became mine. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day I had a 40-foot Modesto ash removed from outside the dining room. 
Growing within 10 feet of the house, branches brushed over the roof. It was a 
brittle tree and large branches had broken during heavy winds. The roots were 
lifting the paving near the house, causing rainwater to drain toward the house 
rather than away. A messy tree, leaves dropped all year. It was too close to 
the house even for a good tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that tree, the house became much brighter. Other plants in the yard 
began to grow rapidly without the competition of such a large tree. I noticed 
that the tree branches had rubbed away some of the roof shingles. It was an old 
roof, so I figured replacing it soon would be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first bought that house in 1970, a 10-by-12-foot enclosed patio 
adjoined the master bedroom. It was a miserable room, built of aluminum with 
thin insulation. It was cold in the winter, hot in the summer and noisy when it 
rained. I never liked that room. It was as dismal as my marriage that had just 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A new room and a new roof seemed like projects that should be done together. I 
decided to replace the room with a "stick-built" room that would actually be 
useful and enhance the house and my life. I designed a room with insulation, 
good light for reading and sewing, enough electrical outlets for my computer, 
TV and VCR and other electrical gadgets, storage and a work surface built-in 
and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be a special place to display a stained-glass window I had built 
several years ago. Elegant French doors opened to the outside. It would be a 
cozy, convenient and comfortable room for working and relaxing. It would be on 
the same footprint as the old room. 
</P>
<P>
 I drew plans for my room and took them to the Building Department in Pismo 
Beach, where I live, for a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 My two teen-age children, a few friends and I embarked on actually building 
the room. With only a few minor glitches, the room was completed in about six 
weeks. Roofers replaced the roof. After painting the exterior of the new room, 
we decided to paint the entire house to improve its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new room converted my originally L-shaped house into a U-shaped house, 
enclosing an ideal spot for a protected patio. The fourth side was a fence with 
rapidly growing citrus trees and a windowless wall on my neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a large cement patio built, and, sheltered from the wind and peering 
eyes, it soon became an entertainment center, a place for outdoor eating, 
reading and relaxing and a private place for sunbathing. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with most home improvement projects, one thing led to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Who doesn't enjoy a hot tub, a good soak? I certainly do, but a hot tub was 
way beyond my means, and I didn't want my patio monopolized by all that 
paraphernalia. The bath tub inside the house wasn't a good substitute either, 
because it didn't hold enough water for an adult to comfortably submerge. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at several old tubs with lion claw feet. Maybe I could get one of 
those and put it somewhere in my yard, perhaps under the trees elsewhere in the 
yard. Outdoors there would be no problem with overflowing water. Privacy would 
be a problem, and I couldn't find a small water heater. I decided against an 
outdoor porcelain tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Time passed. My children graduated from college, found jobs and moved away. 
</P>
<P>
 While shopping for supplies for my drip-irrigation system at the local farm 
supply store, I saw immediately that my problem was solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed in their parking lot were black plastic Rubbermaid watering troughs 
in assorted sizes. They are sturdy, smooth and lightweight. The sides slope 
gracefully, just like on the antique, free-standing tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a mere $69 plus tax I bought one of the smaller models, wedged it into the 
back of my Dodge Colt hatchback and drove it home. 
</P>
<P>
 I HAD MY TUB! 
</P>
<P>
 My tub holds 100 gallons of water if I fill it to capacity, which, of course, 
I don't. The bottom is long enough that I don't have to bend my legs when I sit 
in it. The sides are 25 inches high or shoulder height for those sitting 
inside. My tub can be easily moved into the garage when I'm not using it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot water is no problem. A plumber installed a hot-and-cold laundry faucet 
with a hose bib on the outside of the house. I simply attach a garden hose to 
the faucet to fill my tub. A drain hole near the bottom of my tub facilitates 
draining the water into the garden. Bubble bath doesn't seem to bother the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evenings when I'm soaking in my tub, gazing at the stars in the clear 
California sky, I marvel at how far I've come these last few years.

LAW TAKES AIM AT PREVENTING LEAD-PAINT HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dangers of lead poisoning, especially to young children, have long been 
documented. Until now, however, most prevention efforts have been haphazard or 
ineffective at lowering the number of poisoned children. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new federal law adopted in the fall of 1992 is changing the strategies 
for dealing with the lead problem nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, or Title X as 
it's called, will touch just about everyone and is considered the most 
comprehensive lead poisoning prevention legislation in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Title X imposes its requirements on federally owned, insured and assisted 
housing. But its far-reaching requirements will create a much-needed 
infrastructure for battling the lead-based paint hazards that will affect 
private property owners as well. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most noticeable aspects of the law is its preventive approach to 
the lead problem. Most policies regulating lead hazards in housing require a 
child to become sick before action is taken. Title X's focus is to find and fix 
the hazard before a child becomes ill. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Title X also takes into account the impracticalities of 
targeting all lead-based paint for removal, as it exists in much of the 
nation's residential housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the U.S. housing stock has lead paint," said Don Ryan, executive 
director of the non-profit Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning in 
Washington. "If you say you don't want lead paint in there, half of us are 
going to be living in tents." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, total elimination of lead-based paint hazards can be extremely 
costly and financially debilitating for property owners. As a result, many 
orders for cleanup in communities with strict lead policies have backfired, as 
landlords and other property owners who are unable to finance the work were 
forced to abandon the property. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage more lead clean-up, Title X shifts the focus from total abatement 
to "lead hazard reduction," which includes interim measures as well as more 
thorough abatement of six specific lead-based-paint hazards defined in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Title X changed the ballgame on what will have to be abated," said Ron 
Morony, deputy director of the Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and 
Poisoning Prevention for the department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
"One of its major thrusts is that it's going to get together a good, reliable 
infrastructure. Right now, in L.A., if have a poisoned child it's not clear how 
you can find a reliable contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the case in most communities throughout the United States. Yet, 
nationwide, 57 million privately owned homes and apartments built before 1980 
contain lead paint, according to a 1990 HUD study. Of those, HUD officials say, 
3.8 million are considered a "priority hazard" because young children live in 
them and because they contain lead paint that's peeling or deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California's mandatory disclosure law, a seller aware that lead paint 
exists in a home, must disclose that information. But a Title X provision that 
takes effect in October, 1995, will take that several steps further. That 
provision will require that prospective buyers or tenants of a pre-1978 housing 
unit receive a warning and a pamphlet on lead hazards as well as a disclosure. 
Buyers will have 10 days to arrange for a risk assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Rochlin, owner of Venice-based Lead Tech, a lead paint inspection and 
abatement firm said even now, before the more stringent disclosure and warning 
requirements, lead paint has become a priority to some buyers who are aware of 
the 1995 requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've literally knocked two homes out of escrow because of lead," he said. 
"You can buy a home with lead in it, but you are going to be ultimately 
responsible for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month the Environmental Protection Agency is required to create a "model 
state program" so states can develop their own lead-based paint programs that 
will include contractor training, certification and licensing programs based on 
national standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson signed legislation in October, 1993, that will put California in 
compliance with Title X and bring about the development of a viable lead 
abatement industry here, so those saddled with lead-burdened houses and 
apartments in the future will be able to find qualified contractors to do the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, property owners are on their own. "It's a scary situation right 
now because we don't have regulations," said Debra Carlton, vice president of 
research for the 23,000-member California Apartment Assn. "Lead paint for our 
1994 agenda is at the top of the list."

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: EFFICIENT OUTDOOR SECURITY LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: There were several break-ins in my neighborhood. I want to install 
outdoor security lights, but they are so expensive to operate. Are there any 
bright lights that don't use a lot of electricity? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Lighting the exterior of your house, especially the back yard, is one 
of the best methods to deter a thief. There are new bright super-efficient 
outdoor lights (high intensity discharge -- HID) that you can install yourself. 
They use only a couple of cents worth of electricity per night. 
</P>
<P>
 High-pressure sodium lights are the most efficient HID light commonly used for 
homes. One small 35-watt high-pressure sodium floodlight is brighter than five 
standard 40-watt bulbs combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these fixtures and bulbs are more expensive initially, they quickly 
pay back their higher cost in lower electric bills. The bulbs last 20,000 hours 
as compared to less than a 1,000 hours for standard floodlights, so there is 
savings in bulb replacement costs too. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many new HID light styles designed for home use. These fixtures are 
now smaller and more attractive. You can buy antique-designer light posts, 
contemporary bollard lights for use near a deck or pool, wall floodlights, 
in-ground lights, etc., many with high-pressure sodium bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are going to illuminate a large area and are not concerned about the 
light's color rendition quality, low-pressure sodium bulbs use even less 
electricity. Generally, you will only find these at commercial electrical 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common HID floodlights sold at home centers are mercury vapor. These 
are twice as efficient as standard floodlights, but still much less efficient 
than high-pressure sodium lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Motion-sensing lights are one of the best crime deterrents and use the least 
amount of electricity. They can sense motion as far away as 60 feet and you can 
adjust the on-time from one minute to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A floodlight's switching on usually scares a thief away. Some models have an 
interior module into which you can plug lamps. When the motion-sensing 
floodlight comes on, it also switches on the interior lamps. Even when you are 
away at night, it appears that someone inside switched on the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 In my own home, I use solar-powered motion-sensing floodlights. These need no 
wiring, so they are ideal for back yard or storage shed locations. With 
powerful internal batteries, they will switch on 120 times on just one day's 
charge from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 891 listing 17 manufacturers of 
high-efficiency outdoor security and decorative lights, styles, bulb types, 
motion-sensing 110-volt and solar floodlights, and a cost-to-operate chart. 
Please include $2 handling fee -- cash or check -- to James Dulley, Los Angeles 
Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Itchy Insulation May Be 
Thing of the Past 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to add insulation batts to my attic. Fiberglass is easy to use, but 
it irritates my skin. What other insulation options are there? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Fiberglass insulation batts can be itchy if you do not dress properly. You 
should wear heavy coveralls and gloves. Put rubber bands around the wrist area 
of the coveralls over the gloves to seal the arms as well as possible. Wear a 
breathing face mask too. 
</P>
<P>
 Blown-in rock wool or cellulose is another effective insulation option. If you 
can wait several months, a Canadian company is developing a non-itchy 
fiberglass-like batt insulation made from recycled plastic bottles. How to Help 
Reduce the Greenhouse Effect 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to help reduce the greenhouse effect. About how much carbon dioxide 
(greenhouse gas) is produced per person each year? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The majority of the carbon dioxide gas (CO2) produced is from the burning 
of fossil fuels to produce energy. On average more than 40,000 pounds of CO2 is 
released into the air per year for each U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 To run a typical average-efficiency refrigerator for one year, a coal-fired 
power plant produces more than 2,000 pounds of CO2. Switching to a new 
high-efficiency refrigerator can reduce this amount by about 600 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A general rule of thumb is that for each kilowatt-hour of electricity saved, 
about 1.5 to 2 pounds of CO2 is eliminated from entering the atmosphere. Extra 
Nails, Fasteners Harm Insulation Value 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I build an addition on to my home, I plan to use rigid foam insulated 
sheathing on the outside of the wall studs. Will it harm the efficiency to use 
more nails and fasteners for a stronger wall? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Adding more nails and metal fasteners than recommended by the manufacturer 
does not produce a better wall. In fact, it decreases the effectiveness of the 
rigid foam insulation. Tests show that using just the recommended number of 
nails and fasteners (on eight-inch centers) reduces the insulation value by 
20%.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Ask your nursery professional for the proper spray control for aphids, which 
will soon be opening their 1994 season on your rose growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a notion to move any azaleas or camellias you have, now is the 
time to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * To get the most from your spring and summer annuals and perennials, be sure 
to prepare the oil well by adding soil amendments and working the soil to 
eliminate large clumps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fibrous begonias, cinerarias and impatiens will brighten up the shade 
garden.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SIERRA FOOTHILLS; MINING GOLD COUNTRY; FOLLOWING THE GHOSTS OF 
MINERS AND CARD SHARKS THROUGH COLUMBIA, JACKSON, SUTTER CREEK AND MURPHYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Malnic is a Times Metro reporter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of those cool, damp weekends -- the kind even we Southern 
Californians must occasionally endure at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the kind of weekend for a trip to the beach, or even to the mountains, 
where constant snow flurries can ruin a few days of skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Gold Rush country -- where hours can be spent poking around an 
intriguing assortment of cluttered antique shops, musty used book stores, funky 
museums, tempting candy boutiques, vineyard wine-tasting rooms and even an old 
iron foundry -- the weather is almost irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a chance to get away -- eat a few good meals, hunt for some 
bargains, see a couple of unusual sights and learn a little about one of the 
most colorful periods in California's brief history -- my wife, Martha, and I 
built a recent weekend around a two-night stay at the City Hotel in the 
restored mining town of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1850s, Columbia -- situated in the Sierra foothills about 130 miles 
east of San Francisco -- was the sort of place where boozy gold miners brawled, 
gimlet-eyed card sharks fleeced naive newcomers and legal disputes were 
resolved with blasts of gunfire. The saloons and gambling dens outnumbered the 
churches 159 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gold played out, the town followed suit, and by World War II, 
Columbia was a classic ghost town. But thanks to the lack of 20th-Century 
development -- and the fact that many of the original buildings were built of 
enduring brick -- the core of the town looked much as it had in the 1800s. In 
1945, the state purchased downtown Columbia and turned it into a park -- 
dusting it off, cleaning it up and turning it into a sanitized version of its 
past. It looks like a movie set, and it has been used in such film classics as 
"High Noon" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 In the shops and cafes that line the main street, the clerks and waitresses 
wear period dress. The firehouse is still home to two authentic, hand-drawn 
fire engines. The museums are crammed with period tools, documents and 
household implements. And one of the old bars is still operating -- the What 
Cheer Saloon at the original City Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martha and I were drawn to the hotel -- built to its present configuration in 
1857 -- because it was billed as authentic. And to an amazing degree, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 rooms are the same slab-sided, high-ceiling cubicles they were 100 
years ago. The period furnishings are spare -- our room held a chest of 
drawers, a straight-backed chair and two beds, both with solid foot and 
headboards that provide a tight fit for anyone over six feet. There are a few 
concessions to modernity -- the closet now contains a washbowl and toilet, and 
the kerosene lamps have been wired for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect down comforters, video movies, fluffy towels and room service at 
the City Hotel. The bedding and towels are simple but adequate, and if you want 
entertainment, read a book or strike up a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 While it reminded me of the Army, schlepping down the hall to one of the 
communal shower rooms was better than it sounds. This time there was more hot 
water, a touch of privacy and plenty of soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha enjoyed reading in the upstairs sitting room, where card games sprang 
up around turn-of-the-century tables and a decanter of free sherry was provided 
before dinner. And the hotel dining room's dinners -- elegant prix fixe , 
four-course meals that included entrees of seafood, duck, lamb and beef -- were 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 After a cozy night and a good continental breakfast that came with the room, 
we set out on the one full day of sightseeing that our three-day weekend 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The misty drizzle had deterred the busloads of schoolchildren and tourists 
that often clog Columbia, especially in the summertime, and we had the main 
drag pretty much to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent about an hour checking out the firehouse, museums and the old Wells 
Fargo office, and I stopped off for goodies at the Columbia Candy Kitchen, 
where Jennifer McMahon -- part of the fourth generation of her family to live 
in the town -- was all decked out in a frilly, 19th-Century gown. "Actually, we 
can wear almost anything that's old-fashioned," she confided as her ancient 
cash register rang up the tab with a satisfying clang. "But that means no 
tennis shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later we were heading north on California 49 -- the 300-mile route 
reconfigured years ago to wind through most of the state's historic Gold Rush 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
 There are dozens to choose from -- communities like Mariposa, with its 
picturesque courthouse, built in 1854, that is the oldest in the state; Sonora, 
probably the largest and most successful of the Mother Lode mining towns; 
Angels Camp, which provided the inspiration for Mark Twain's story about the 
jumping frog, and San Andreas, source of much of the copper used by the Union 
Army during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 But for us, time was short, so we made a bee line for Jackson, the sort of 
place that warms Martha's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is home to more than a dozen shops crammed with dusty books and 
assorted antiques. Some of the stores offer handsome heirlooms with prices to 
match. Most of them offer the kind of battered, rusty, mismatched stuff you 
find at garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the weather, Jackson's streets were crowded that day with eager 
shoppers. Martha and I adopted our usual pose in such circumstances, each 
curling up in a quiet corner beside a bookshelf, browsing happily as the rain 
pounded down. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quick lunch at a roadside hamburger stand in nearby Drytown, we 
doubled back to Sutter Creek, the sort of place that warms my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter Creek is where you find the Knight Foundry, a magnificent collection of 
massive, aging machinery that is listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. Still in business after more than 120 years, the foundry is where they 
cast, hammered and machined the Gargantuan equipment used to extract ore from 
the Sierra during the dwindling days of the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a self-guided tour, but if things are quiet you can get furnace tender 
Russell Johnson -- a bearded, overalled mountain of a man -- to lead you 
through the throbbing clutter of cranes, drill presses, lathes and hydraulic 
presses. A Rube Goldberg collection of belts, drive shafts, pulleys and gears 
connects them all to the Knight water wheel that provides the power. The really 
spectacular shows are put on every two weeks or so, when Johnson pours flaming 
streams of incandescent molten iron from the coke furnace into molds scattered 
about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha, who read in the car while I hung out with Johnson, dozed contentedly 
as I made the 45-minute drive through the lush highland wine country to the 
town of Murphys. Like a lot of the Gold Rush towns, Murphys has a pleasant main 
street lined with handsome trees and an attractive assortment of tourist shops, 
19th-Century buildings and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons never made clear, it's also the headquarters for an irreverent, 
offbeat group called E. Clampus Vitus. The organization, founded during the 
Gold Rush as a spoof of the solemn fraternal orders of the day, has erected a 
commemorative slab of bas relief portraits known collectively as the Wall of 
Comparative Innovations. The criteria for inclusion are not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those honored are people you've probably heard of -- actress Lola 
Montez, author Bret Harte, pathfinder Jedediah Smith and wagon-maker John 
Studebaker. And there are some you probably haven't -- a woman named Julia C. 
Bulette and a man named Oliver Sandad.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Bulette, the citation says simply: "Born in London. Gentle companion to the 
miner. Brutally strangled in bed, 1867." Of Sandad it says: "Struck it rich, 
lost it all in a crap game. . . . Later became a dirt farmer in the wilds near 
Milpitas. He was happy no end and not the least bit lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 After another fine dinner at the hotel, a good night's rest and an early rise, 
we headed home. It would be nice to say that getting there was half the fun, 
but it wasn't. The drive from Los Angeles to Columbia and back is about 350 
miles each way, almost all of it a mindless trek along featureless stretches of 
Interstate 5 and U.S. 99.  
</P>
<P>
 But there was a bright side. We rented a car, which saved wear and tear on the 
family sedan and provided us with a clean, spacious vehicle that was someone 
else's problem. Weekend rates are good -- Enterprise rentals offers a Ford 
Taurus for about $75 with unlimited mileage. 
</P>
<P>
 We cheated and upgraded to an Infiniti. It cost more than twice as much, but 
the leather seats smelled good and Ravel on the CD player made the Grapevine 
glide by like the Gran Corniche. Budget for Two 
</P>
<P>
 City Hotel, two nights: $ 172.80

MAE PRELOW, 99, MOTHER TO HUNDREDS, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mae Dedrick Prelow, who for half a century cared for hundreds of children as a 
foster mother and hospital volunteer in South-Central, died March 12, less than 
two months before her 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Prelow, who lived in Carson, died of heart failure during surgery for 
cardiac problems, said her daughter-in-law, Leona Prelow of Carson. A funeral 
and musical tribute were held March 19 at New Hope Baptist Church in 
South-Central, where Mrs. Prelow had organized the children's choir and 
directed it for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Mrs. Prelow praised her talents in dealing with children. For 
20 years, she ran a South-Central foster home where she cared for more than 70 
youngsters. After closing the home in the early 1970s, she turned her attention 
to the infants at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, where 
she volunteered as a foster grandparent until 1991. Mrs. Prelow spent 20 hours 
a week at the hospital caring for infants, especially the premature and 
high-risk babies in the special-care nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a charisma about her. Little kids just kind of look up to her," New 
Hope Baptist Pastor James S. McKnight said last April, as her family prepared a 
99th-birthday celebration. On that occasion, he recalled that a choir reunion 
to honor Mrs. Prelow in the mid-1980s drew a crowd of 200 that overflowed the 
choir loft. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just mention the name of Mae Prelow, and they come back," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Prelow was born in 1894 in Texas and moved in 1922 to Los Angeles, where 
she married and had one son. After her husband, a sanitation worker, died in 
the 1930s, she supported herself by operating the foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 She cared for six or seven children at a time, from infants to school-age 
children. Some were in foster care because their parents had abandoned them; 
others were born into families with drug or alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 interview with The Times, Mrs. Prelow was modest about her work with 
children. "It did the children good, and made me happy to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At her funeral, a family friend spotted an unidentified young man seated in a 
pew, weeping. He explained that Mrs. Prelow had raised him and taken him to New 
Hope Baptist many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Everything they're saying about Mae Prelow is correct,' " Leona 
Prelow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Prelow is survived by her daughter-in-law; her son, Clifford Prelow; two 
grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Memorial contributions can be made 
to the Mae Prelow Children's Choir at New Hope Baptist Church or the King/Drew 
Medical Center.

 Developers of the Union Station and Terminal Annex Post Office redevelopment 
projects have produced a walking tour map to acquaint commuters and tourists to 
the surrounding historic neighborhoods of Olvera Street, Chinatown and Little 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The free "Alameda North/World Walk L.A." map guides visitors from Union 
Station through the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Catellus Development Corp., owner and developer of the 50-acre Union Station 
property, and the Ratkovich Villanueva Partnership, developers of the U.S. 
Postal Service's 18-acre Terminal Annex property, produced the map with input 
from community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Olvera Street merchant Peter Martinez said he was pleased with the way the map 
links the neighboring but diverse communities. He and his wife, Emily, said 
they hope the map will persuade commuters to return to Downtown on weekends for 
shopping, dining and cultural events. The map is available at Union Station, 
the U.S. Postal Service's Terminal Annex site, the Olvera Street Visitor's 
Center, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Japanese American Cultural and 
Community Center and the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rappers, musicians, former professional athletes and recovering drug addicts 
will gather next week for a forum to deliver a message against drug use to 
teen-agers and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap artist Fros-t and the band Positive Alternatives, made up of recovering 
addicts, will provide entertainment at the Teens Against Drugs forum from 2:30 
to 5 p.m. on April 7 at the East Los Angeles Neighborhood Service Center, 133 
N. Sunol Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to appear are former Minnesota Twins player Darryl Jackson and 
former lightweight boxing champion Mando Ramos, whose career was cut short when 
he became addicted to alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He now runs 
Boxers Against Alcohol & Drugs, a teen program in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The day will include a demonstration by U.S. Customs Service dogs trained to 
sniff out drugs in packages, and information from several community 
organizations that offer help for troubled families. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum was planned as a result of surveys of 200 community organizations 
that identified drug abuse as the foremost problem in the county, said 
organizer Fernando Bravo, a senior health educator at the Edward R. Roybal 
Comprehensive Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing is, we thought the parents and the youth have a lot of myths 
about drug use, so hearing it from the experts, the recovering drug addicts, we 
hope they get the facts in such a way that they believe it," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect an audience of 200 to 250. The event was planned by members 
of the East/Northeast Networking Roundtable Health Committee. The committee is 
also holding a photography contest in which youths ages 10 to 17 are asked to 
submit original 8-by-10, black-and-white photos of youths involved in positive 
activities. Deadline for entries is 5 p.m. Wednesday. Prizes will be awarded at 
the Teens Against Drugs forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Submit entries, with an application form signed by a parent or legal guardian, 
to Ernie Avila, Casa de Hermandad, 133 N. Sunol Drive, Los Angeles 90063.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: RAVE FOR FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, three employees of the now-defunct Bistango on La Cienega 
Boulevard plotted to change Angelenos' perception of Latin American food. Tired 
of patrons thinking that Latin food amounted to a plate of beans and rice with 
some meat, Kevin Cooke, Jose Chavez and Ismael Saenz's decided to present the 
foods of Mexico, Central and South America in a French style, with elegant 
presentations and an array of sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, the delightful Sabor (Spanish for "flavor"), opened in Silver Lake 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabor's cuisine, developed by self-trained chef Freddy Saucedo, is a fusion of 
flavors of the American South and Latin America. Many customers begin their 
meal with the Yucatan chicken soup ($4.95), a lime-infused broth with pasilla 
chili, tomato and corn chips, on which floats a grilled breast of chicken and 
fresh avocado. Another tasty opener is coxinha ($5.95), buttermilk-flour puffs 
stuffed with goat cheese and chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are many tempting main courses, I find it hard to resist the 
Southern fried chicken ($10.95), a succulent, crispy-skinned bird. The four 
pieces came with smooth mashed potatoes with buttermilk gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin tamales ($10.95), filled with chicken and sun-dried guajillo chili, are 
topped with spicy sausage and a chipotle chili sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sabor, 2538 Hyperion Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 660-0886. Open Sunday through 
Thursday 5:30 to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. Sabor Too, 
at 3221 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, is also open for lunch.

VOICES: 'I ALWAYS TRIED TO DO RIGHT'; A BUSINESSMAN WHO LOST J AND Y LIQUOR 
MART IN THE RIOTS POINTS TO THE UNFAIRNESS OF PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON 
REOPENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jae Yul Kim, 50, is the president of the Korean American Grocers' Victims 
Assn., a group of business owners who lost their South-Central stores in the 
1992 riots. Of the 174 store owners in the group, only six have reopened their 
businesses. Most have been unable to reopen because of reluctant landlords, 
lack of finances or city restrictions, Kim says. Kim, who emigrated to the 
United States from South Korea 20 years ago, has been in the retail business 
for 17 years. He purchased the J and Y Liquor Mart at 4355 S. Arlington Ave. 
four years ago and wants to rebuild because he does not believe he can find a 
buyer for the property. He says he cannot agree to the conditions the city has 
placed on the reopening of the store, including hiring a security guard and 
prohibiting the sale of single cans of soda or beer. He and his wife have been 
surviving financially with the help of their son and federal emergency aid that 
is to expire shortly. They live in Encino and have three grown children. Kim 
was interviewed by Karen E. Klein.  
</P>
<P>
 I closed early the day of the riots and took my wife home. I came back about 6 
in the evening and they had already broken in the door and they were stealing 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, about 10 o'clock in the morning, I came back and they were still 
looting out of my store. I saw a policeman and asked him, "What can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "Do you have insurance?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said yes and he said, "There's nothing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, they burned my store to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 months, FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) has helped me. 
But my grant runs out next month. I don't know how I'm going to keep my house. 
I'm not sure I can make my payments. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to try and rebuild the store, but the city has put many conditions on 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a small store, and I can't accept that many conditions. For 
instance, if I can't sell single cans, how can I make money? 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like I don't want to go back there. I'm still scared. I was robbed 
twice at gunpoint before the riots. Once a robber fired at me and hit the 
bulletproof glass in the front of my cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Coalition (for Substance Abuse Prevention, a South-Central-based 
organization opposed to the proliferation of liquor stores in the area) doesn't 
want us to come back. They don't want liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm a good guy, I'm a nice guy. I always tried to do right by my 
customers. Only one guy got mad at me once. He asked me to give him credit. But 
I never give credit, so I just said no. He got so mad, he said, "I'm gonna burn 
down your store." But I don't know who really did it. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand what the Community Coalition says. I know they don't want liquor 
stores. But when I bought that store, I didn't ask how many other liquor stores 
were around my store. I got my license, so I didn't care about the other 
stores. What could I do about them? 
</P>
<P>
 I came to America 20 years ago and I have worked hard. That land is mine. When 
I first got that land, I was so happy. Now, am I supposed to throw that land 
away and go someplace else? Maybe I won't be able to make money someplace else. 
The economy is so bad now it's hard to open a business anywhere else. I have a 
loan from the Small Business Administration. If I relocate, I will have to pay 
rent and pay back the SBA loan. I can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I wonder what to do. I talked to a contractor today, but I'm not sure 
what to do. If I go back in, what will the Community Coalition do to me? I'm 
scared. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do give me another chance, I will go back and help the community. I 
want to do that.

VOICES: 'IT REALLY MADE LIFE DIFFICULT'; AREA'S PROBLEMS HAVE EASED SINCE J AND 
Y LIQUOR CLOSED, SAYS A LONGTIME NEIGHBOR WHO WANTS IT TO REMAIN SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shirley Warren, 44, has lived with her husband just around the corner from the 
J and Y Liquor Store for nearly 14 years. The Pacific Bell facilities 
administrator is a member of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment, a federally funded drug and alcohol project. She was 
interviewed by Karen E. Klein.  
</P>
<P>
 I am opposed to the J and Y Liquor Store being reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 It has nothing to do with race, and I have nothing against the owner 
personally. I don't care who wants to put a liquor store around the corner from 
me, I don't want one there. If my sister wanted to put one there, I'd petition 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many other liquor stores in this neighborhood, it's a shame. In a 
half-mile radius of my home I can count four or five stores right off the top 
of my head that are still open. In some cases, there are liquor stores on every 
corner or right across the street from each other. There are just too many in 
our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous things that would benefit the community that could be 
opened there. Maybe even a self-storage warehouse where you could store 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not frequent the store when it was open, but there were people hanging 
out in the parking lot all day and all night, loitering, drinking, cussing and 
using the telephone there for their drug business. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time you have people around a parking lot, that in itself is unsafe. One 
time, a lady went into the liquor store to purchase an item and when she came 
out, her car had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 People who catch the bus had to walk right past that parking lot every day and 
put up with verbal abuse from the punks who hung around there. They made 
comments to the women and children. There are churches nearby, and the pastors 
and churchgoers had to hear all that. It's not good for the children to hear 
the language that went on there. 
</P>
<P>
 This still is a residential area, even though Arlington may be considered a 
main street. We can't all pick up and move just because the liquor store is 
there, but it really made life difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 My house is off an alley that went behind the liquor store, and all the 
vagrants that hung out at the liquor store would come down the alley and past 
our back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 We had fires in the alley and vagrants who drank outside the liquor store and 
then went into the alley to relieve themselves. The liquor store caused all 
kinds of problems. Now that it is gone, some of the problems have died down. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when they started to talk about the liquor store coming back, it 
began to really stress me out, every time I thought about it coming back and 
all the problems it was going to bring. 
</P>
<P>
 I've gotten more involved since then. I voiced my opinion starting last year 
and went down to City Hall to a couple of hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 My neighbors and lots of other people in the neighborhood feel the same way I 
do. It has felt very much safer since that store has been gone. You don't even 
hear the shooting and stuff as we used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if the owner had tried to use a security guard there, maybe that would 
have helped some. There is a neighborhood grocery store about half a block 
away, and they have a guard and a parking lot that is for customers only. They 
don't have very many problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If a person needs to buy alcohol, there are a lot of other places they can go. 
I don't see any reason that liquor store should reopen.

<P>
 High school baseball fans Wednesday were treated to an old-fashioned 
shoot-out, Eastern League style: low score, high drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell pitcher Johnny Moreno and South Gate's Alonso Lopez retired batter after 
batter in a game that was decided by one run. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dust from the mound settled, Lopez was left standing and South Gate 
had earned a 1-0 win in its league opener at Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in control of my pitches today," said Lopez, who retired 21 of the 23 
batters he faced and eight of the first nine. He struck out three and didn't 
allow a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alonso was just his normal self today," South Gate Coach Mike Ryan said. "He 
throws strikes and doesn't get himself into trouble by walking batters." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez (1-1), who gave up a single in the third and another in the sixth, did 
not allow a runner past first base in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-2) would get all the scoring it would need in the top of the third 
when Andy Silva drove in outfielder Jorge Zamora on an RBI single to left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno (2-1) was also brilliant, striking out four batters and walking only 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the Rams last season, Lopez has not lost a game (10-0) in 
Southeastern Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters: Alonso Lopez (SG); Johnny Moreno (B). 
</P>
<P>
 WP -- Lopez (1-1); LP -- Moreno (2-1).  
</P>
<P>
 Records: South Gate 4-2; Bell 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola 8, Harvard-Westlake 7 -- The Cubs (3-4-1, 1-2) scored the winning run 
on a one-out sacrifice fly to cap a three-run seventh inning in a Mission 
League game Wednesday at Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters: Carrigan (L); Garson (HW). 
</P>
<P>
 W -- Spielbuehler (1-1). L -- Linde (0-1). HR: L -- Clougherty, Spielbuehler. 
</P>
<P>
 Schurr 8, Bell Gardens 6 -- Schurr scored four unearned runs to defeat Bell 
Gardens in a Almont League game on Tuesday. Starting pitcher Pete Loza (0-3) 
allowed eight runs on six hits, four walks and two hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Arana went three-for-four with three RBI and his older brother Manuel 
Arana had two hits and a RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters: Loza (BG); Meza (S). 
</P>
<P>
 WP -- Meza (2-1); LP -- Loza (0-3).  
</P>
<P>
 2B: BG -- M. Arana, Dominguez. S -- Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Bell Gardens 4-5, 1-1; Schurr 3-4, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln 6, Wilson 4 -- Lincoln shortstop Cesar Castaneda went three-for-four 
with three RBIs in a Northern Conference game Wednesday at Wilson. Castaneda's 
three-run homer in the top of the fifth inning with one out stretched Lincoln's 
lead to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson rallied to cut the deficit to 6-4 in the bottom of the seventh on third 
baseman Marco Meza's two-out single to left field, but Danny Arreda was thrown 
out trying to reach third base to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mule catcher Bruce Beltran had two triples -- each one coming with two outs -- 
but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters:Gerald Lazano (L); Rene Herrera (W). 
</P>
<P>
 WP -- Lazano (2-0) LP -- Herrera (2-1)

DORSEY DOESN'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED; TRACK: DEFENDING CITY CHAMPIONS DON'T LET 
UP AGAINST NARBONNE IN 78-45 WIN. SETTLE LEADS SWEEPS IN 100 AND 200 METERS.

 If Dorsey Coach Ralph Tilley had any fears that his boys' track team would be 
overconfident against Narbonne, those worries were unfounded. The defending 
City champion Dons cruised to a 78-45 victory Wednesday in a Southern Pacific 
Conference meet at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take anybody lightly or worry who we're running against," Tilley 
said. "We just go out and run our best." 
</P>
<P>
 The team took their coach's words to heart, with the Dons (3-0) producing 
several season bests. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Settle led Dorsey sweeps in the 100 and 200 and also joined Jabulani 
Smith-Freeman, Rodrick Brown and Anthony Mabry on the victorious 400 relay, 
which clocked 42.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Settle edged Brown in the 100, both timing seasonal bests 10.7 seconds, with 
Smith-Freeman in third at 10.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Settle, a senior who finished second in the 200 and third in the 100 at last 
year's City championship meet, won the 200 in a season-best 21.6, followed by 
Brown and Che Johnson in 22.6 and 22.7 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Freeman and Johnson finished first and second in the long jump, leaping 
21 feet 5 inches and 21-4. Smith-Freeman also bounded 44-0 1/2 to win the 
triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Wheeler, the City runner-up at 800 meters, won his specialty in 
1:59.1. Wheeler combined with Eric Pierce, Mabry and Devon Dubriel, winner of 
the 400 (52.6) on the 1,600 relay team, which won in 3:28.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabry won the 110 high hurdles in 15.1 and knocked more than two seconds off 
his seasonal-best in the 300 intermediate hurdles to win in 40.3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons also received first- and second-place performances from Keith Friday 
and Cliff Judie in the high jump, each clearing 6-0. Oscar Lopez (43-0) and 
Oscar Lopez (4:51.9) also recorded victories in the shotput and 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Glenn notched victories in the 100 hurdles (16.5), long jump (15-1) and 
high jump (4-8) to help the Dorsey girls escape with a 60-59 victory over 
Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Butler won the 400 and 800 in 59.2 and 2:25.1 for Dorsey (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington boys (3-0) stayed on pace for a showdown Wednesday with Dorsey 
for the Southern Pacific conference title, defeating host Banning, 71-45. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McElroy won the 100 in 10.9, led a General sweep in the 200, clocking 
21.5, and also anchored the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams to victory in 42.8 
and 3:28.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Amar Brisco won the 400 in 51.3 and long jump at 20-8 for Washington. Doniel 
Webster (43-11 3/4) and Jamal Williams (40-5) also won the shotput and triple 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Griffis was all the Washington girls (3-0) needed to defeat Banning, 
71-45. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior won the 100 hurdles (15.1) and 300 hurdles (48.0) and anchored the 
400-meter relay team of Shana Skaggs, Turie McCormick, Kizzy Veazey to victory 
in 52.6 despite a dropped baton. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick won the 100 (13.1) and triple jump (32-3) and Tina Greer leaped 16-3 
in the long jump for Washington. On the Fast Track

 The Loyola High School boys' volleyball team rolled over Torrance Bishop 
Montgomery on Thursday in three quick sets that rarely saw any challenge for 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Loyola, which won the match 15-3, 15-4, 15-6, used the explosive 
hitting of Pat Klein and Steve Donne to devastate the Knights in less than one 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs took advantage of the Knights' poor setting and hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The undefeated Cubs extended their winning-streak to seven and remain atop the 
Mission League with a 5-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Donne led with six kills and made five assists, while Klein, who only played 
the first two games, had five kills. Defensively middle blocker Lee Bennett had 
six stuff blocks and two digs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights held their only lead when Michael Igloi aced his jump serve to 
begin the third game. The Cubs then followed up with a five-point run, mostly 
on Knight errors, including two over-hit spikes and one net violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off of a win last week over Harvard-Westlake, which is ranked No. 2 in 
the nation by USA Today, the Cubs are poised to take the league title. They 
meet Harvard-Westlake again April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the Cubs visit Division II defending champion Simi Valley Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday boys' volleyball matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 3, Huntington Park 1 -- The Eagles (4-0 in conference) bounced back from 
a one-set deficit to defeat host Huntington Park in a Southeastern Conference

kills, Dickie Purcell had 21 and Rudy Flores, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 4, Garfield 1 -- Trailing 11-6 in the fourth set the Roughriders 
(4-0 in conference) edged back to beat host Garfield in four sets, 20-18,

the 10-run rule and recorded their biggest victory of the season in Tuesday's 
Southeastern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my second string playing after three innings," said Garfield Coach 
Robert Dorn. "I was hoping their coach would use the 10-run rule. I hate games 
like this because it does terrible things for softball." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn said Jefferson did not want to stop the game because the Democrats' bus 
had not returned. 
</P>

<P>
 The Spartans were also led by Jose Cisneros, who won the 50 freestyle in 
26.21.

fielded swimmers in the freestyle and the backstroke. 
</P>

50 freestyle, 100 freestyle and 100 backstroke in an Eastern League dual meet 
Monday.

EASTER EGGS; EGGS FROM THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are hundreds of ways to make eggs, but one of the most unusual and 
delicious comes from India, via home cook Rose Nair of Hawthorne. She calls the 
dish "roasted" eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eggs aren't really roasted in the oven like meat. They're hard-boiled, 
peeled, then simmered with a sauce of onion, garlic and red chile. At serving 
time, they're cut in half and topped with a spoonful of the thick, deep-red 
sauce. It's a wonderful way to use up leftover Easter eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In south India, Nair says that the custom is to serve roasted eggs with 
drinks, just as we might serve deviled eggs. This particular recipe comes from 
Nair's mother-in-law, Thankan, who is from the southern Indian state of Kerala. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Indian dishes require a long list of ingredients, this one is 
exceptionally simple, which makes it ideal for entertaining. Nair seasons the 
eggs with hot red chile powder from an Indian market, but the effect is sweet 
rather than spicy. The sweetness comes from the onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nair, who works in the airline industry, was born in Bombay and returns to 
India occasionally. She hasn't forgotten her roots: Her living room is 
decorated Indian-style, with low couches on which she spreads Indian fabrics 
and arranges colorful pillows. It's an ideal setting for her elaborate Indian 
dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
 And her roasted eggs are often part of the menu. Sometimes she sets the eggs 
out buffet-style with other main dishes rather than serving them as appetizers. 
Nestled in the indentations of a deviled egg plate and topped with cilantro, 
they make an attractive side dish. And they're always welcomed by guests who 
eat little or no meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nair says that traditionally in India, cocktail snacks are prepared as they're 
served rather than ahead of time. "You can't let things sit," she says, 
"because they would become soft in the humid climate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though you obviously don't have to worry about eggs losing their crunch, the 
dish should be assembled at the last minute. The eggs can be boiled and the 
sauce cooked in advance, then heated together at serving time. The eggs should 
be served warm, but if they cool off, don't reheat them, and don't be tempted 
to give them a quick zap in the microwave, which could make them rubbery. "We 
don't use microwaves in India," Nair says. "Everything there is so fresh." 
KERALA-STYLE ROASTED EGGS (Mutta Varthada) 6 eggs 1 onion, coarsely chopped 2 
or 3 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon ground dried red chile 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 
cup oil Chopped cilantro Lemon slices, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-boil eggs, peel and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine onion, garlic, ground chile and salt in blender and blend thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large saucepan. Add onion-chile mixture and stir, then turn heat 
to low and cook, stirring often, until mixture turns deep-brown.  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce outside of each egg several times with tip of sharp knife. Add whole 
eggs to onion mixture, cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes. While eggs are still in 
pan, cut each in half lengthwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon onto serving plate, topping each egg half with onion-chile mixture and 
cilantro. If desired, garnish plate with lemon slices. Makes 12 appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each egg half contains about: 123 calories; 130 mg sodium; 106 mg cholesterol; 
12 grams fat; 1 gram carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 0.12 gram fiber.

EASTER EGGS; THE BREAKFAST BRIK  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Dosti is the author of the recently released Mideast & 
Mediterranean Cuisines (Fisher Books: 1993; $9.95, 144 pp). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the many pleasant dining experiences I've had in North Africa, one of the 
most unusual was the dish that French-speaking Tunisians call la breik (or la 
brik ) a l'oeuf . Breik is the Tunisian Arabic pronunciation of the Turkish 
word borek , and l'oeuf the French word for egg. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheet of filo is topped with a whole egg or two, plus onion, cilantro and 
seasonings to taste, then folded into a neat envelope shape and fried in oil. 
The egg inside the package cooks to fried-egg consistency and makes a fantastic 
breakfast meal in a edible package. You can add cooked, diced vegetables, meat 
or poultry to the eggs or leave them plain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe works best if you use fresh filo, which is available in Middle 
Eastern and Greek markets. It's possible to use frozen filo, but be sure there 
are no "wet spots," which can occur if the filo is thawed, refrozen and thawed 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 EGGS IN A PACKAGE (La Breik a l'Oeuf) 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/4 cup chopped 
cilantro 6 filo pastry sheets Melted butter 6 eggs Salt Freshly ground pepper 
Paprika Oil 
</P>
<P>
 Combine onion and cilantro in small bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 filo sheet on clean flat surface. Brush with melted butter. Cover 
remaining filo sheets with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Fold filo sheet in 
half, making 1 long rectangle. Brush with butter again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle 2 tablespoons onion-cilantro mixture in center. Break 1 egg over 
onion-cilantro mixture. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika to taste. Fold 
filo over egg, envelope-fashion, enclosing egg. Moisten seams with water and 
press lightly with fingers to seal. Pierce in several places with wood pick to 
let steam escape while frying. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with 1 filo sheet at time, repeat with remaining filo sheets and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour oil for frying 1 inch deep into large skillet over medium heat. Carefully 
lower each egg package into hot oil. Fry, turning frequently to cook evenly, 
until golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot. Remove from hot oil with 
slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 151 calories; 188 mg sodium; 212 mg cholesterol; 
6 grams fat; 16 grams carbohydrates; 9 grams protein; 0.13 grams fiber.  
</P>
<P>
 Variations: 
</P>

 Every afternoon when I get home from work, I feed the chickens and gather 
eggs. Absolutely fresh home-grown eggs produced by happy, well-fed chickens 
just 3 1/2 miles from downtown Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have only eaten the supermarket variety, really fresh eggs can be a 
revelation. The whites are firm and, if the chickens have been eating their 
greens, the yolks are an intense orange. A fresh egg doesn't run all over the 
pan. It has integrity. It has taste. 
</P>
<P>
 I show my appreciation by taking good care of my 12 hens. They exercise in a 
pen about 8-by-10 feet, which is completely surrounded by chain link, its edges 
buried deep to discourage raccoons or any other predator. A tree provides 
afternoon shade in summer. The coop is about 6-by-8 feet, with six nest boxes 
stacked near the door and three rails, placed about halfway up the walls, where 
they roost at night. My husband made the coop out of plywood and old windows, 
and he gave the hens a great view of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hens. No rooster. I have wonderfully tolerant neighbors, but I doubt they 
would appreciate a hearty 5 a.m. crow. Besides, you don't need a rooster for 
great eggs; you only need one if you want fertile eggs or baby chicks. (Fertile 
eggs are overrated. They don't taste better, they don't have more food value, 
and they spoil faster than non-fertile eggs.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roosters present another problem. In the city of Los Angeles, the only 
restriction on keeping chickens is distance. Hens must be at least 20 feet from 
the owner's dwelling and 35 feet from any other dwelling; roosters have to be 
20 feet from the owner and 100 feet from any other home. It's possible to get 
away with less footage if your neighbors don't mind and don't complain. Bribing 
them with fresh eggs might help.  
</P>
<P>
 Chickens will eat almost anything, and they produce a rich manure that will 
enrich your soil better than any chemical. I feed my hens table scraps, too-old 
dairy products, weeds and garden trimmings, cat food the cats won't touch (the 
hens' favorite), slugs and snails and any bugs I can catch. This eclectic fare 
is supplemented by commercial chicken feed: scratch -- cracked corn, milo and 
wheat -- and laying mash. I keep two waterers and two feeders filled at all 
times. Clean, fresh, abundant water is important, especially in the warmer 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most hens start laying at 6 months and hit their peak in the next year. 
Commercially raised layers live in tiny cages and spend most of their lives in 
bright light, which tricks them into laying even more. The life span of a 
commercial egg-laying hen is about a year and a half. Back-yard hens, allowed 
to live more natural lives with outdoor exercise and a sensible bedtime, can 
produce for a longer period. They probably won't break any egg-laying records, 
but they should keep a household stocked with eggs for at least three years.  
</P>
<P>
 The breed of the hen largely determines how many eggs you will get. Leghorns 
and their various hybrid derivatives are the laying-est, with more than 300 
eggs a year popping out. But they are high-strung, squawk-y and not terribly 
pretty, and most lay white eggs, which don't appeal to me. Rhode Island Reds 
can lay as many as 290 brown eggs a year. Araucanas lay about 200 to 250 
colorful eggs a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last, which originated in Chile, come in all colors, from plain black to 
multi-speckled, and are distinguished by the absence of wattles (those fleshy 
red appendages around the beaks) and the presence of little feathery tufts on 
their cheeks and chins. A more important distinction is the color of their 
eggs, which ranges from olive green to light blue, with an occasional pink or 
gold. They are the Easter egg chickens. But each hen lays only one color, alas. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Some hens lay first thing in the morning, others take their time. Egg 
production isn't easy; a pained squawk is often heard from the nest box. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer eggs in winter because there is less light. The more they 
sleep -- which they do from sunset to sunrise -- the less they lay. There are 
also fewer winter eggs because it's colder, and the hens have to expend energy 
to keep warm that would otherwise go to make eggs. In summer, egg production 
drops as the temperature rises, and the hens walk around with their wings held 
away from their bodies, hoping for a cool breeze to the wing pit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15 years I have been keeping chickens, only one has become a pet -- 
Vera, named after the World War II-era British singer Vera Lynn (who sings 
"We'll Meet Again" at the end of "Dr. Strangelove"). Vera the hen is also 
British, a speckled Sussex, and she sings too. She keeps up a fairly steady 
chorus that sounds like a cross between an avian purr and a hum, occasionally 
bursting into a musical cackle. She is also rather smart for a chicken: She 
comes when she's called. Not a really big deal, but none of the other chickens 
I've owned have ever figured it out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vera is 7 -- very old for a hen. I doubt if she lays six eggs a year, but that 
doesn't matter. She is layer emeritus, and she will never be poule a 
l'estragon. (Yes, I have slaughtered chickens. Plucked the feathers, pulled out 
their innards, cut them up. It's not pleasant, but it gave me the virtuous 
feeling that I'd earned the right to eat them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vera was a mail-order hen. It is possible to buy chickens locally, as babies 
and as mature hens, but you get a much wider selection through the mail. I've 
had silver-laced Wyandottes, buff Orpingtons, barred rocks, hybrid layers, 
hybrid fryers, even a couple of leghorns. Baby chicks can survive without food 
or water for 72 hours after they come out of the shell. They are fragile, 
though, so they have to be shipped in batches of at least 25 to maintain body 
heat. The tiny, peeping fluff balls arrive in a cardboard box perforated with 
vent holes. I've received about 200 chicks this way, and only one shipment 
suffered fatalities; the mail carrier just left the box on the front porch 
without calling me, and the babes were chilled. Seven of the 25 died. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first few weeks of their lives, chicks are fairly easy to care for. 
They need a big box away from all drafts, plenty of newspapers or straw to keep 
the box floor dry, a 25-watt light bulb -- poked though a hole in the side of 
the box and high enough so they can't touch it -- to keep them warm, You can 
also use a 250-watt heat bulb (which is not a regular light bulb) suspended 18 
inches from the floor. The light doesn't get turned off, unless you can provide 
another source of heat. Chick waterers and feeders, purchased from feed stores, 
should be filled and cleaned several times a day. Birds are not tidy. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a month, maybe less, they will need bigger accommodations. They could 
go into a bigger box or a coop -- if you can keep the light going or somehow 
ensure that they don't get chilled at night. If you already have large 
chickens, don't put the babies with them. The older chickens will kill them. 
Also, if a mature chicken becomes ill, the others will attack it. Life in the 
coop can be ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It can also be harmonious, if the hens are not overcrowded. There is a pecking 
order, and it has little to do with size or age. Don't interfere with it. If a 
hen is getting badly pecked, I remove her until she heals. If they start 
pecking her again, I give her away. A normal pecking order should not spell 
death or torture for even the lowest hen. If it does, the flock may sense 
something is wrong with the victim, and there isn't much you can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of their puzzling faults, I enjoy chickens. I like the cooing sounds 
they make when they're contented, the excited pawk-pawk-pawks when they find a 
succulent bug, the shape of their plump bottoms, the beauty of their sleek 
feathers.  
</P>
<P>
 And their fresh eggs are glorious.

 * Gathering: Egg wholesaler Pete Ruiz of Sunset Egg Ranch in Van Nuys says 
eggs should be collected often (so they don't languish in hot weather or under 
a hot hen), washed carefully in warm water, dried and refrigerated immediately. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooking: I boil eggs using Adelle Davis' method: Boil water, add eggs, cover 
pan, turn off heat, set timer for eight minutes.This makes a medium-boiled egg 
with firm whites and fairly firm yolks. Don't try to hard-boil a just-gathered 
egg; the white will come off with the shell. An egg should be at least 3 days 
old before it's hard-boiled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buying Chickens: Check the Yellow Pages for feed stores in your area. Always 
call first, because many feed stores don't carry chickens, or carry them only 
occasionally. You can order by mail from Marti Poultry, P.O. Box 27, Windsor, 
Mo. 65360-0027. (816) 647-3156. Free catalogue. JUDITH SIMS

 Every year you probably hard-boil a couple of cartons of eggs for the kids to 
decorate. They get hidden in the back yard and then -- found or not -- they 
likely languish unappreciated until finally someone tosses them out. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, use eggs for the purpose for which they were intended: Cook them 
and eat them. Eggs have been of bad repute nutritionally for so long that you 
may have forgotten just how delicious they are.

 "Something magical happens to the taste of a simple frittata when balsamic 
vinegar is dribbled over its surface," writes Carol Field in the introduction 
to this recipe in her book "Celebrating Italy" (Morrow; 1990). She got the 
recipe from Italo Pedroni, whose great-great-grandfather opened the tiny 
countryside shop and restaurant Osteria di Rubbiara in Nonantola, Italy, in 
1862. Pedroni and his wife, Franca, continue the tradition: The shop sells 
family-produced liqueurs and balsamic vinegars; behind the store, hungry 
travelers can sit outdoors and eat some of Italy's best pasta.  
</P>
<P>
 HERB FRITTATA DRIZZLED WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR (Frittata all'Aceto Balsamico) 1 
onion, finely sliced 1/4 cup peanut or olive oil 10 eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons 
chopped rosemary leaves 2 sage leaves, chopped 2 1/2 teaspoons torn basil 
leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Saute onion in oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until onion is 
translucent and becoming golden. Beat eggs in bowl with rosemary leaves, sage 
leaves, basil leaves and salt. Remove onion from pan with slotted spoon, drain 
well. Add onion to egg mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook egg mixture in same skillet over medium heat. As edges of egg mixture 
begin to set, tilt pan and lift outer edges so still-runny eggs can run under. 
Reduce heat to low and continue cooking until eggs are golden brown underneath 
and quite well set on top, between 18 and 20 minutes. Put large serving plate 
over top of skillet and carefully invert frittata. Slide frittata back into 
skillet, uncooked-side-down. Cook 1 to 2 minutes to set on second side. Remove 
to serving platter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle surface of frittata evenly with balsamic vinegar by holding spoon 
full of vinegar about 6 inches above frittata and tapping finger against it as 
you move spoon uniformly over top. Let frittata stand 1 to 2 minutes to combine 
flavors. Makes 4 servings.

 This is one of those perfect, simple dishes in which the disparate elements -- 
hard-boiled eggs, leeks, anchovies -- seem made for each other. Right now is 
the perfect season to find young leeks, which, in the words of Paul Bertolli, 
who printed this recipe in "Chez Panisse Cooking" (Random House; 1988), "have a 
fresh grassy flavor and are much more tender and less stringy than the larger, 
more mature ones." He recommends young leeks with shoots about 1/2 inch in 
diameter -- though the recipe does work with older leeks too. The dish works as 
a first course or side dish, especially if you're serving a roast or braised 
meat. Bertolli likes to make this as a light lunch: "by themselves, with sliced 
sausage or ham, or with grilled fish."  
</P>
<P>
 LEEKS VINAIGRETTE WITH ANCHOVIES AND EGGS 30 young (baby) leeks 1 gallon water 
1 1/2 tablespoons salt 6 salt-packed anchovies 3 large eggs 1 large shallot, 
finely diced 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar Salt, pepper 1/4 
cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Trim root end of leeks and cut away green leaves. Discard leaves. Leeks should 
be about 5 inches long. Make 2-inch slits on either side of top end of each 
leek so sand and dirt can flow out when leeks are rinsed. Remove any tough 
outer skin and plunge leeks into large bowl of water. Check cut tops and shake 
any sand out under water. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring water and salt to boil in large pot. Add leeks. Adjust heat so water 
gently bubbles. Cook leeks 15 to 18 minutes, or until tender throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fillet anchovies and soak in several changes of cold water 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover eggs with cold water, bring to boil, turn off heat, and let eggs stand 8 
minutes. Cool eggs under cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine shallot and vinegar in bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Stir in olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully remove leeks from pot and place on plate to cool. Squeeze leeks 
gently to remove excess water. Chill in refrigerator 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel eggs and chop very coarse. Drain and squeeze anchovies so they are dry. 
Slice into small bits. Stir anchovies into vinaigrette. Pour vinaigrette over 
leeks. Toss gently so that leeks don't fall apart. Arrange leeks on individual 
plates or large platter in single layer, adding all of vinaigrette. Scatter 
eggs and parsley over top and serve. Makes 6 servings.

 Without eggs, custards, one of the world's great foods, wouldn't have been 
invented. This one -- another from Paul Bertolli's "Chez Panisse Cooking" -- 
was designed to enhance the flavors of roast chicken or grilled paillards of 
veal. Bertolli's cooking advice: "Although the recipe calls for chanterelles, 
any wild mushroom or combination of mushrooms may be used. The mushrooms should 
be well-seasoned and as dry as possible so that their moisture will not 
interfere with the balance of the egg and cream in the custard."  
</P>
<P>
 CHANTERELLE CUSTARD 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 1/2 cups fresh 
chanterelles, thinly sliced Salt, pepper 1 shallot, minced 1 small clove 
garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon chopped thyme leaves 1 egg 1 egg yolk 1 cup heavy 
whipping cream Dash freshly grated nutmeg Butter for ramekins 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in 10-inch skillet, add chanterelles. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Cook mushrooms at simmer until released juices are reduced and 
evaporated. Add shallot, garlic and thyme. Continue to cook mushrooms 5 
minutes. Remove pan from heat and transfer mushroom mixture to plate to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together 1 egg and 1 egg yolk, cream, 1/8 teaspoon salt, dash pepper, 
and nutmeg until just mixed. Add mushrooms and stir well. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins and evenly divide custard mixture among them. 
Place ramekins in baking dish. Pour hot water into baking dish to reach halfway 
up ramekins. Bake at 350 degrees 35 minutes, or until custards are firm in 
center and brown on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove custards from oven. Remove from water bath. Let custards cool at room 
temperature 10 minutes. Run knife around inside edge of ramekins, jiggle each 
ramekin from side to side, invert onto 1 hand, and carefully remove custard. 
Set each custard, browned side up, on warm dinner plate. Makes 4 servings.

EASTER EGGS; ARTIE AND THE LOST HAREM: AN EGG STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I lived in Iowa, my boyfriend Alan and I kept chickens. We had seven or 
eight plump Rhode Island Reds who laid brown eggs; two Araucanas from South 
America, who had black skin and white feathers and laid beautiful pale-blue 
eggs, and Artie. Artie was a banty rooster with glossy black feathers and huge, 
corn-yellow spurs. He was proud and vain and remarkably quiet for a rooster. He 
took his husbandly responsibilities at the henhouse very seriously. His motto 
was: Every Hen Every Day. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, I was too afraid of the hens to gather eggs; they dove at my hand, 
screamed, flapped their wings. Alan taught me to pull my sleeves down over my 
knuckles as a kind of impromptu mitt, nudge the hens firmly aside, scoop up the 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 We ate eggs almost every day, and sold some occasionally to our neighbor 
across the street. We lived in a beautiful old Victorian farmhouse, where 
Alan's grandma once lived, and as in his grandmother's day, eggs were stored in 
drawers in the pantry and not, to my amazement, in the refrigerator. With 
disdain for my citified habits, Alan insisted it was sheer superstition that 
eggs required refrigeration. Eggs, he swore, would keep for three, even six 
months at room temperature. And, as far as I could see, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And then, trouble began brewing in the henhouse. First, one of the Araucanas 
got out and was hit by a tractor trailer. We gave the other one to a friend. 
Then the Rhode Island Reds started eating their own eggs. I'd go out in the 
morning and find the eggs pecked open, the roosts a sodden mess. Alan deduced 
they had a calcium deficiency, so we went to the feed store for oyster shell. 
The man who waited on us was dubious: Once hens develop a taste for their own 
eggs, he said, there was no retraining them. Nevertheless, we bought the oyster 
shell and a fancier mash to tempt them back to normal appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hens laid eggs with richer yolks, tougher shells; alas, every morning, 
most of the shells were broken, the yolks soaking into the hay-bedded roosts. 
</P>
<P>
 We ate our way through the drawers of eggs. And, as Alan was of a practical, 
Iowa farm family bent, we ate a few stewed old hens too. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, we actually had to start buying our eggs. We bought them from an old 
coot named Louie, who lived over by the lake. Louie's wife had died a few years 
back, and he had slowly descended into a kind of bachelor-farmer pagan squalor. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Louie's house was heated by an old wood stove; the kitchen was tidy, but 
dirty. And the barnyard . . . there was poultry everywhere: chickens, roosters, 
ducks, geese, turkeys. In the yard and barn, in every declivity -- tractor 
seat, spare tire, hollow in a heap of hay -- there were eggs. There were eggs 
in his tool box, eggs in the grain bin, eggs wherever a chicken could roost 
with the slightest sense of enclosure or concavity.  
</P>
<P>
 Louie would gather us up a shoe box full of eggs. We were never fully 
comfortable with these eggs, always afraid one might have been sat on a little 
too long. Whenever I'd crack one of Louie's eggs around Alan, he'd always say 
"Peep, peep, peep," to tease me because I was so squeamish about finding a 
particularly mature fertilized egg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We probably could have obtained farm-fresh eggs from any number of people, but 
a trip to Louie's seemed exotic, and besides, in one of his outbuildings, he 
had a '46 Studebaker pickup truck in which Alan was extremely interested. 
Meanwhile, our hen population steadily declined until the only chicken left was 
Artie.  
</P>
<P>
 While Alan had no compunction about stewing the egg-devouring hens, Artie was 
a different story. He had arrived as an egg in the mail; Alan had incubated 
him, fed him with an eyedropper. Artie had personality. He was friendly, funny, 
spry. He made me understand why a particular kind of cocky small guy is called 
a banty rooster -- self-satisfied, vain, horny. Without his harem, Artie walked 
incessantly around the yard, stepping high in the grass, rushing up to us when 
we came out of the house. Without his harem, he was at a loss; eating insects 
was fun, staring into hubcaps had its moments, but Artie was meant for more 
vigorous activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan didn't want to kill him: Artie hadn't eaten any eggs. We decided instead 
to take him to what was surely heaven-on-earth for fowl. Early one evening, we 
drove out to the lake. A flock of Louie's poultry pecked in the culvert. We 
threw Artie out of the car window. Louie, we were sure, would neither notice 
nor mind this addition to his flock. 
</P>
<P>
 We were not undetected, however. We soon heard through the small town 
grapevine that Louie was telling everyone that people were throwing chickens 
out of their cars into his yard. He thought it was hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time we made an egg run, we found Louie busy at a bloody stump 
butchering chickens, filling his freezer for winter. He complained that his 
birds were too wild any more, and he was too old and stiff to catch them. "This 
last one, though, little black chicken, was friendly as pie. Came right up to 
me. Spurs on him like bear claws. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan and I looked at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh , Artie !

 Farm-fresh eggs are at their best unadorned -- fried or scrambled or poached 
and served with just a little salt and pepper. Still, I can't resist this 
long-favorite dish for Greek eggs. It works well in small or large batches -- 
I've made it for as many as 15 people, er, garlic-lovers. It's especially heady 
during summer when fresh tomatoes and Greek oregano can come straight from the 
garden.  
</P>
<P>
 GREEK EGGS 1/4 cup olive oil 5 cloves garlic, minced 2 large tomatoes, halved 
and sliced 1 scant tablespoon dried Greek oregano or 2 tablespoons fresh 6 
eggs, lightly beaten Dash salt Pita bread or flour tortillas, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 10-inch skillet. Add garlic and cook briefly. Add tomatoes and 
oregano. Cook over medium-low heat until tomatoes are tender and begins to lose 
their skin. Add eggs and dash of salt. Stir mixture until eggs are cooked but 
still soft. Serve immediately on warm pita bread. Makes 2 to 3 servings.

MORE LIMITS SOUGHT ON DAY LABORERS; NEIGHBORHOODS: ANGRY LADERA HEIGHTS 
RESIDENTS SAY THE NEW COUNTY ORDINANCE DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO KEEP WORKERS OFF 
THEIR PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Complaining that a new county ordinance does little to stop day laborers from 
congregating near their homes, a group of Ladera Heights residents is vowing to 
take its case for stronger restrictions back to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't seen the last of us," said Ronnie Cooper, president of the 
Ladera Civic Assn. "We're not done, not by a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents attended a Board of Supervisors meeting March 15 to 
hear the vote on the ordinance, which prohibits laborers from seeking work in 
parking lots only when property owners set up alternative work sites and inform 
laborers accordingly. It was proposed by Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was a watered-down version of an earlier Burke proposal that was 
prompted by Ladera Heights homeowners' complaints that laborers were spilling 
into their neighborhood from the Slauson Avenue HomeBase store, littering, 
urinating in public and creating disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 The original measure would have prohibited laborers from congregating near 
residential property, and also would have banned day laborers from seeking 
employment in commercial parking lots and on public street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have called me in the past in tears saying that some workers were 
blocking their driveway, that they couldn't get to their cars," Cooper said. 
"That residential clause is something that we want back." 
</P>
<P>
 The association has drafted a letter to the Board of Supervisors asking for 
stronger restrictions against day laborers. Cooper says she will push for 
Burke's original bill to be made into a two-year pilot measure that would apply 
only to Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents vowed to continue their fight for stronger restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife won't shop at HomeBase because of the disturbances the laborers 
cause, and that store has a vested interest in my business," said Clifton 
Fisher, a parks and recreation commissioner for the city of Inglewood. "This is 
an economic and behavioral problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Waleatha Taylor, a block club captain whose street borders HomeBase, called 
the new law "a good first step," but said more must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us can't get to our homes in the late afternoon because the alleys 
are filled with these workers," she said. "We really need to take this matter 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Lopez, who lives on Slauson directly across the street from HomeBase, was 
less diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loses -- the residents and the laborers," he said. "This will only 
allow the exploitation of the workers to continue. We have to go back to square 
one and get the first measure approved."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; PILOT CALTRANS PROJECT FENCES OUT TANSIENTS 
</P>

<P>
 A contractor hired by the state Department of Transportation is nearly 
finished installing a prototype fence designed to keep people from living under 
the Santa Monica Freeway beside the Hoover Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware of the problem but it was the people in the neighborhood who 
really brought the magnitude of it to our attention," said Russell Snyder, a 
spokesman for Caltrans, which is responsible for maintaining the area. "The 
crime there really elevated the magnitude of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, neighborhood residents watched as the area became 
a base for transients and the center of the local drug trade. At one time, as 
many as 25 people lived there, some with appliances powered by auto batteries, 
neighbors said. Neighbors suspected some of the under-the-bridge dwellers in 
local auto thefts, burglaries and other property crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid to walk by," said one neighbor last winter. Another 
resident said he was threatened with bodily harm after he complained to some 
people under the bridge about their activities. The police have made numerous 
narcotics-related arrests at the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to address the problem was pushed along by a neighbor who 
requested anonymity. For two years, he called and wrote letters to Caltrans and 
city officials proposing that the area be sealed off, requesting action and 
monitoring responses. 
</P>
<P>
 A regular chain-link fence proved ineffective as people climbed over it or cut 
it. A Caltrans maintenance crew occasionally evicted the transients but they 
returned each time. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Caltrans tried an organic deterrent. "We spread some manure 
under the bridge and then wet it down," Snyder said. "It was kind of ripe, and 
it worked for a while. But that wasn't a long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Caltrans decided to install the security fence, which, at about $70 
a foot, is more expensive than chain-link fencing, which costs about $10 per 
foot. The new fence will be as high as 10 feet at some points, higher than the 
standard six-foot chain-link fence. Caltrans officials estimated the project 
will cost $28,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fence is thicker than a chain-link fence, with smaller openings in the 
mesh. It is harder to cut or climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get your fingers into it and you can't get wire cutters in between 
the spaces," said Conrad Loera, the Caltrans project engineer who drew up the 
initial plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar fencing has been used in other states and in some prisons, but never 
before in a Caltrans project. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the installation began in January, the people who lived under the bridge 
and most of the alleged drug dealers have moved away, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one expects the fence to eliminate crime in the area -- another auto 
burglary near the bridge was reported last week -- it does give residents a 
chance to reclaim their neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've noticed a tremendous difference," said the self-described "concerned 
citizen" who spearheaded the campaign for the fence. "The neighborhood is a lot 
quieter, and people who live here seem more at ease walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 A newly formed Neighborhood Watch group promises to keep an eye on the fence 
to see if it works. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: TEMPLE-BEAUDRY; LIBRARY CELEBRATES NEW LOCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pilipino-American Reading Room and Library holds a celebration featuring 
food, entertainment and arts and crafts at its new location today.  
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1985 by Helen Brown, the library is a repository of materials 
documenting the history, culture and politics of Filipinos in the Philippines 
and the United States. (Since Tagalog, the main Philippine language, has no F 
sound, some reject the traditional spelling of Filipino, preferring to use a 
P.) 
</P>
<P>
 The original location in the Filipino Christian Church proved to be too small 
for the growing collection and for researchers like Hector Santos, who found 
important sources in the collection for his study of ancient Tagalog scripts. 
"The new place is bigger, brighter and the atmosphere is quite a bit better for 
research," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is believed to be unique in the United States in its focus on the 
Philippines and the scope of its multimedia collection.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely critical that we have this library in this specific area 
because there's a generation of kids who should be aware of their cultural 
background," said Lisa Sarno, a field deputy for City Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, whose district includes a large number of Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pilipinos in this city need a place where they can go to read about their 
heroes, heroes that we never learned about in school," said Sarno. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a former teacher and social worker who is a community activist, said 
that when Philippine American students have a chance to read the materials in 
the library, "it rekindles in them a sense of pride." 
</P>
<P>
 "The pride and self-esteem come with the rediscovery of lost roots and that 
gives them the strength and motivation to take their place in the whole 
multiethnic mix of this city," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will be open from 1 to 5 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays and 
by appointment, but Brown is seeking volunteers who can help expand the hours 
of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's festivities run from 1 to 5 p.m. at 1925 Temple St. in Luzon Plaza.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE CENTER; FEAR BELIES DECREASE IN VIOLENT 
CRIMES

<P>
 If the statistics say violent crime is decreasing, why don't people feel 
safer? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a question Capt. Nick Salicos of the Police Department's Rampart 
Division raised last week at a luncheon sponsored by the Wilshire Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Salicos said violent crime in the division is down about 15% so far this year 
compared to last year. "Raw data-wise, we're in good shape," he said. "The 
problem is that your sensation of how safe you are has nothing to do with those 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Salicos underscored the importance of a visible police presence in the fight 
against crime and fear. For example, about 80% of all crimes in the Rampart 
Division are committed in public view, he said, and are thus "repressible" if 
uniformed officers are more visible and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some problems, such as drug dealing or aggressive panhandling, demand more 
concentrated attention by police officers, Salicos said. Toward that end, he 
has formed a unit under Senior Lead Officer Andrew Voge to focus on specific 
problems identified by the police and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Salicos said his plans to reach out to community groups and work with a 
community advisory board should also counter feelings that people are powerless 
to fight crime. "The community advisory board will be a forum for information 
on community problems that need police attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about aggressive panhandlers who walk in front of motorists stopped 
at intersections, Salicos stressed the importance of reporting incidents to the 
police. "We need to have you call us and tell us where the problem is," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To report a crime in a non-emergency situation: (213) 485-2681. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rampart Division's front desk: (213) 485-4064; the Wilshire Division's 
front desk: (213) 485-4022. Normandie Avenue separates Rampart on the east and 
Wilshire on the west.

 Betty Oyama was tired of living in the Bermuda Triangle of neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Figueroa Terrace, a hilly street between Chinatown and Echo 
Park, Oyama had heard neighbors gripe about being transferred back and forth 
between the Central and Northeast police divisions whenever they tried to phone 
in a crime report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department couldn't figure out where Figueroa Terrace and a pocket 
of neighboring streets were. Some local residents said they grew so frustrated 
that they stopped reporting the frequent auto thefts, assaults and carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
 After her parents were victims in a follow-home robbery a couple of years ago 
and it took police about five hours to arrive, Oyama decided that she had had 
enough. She began knocking on doors to rally residents to form a Neighborhood 
Watch group. And the name she selected for the group reflects the neighborhood: 
Forgotten Edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as it nears its two-year anniversary, the Forgotten Edge Neighborhood 
Watch is a model of community participation. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, located off Sunset Boulevard, near the Pasadena Freeway just 
below Elysian Park, is a mix of new and old housing styles and residents who 
span the socioeconomic and ethnic spectrums. New condominium complexes stand 
next to 1920s-era bungalow houses and old apartment buildings. Families of 10 
live next door to singles and college students. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors know each other well, watch out for one another and meet to 
paint out graffiti. A telephone list unites the group's 50 active members. More 
important, police officers have come to know the neighborhood, which officially 
lies in the Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Joe Writer, the division's senior lead officer in the area, has become 
an important contact for Forgotten Edge residents. He attends their meetings on 
the second Tuesday of each month to report on crime trends and prevention and 
to hear firsthand their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even bicycle patrol officers from the Central Division occasionally pedal into 
the neighborhood to check on residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working because people know now (whom to call). . . . They're reporting 
crime. Before, they lived in a vacuum," said Writer. "They have a relationship 
with the Police Department on an ongoing basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Building on this relationship is an ongoing process, residents said. Because 
of the neighborhood's mix of ethnicities and languages, informing and 
persuading non-English speakers to get involved in Neighborhood Watch has been 
a challenge, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oyama, who speaks Chinese, and other bilingual Forgotten Edge members 
regularly go door to door with police officers to provide bilingual 
crime-prevention information and to check for unreported crimes among the 
Chinese- and Spanish-speaking residents, who often do not call police because 
of language and cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oyama said residents still must occasionally practice patient persistence when 
calling police: "Even now when we call the front desk at Northeast Division, 
officers say, 'You're not in our division.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the Forgotten Edge's successes are significant. Writer said neighborhood 
gang activity has decreased because of the community's more watchful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the improved communication among neighbors pleases Ken Urheim, a six-year 
resident of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I had a break-in and my neighbor watched and didn't do 
anything about it," said Urheim, whose rented Figueroa Terrace house offers a 
breathtaking view of the Downtown skyline. "The neighbor said, 'I thought maybe 
you were moving out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, my neighbor over here watches out for me and I watch out for her. 
And I watch Betty's rental property over here . . . because you never know."

<P>
 The exercise seemed simple enough: The eight members of the group were asked 
to respond, on unsigned cards, to the questions, "What do you do?" and "What 
would you like to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Group facilitator Arlene Andrews collected the cards, redistributed them to 
group members and directed them to determine whose card they received by the 
statements written. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the group members -- participants in a human relations training course 
-- had met just moments before the exercise. So they were forced to rely on 
first impressions and such imprecise hints as handwriting style, which proved 
six out of eight times to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman trying to guess who wrote "dog groomer, student, aspiring actor" 
said her first instinct was to look at clothing styles. "I thought 'dog groomer 
-- overalls,' " she said as she incorrectly chose a woman dressed in denim 
clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Using games mixed with frank, personal and often emotional discussion, the 
course offered by the National Conference of Christians and Jews attempts to 
teach community members to reduce prejudice and stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific goal of the five-week program is to teach people in management, 
guidance or leadership positions -- teachers, social and youth workers, 
administrators, college dorm monitors -- when and how to intervene when racial 
or ethnic tensions arise in the workplace or other group settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants meet one evening a week for four weeks at the National 
Conference's offices at 1055 Wilshire Blvd., and spend one weekend in a retreat 
at a Glendale camp facility. The program is offered every six months and costs 
$125, with financial aid available. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants meet in ethnically divided discussion groups as well as with the 
entire class. Facilitators use the "racially separate" groups to encourage open 
discussion and confronting of stereotypes within ethnic groups as well as 
stereotypes of other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about internal images within our own communities . . . and how it 
makes you feel about who you are," said Daniel Loera, program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent retreat, members of a Latino discussion group expressed anger 
at stereotypes applied to them during the guessing game played earlier in mixed 
discussion groups. "Somebody attached me to a gang because of my style of dress 
and because I was very 'Mexican-looking,' " said one woman who added, "I got 
this comment from another person of Mexican ancestry." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a white discussion group, many of whom were Jewish, struggled with 
facilitator Rachel Levin's question, "What do you think 'being white' is?"  
</P>
<P>
 "You can be white and you can be gay," said one man. Others said they felt 
uncomfortable being labeled "white," with one woman saying, "No one can just be 
'white.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The program helped Ruben Duenas, 24, who works for a nonprofit agency in 
Pico-Union, realize the more subtle forms of stereotyping and their damaging 
effects: "I don't find myself generalizing on the larger-scale things, like 
race, but during that (guessing) exercise, I found myself classifying people 
based on writing, which is stereotyping by gender." IRIS YOKOI

<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors will consider approving the final 
environmental document regarding the proposed expansion of the County-USC 
Medical Center at its April 7 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for buying out the homes and businesses on Cummings, Chicago, 
Charlotte and Cornwell streets and razing them as soon as the first of the 
estimated 200 families are moved out, perhaps within months. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote comes as officials are preparing a formal proposal to the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to allow the use of federal earthquake relief money 
for the construction of the proposed $1-billion complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Director Fernando Vizcarra said his team will prepare an overall plan 
for the accelerated construction project over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel fairly certain that we're going to get something, but we don't know 
what (amount) exactly," Vizcarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake caused an estimated $400 million in damage 
to 16 buildings at the complex, leaving some uninhabitable and making it 
necessary to fund some replacement buildings sooner than originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal money could shorten the proposed eight-year building process to 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction will consolidate the County-USC hospital and other hospitals 
on the 72-acre campus into one building that will have six- to 15-story wings. 
The main hospital building may be saved for use as an office building. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of construction will be a 3,000-space parking garage near 
Cummings Street. That will begin as soon as homes can be assessed, bought out 
and razed, said Vizcarra, perhaps as early as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Impact Report is available for public review at the medical 
center project office, Interns and Residents Building, 2020 Zonal Ave., and at 
the following public libraries: Benjamin Franklin Branch, Malabar, El Sereno, 
Lincoln Heights, Chinatown, City Terrace and the Central Library.  
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; LANGUAGE LIVES ON IN HISTORY CLASS

<P>
 Teen-agers, senior citizens and a few people in between are learning the 
language and the history of their ancestors at the Chicano Resource Center at 
the East Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 turn out the last Saturday of each month to hear Prof. Fermin Herrera 
of Cal State Northridge teach Nahuatl (pronounced nah-WHAAT), the language of 
the Mechicas who inhabited Tenochtitlan, now known as Mexico City, and 
discussions on the history of the Mechicas taught by poet Leo Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know about the Holocaust, but do they know that there were 25 million 
Mexicanos killed by the Spaniards between 1521 and 1570? In Tenochtitlan, there 
were 350,000 people killed," Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these were advanced civilizations. Tenochtitlan was an island city, like 
Venice, but larger, with canals and bridges and buildings made from bricks, not 
mud huts. This is a little bit of what we're trying to do. It's a wake-up 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra, 44, who grew up in East Los Angeles, has researched the Mechicas on 
his own and is making it his life's work to spread the word about the history 
and culture that belongs to Mexicans and Mexican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The free classes are the result of Guerra's Chicano Mexicano Empowerment 
Committee, which is also working with organizers of a Mexican charter school in 
Montebello that will be designed by Mexican Americans to include the 
pre-Columbian history of the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra decries the use of Hispanic and Latino because, he said, they tend to 
blend the diverse cultures together and make the people sound generic. 
</P>
<P>
 His committee has also protested against KVEA-TV Channel 52 for its use of 
Hispano, on similar grounds. Spokeswoman Claudia Santa Cruz said the station 
uses Hispanic and Latino in its broadcasts. "It's a little bit difficult 
because you can't please everybody," she said. "They want us to use the word 
Chicano and to a lot of people, that's an insult." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra said that the Nahuatl language can be heard in certain so-called 
Spanish words, such as cuate, or twin. The Spanish term is actually gemelos, 
but Mexicans don't use it. Mitote, which means gossip, is also a Nahuatl word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what impressed me was how these words had survived," Guerra said. 
"There's an important aspect of who we are as a language. We're an Indian 
people who have been scarred by racial rape, which is something we don't like 
to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nahuatl class, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the Mechica history class, 
from 1 to 3 p.m., are taught at the library, 4801 East 3rd St. Guerra, who 
invites anyone to sit in on the history classes, wants to present another 
series after this one concludes in May.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; COURT RULING BUOYS LIQUOR STORE FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a major victory in the battle to regain control of their 
communities, a coalition of residents and lawmakers welcomed a court decision 
that upholds the city's post-riot crackdown on liquor store operations. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 17, the 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld the city's right to 
impose restrictions on liquor stores rebuilt after the 1992 civil unrest as 
part of a city zoning ordinance that requires some owners to hire security 
guards and puts limits on the hours of liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, the city has required conditional-use permits for liquor sales in 
South-Central. After the riots, the city applied those requirements to land-use 
applications for store owners who wanted to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 liquor stores, most of them minimarkets, were destroyed during the 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ecstatic at this victory, because all along we've championed the 
residents' rights to use the public hearing process to correct the 
environmental problems liquor stores have created," said Sylvia Castillo, 
project director for the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and 
Treatment, a nonprofit group with more than 500 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision also drew support from Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and 
Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose 8th and 9th districts include South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a significant message to those who would attempt to disarm the 
city" from enforcing land-use requirements, Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walters cautioned that the decision may result in a stepped-up challenge 
by the alcohol industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be at all surprised if the decision strengthens the efforts of 
the alcohol lobbyists to find some kind of loophole to challenge the court's 
decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation, the group that 
along with two liquor store owners filed the appeal, said they hope to appeal 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obviously disappointed," said attorney Stephen L. Jones. "But this was 
a case that was bound for the (state) Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real blow is, perhaps, that it's been 23 months since the riots, and of 
the 175 Korean stores that were destroyed, only six have come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who also represents plaintiffs in seven other lawsuits involving liquor 
store permits, said he expects to proceed with those cases. "We have individual 
cases with individual conditions that we're challenging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tellez, who has attended public hearings on the liquor store issue, was 
one resident pleased by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we have a better chance of keeping our streets safe," said Tellez, 
who lives on 22nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the liquor store on my corner burned, we had the police coming down 
there up to five times a day. The next day after the riots, we didn't have the 
problem." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

<P>
 What seemed a simple case of moving into a new neighborhood for Hector Manuel 
Razcon Vargas nearly a year ago may have cost him his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem began in June, when Razcon Vargas relocated a two-story, white 
stucco apartment building to a lot at 1965 Bonsallo Ave. The relocation soon 
created problems between Razcon Vargas and his neighbors, who complained that 
the building doesn't fit into the neighborhood because it is too close to the 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building does not conform to the guidelines and never has," said Jim 
Childs, chairman of the housing and planning subcommittee for the 
Adams-Normandie Project Area Committee, an advisory group to the Community 
Redevelopment Agency. "When the building was set down, it literally stuck out 
like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Razcon Vargas said the building does conform to the guidelines and pointed to 
the redevelopment agency's approval of the project, which was required for the 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly a year later, the building stands empty. And Razcon Vargas said he 
has lost his apartment building and his Santa Monica home because neighbors' 
objections kept him from completing the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan was to finish the building. The lot was free and clear and I was 
going to refinance that property and rent the apartments," said Razcon Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to use the money I got from the loan to pay off my house. But 
everything started to fall apart because they stopped the work and I had to dip 
into my savings and I ended up losing my house. All my saving and money were 
invested in that project." 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency acknowledged that it mistakenly signed off on the 
project, said Ed Saulet, the agency's project manager for the Adams-Normandie 
area that includes Bonsallo Avenue. The agency has tried to negotiate a 
$170,401 settlement for the building and the land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Razcon Vargas said he declined to settle because the amount would not cover 
the loss of his $300,000 home. He said the apartment building and lot are worth 
about $177,000, with the remainder going to legal and miscellaneous fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said the $610,000 settlement that Razcon Vargas has requested 
is out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Childs and other residents said the agency should do more to 
help Razcon Vargas and the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outrageous tragedy for everyone," Childs said. "The community is 
left with this abandoned building up on blocks and no one at the agency is 
being held accountable. It's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Saulet said he expects to meet with Razcon Vargas this month to resolve the 
problem. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; MAY OPENING SET FOR LONG-DELAYED 
CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an area that has the highest birthrate in the state and in a city where 
medical care is scarce, a new family clinic scheduled to open in May will fit 
residents' needs perfectly, said one city official. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 43,000 people live within Bell Gardens' 2.4 square miles, the city 
has only three sources of health care: a small county clinic offering limited 
services and two private doctors' offices, said Susan Stemmler, executive 
director of Family Planning Centers of Greater Los Angeles, the nonprofit 
umbrella organization that will oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual for there to be so little health care where there is such a 
big population," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Bell Gardens is so underserved by the medical community is that 
private doctors cannot make money in an area where many residents are poor and 
uninsured, Stemmler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physicians groups go into the city and can't stay open," Stemmler said. "One 
opened about a year ago and closed within six months." 
</P>
<P>
 When Stemmler surveyed residents, many said they traveled to Tijuana for 
health care and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic at 6501 Garfield Ave., which will be funded in part by the 
city, will offer family planning and prenatal care, general medical services, 
pediatric and dental care and, eventually, minor surgery, Stemmler said. 
Patients will be charged on a sliding scale according to their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders have been trying to bring a public health care facility into the 
area for years, said City Manager Charles Gomez. "We all agree that the service 
is needed in the city, and we're all wringing our hands wondering when it would 
be open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped the clinic would open in January, he said, but the project 
has hit many snags since it was approved in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The property has been burglarized four times, including once when all the 
copper plumbing was stolen. Another problem arose when the former property 
owner sold off part of the parking lot -- and with it parking spaces that the 
clinic needed to operate legally. To speed the clinic's opening, city leaders 
changed the law to allow businesses in a commercial-industrial district to have 
off-site parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up costs for the project were about $500,000, Stemmler said, including 
$252,000 allocated from the city's federal Community Development Block Grant 
funds. The clinic should be financially self-sufficient within a year, Stemmler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17,000-square-foot facility will feature 18 examining rooms and eventually 
employ a staff of about 50, Stemmler said. MARY HELEN BERG

<P>
 A city-sponsored student loan program should make the dream of higher 
education more attainable to dozens of students annually while building 
community stability and pride, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next month, city residents can apply for no-interest loans through 
the city's Academic Pursuit Program to help defray the cost of tuition, books, 
room and board, transportation and other educational expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, using the interest created by $3 million in city reserves, will 
fund thousands of dollars in loans in exchange for community service work, said 
Karen Nobrega, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, where the per capita income is about $5,000, the program 
could mean the difference between a college education and a high school 
diploma, said Mike Padilla, a counselor at Bell Gardens High School. It will 
also give students the opportunity to attend private and out-of-state schools, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my students are low-income, so the majority need and receive 
financial aid," Padilla said. "But many times it's not enough. This will give 
them more choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Alamillo, a 17-year-old senior has his sights set on Boston Univeristy, 
where he would like to study broadcast journalism but estimated that he needs 
at least $25,000 for each year of study. "I'm glad the city is offering this 
loan," he said, "It will make things a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's another program like it in the state in terms of 
magnitude," said Nobrega. About $120,000 in loans should be available in the 
first year of the program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's loans will help offset the costs of bachelor's, master's, 
doctorate, law and medical school programs. All recipients will be required to 
perform some community service. It is still unclear how the loans will be 
awarded or what type of volunteer work will be required, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will be required to begin repaying the loans within one year of 
completing a program or leaving school. However, part of each loan can be 
repaid with city-sponsored internships or additional community service, Nobrega 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a city with a 30% or more transiency rate, the program has a side benefit. 
Because participants are required to have lived in the city for four 
consecutive years and students' legal guardians must continue to live in Bell 
Gardens while the student is accepting loan money, the program encourages 
families to remain in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for the program, students must also have a 2.5 grade-point 
average, a good attendance record and proof of acceptance at an accredited 
four-year or junior college. The deadline for applications is May 12.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; PLANS CONTINUE FOR AFRICA-THEME ZONE

<P>
 The African International Village Assn. has enlisted the help of an 
architectural team to give shape to its plans to transform the Crenshaw area 
into an African-themed business and cultural district. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three months, 10 architects, artists and engineers have worked to 
develop conceptual drawings to give the Crenshaw corridor a new look from Adams 
Boulevard to Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The association was founded three years ago by community activist and Cal 
State Los Angeles student Melva Parhams to work for the official declaration of 
the Crenshaw district as the African International Village. The designation 
would make Crenshaw an African-themed cultural and business district similar to 
such areas as Chinatown, Koreatown and Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 AIVA will present its plans to the public at community meetings later this 
year, then will submit them to the city in hopes that they will be incorporated 
into the General Plan for Los Angeles, architectural team chairman Okey Okonkwo 
said. The General Plan, the city's plan for development and growth, is 
undergoing revision. 
</P>
<P>
 Okonkwo said that a model of the Crenshaw corridor, to be completed within the 
next three months, will inject a cultural element into the city's plans for 
physically improving the area as well as allow the Crenshaw community to have a 
direct say in its own future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We here in the area need to reflect our culture somehow," said Okonkwo, a 
Nigerian-born architect who is on the board of several community institutions, 
including First African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Sheenway School. "We 
can do that in architecture and design. And we need to very definitely tell the 
city what we would like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the model is still in preliminary stages, some elements have already 
been drafted, including pyramid-shaped buildings and a memorial wall inscribed 
with the names of people who died of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make this historically significant," said Edward Williams, an 
industrial project designer and a member of Okonkwo's team. "This is an idea 
whose time is overdue."  
</P>
<P>
 The African International Village "is an effort that's going forward against 
all odds," said Parhams from AIVA's Crenshaw Boulevard office. "It's time to go 
for it and claim our legacy as our own." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: BALDWIN HILLS; CITY DISPUTES SALE OF CRA-FUNDED MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Community Redevelopment Agency board members are giving mall developer 
Alexander Haagen until April 7 to reinstate the city's rights to the Baldwin 
Hills Crenshaw Plaza or face a possible lawsuit, a CRA official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board met last week in closed session to discuss a plan of action in 
response to Haagen's recent sale of the troubled Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza 
to a Haagen-controlled real estate investment trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The move effectively ended Haagen's partnership with the CRA, which put up $50 
million to help construct the mall in 1984 and was to receive half the profits 
under an agreement with Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen sold the mall to his publicly traded company, Alexander Haagen 
Properties, last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen officials argued that the mall was sold at a loss and therefore had no 
profits to share. CRA spokesman Marc Littman said the redevelopment agency, 
along with several City Council members, immediately questioned the legality of 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of CRA administrators, led by board chairman Stanley Hirsch, were 
negotiating with Haagen representatives last week to protect the city's 
interest in the mall. Littman said the city attorney's office is preparing to 
take legal action if the city cannot come to an agreement with Haagen by April 
7. "We want to resolve this as soon as possible," Littman said. "We would like 
to settle it without going to court, but we are preparing for that possibility. 
We'll be ready to take legal action." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represented much of the Crenshaw area until 
district lines were redrawn in 1992, said she hopes that the negotiations will 
clarify the city's rights in the matter. "The original deal between the 
redevelopment agency and the Alexander Haagen company sounded as if it provided 
something for the city, and it's not all that clear that it really did," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen officials have said the mall has already benefited the city by creating 
a new tax base and contributing to increased economic activity in the Crenshaw 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has been losing money since opening in 1988. City officials had hoped 
a $12-million theater multiplex would turn the plaza around financially. But 
the dispute with Haagen has thrown into question whether the city will grant a 
$1.5-million loan that would make the theater, to be developed by Haagen and 
Earvin (Magic) Johnson, possible. ERIN J. AUBRY

 KATHY LEE KNOWS THE BURDEN THAT comes with being reared as a model Korean 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 After her family immigrated to Southern California from South Korea when she 
was 7, the pressure was on for her to get good grades, attend a good college, 
marry a Korean man and eventually have children who would uphold the same 
traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old earned respectable grades in school and is now a UCLA graduate 
student. But there are no wedding plans in her future. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of keeping it secret from her family, the Silver Lake resident 
finally told her parents five years ago that she is bisexual. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very angry and upset because their dreams for me were crushed," 
said Lee (not her real name), who was accused by her mother of being possessed 
by the devil and urged to attend church. 
</P>
<P>
 "They first tried to cut me off financially, but they realized that didn't 
work, so now we have a truce. But they still talk about me getting married and 
say I'm getting to an age where I won't be marriageable." 
</P>
<P>
 Gays and lesbians from all backgrounds struggle with their sexual identities, 
but those who have come from countries and cultures where homosexuality is 
taboo grapple with some of the most difficult conflicts as they struggle for 
acceptance. The disdain that many have encountered here from family and friends 
has its roots in their homelands, where same-sex relations are regarded as a 
threat to religious and cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee recalled attending a Korean American student conference and overhearing a 
conversation about gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying, 'Thank God there are no Korean gays,' " said Lee, who is 
now dating a Chinese American woman. "In Korea, gays are closeted and 
underground. They can't come out so they tend to get married and do the 
heterosexual routine." 
</P>
<P>
 The discrimination many gay immigrants face does not come just from 
heterosexuals. Many, particularly those who are recent immigrants and do not 
speak English well, say racism is widespread in the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started attending lesbian support group meetings, most people 
were fluent in English and I felt very out of place," said Ivania Gonzales, who 
came to Los Angeles from Nicaragua in 1982 and now lives near Hancock Park. "I 
felt people looked down on me because I was Spanish-speaking. When I would go 
to white lesbian clubs, I could feel all the eyes staring at me because I was 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 A history of religious and cultural values that hold homosexuality in contempt 
-- particularly in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East -- have made 
the gay immigrants' plight extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Oscar Reconco, 36, moved to Los Angeles in 1977, he started 
lying to his mother in Honduras about his lovers. He told her he was dating 
women, and to prove it, he began sending her pictures of female friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reconco's mother and other family members eventually learned he was 
gay, the subject still is rarely discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister sees my friends come to the house and she knows I'm gay, but we 
never talk about it," said Reconco, who is now project director of the Cara A 
Cara Latino AIDS Project but has worked as a cocktail waiter at a gay bar and 
as a manager of El Cholo Restaurant on Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have a good relationship with my family. I don't have any shame to be 
gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Reconco, however, knows that most gay immigrants face much more hostility when 
coming out to their families than he did. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to shed light on such struggles, Reconco wrote a play about a 
Latino immigrant who must tell his mother that he is gay. "Elegia Para un 
Travesti" ("Elegy for a Transvestite"), which was recently staged at the 
Complex Theatre in Hollywood, is not based on Reconco's own life, but on the 
collective experiences of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In one scene, the main character's mother arrives for a visit and finds gay 
magazines in her son's home. When he tells her that he is gay and that he 
performs in drag at a gay bar, she tells him that God hates homosexuals and 
that AIDS is a justifiable punishment for people like him. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene, Reconco said, serves as a painful reminder to many gay Latinos of 
the uphill battle to gain acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latino community needs to learn about us," said Reconco, who lives in 
Echo Park. "They need to know that there are many of us out there and that we 
have our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 68 countries still outlaw sex between men and 26 outlaw sex between 
women, according to a 1992 survey conducted by the Brussels-based International 
Lesbian and Gay Assn. Fines, prison or execution await those who are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left Iran for that reason," said a gay immigrant who came to Los Angeles in 
1978 and asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Those accused four times of being gay in Iran are sentenced to death. "I'm a 
Shiite Muslim gay Iranian. I have experienced three types of prejudice, but 
I've learned to accept that as part of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the federal ban against "sexually deviant" immigrants was lifted in 
1990, he said he lived in fear that the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
would deport him. And immigrants who test positive for HIV are still denied 
entrance into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not express my social and political views (for fear of deportation)," 
said the Iranian immigrant. "If I were sent back to Iran, my life would be 
endangered and my entire family would be severely impacted." 
</P>
<P>
 In most Latin American countries, where the predominant religion is Roman 
Catholicism, homosexual acts are considered a sin and openly gay people often 
are harassed because they are seen as threats to machismo and the revered 
family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up in El Salvador, I was humiliated by other boys at 
school because I was different," said Walter Campos, who immigrated to Los 
Angeles in 1981 and knew he was gay when he was 10. "My grandmother told me I 
should try to behave more masculine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up Catholic, Campos said he still believes in God but stopped 
going to church because he knew he would not be accepted. Although he suspects 
that his parents know he is gay, they have never discussed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As gay Latinos, we deserve the same rights as everyone else," said Campos, 
who works as a research specialist at Avance Human Services, an Eastside social 
services agency that operates a bilingual AIDS information hot line. "We're not 
all perverts and misogynists. We represent another culture that people should 
try to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Peter Liuzzi, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles' liaison to the gay and 
lesbian community, said many people have the misperception that the Catholic 
Church condemns all homosexuals. The church believes that being a homosexual, 
in itself, is not sinful, Liuzzi said. But it does not approve of any gay sex, 
as well as any sex outside of marriage, he said. In other words, gays and 
lesbians who wish to remain true to the church's doctrines must practice 
celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the church because of its dogma about sexuality," said Jose Gonzales, 
who came to Los Angeles from Chile in 1991 and once studied to be a Catholic 
priest. "Being gay, I couldn't agree with the church's views about abortion and 
homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales is now the pastor of a Spanish-speaking service at the Metropolitan 
Church of Los Angeles, a predominantly gay and lesbian church in Culver City. 
"We believe God loves everyone, no matter what your sexual orientation is," 
Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Liuzzi acknowledged that there are some within his church who believe 
God dislikes all homosexuals, part of his job is to steer gays to supportive 
parishes. But out of 284 parishes in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, only six 
welcome gays and none are in Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have a committed Latino parish (accepting of gays) on the 
Eastside," Liuzzi said. "We're working on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Like their Latino counterparts, many gay Asians struggle with their 
homosexuality for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kim, co-chairman of the Gay Asian Pacific Support Network, said most of 
the group's 120 members -- whether they are recent immigrants or were born in 
this country -- face the same family conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all come from relatively similar families who put pressure on us to get 
married and have families," said Kim, a second-generation Korean American. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, the KoreAm Journal, a monthly Korean American publication based 
in Gardena, addressed the issue of gay Korean Americans. James Ryu, editor of 
the journal, said the response to the issue was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people said we were brave for bringing up this issue," he said. "Other 
people said they know gay people have rights, but they don't want them as 
friends. They said they would rather not talk about it because they don't 
accept it, but don't want to seem closed-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonina Barraquiel, a native of the Philippines, said she initially blamed 
her son's homosexuality on the fact that she raised him without a father. But 
she soon accepted it and now offers her full support. 
</P>
<P>
 During a support group meeting for Los Angeles parents of gay and lesbian 
Asian Americans, Barraquiel said she once got into an argument with a father 
who could not accept his gay, HIV-positive son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that being an Asian is already a disadvantage and that he could not 
tolerate this," she said. "I told him: That's a good reason why you should show 
more love and support.' Asian parents have trouble accepting this." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, minority communities -- Latinos in particular -- have been 
forced to address the issue of homosexuality because many from within their own 
communities are dying of AIDS. Latinos accounted for 17% of all AIDS cases 
nationwide in 1992, although Latinos make up just 9% of the population, 
according to the National Commission on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a huge need to educate Latinos," said Juan LeDesma, director of 
health services at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center in 
Hollywood. "Many Latinos are afraid and embarrassed to talk about sex. Whenever 
we say things like penis, vagina or semen, people are always giggling." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the discrimination they face, many gay immigrants believe they must 
fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens to gay immigrants is that they're often divorced from their 
families, which is a very important support network," said J Craig Fong, 
director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund's Western Regional 
Office. "They're forced to forge a new identity for themselves and create a new 
way to be Latino or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really tough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gay immigrants of color also are struggling to find their niche in the gay 
community, said Joel Tan, Barraquiel's son, who came to the United States from 
the Philippines in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The gay community is very male and Eurocentric, said Tan, who serves as 
program coordinator of the Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team near Downtown. 
"The norms being established are very white-oriented, and Asian males are often 
stereotyped as exotic and passive." 
</P>
<P>
 While working as a bartender at a gay club, Tan said many white men were 
condescending toward him when they talked to him or tried to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got so bad, I developed a reputation for hating white men," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gays said nonwhites used to be asked for several forms of identification 
before they could enter gay bars that served mostly whites. Those who could not 
speak English were even more harassed at the doors of some gay clubs, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center has expanded its 
efforts to serve and hire more people of color, it still has a way to go before 
it truly serves the community, immigrant activists say. The center, which is 
the nation's largest gay and lesbian center, offers counseling, health and 
legal services in Spanish, but has only limited services in Asian and other 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is an issue for us," said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of 
the center. "Because of language barriers, trying to hook into the gay and 
lesbian community is often difficult." On the Cover

 Ivania Gonzales, right, and Marta Martinez recently celebrated 12 years of 
living as a couple in their home near Hancock Park. Gonzales, who arrived here 
from Nicaragua in 1982, said it has been difficult to fit into Los Angeles' gay 
community:

<P>
 "I felt people looked down on me because I was Spanish-speaking. When I would 
go to white lesbian clubs, I could feel all the eyes staring at me because I 
was different." Support Groups

HOW SCHOOLS CAN ADDRESS NEEDS OF GAYS, LESBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Educational institutions are often described as ivory towers -- places that 
operate independently of the events, trends, and other realities that surround 
them. More often than not, though, schools actually reflect what happens in 
society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the growing attention devoted to homosexuality. Not surprisingly, 
public schools nationwide are reviewing how well they address gay and lesbian 
students' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, clubs and discussion groups for 
gay and lesbian students have been formed on some campuses. In my own school, 
we have begun a Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Student Union, reserved part of the 
general bulletin board for the organization's announcements, and welcomed 
speakers on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts are important. According to alarming statistics from the U.S. 
Department of Health, gay and lesbian youths are three times more likely to 
fall victim to suicide, attempted suicide, and substance abuse than their 
heterosexual peers. They are also more likely to drop out of school, to suffer 
social alienation and rejection by family members, and to be kicked out of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of the problem, as with all types of discrimination, is ignorance. To 
combat it on campus, a variety of handbooks and curriculum guides have been 
developed. The materials are typically authored by gay and lesbian 
organizations, health professionals, civil rights groups or educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolwide, there are several frequently mentioned ways to help gay and 
lesbian students succeed and gain acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Educating and sensitizing staff and teachers is a good starting point. It is 
particularly important for school counselors and psychologists to know the 
facts -- not the myths and stereotypes -- about gays and lesbians, and to be 
able to talk and listen to such students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local gay and lesbian organizations have speakers bureaus, and schools 
should make use of them for assemblies, debates and panel discussions to help 
inform students and staff about gay and lesbian issues. (Making such 
presentations available for parents in the evenings can help cure campus 
homophobia too.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are also strategies teachers can employ in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 They can stop the use of anti-gay and lesbian slurs. They can discuss why such 
slurs are wrong, just as they should when students make ethnic or religious 
slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers can identify gay and lesbian contributions throughout the curriculum, 
including history, literature, art, science, government and math. In teaching 
about the Holocaust, the decimation of Jews is highlighted, but persecution of 
gays and lesbians is rarely mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it mentioned that a large number of writers were reputedly gay, lesbian 
or bisexual (Lord Byron, Hans Christian Anderson, Herman Melville, Walt 
Whitman, Oscar Wilde, Willa Cather, Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, E. M. Forster, 
Virginia Woolf, Tennessee Williams and James Baldwin, among others). 
</P>
<P>
 It is also helpful to include class discussion of gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
issues along with other minority issues.

KILL 710 EXTENSION, PRESERVATIONIST URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena, 
Pasadena and the El Sereno neighborhood of Los Angeles should be rejected, the 
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation told Los Angeles 
business and community leaders recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moe, head of the Washington-based organization, called for a shift in 
transportation dollars from cars to mass transit at a recent Los Angeles Town 
Hall meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed extension from the Foothill Freeway to the San Bernardino Freeway 
would reportedly destroy nearly 1,000 homes, including a number of historic 
buildings. For the last four years, South Pasadena has appeared on the trust's 
list of the most endangered places in America.

TRACING A CENTURY OF TRADITION AND TRIAL; STORIES AND MEMENTOS OF JAPANESE 
AMERICAN WOMEN DOCUMENT THEIR TRANSITION FROM IMMIGRANTS TO THEIR PLACE IN 
CONTEMPORARY CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the first Japanese American women came to the United States as 
"picture brides," kimonoed women brave enough or desperate enough to spend a 
month at sea to marry a man whose face they knew only from a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughters -- the generation known in Japanese as Nisei -- thought of 
themselves as citizens like any other. But when the Japanese bombed Pearl 
Harbor, thousands of Japanese American citizens found themselves robbed of 
their possessions and shipped off to harsh detention camps because of the color 
of their skin.  
</P>
<P>
 The third generation, called Sansei, includes women like Kristi Yamaguchi, who 
skated her way to a gold medal for the United States at the Albertville 
Olympics in 1992. More than 50% of them marry non-Japanese men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strength & Diversity: Japanese-American Women 1885-1990" is the subject of an 
award-winning exhibit running through May 30 at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with 50 Japanese American women, the show was originally 
organized by the National Japanese American Historical Society and the Oakland 
Museum, where it opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because Japanese American soldiers, many fresh from the camps, fought 
so heroically during World War II, the story of Japanese American men has been 
told before. But as Rosalyn Tonai, one of the show's Bay Area organizers, 
points out, this is the first exhibit that tells the story of Japanese American 
women, often in their own words. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes this show from other ethnic exhibits, even groundbreaking 
ones, is that, as it travels around the country, the show is customized to 
reflect the local experience. "It was very different in Hawaii than it was in 
Portland, Ore.," Tonai said. Southern California has the largest concentration 
of Japanese Americans in the country -- more than 130,000 in Los Angeles County 
alone. Working with the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, the 
Autry has tapped this rich community resource to give the show a local spin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Michael Duchemin, curator of history at the Autry, the traveling 
portion of the show includes photographs, text -- much of it taken from the 
oral histories -- and some 70 objects that document the journey of Japanese 
American women from immigration to their varied roles in contemporary culture. 
The era of the picture bride, for instance, is vividly evoked by a kimono, iko 
or kimono rack and Japanese wicker suitcase that accompanied one hopeful woman 
across the Pacific. Local additions flesh out the basic show and allow visitors 
to see in concrete detail how their Japanese American neighbors fared during 
almost a century of tradition, trial and change. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II Japanese American women had even fewer job opportunities 
than their men. Many could get jobs only as domestic servants or at vegetable 
stands. But during the 1930s, some local Japanese American women attended the 
Gardena Dressmaking College. The show includes a photo of the class of 1936, 
plus a diploma and a program for the ceremony that marked them as full-fledged 
seamstresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, some of the most powerful material involves the notorious 
"relocation centers." As a result of the exclusion order of 1942, many Japanese 
Americans were, in the words of writer Eugene V. Rostow, "sent to concentration 
camps on a record which wouldn't support a conviction for stealing a dog." 
Locally, many internees were concentrated at Santa Anita, where children did 
their lessons in front of the parimutuel windows in the grandstand because 
their mothers didn't want their educations interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tonai, whose mother was a teen-age internee in Rohwer, Ark., many 
people, however guiltless, were ashamed of being interned and never spoke about 
their camp experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes such eloquent objects as an oil painting titled "Family 
in Camp Room," done in Rohwer, that shows how internees tried to brighten the 
small, barracks-like spaces where they suffered marriage-testing lack of 
privacy and other indignities. Bad, decidedly un-Japanese food was another 
trial of camp life. Internees in Topaz, Utah, finally rioted after they were 
served liver once too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow the internees, especially women, managed to create some beauty in 
their lives and those of their families. Handcrafted jewelry is part of the 
exhibit, including a corsage made from little white shells at the Gila River 
camp in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same camp Japanese Americans wove baskets in the style of the local 
Pima Indians. "It looks like the Indians may have been showing the internees 
how to make them," Duchemin said. The result is "a very interesting 
cross-cultural piece" that appears in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stories of Nisei women are especially interesting because, even more than 
their mothers, they were aware of being, in the words of writer Mei Nakano, "in 
double jeopardy, objects of the sexism of the society-at-large as well as the 
deeply entrenched one of the traditional Japanese society." 
</P>
<P>
 As you look at the pictures and read the words, you can almost imagine the 
parents of the Nisei women who became WACs and broke from tradition in other 
ways, muttering the Japanese equivalent of oy veh.  
</P>
<P>
 Activists are also part of the story, including the women who fought for 
redress and reparations for the victims of Executive Order 9066. 
</P>
<P>
 The show includes a Life magazine cover that shows civil rights activist Yuri 
Kochiyama cradling the head of fallen Malcolm X.  
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit also bears witness to the achievements of contemporary women. 
Included in the show is a robe worn by Fumiko Hachiya Wasserman as a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge. "It brings the story up to the present," Duchemin 
says.

SHERIFF'S OMBUDSMAN: TURN COMPLAINTS INTO RESULTS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE 
POSITION WAS CREATED IN PART TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THE COUNTY PAYS TO VICTIMS OF 
EXCESSIVE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By his own admission, Rudy De Leon has an awesome job ahead of him. On Monday, 
the retired police officer became the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
first ombudsman.  
</P>
<P>
 The position was created in part to help reduce the millions of dollars that 
Los Angeles County pays each year in liability judgments to victims of 
excessive force, De Leon said. "By the very nature of law enforcement, there 
will be violent confrontation, and there will be lawsuits," he said. "But what 
you want to do is reduce those to the minimum possible and create better 
conditions in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a $360,000 budget, De Leon hopes to create an office where 
citizens with complaints can get results. He said he wants to establish a 
uniform system for reporting brutality cases, and see those guidelines 
distributed to all police stations. De Leon will focus primarily on cases that 
result in hospitalization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints with merit go from the captain of the station to internal affairs 
to the criminal division and then to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon will follow the cases in his new $60,200-a-year job, and report to 
Sheriff Sherman Block and the Board of Supervisors. He will be responsible for 
making sure complaints are investigated quickly and sent to a retired judge, 
from an approved panel, to be reviewed. He also will provide progress reports 
to the complainant.  
</P>
<P>
 Until De Leon has a chance to sort through the files, though, he will not know 
how many cases await him. "There may be 1,000 complaints floating around," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors selected De Leon because of his "tremendous law 
enforcement experience and his background and knowledge of the county," said 
Dennis Morefield, spokesman for Supervisor Deane Dana. "The hope is that he'll 
bring stability and confidence to law enforcement," he said. "No one man can do 
it all. But (De Leon) can help." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon has a long history of service to the community and to law enforcement. 
He served with the Los Angeles Police Department for 31 years. In the 
mid-1970s, as captain of the Hollenbeck Division in Central Los Angeles, he 
helped transform an abandoned police station into a youth center. After he 
retired, he served on the state Board of Prison Terms and was later special 
assistant to former Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp for eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement has been extremely good to me," he said. As ombudsman, he 
said, "I have the opportunity to do some good for the community where I live, 
where I was raised, the community that gave me all the opportunities that I've 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native, De Leon, a 69-year-old Torrance resident, is the son of 
Mexican immigrants. When he was a student, De Leon read a column by a newspaper 
sports writer who featured athletes who became police officers. "There were 
famous football players from USC and UCLA, there were boxers, they were all 
LAPD," he said. "All the athletes I knew were good guys, so I went for it." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon was the only Latino in his academy class. By the late 1950s, though, 
more than 200 Latinos served in the Los Angeles Police Department, he said. "I 
saw a lot of discrimination. But I was very fortunate," he said. "I encountered 
very few instances of discrimination. When I did, I addressed it. I tell other 
minorities to do the same. Do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions have improved for minorities, he said, "but the separatism today is 
in some cases worse than a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 That segregation, coupled with youthful frustration and "the anonymity that 
law enforcement officers have in the community," he said, have led to far more 
serious allegations of excessive force today than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most officers do a professional job. Officers that work in volatile areas are 
loved by the people who live there. Officers that walk the beat in the 
projects, they get respect, they have rapport, even with the gang members. 
They're not tough. They're not aggressive. They do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they don't? "Then I do my job," he said.

TEMPERS FLARE OVER HOMELESS SHELTER PLAN; HEARINGS: RESIDENTS SHOUT DOWN 
OFFICIALS OF ORGANIZATION THAT WANTS TO TURN SURPLUS NAVY HOUSING INTO A 
HOMELESS SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of angry residents turned out last week to grill the officials of a 
South-Central-based organization that wants to open a homeless shelter in 
surplus Navy housing in a San Pedro neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight representatives from Turner's Technical Institute, which plans to run 
the homeless program for up to 120 families, faced a hostile crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute representatives who addressed the crowd were often shouted down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to ask questions, not for you to tell us stories!" one resident 
yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute has the approval of the federal Department of Health and Human 
Services to open the homeless shelter in 144 dwellings on 27 acres on Taper 
Avenue. Enlisted personnel and their families from Long Beach Naval Station 
will live in the housing until summer, when they are expected to be 
transferred. The naval station is scheduled to close in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most questions from the public went unanswered by the institute panel, 
prompting Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro, 
to say: "I've been up in City Hall for the past 7 1/2 months and I've seen some 
songs and I've seen some dances, but this is the most unorganized stage show 
I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments were met with thunderous applause from residents, who wore baby 
blue ribbons as a symbol of support for their neighborhoods and of their anger 
at not being included in the federal decision to approve the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnathon Marzet, deputy director of the technical institute, assured the 
crowd that no alcoholics or drug users would be allowed in the program and that 
applicants would be screened thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first month of operation, he said, only 30 families would be admitted 
to the shelter. Every 60 to 90 days, more families would be allowed in, so it 
would take nine to 12 months to fill the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people held up signs at the meeting whenever the audience got rowdy, 
telling them the institute was "not the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd shouted questions, Marzet and other panel members asked that the 
questions be written down, so they could answer them during the next meeting 
and provide the documentation that was requested. When this drew an angry 
response from the crowd, Marzet said it was a good time to end the meeting, and 
the panel left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaflets and signs told the crowd that the goal was to force the federal 
government to amend legislation that gives homeless advocacy groups first 
priority for surplus federal property without the consent of local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 has been criticized by 
the California League of Cities and the state Office of Planning and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies are studying a task force's recommendations to Gov. Pete Wilson, 
which released a report in February on the use of closed California military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the report calls the McKinney Act a significant barrier to 
economic growth and says local plans should be given priority over shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Williams, deputy director of the Office of Planning and Development 
agrees, saying the McKinney Act was a concern throughout California when public 
meetings on base closures were held last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "The locals (should) have the option to offer comparable property at a 
different location from the specific location that was required by the homeless 
group," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue also will be considered April 5 by the Los Angeles City Council 
Intergovernmental Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time the council has looked at how the federal law overrides 
any local decisions made on use of surplus military land, said Tom Kruesopon, 
spokesman for Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (federal) government can make laws like this, then what's next?" 
Kruesopon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full council is expected to vote April 8 on a proposal to urge Secretary 
of the Navy John H. Dalton to suspend a decision on the Taper Avenue housing 
until there is a full public hearing and an environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich will hold a hearing at 7 p.m. Tuesday at San Pedro High School, 1001 
W. 15th Street.

TAKING A SHOT AT FILMS; CAL STATE L.A. SHOTPUT TITLE-HOLDER TOMMIE LISTER JR. 
TRANSFERRED HIS ATHLETIC SUCCESS TO PRO WRESTLING -- AND NOW ACTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tommie Lister Jr. no doubt is remembered by professional wrestling fans as 
Zeus, a homicidal maniac who challenged Hulk Hogan to a match with no rules in 
the 1989 film "No Holds Barred." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrestled in "SummerSlam" that year. Lister also joined Randy (Macho Man) 
Savage in a tag-team match against Hogan and Brutus (The Barber) Beefcake in a 
pay-per-view special. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the 6-foot-5, 275-pound Lister dropped out of the World Wrestling 
Federation scene. Lister sold his Harbor City home to move to Atlanta in 1990 
and left the name Zeus behind -- on the bottom of his swimming pool, to be 
exact -- and resurfaced in TV and movie roles with the nickname "Tiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might think that Lister's work in the big-screen shoot-'em-ups aren't 
much different from the theatrical escapades of professional wrestling. But 
Lister's road to success started long before the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, 35, was the 1982 NCAA Division II shotput champion at Cal State Los 
Angeles, where he still holds the school record of 61 feet, 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track and field will always be my first love," Lister said. "Winning the 
national championship means more to me than anything I have or will do. It was 
my first claim to success." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister improved to 64-3 in 1983, competing for the Converse Track Club, but 
gave up track in 1984 to try his hand in football with the New Orleans Breakers 
of the now-defunct United States Football League despite having no organized 
football experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Lister, a business major, began receiving small roles in 
commercials through contacts with agents he met while working as a bouncer at 
the nightclub Imperial Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, it was Bubba Smith. Then came the Mr. T era," said Lister, who has 
been blind in his right eye since birth. "I was the next one to come along. My 
eye made me distinctive and became my trademark. I went to an audition and got 
the part. Then I kept going and going and getting the parts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Breakers cut Lister after two exhibition games but offered him a spot on 
the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lister opted for acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needed football and getting beat up?" he said. "I made $100,000 my first 
year making movies without getting hurt. With the little common sense I had 
left, I figured I should become an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister now has 21 film credits. He was a regular on HBO's "1st & Ten" series 
and has guest-starred on "Webster," "Matlock" and the "Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air." He also had a cameo with Eddie Murphy on Michael Jackson's "Remember 
the Time" music video.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year Lister co-starred with Mario Van Peebles and Tone Loc in the Western 
"Posse." In "Men at War," which finished filming in Thailand and is scheduled 
for a fall release, Lister plays an evil mercenary named Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think Zeus was bad, Blades is like his twin brother, but twice as 
bad," Lister said. "The kids are going to love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister's athletic career, however, didn't blossom as quickly as his one in 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
 He competed in track for three seasons at Compton High School but never won a 
league championship or advanced to the Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who weighed 250 pounds during his shotputting days, attended Palomar 
Junior College for a year but didn't qualify for postseason competition. He 
transferred to Long Beach City College in 1979 for his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so huge we called him the Hulk," said Virgil Torrence, 34, a sprinter 
and roommate of Lister's at Long Beach. "He would growl and do Incredible Hulk 
imitations. He is really friendly and easygoing, but he can be almost 
intimidating when he is goofing around. He always had a little acting ability." 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, Lister also showed his first signs of athletic promise, 
recording a mark of 52-0 in the shotput. He qualified for the Southern 
California finals and earned a scholarship to Cal State L.A. There he increased 
his best to 53-9 his junior year. He finished sixth in the California College 
Athletic Assn. championships that year but was plagued by a mysterious 30-pound 
weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister received a diagnosis of kidney stones and infected tonsils. He had 
surgery, was hospitalized for three weeks and forced to sit out the 1981 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a milk freak and developed calcium deposits in my bladder 
because I never drank any water," Lister said. "When I got well, I knew I was 
going to break the school record." 
</P>
<P>
 That he did -- by nearly six feet and winning a national title. Lister is the 
only Cal State L.A. shotputter ever to surpass 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only a matter of time before he reached that kind of level," Long 
Beach Coach Ron Allice said. "When he came to Long Beach, he was a real novice 
and that was his first real year of throwing. His potential was untapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister also conceded that his fascination with Westerns wasn't conducive to 
top performances on the track: "I'm a TV fanatic. I was always late to practice 
because I was watching 'The Rifleman' and 'Bonanza.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lister said he still watches movies well past midnight most nights. But he 
also finds time to give motivational talks to youth groups in Georgia with his 
friend Deion Sanders of the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Falcons. He also visits 
Allice to give inspirational speeches to the Long Beach track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who plans to move back to Southern California in the near future, said 
he yearns to return to Cal State L.A. someday to teach drama or coach track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything started there," Lister said. "I got my first big break for 
exposure because people there believed in me and gave me a chance to develop. I 
would love to wear a Cal State L.A. jacket wherever I go around the world. I'm 
just a big kid who got lucky beyond his wildest dreams, but I am very, very 
proud of where I'm from."

SEEKING THE SUBURBAN DREAM; POLL: RESIDENTS OF SOUTH COUNTY'S MASTER-PLANNED 
COMMUNITIES SAY THEY ENJOY THEIR LIFESTYLE DESPITE LONG COMMUTES, EXPENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON and DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They drive for 20 minutes just to reach the freeway -- then commute another 30 
minutes or more to work. Their foreclosure rate is nearly twice as high as the 
rest of Orange County, and many pay extra taxes for new roads and schools. The 
promised jobs aren't there, there are no movie theaters, no gourmet 
restaurants, no teen hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest wave of suburban pioneers who headed to the foothills of south 
Orange County in the late 1980s and early '90s in search of the California 
dream firmly believe they've found it: brand-new houses in relatively 
crime-free communities centered on family life and outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Times Orange County Poll, residents of Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch 
give their communities extremely high marks for livability. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight in 10 residents view their communities very favorably, with a scant 2% 
expressing dissatisfaction. Countywide, only 58% like their towns as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfaction is far greater in these new, master-planned foothill communities 
of South County than in older Orange County cities such as Santa Ana (19%) or 
Anaheim (32%). Indeed, of the six areas surveyed since 1989, only Laguna Beach 
(87%) has a higher rating. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to the survey of 600 adult southern foothill residents 
conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates, 89% say the hopes and expectations 
they had when they moved to the area have been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suburban dream seems to be alive and well in the new communities in this 
remote corner of Orange County," said Baldassare, a UC Irvine urban 
sociologist. "These new communities seem to be filling a growing need as many 
Orange County residents today are seeking ways to separate themselves from the 
crime, gangs and urban ills they see as creeping into the older, established 
areas of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the characters in James Hilton's classic, "Lost Horizon," many residents 
of the southern foothills seem to feel they have found a suburban version of 
Shangri-La -- a comparison that ABC's "20/20" played up in a glowing 1992 
segment on Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 But others are reminded of another work of literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in South County call it Whoville, as in the Dr. Seuss book in 
which everyone in the little town is happy," said Rancho Santa Margarita 
resident Frank Young, 35. "The idea is it's a very homogenized little community 
where everyone looks, acts and dresses the same." 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Young, a mortgage banker who moved from Laguna Hills three years 
ago: "There are some definite advantages to living someplace that's nice and 
clean and well thought out." 
</P>
<P>
 The suburban paradise these nearly 40,000 foothill community residents have 
found is a maze of cul de sacs and greenbelts carved out of the sparse hills of 
what was once idyllic ranchland. 
</P>
<P>
 Red-tiled roofs march up the hillsides in tidy rows. Streets and jogging paths 
are filled with young families. And signs point the way to even newer 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what some may view as look-alike communities, there is variety here -- 
from the multimillion-dollar estates in gated Coto de Caza to the townhouses 
and apartments in Rancho Santa Margarita, the region's "urban village." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, however, have much in common. They are more likely than the 
rest of the county to be white, to own their homes, to be affluent and 
politically conservative. They are also more likely to be married, have 
children living at home, to be employed and to be younger than 55. But they are 
less likely to attend church. 
</P>
<P>
 Any negatives to living in an area so far removed from jobs, shopping and 
entertainment are, according to the poll, outweighed by the positives: their 
communities' outdoor recreation, parks and open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's public schools and the clean, new homes and neighborhoods also 
receive high marks, although critics decry their uniform appearance and strict 
community codes and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the area's remoteness is viewed as an asset, ranking at the top of what 
residents like best about living in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't hear sirens," said Craig Lipus, 38, director of sales and marketing 
for an electronics company who lives in Portola Hills. "I don't want to call 
where I live country living, but you have to really drive out to hit the hustle 
and bustle. It really is peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 Lipus, a Southern California native who moved his family to the foothills from 
Texas four years ago, recalls once driving home at 2 a.m. and seeing "the 
biggest buck deer I ever saw in my life crossing the road. And there's coyotes; 
I chased a coyote out of my back yard just before he got my kids' rabbits." 
</P>
<P>
 Their distance from urban Orange County keeps foothill residents relatively 
safe from crime; a Sheriff's Department official calls it one of the most 
crime-free areas in the county. And the newness and cleanliness of their 
communities contributes to residents' overall sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just feels like there is virtually no crime out here whatsoever," said one 
Rancho Santa Margarita resident. "My wife leaves the garage door open and the 
house unlocked when she goes to the grocery store and picks up the kids from 
school, and you can't do that at all in Garden Grove or Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the area's relative safety, foothill community residents overwhelmingly 
view their communities as a good place to raise children -- with nearly nine in 
10 strongly agreeing and virtually no one taking issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern foothill residents are far more positive about their communities' 
suitability for children than are people in South County (56%) or North County 
(36%). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice out here," said Susan Lokietz, a mother of two children, 
ages 3 and 7, who moved to Rancho Santa Margarita from Mission Viejo in 1989. 
"We have great neighborhoods, good schools and there's lots of kids and things 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the foothill communities, who are much more likely than the rest 
of the county to be raising children, also feel more secure about their kids' 
safety. Only 13% say they worry "a great deal" about their children becoming 
crime victims at school or in the neighborhood. Countywide, 43% worry a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, of course, pay a price for living in such a remote corner of Orange 
County: the frustration of spending time on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In Terrence Dooley's case, he pays a very big price indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six months, the 40-year-old Rancho Santa Margarita engineer has 
been commuting to work at UCLA. "Doing the drive is a very big drain," he said. 
"It produces a lot of stress, but you learn to cope with it." 
</P>
<P>
 And not surprisingly, because so many residents bought their homes at or near 
the height of the Southern California real estate market, poll respondents also 
listed economic issues as top concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Priestley, whose family moved to Rancho Santa Margarita from Utah in 
1990, may be typical. 
</P>
<P>
 The $207,000 house they bought is now worth less than $190,000, she said. But 
Priestley, 41, takes heart in the fact that three realtors recently called 
unsolicited to say that their house, in an area not far from the town's lake, 
would be "hot" again by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their worries, residents find enjoyment in the region's active 
outdoor lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority -- 82% -- say they are "very satisfied" with sports, 
recreation, parks and open space; only 4% are unhappy. Of those who complained 
about the lack of facilities during follow-up poll interviews, most live in 
Portola Hills, where efforts to build at least one neighborhood park have run 
into controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many compared the region's atmosphere to that of the small towns of long ago, 
an era of friendliness, support and helpfulness they say is lost in much of the 
rest of fast-paced Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real camaraderie out here," said Richard Thompson, 43, whose 
family was among the first wave of homeowners in Rancho Santa Margarita in late 
1986. "Because we were quite a way from normal shopping areas, we did a lot of 
lending. If somebody had rented a rototiller, everyone got to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real pioneer spirit out here because we were all getting started 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said much of that community spirit still exists, with five of his 
original 10 neighbors remaining on his street. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some, there's a downside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here but I think mainly it's a great place for younger people, 
young families," said Judy Gibbs, 59, who bought a condominium in Rancho Santa 
Margarita in 1988. "There's not a lot of cultural diversity either. The people 
are all the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley, the UCLA commuter, calls a few of his neighbors close-minded and 
"insular." He heard that several even complained about his drinking a beer in 
his front yard one weekend afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the level of satisfaction with movies, restaurants and entertainment in 
general is quite low, the poll showed. Only one-third say they are satisfied 
with their dining and entertainment options, compared to 57% countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 No theaters exist in any of these six communities, although plans call for 
multiscreen cinema complexes for both Rancho Santa Margarita and Foothill 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also cite a shortage of good restaurants, other than the fast food 
outlets that have sprung up in Rancho Santa Margarita's new shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to drive pretty far to get to a decent restaurant," said Coto de 
Caza resident Bill Cowdrey, 34, who often travels to Irvine or Newport Beach to 
go out to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, life is good in the southern foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thompson, the beauty of the area -- with the view of Saddleback, the 
foothills, the valley -- still overwhelms him at times. A graveyard-shift 
worker, Thompson recalls returning home one clear, beautiful morning recently 
and congratulating himself all over again on the decision to move there. 
</P>
<P>
 The view while driving home over Alicia Parkway, he said, "was just 
breathtaking." HOW THE POLL WAS DONE 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 adult residents in Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de 
Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch was 
conducted Feb. 10-13 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated 
random sample of telephone numbers was used. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of error for all respondents is plus or minus 4%. For subgroups, 
the error margin would be larger. 
</P>

 TODAY: A look at the people who live in Orange County's southern foothills -- 
and why. 
</P>

 MONDAY: The recession had a crushing impact on residents, who saw their home 
values drop, and on many developers, who had to restructure their plans.

<P>
 TUESDAY: Families are flocking to the new suburbs, where parents praise the 
many activities for youngsters. But for the teens, there's not much to do. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY: Living so far out means secluded neighborhoods and horrendous 
commutes. Though access is improving, traffic congestion remains a problem.

 There isn't much doubt that life on the county's suburban frontier is 
congenial. Eight in 10 residents have a very favorable view of their 
communities, a degree of satisfaction much stronger than that found countywide 
and in league with some local garden spots. Behind this satisfaction is a huge 
majority saying their hopes about living in their community have been realized:

NEWS ANALYSIS; IRVINE CO. QUIETLY BIDES ITS TIME IN BASE PLAN DEBATE; 
CONVERSION: REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, THE COMPANY, WITH ABOUT 4,000 ACRES NEAR 
EL TORO, STANDS TO BENEFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In all the rhetoric that has consumed planning for the afterlife of El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, including the promise of big profits from development 
there, the voice of one corporate giant has been noticeably silent: the Irvine 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest owner of undeveloped property ringing the air station, 
officials with the real estate giant have neither been stalking supervisors at 
the Hall of Administration nor have they taken sides in the roiling debate over 
whether a new commercial airport should be in El Toro's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen them anywhere," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, whose 
county office has served as home to an "El Toro encounter group" in recent 
months for various interests, from the Lincoln Club, one of Orange County's 
most politically powerful groups, to Leisure World, the senior citizen 
community in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's public silence has taken on an element of political intrigue all 
its own in some quarters, yet differs little from the reclusive personality of 
Donald Bren, whose Irvine Co. controls more than 60,000 acres in Orange County. 
Company officials say that about 4,000 of those acres are in the immediate area 
of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has maintained its neutral stance even as leaders of the Lincoln 
Club have filed an initiative seeking approval of a commercial airport through 
a vote of the people. At the same time, government officials in South County -- 
where the Irvine Co. is a dominant force -- have adamantly opposed an airport 
at El Toro, fearing increased noise and traffic to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get that kind of money by sitting pretty for long," Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley said. "Donald Bren is a pretty smart person. They are going out 
to see what's best for the Irvine Co. . . . We'll hear from them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the right time, company officials say, has not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. Vice President Monica Florian said the issue has been particularly 
vexing and presents possible development limitations for the company, whether 
or not the base becomes a new airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the different possible uses for the base have different implications. 
There is a big new universe there," Florian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said company Vice President Larry Thomas: "There are very complex questions 
that are not easily answered. Unless you do the studies, there is no simple way 
to assign whether one kind of development will be good or bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have an airport, what does it mean?" Thomas said. "Does that preclude 
other uses? If it does, does that mean the land becomes less valuable? I guess 
it depends on how the officials draw the maps." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Florian said, the company maps have always been drawn on the basis 
that El Toro would continue to operate as a military base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have decades of planning agreements with the Marines and the (adjacent) 
city of Irvine that reflect that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than participate in a potentially divisive airport initiative or join 
the vanguard of South County cities in their vocal opposition to an airport, 
Florian and Thomas said the company intends to allow the newly created El Toro 
Planning and Reuse Authority to commission studies of possible new developments 
for the base before taking a position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative may be a way to expedite the gathering of information from the 
community," Florian said, "but from personal experience it's not the kind of 
atmosphere that can necessarily get good information." 
</P>
<P>
 Florian said she shares the frustration of the local business community with 
the months it has taken to create the authority and begin planning, but the 
company has committed to participating as one of 50 members of the authority's 
executive advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a frustration on everybody's part on how to crystallize the 
decision-making process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For various reasons, chief among them being the maintenance of political 
relations with South County cities, Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond 
said the Irvine Co. would gain little by taking a strident position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've definitely been the sleeping giant in this thing," said Hammond, one 
of the city's delegates to the authority's nine-member governing board. "I know 
they are going to keep a very close eye on what's going on, but I don't think 
it would be politically wise for them to get involved now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for them to take a position that would alienate some 
(government) officials who may have to vote on their future projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond said that company officials would likely allow the planning process to 
run its course since the Irvine Co.'s status as the area's largest landholder 
leaves them in a virtual no-lose position for most any future base development. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, chairman-elect of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, said the 
company's current neutral position is reflective of a methodical and very 
"process-oriented" approach, not particularly unlike the company's corporate 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is that Monica (Florian) has been very supportive of the 
authority and the established process," Wedin said, "but I don't know what Don 
Bren or (Irvine Co. Executive Vice President) Gary Hunt might be thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the smartest thing for them to do is not to be too far out front on 
this thing and not get sucked into the fray too soon," he said. "They've got to 
be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the company's enormous real estate holdings and presence in the 
community have been difficult to ignore as the fractious debate has raged on. 
And there are some who believe the company could ultimately serve as a 
"peacemaker" when more specific and controversial land-use proposals are 
floated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to have to do it in a way that won't alienate the South County 
cities," said Anil Puri, co-director of Cal State Fullerton's Institute for 
Economic and Environmental Studies. "But at the same time, they are going to 
have to do it in a way that promotes long-term growth." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Puri said, the Irvine Co.'s silence should be a relief for local 
politicians, especially members of the Board of Supervisors, who now find 
themselves juggling the interests of a divided county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Co. might be doing the supervisors a favor by not coming to them 
now," Puri said. "I certainly would not want the biggest developer in the land 
coming to tell me what they want on top of everything else that's been 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the studies are complete, Florian and Thomas said there are few facts to 
discuss. While some may advocate plans for a commercial airport, Florian said 
little is known about "what kind of an airport. What kind of planes will fly in 
and out? What regulations will there be? There are not answers to those 
questions yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the process moves forward, there will be something more tangible to talk 
about," she said. "We are not afraid to engage community groups on matters of 
policy."

QUAKE FAILS TO SHAKE VALLEY'S HOUSING GLUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ and JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even the Northridge earthquake could put much of a dent in the San 
Fernando Valley's housing glut. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire blocks of apartments were wrecked Jan. 17, but thousands of units still 
go begging. Signs touting "1st Month Free" and "Low Move-In Costs" hang from 
buildings throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many renters evicted by the quake remain without a permanent home 
because the available apartments are either too posh, too dangerous or too far 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing authorities say most of the more than 30,000 people temporarily 
displaced by the quake have found housing, some with government assistance and 
others with their own savings. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of the Valley's working poor, the local housing market is a lot 
like the predicament of food and world hunger: There's plenty to go around, but 
a lot is in the wrong place or at too high a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could place just about anybody who walks in, but some of the areas are not 
the greatest," said Mike Baker, who works for a nonprofit social service agency 
assisting earthquake victims at a disaster assistance center in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rough neighborhoods, many refuse to move into apartments that are 
poorly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a right to decent housing," said Del Richardson of Beyond 
Shelter, one of seven nonprofit agencies now working under the Los Angeles 
Housing Authority to help displaced residents find a new home. "Even Charles 
Manson has a home." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the nation's largest disaster relief effort, the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development has set aside $200 million to help the poorest of 
those left homeless by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of families have taken advantage of the emergency help, known as 
Section 8 housing assistance, which provides an 18-month rent subsidy and 
virtually guarantees rent for landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal money, administered by the Los Angeles Housing Authority, also 
pays for social service workers to help families hunt through apartment 
listings, to drive them to see the buildings and to help negotiate with 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are still looking for the perfect apartment. In Los Angeles, for example, 
nearly 14,000 families have qualified for the federal housing subsidy, but so 
far only about 6,000 have actually used it. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that many people are trying to move to better neighborhoods, 
according to those who work at the four disaster assistance centers in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor people want the same things everyone else wants," including better 
housing and safe schools, said Jeff Farber of the Los Angeles Family Housing 
Corp., a nonprofit agency assisting earthquake victims in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no surprise that available apartments in communities such as Panorama 
City, Van Nuys and Reseda far outnumber those in Encino, Sherman Oaks and 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency housing subsidies can be applied to any apartment or house that 
meets minimum safety standards. The subsidies apply, for example, to a 
two-bedroom unit costing up to $864 and to a three-bedroom unit costing up to 
$1,167. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy rate for rental housing in the Valley before the earthquake was 
about 13%, meaning that 25,000 or so apartments were empty, mostly one- and 
two-bedroom units, according to a survey last summer by the local apartment 
owners association. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake wrecked about 3% of the apartments in the city, leaving plenty 
of empty units to house the displaced, according to city building and safety 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean the housing problems created by the earthquake can be 
easily solved. 
</P>
<P>
 One apartment complex on Parthenia Street in Northridge, for example, welcomes 
prospective tenants with huge signs and bunting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Breazell, who needs to find a home for himself, his wife and 
2-week-old baby, gave this response: "That's not a bad area if you wear 
Kevlar," referring to the material used to make bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sympathize because who wants to live in an area that's not safe?" said 
RaaataCarter, a housing relief worker in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Less understandable are the reactions of Karen Peyrot -- who will only have to 
pay $150 rent, with the government paying the balance for a two-bedroom unit 
under the Section 8 program. Social workers found her a squeaky-clean 
two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in the upscale Valley Village neighborhood of 
North Hollywood. The building has a pool and central air conditioning, and is 
about two miles from her son's school. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a visit last week, she was undecided because the balcony overlooked 
a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apartment looked nice but I don't like the view," said the unemployed 
mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers say Peyrot is not typical of the clients they try to help. But 
her position underscores the lengths to which Washington has gone to 
accommodate Southern California's earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of others, less picky, have trouble getting into even the least 
desirable apartments because they are saddled with bad credit, a record of 
evictions or a host of other troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many larger families also need affordable three- and four-bedroom homes, which 
are at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Also slowing the process are landlords who refuse to participate in the 
government-funded program. None are required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers say landlords resist filling out forms and are fearful that 
they will be forever obligated to house tenants on government relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Liz Mohler's job is to persuade Sherman Oaks-area landlords to accept 
tenants receiving the 18-month government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of false illusions about the program," said Mohler, who works 
for a nonprofit agency called On Your Feet, which offers help at the disaster 
assistance center in Sherman Oaks. Some owners are afraid they cannot evict the 
government-assisted tenants if there is trouble, and wonder what will happen 
when the government payments stop next year. 
</P>
<P>
 For many other landlords, the quake has been a boon to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Baruch, vice president of J & D Baruch Management Co., which manages 
eight apartment buildings in Studio City, Sherman Oaks and Sylmar, said the 
number of vacant apartments has fallen from nearly 60 to about a dozen since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of those vacancies were filled with tenants under the federal 
emergency subsidy program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others landlords have not been as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Papazian, who manages the Philian Apartments on Dickens Street, just a 
block south of Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, said he wonders where all 
apartment tenants who were displaced by the quake have gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Two apartments at his complex remain empty two months after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought man it would fill up like that," said Papazian, snapping his 
fingers. "But they're still empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Papazian said cost may be a factor. A one-bedroom apartment at his complex 
costs $650 a month, about $100 more than what tenants paid in less-pricey 
communities such as North Hollywood or Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has had inquiries from two prospective tenants who are eligible for 
the government subsidy. Each was qualified for a studio apartment -- at a 
maximum rent of $570 a month -- and asked for a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Papazian refused, saying, "We're not raising our rents because of the 
earthquake, but we're also not dropping them either." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Hughes, who is the executive director of the Apartment Assn. of San 
Fernando Valley/Ventura County, which represents 3,000 apartment owners, said 
the Valley streets she travels to work each morning are cluttered with 
apartment buildings with vacancy signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial boost in apartment inquiries that overwhelmed her office has since 
died off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members are beginning to call back, and they are saying that nobody is 
calling them anymore," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Isham, the executive vice president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater 
Los Angeles, might know why. His office -- which serves apartment owners south 
of the Santa Monica Mountains -- runs tenant credit checks for members. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental applications increased 23% in February over the same month last year, 
in part because of an exodus of residents from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a desire by folks to escape the trauma," Isham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matchmaking of prospective tenants and landlords is expected to improve when a 
computerized listing is installed at the city's seven disaster service centers. 
The Metropolitan Housing Bank, operating with federal funds, received approval 
last weekto buy computers that will list available housing, price, location and 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster relief workers now depend on listings from the city housing 
authority, local newspapers and their own eyes as they drive the Valley looking 
for vacancy signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulties, they have found homes for people such as Robert 
Morriss, 38, an unemployed artist who has been living in a borrowed camper 
since his Sherman Oaks apartment was declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," said Morris last Monday, the first day at his new apartment, 
also in Sherman Oaks. "Things are starting to look a little better for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Sherry Jenkins, 24, was about to cry with joy after finally 
finding an apartment for her herself and her three children. The mother, who is 
receiving welfare payments, said she had been living in her car for more than a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A weight has been lifted off my shoulders," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the immediate successes of the federally funded program, Barbara 
Zeidman, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles City Housing Department, 
said policy-makers should be planning for the future, when the government help 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the great unknown is not where we are today, but where are we going to 
be in 15 months," when the 18-month government subsidies end, Zeidman said. 
"There is no doubt that when they expire, many will not be able to afford to 
stay where they are."

THE NEW PIONEERS; LATEST SETTLERS STAKE CLAIMS; GROWTH: THOSE FLOCKING TO ONE

 "We find ourselves suddenly threatened by hordes of Yankee immigrants . . . 
whose progress we cannot arrest."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pio Pico, California's last Mexican governor before American conquest in 
1846. 
</P>
<P>
 They began lining up near the sales offices days -- even weeks -- before new 
housing phases went on sale. Hundreds of them, camping out in tents, sleeping 
bags and motor homes, waiting for the chance to buy into a new community 
literally being built from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 Like latter-day Forty-Niners, they were staking their claims on a piece of a 
California dream-in-the-making: Rancho Santa Margarita, in 1986 Orange County's 
newest master-planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by home prices ranging from $55,000 to $200,000 and the promise of new 
schools, shops and businesses, they descended upon this burgeoning community 
nestled between the hills of Mission Viejo and the landmark Saddleback peaks 
looming up behind the red-tiled roofs like a painted Hollywood backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita was the latest incarnation of the good life, Orange 
County style: Boating on the manufactured lake, jogging and bicycling on scenic 
paths. Tennis, swimming, golf, fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly eight years after the first suburban settlers moved in, Rancho Santa 
Margarita continues to promote itself as a "place where life is meant to be 
enjoyed" and potential homeowners still camp out for new homes now priced from 
$90,000 to more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of this "urban village" and those of the adjoining residential 
developments that have sprung up in the foothills of South County are riding 
the wave of development in one of the county's final frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are basically the suburbs of suburbs," says UC Irvine urban sociologist 
Mark Baldassare. "First we had residents fleeing the urban areas of Los Angeles 
for Orange County. Later on we had the movement of people from north to south 
Orange County, and today we're seeing residents throughout what has become a 
very urban Orange County seeking the new suburbs in the southern foothills of 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Residential development in these remote hill areas is part of the gradual but 
inevitable shift southward in the wake of the tidal wave of growth that swept 
over Orange County in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 From the postwar bedroom communities of North County, which transformed what 
had essentially been an agricultural county with separate and distinct 
communities into a suburban sprawl, the county has evolved into a 
multi-centered metropolitan region that requires a new definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it postsuburban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other conceptual alternative -- rural, urban or suburban -- accurately 
describes the nature of settlement space in Orange County," says Spencer Olin, 
a professor of history at UC Irvine and co-author of "Postsuburban California: 
The Transformation of Orange County Since World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Olin says the "urban village" concept of 5,000-acre Rancho Santa Margarita -- 
which eventually will enable even more residents the option of living and 
working in the same community -- is consistent with the overall trend in Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the notion of Orange County as a "bedroom community" for people 
working in Los Angeles is as outmoded as white gravel rooftops and tail fins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistics indicate a vast majority of residents in Orange County now work in 
Orange County, which distinguishes the county today from what it was in the 
'60s," Olin says. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 1991 book, Olin and his co-authors identify 21 other counties with 
characteristics similar to Orange County, ranging from California's Santa Clara 
County to Suffolk County in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more metropolitan regions in America -- and perhaps western Europe 
as well -- will look and act like Orange County in the future," Olin says. 
"They are sprawling, multi-centered regions which, while lacking an urban core, 
nonetheless possess the economic vitality, technological dynamism and cultural 
diversity formerly associated only with major central cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Olin cites the Irvine Co.'s creation of Irvine -- "a bold departure in 
community planning and building" -- as a prototypal example of this 
"post-suburban spatial organization" that has been emulated by other 
development companies within the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin and his colleagues, UCI professors Rob Kling and Mark Poster, write that 
Irvine, "by design, has no downtown but is a deconcentrated mosaic of 
residential villages, small shopping centers and industrial parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., according to Olin, successfully marketed this "dynamic 
post-suburban complex" as a "carefully planned, middle-class, suburban utopia," 
projecting images of "neatly landscaped communities, convivial village life, 
freedom from crime and congestion, upscale consumer conveniences, and other 
pleasant amenities" -- all of which other developers adopted in their marketing 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision of a utopian lifestyle has been a common theme in Orange County's 
growth and development since the boom of the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the arrival of freeways would help spur unprecedented development in 
Orange County nearly a century later, the arrival of the Southern Pacific and 
Santa Fe railroads in the late 1870s paved the way for the development of 
Fullerton, Buena Park, Villa Park, Aliso City (now Lake Forest) and Capistrano 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons the 1880s was such a predominant and successful period of 
development can be credited to a concept that would reach an art form in the 
20th Century: marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County," says historian Pamela Hallan-Gibson, "was somewhat of a 
promoter's paradise in the boom of the 1880s." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallan-Gibson, author of "The Golden Promise: An Illustrated History of Orange 
County," says there were many reasons for that: "Orange County had a good 
agricultural economy, had fairly secure water supplies thanks to wells, a mild 
climate and a real active group of supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a promotional brochure published by the Santa Ana Valley Immigration 
Assn. in 1885 extolled the virtues of the Santa Ana Valley, "where so lately 
the wildflowers bloomed and died and bloomed again in undisturbed luxuriance, 
tasteful and often elegant homes are springing up, surrounded by orchards and 
vineyards, which promise rich returns in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Observes Hallan-Gibson with a laugh: "Now doesn't that just make you want to 
put down your snow shovel and come out?" 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of the Pacific Electric Red Cars into Orange County from Los 
Angeles after the turn of the century spurred another boom as thousands of 
tourists and vacationing Angelenos were given a taste of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really made a lot of people aware of Orange County who hadn't really been 
in the past," says Hallan-Gibson. And everywhere the Red Cars went, she says, 
"land values went up and people started subdividing." 
</P>
<P>
 The completion of Pacific Coast Highway in the late 1920s resulted in 
residential developments in San Clemente and Dana Point. The grand opening of 
the sale of land in Dana Point in 1924 drew a crowd of thousands who came to 
hear a band concert, eat a free barbecue and listen to a pitch to buy 
60-by-100-foot lots for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression curtailed further development in the county, but World War II 
set the stage for the biggest boom of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the thousands of servicemen who passed through the Santa Ana Army Air 
Base, the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and a handful of other military 
installations during the war had succumbed to the allure of the county's mild 
climate and the scent of orange blossoms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 As returning veterans looking for homes, jobs and prospects, they viewed 
Orange County as a golden opportunity for creating better lives for themselves 
and their families. As Hallan-Gibson writes in "The Golden Promise": "A human 
tsunami swept over Orange County in the 1950s, taking much of the old culture 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1950 and 1960, the county's population would swell from 220,000 to 
704,000. In 1956 alone, according to Hallan-Gibson, the population jumped 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's growth -- residential as well as industrial -- was so 
overwhelming by the mid-'60s that a writer for Orange County Illustrated was 
prompted to ponder: "Are we to destroy the very things we sought?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the breakup of the old ranchos on former Mexican land grants caused 
North County to begin developing a century earlier, much of remote South County 
had remained in private hands as ranches owned by the Irvine family, the 
O'Neill/Moiso family and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But such large-scale land ownership provided the opportunity to experiment in 
planned community design and development, beginning with the Irvine Co. in the 
early '60s and moving into the planned communities of Mission Viejo, Rancho 
Santa Margarita, Aliso Viejo and Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Steven Kellenberg, vice president of PBR, an Irvine-based community 
planning consulting firm: "Orange County does have a tradition at least since 
the early 1960s of quality planned community development. There is probably a 
higher concentration of planned communities in Orange County than in anywhere 
else in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellenberg, whose firm has supported the Santa Margarita Co. in its planning 
activities since the community was conceived in the early '80s, says Rancho 
Santa Margarita was designed with the idea of providing the best that planned 
communities had to offer: a balance between jobs and housing, the idea of an 
urban village in an open-space setting and a strong pedestrian orientation in 
terms of being able to bicycle and walk to community services, jobs, dining and 
entertainment, parks, day care and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the trends clearly are toward more pedestrian orientation in new and 
existing communities," says Kellenberg, who believes Orange County will 
continue to be a "laboratory for new community design concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the '50s bedroom communities of North County, which "were oriented 
toward meeting the needs of a postwar society rapidly with very high housing 
production at a moderate cost," Kellenberg says, "we've moved past that in 
recent decades and we are looking for communities that are more supportive of 
the lifestyles of the residents, that are more user-friendly, that provide a 
stronger sense of place and are less automobile-dominated." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned community, he says, "provides the opportunity to reinvent the 
suburbs and, more than ever before, cities and counties with smaller-scale land 
ownership are now searching for ways to do that." The Hills Are Alive . . . 
with Young, Upscale Professionals 
</P>
<P>
 Do people living in the southern suburbs differ from the rest of the county's 
residents? They do, in several ways. They are more likely to be upscale and 
educated, to work in professional/managerial jobs and to have higher incomes 
than the rest of the county. Foothill dwellers are more likely to be white, 
married with children, California-born, and to have come here before 1975 if 
they are foreign-born. Here's how those living in the three separate ZIP codes 
that comprise the southern foothills compare to the county as a whole:

THE NEW PIONEERS; FOR A MAJORITY OF SUBURBANITES, POLITICAL LINES FORM TO THE 
RIGHT

 One political consultant calls it "Republican heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Times Orange County Poll, residents of the southern foothill 
communities are very conservative, even by Orange County standards.Fifty-three 
percent of foothill respondents said they were conservative, in fact, compared 
to 44% in a recent countywide survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Tom Hayden's getting many supporters out in the new towns," 
quipped UC Irvine urban sociologist Mark Baldassare, who conducted the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only 17% of poll respondents in the new communities described 
themselves as liberal, opposed to 28% countywide. And those who said they were 
very liberal in the new survey numbered fewer than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like this who are fleeing the urban problems of northern Orange County 
and the rest of Southern California probably would tend to be more 
conservative," Baldassare said. "There is an affluent, white, 
upper-middle-class group of people that has defined these new towns as their 
new homes, and they're a pretty conservative bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The political findings should be no surprise, said political consultant Mark 
Thompson, who called the area a "Republican heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who moved out there because they are probably fairly 
conservative in many aspects of their lives, not just politically," Thompson 
said. "Many are middle- and upper-income folks who wanted to get away from the 
urban areas and get into a nice, clean, safe environment that emphasizes family 
values. They are not your typical risk takers."

THE NEW PIONEERS; QUESTION OF BELIEFS; PASTORS SAY LOW ATTENDANCE AT SERVICES 
MAY BE TESTAMENT TO AREA'S HECTIC PACE

<P>
 Just around the corner from his small, neighborhood church in Rancho Santa 
Margarita lies a grassy field that Pastor Mike Beals tries hard not to resent. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here on Sunday mornings that Little League and youth soccer games draw 
hundreds of boisterous children and their parents -- including a few of Beals' 
parishioners -- away from services at Mission Hills Christian Center, a 
nondenominational, evangelical church. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a real shift in children's sports toward Sunday activities," 
Beals said. "The church is put in the position of competing directly with 
organized sports, especially in this area where other factors also make it 
tough to get people here on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing popularity of youth sports may be one reason that The Times Poll 
of residents in Orange County's southern foothills shows a relatively low rate 
of attendance at religious services. 
</P>
<P>
 On three questions concerning religious issues -- including the overall 
importance of religious matters, attendance at churches or synagogues, and the 
numbers of evangelical Christians -- the results indicated residents of Rancho 
Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and 
Robinson Ranch were generally less religious than Orange County as a whole. 
Countywide, 42% attended church or synagogue in the past seven days as opposed 
to 34% in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people get busy, many just tend to put God on the back shelf," said Gary 
Kusunoki, senior pastor of Calvary Chapel in Rancho Santa Margarita. "And these 
people out here are certainly busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita resident Paul Sandner, 39, puts it another way: "In our 
case, I think you'd have to chalk it up to just plain being lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 On only one question related to religion -- membership in a church or 
synagogue -- did the answers of poll respondents concur with the county as a 
whole. Fifty percent of respondents to the new survey described themselves as 
members of a religious institution, virtually identical to the 51% who 
responded in kind to a countywide 1991 Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Times pollster Mark Baldassare and others pointed to a variety of reasons, 
ranging from the region's many young adults struggling to balance the demands 
of children and careers to the seductive pull of the area's spectacular 
mountains, lakes and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is so family- and neighborhood-oriented and we tend to associate 
those characteristics with religion and church-going," said Baldassare, an 
urban sociologist at UC Irvine. "But so far, it appears to be a community where 
people spend more time outdoors on weekends than they do indoors in churches." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the foothills area boasts numerous churches, including the huge 
Saddleback Valley Community Church in Foothill Ranch, with Sunday attendance of 
about 8,000 and San Francisco Solano Catholic Church in Rancho Santa Margarita, 
which has about 4,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 And, given the exigencies of life for many residents, San Francisco Solano's 
Father Michael Pecharch says he finds it remarkable that his parishioners 
manage to be as active in the church as they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have many young families, with both parents working in order to buy out 
here, and often driving very long commutes," Pecharch said. "Given that, we 
have an amazing amount of young families involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Priestley knows well just how difficult it can be to make it to church 
each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Priestley, 41, of Rancho Santa Margarita said she doesn't attend services at 
the nearby Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because she works part 
time at Mervyn's on Sundays in addition to her full-time, weekday job as an 
office receptionist. She said her family, who moved from Utah in late 1990 and 
bought a house near the peak of the Southern California market, needs the 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, her husband and two children are regulars at the Sunday services, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastors interviewed said the challenges involved in bringing in worshipers 
also include the age of the residents. Rancho Santa Margarita, for instance, is 
made up largely of baby boomers, a generation that has tended to be suspicious 
of organized religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many of the area's residents are forced to spend long hours commuting 
during the week, prompting a desire to stay very close to home on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Beals: "They really just want to stay home and enjoy their quarter-acre."

borders. Below are the requirements (number of copies of applications and 
photos, amount of fees) to obtain visas for many countries in Africa.They may 
be obtained from the appropriate consulates or embassies in the traveler's 
area, or by using a variety of commercial services that charge additional fees 
and are usually listed under "passport and visa services" in the telephone 
directory. Next week: visas for Asia and the former Soviet republics.

<P>
 A new toll-free telephone number will take the place of both.

ON 'TRAVELING IN STYLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hope I am the first to congratulate The Times on publication of "Flying 
Blind" by Jim McLain in "Traveling in Style" (March 6). It is the best piece of 
writing since "The Peter Principle" launched The Times Magazine into orbit a 
couple decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I may be prejudiced. As a former aviation editor and current travel writer 
whose 77-year-old eyesight is failing, I empathize deeply with the author. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that, if my time comes for darkness, I can display Jim McLain's courage 
and (may I say?) outlook.

 Thank you, thank you, for "Traveling in Style." Every article was interesting 
and informative and each destination was affordable. I want to go to Istanbul 
and New Orleans and the French Riviera and Veracruz and St. Petersburg! 
Congratulations. I'm looking forward to the next issue.

 Regarding Istanbul's bazaars: I spent two enjoyable years in Istanbul, 
courtesy of the U.S. Air Force. Both bazaars are fascinating. The Spice Bazaar 
has a restaurant on the second floor, with all the aromas, charm and food of 
Istanbul. What it "misses" is tourists -- another plus. 
</P>
<P>
 And about the merchant's son who was able to sell pearls in six languages: 
"Our" bazaar merchant, a Romanian Jew, spoke 13 languages -- including six 
mother tongues (Latino, Hebrew, French, Romanian, Hungarian and German) and 
several others needed to conduct business in Turkey, including Turkish, Greek, 
Bulgarian, Armenian, English and Russian. After you conquer the first 10, the 
rest comes easy.

 Regarding the illustration that accompanied the article on Istanbul: I find 
the reference to the ferries docked near the Galata Bridge erroneous. These 
ferries provide transportation to the Asian side of the city located across the 
Bosporus. The Golden Horn is a relatively small inlet which is crossed by the 
Galata and Ataturk bridges. Small water taxis serve its shores.

ALASKA WAKE-UP CALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding James L. Vermillion's letter on not boycotting the state of Alaska, 
but appealing to the Alaskan Division of Tourism instead (March 13): I want to 
point out how much more complex it is than that. I do understand how harsh a 
boycott could be on the small businesses of Alaska, but at the same time we 
desperately need all of those Alaskan citizens to be very active in the 
preservation of their native plant and animal species, in this particular case, 
the wolf. Perhaps a boycott could be a "wake-up" call to these Alaskan citizens 
to take the matter of the Alaskan ecological welfare into their own hands.

ROAD LESS TRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have just read "Exploring Ancient Mysteries in Petra" (Feb. 13). Two years 
ago, I rode into Petra on a horse led by a Jordanian "guide."The horse stumbled 
and the "guide" grumbled all the way into and out of the valley, as we passed 
vestiges of a very good Roman road. It was not a comfortable experience for 
someone in his late 70s! 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, I learned that the road used by tourists is not the only 
road into the site. At the other end of the valley there is a road used by the 
trucks that supply the many concession stands catering to the tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra is a magnificent sight, but it would be just as magnificent if one could 
go in by shuttle bus on the truck road. Forcing tourists to enter on foot or on 
horseback when there is an alternative is ridiculous.

 I was offended by the comments made about the British in "India's Portugal" 
(Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, Barry Zwick doesn't seem to like the British very much.Maybe 
he had some personal differences with them on his trip or maybe Mr. Zwick is 
like the typical American abroad -- loud, excessive and a spendthrift. That 
would surely make him unpopular with my fellow countrymen.

 Regarding "India's Portugal": I have never read a travel article that made me 
not want to go to the destination being written about more than this one. Why 
would any woman want to go somewhere that has government-sponsored "leering 
expeditions" at their beaches? I for one don't need to go all the way to India 
to get leered at. It happens right here in L.A. as I go about my daily 
business, fully clothed.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; NEW HOSTEL HAS IRISH EYES SMILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Belfast International Youth Hostel is due to open April 1 in a 
convenient central location in Northern Ireland's capital. The 128-bed hostel, 
at 22 Donegall Road (from the United States, phone 011-44-232-324733), is near 
Queen's University, the Ulster Museum and the Botanic Rail Station. Two- and 
four-bedded rooms start at $11.75 per night. Three family rooms, each with six 
beds, are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostel's central location -- and the fact that it will be open 24 hours, 
with a security officer on duty -- is a boon for backpackers who arrive in 
off-hours. Belfast lacks public luggage-storage facilities due to its political 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Belfast youth hostel, which is closing at the end of this month, was 
about 2 1/2 miles outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Security may well be on the minds of novice visitors to Belfast. According to 
the authors of the 1994 edition of "Let's Go: Ireland" (Harvard Student 
Agencies; $15.99), "Belfast is actually safer for tourists than most American 
cities. The city center, the 'Golden Mile,' and the university area to its 
south rarely see any trouble." They warn, however, that West Belfast, "full of 
joblessness, anger and amazing political art, should only be seen by day." 
</P>
<P>
 The 384-page guidebook also advises travelers of areas in which not to walk or 
hitchhike at night, and warns them to avoid taking photos of the military, to 
cross borders only at approved checkpoints and to avoid big cities when large 
marches are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who travel to any Irish port by sea can often get discounts with their 
student, youth or youth hostel membership card. There are ferry services 
directly to Belfast from Liverpool, England, and to Larne (five miles from 
Belfast) from Stranraer, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lines -- B & I and Sealink -- offer members of Hostelling International a 
25% discount. B & I also offers a 25% discount to International Student 
Identity Card holders and a 50% discount to students who purchase a special 
Travelsave stamp from the Irish Student Travel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Youth Hostels Assn. of Northern Ireland (YHANI) and the 
Northern Ireland Tourist Board introduced a new computerized booking system for 
the seven YHANI hostels in Northern Ireland. It's now possible to go into any 
tourist information center in Ireland and, for a small fee, make a reservation 
for a bed in any YHANI hostel. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Belfast, the fee for a bed averages about $9 per night. Although 
most guests are under 25, there are no age restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Ireland is barely 85 miles from north to south and slightly wider 
east to west. One of the country's most popular tourist sites is the Giant's 
Causeway. Formed by volcanic activity, it consists of 38,000 tightly packed 
columns, some of them 40 feet tall, which form stepping stones to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The following hostels, all of them inspected by the tourist board, are 
situated near the Giant's Causeway: 
</P>
<P>
 * YHANI Whitepark Bay Youth Hostel, Whitepark Road, Ballintoy, is seven miles 
from the Causeway. It has 44 beds, and rates start at $8.75. 
</P>
<P>
 * McCool's Independent Youth Hostel, 5 Causeway View Terrace, Portruksh, 
actually has a view of the Causeway. It has 14 beds, and rates start at $9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Causeway Coast Independent Hostel, 4 Victoria Terrace, Portstewart, has a 
direct bus link to Giant's Causeway from the hostel. Beds start at $7.35. 
</P>
<P>

VALLEY BRIEFING: MOVING MOUNTAINS; THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE SURROUNDING THE 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Researched by JULIE SHEER / Los Angeles Times

 Craggy or rounded, green or purple, the mountains that ring the San Fernando 
Valley have many faces. Although their geologic histories are similar, the 
Santa Susanas and the Santa Monicas are youngsters compared to the granddaddy 
of our mountains, the San Gabriels. 
</P>
<P>
 Before there was a San Fernando Valley, seas covered the area and dried up, 
leaving sediment that turned into rock. Underwater volcanoes erupted to the 
west, spewing lava. Then the tremendous forces that move continents caused land 
to fold and uplift, creating the mountains. The mountains we see today began 
pushing up about 4 million years ago, eroding into the ranges that Valley 
residents know. Geologists attribute the existence of these mountains of the 
Transverse Range to the same forces that cause earthquakes on "low-angle thrust 
defaults" similar to the one that caused the Northridge quake. Quakes in these 
areas can create mountains or raise ranges that already exist. The Santa 
Susanas rose about 15 inches in the Jan. 17 quake. The 1971 Sylmar quake, also 
on a thrust fault, lifted the San Gabriels three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountains are still rising and eroding, and evidence of earth-moving 
activity miles below the ground is visible in many areas. The San Andreas fault 
can be seen in the Antelope Valley, and other faults are visible in road cuts 
around Chatsworth. Layers of ancient sedimentary rock, often tilted from past 
quakes, are noticeable at many places throughout the mountains. What Caused Our 
Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 When plates collide rather than slide horizontally past each other, rocks will 
either fault (crack), or fold upward, forming mountains. In our region, 
earthquakes on low-angle thrust faults have caused rocks to move vertically, as 
well as horizontally. This results in the horizontal layers of sedimentary 
rock, or strata, at the surface to be pushed up. The buckling forms an arch 
called an anticline, visible as the upswept mountains that surround the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists categorize folds and, according to some geologists, the mountains 
here are the result of "fault propagation folds." Similar to a rug on a floor 
being pushed together, rock layers that were once flat have been pushed up when 
one block rises over another at a thrust fault. What They Are Made Of 
</P>
<P>
 The mountains are made up of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rock. Some 
sedimentary layers are horizontal but most are tilted and twisted due to 
folding and uplift from quakes. Sedimentary rock is youngest and metamorphic 
rock, which is the core of the mountains, is oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedimentary 
</P>
<P>
 The result of weathering and erosion, these rocks formed from materials that 
were once part of older rocks, plants and animals. They accumulated in layers 
called strata and hardened. Most in our mountains are less than 18 million 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sandstone: Natural chemical substances cement grains of sand together. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shale: Clay is compressed into thin, hard layers, which often split apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conglomerate: Naturally cemented gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Igneous 
</P>
<P>
 Rock that has solidified from a molten or nearly molten state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Granite: Hard, coarsely crystalline rock that makes up most of the Earth's 
continental crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Metamorphic 
</P>
<P>
 Sedimentary and igneous rock that changed due to heat or mountain-building 
movements deep in the Earth's crust, geologists call this "basement" rock. It 
makes up the core of our mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gneiss: Formed from metamorphism of granite, causing feldspar and quartz 
crystals to form layers between which mica crystals often lie in wavy bands. 
Where They Are Headed 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists divide California into "geomorphic" regions. The Transverse Ranges 
east-west, the opposite of most other western ranges, which run north-south. 
Many geologists believe the Transverse Ranges used to run north-south before 
rotating 90 degrees starting about 14 million years ago. They believe this was 
caused by isolated blocks of rock caught between the southeastward-moving North 
American plate and northwestward-moving Pacific plate. According to this 
theory, the twisting opened the space now occupied by the Los Angeles Basin. 
Santa Susana Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 30 miles long, 16 miles wide at longest point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highest point: Oat Mountains, 3,747 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appearance: Brushy slopes made up of young, sedimentary rock. The oldest 
exposed rock is 15 million years old. Very little metamorphic rock is exposed. 
Vegetation is abundant because sedimentary rock allows good soil to build up 
quickly and good chaparral cover to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: About 3 million years ago, a large river created a delta in what is 
now the Santa Susanas and Simi Valley. The river existed until about 700,000 
years ago, when seismic forces squeezed the area up, forming the Santa Susanas. 
The mountains lifted so quickly the river couldn't cut through the range and 
was forced to the north, forming the Santa Clara River. San Gabriel Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 64 miles long, 24 miles at widest point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highest point: Mt. San Antonio, 10,064 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appearance: Erosion is deeper than other ranges, exposing older metamorphic 
and igneous rock such as granite and gneiss, giving the mountains their rocky, 
craggy look. Vegetation is sparse since there is little soil in which seeds can 
germinate. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: Igneous rocks in the range area age 80 million to 1.2 billion 
years, and some metamorphic rocks are older than 1.5 billion years. Lifting 
began 45 million years ago; by 25 million years ago, the mountains were fairly 
large. Rapid uplift has taken place in the last 5 million years. Since at least 
80 million years ago, about 12 miles of rock has been eroded and deposited into 
the Santa Monica Bay. Verdugo Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 14 miles long, 5 miles at widest point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highest point: Verdugo Peak, 3,126 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appearance: Exposed granite that formed 200 million years ago is visible. 
The Verdugos are considered the foothills of the San Gabriels, so their rock 
content is similar. They have the same geologic history of erosion of 
sedimentary layers. Santa Monica Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: 50 miles long, 10 miles at widest point 
</P>
<P>
 * Highest point: Sandstone Peak, 3,111 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appearance: Tilted sedimentary rock, predominantly sandstone and shale, is 
rounded because it is young and less eroded. Underlying granite, the oldest 
rock, can be seen where they have been exposed by erosion in Griffith Park. 
Dark Santa Monica slates are visible in Topanga State Park and in road cuts 
along the San Diego Freeway. Brown or reddish volcanic rock can be seen in the 
western part of the range. Modelo shale, which forms a mantle over the older 
rock layers on the north flank, is the youngest formation, containing fish and 
seaweed fossiles. Chaparral thrives in sedimentary soils of the steep 
hillsides. Formation of the Santa Monicas 
</P>
<P>
 This geologic timeline highlights some of the events that formed the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Histories of other ranges parallel this one, although some 
rock is much older. Years on the timeline are approximate. 
</P>
<P>
 140 million years ago: Slates in area that is now Santa Monicas are formed 
when mud or shale is deposited beneath a shallow sea. 
</P>
<P>
 140 million years ago: Oldest known bird, Archaeopteryx, the size of a crow, 
flew the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 120 million years ago: Molten rock bakes sedimentary shales into slates and 
cools into granite. 
</P>
<P>
 90 million years ago: Period of uplift and erosion, with seas covering the 
land. Marine rocks that formed the cliffs in lower Topanga Canyon are 
deposited. 
</P>
<P>
 80 million years ago: Eroded area begins to be covered by oceanic sedimentary 
rock. Area begins long period under water.  
</P>
<P>
 63 million years ago: Mammals became the dominant animals on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 60 million years ago: Another cycle of erosion begins and then another return 
of the sea, laying down sedimentary rocks of marine origin, which can be seen 
from Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 25 million years ago: Western part of range remains under water for another 10 
million years. 
</P>
<P>
 15 million years ago: Underwater volcanoes near Conejo Mountain erupt, spewing 
lava, now visible as rock in Conejo Valley and Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 13 million years ago: Volcano becomes extinct. Area again drops under water 
and remains that way for about 10 million years 
</P>
<P>
 5 million years ago to present: Seas recede. Compression pushes land up, 
causing the folded and faulted rocks we see today. 
</P>
<P>
 2 million years ago: Modern human beings develop and the Ice Age begins.

SMALL FISH MAY PLAY BIG PART IN FATE OF LAGOON; ENVIRONMENT: THE GOBY IS 
GETTING STAR TREATMENT. ACTIVISTS PREDICT ITS INCLUSION ON THE FEDERAL 
ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST WILL BE THE IMPETUS FOR CLEANING UP THE WATER NEAR 
MALIBU CREEK. 
</P>

<P>
 It is a tiny, unremarkable fish that feeds off microorganisms at the bottom of 
estuaries. But the unsung goby, environmentalists predict, just might provide 
the impetus for a solution to the decade-long controversy over how to clean up 
and restore Malibu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month since the goby was added to the federal endangered species list, 
residents, surfers, environmentalists and government agencies have been waiting 
to see how the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife plans to ensure the 
survival of the two-inch-long fish, which lives and breeds in the brackish, 
polluted lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain the goby's habitat, the state Department of Parks and Recreation 
is expected to adopt the fish and wildlife department's guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is expected to call for strict regulation of mechanical breaching of 
a sandy berm that separates the lagoon from the ocean. State parks department 
employees bulldoze sections of the berm when the lagoon water reaches the brim 
so that septic tanks that feed into the lagoon do not back up. 
</P>
<P>
 But breaching the berm can harm the goby because the practice upsets the 
balance of salt and fresh water in the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, due in a few months, probably won't include recommendations to 
eliminate the lagoon's bacteria and disease-causing microorganisms because such 
pathogens have been found to not harm the goby. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists nevertheless are optimistic that the goby may indirectly 
help the movement to clean up the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 If closely regulated breaching can be achieved to protect the goby, the 
thinking goes, then clearing the bureaucratic wrangling among government 
agencies that has blocked the cleaning up of the lagoon can't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the (federal endangered species) listing is going to be the driving 
force and catalyst to get restoration going," said Mark Gold, scientist for 
Heal the Bay. "Hopefully it will also get us off the dime to clean up the storm 
drain runoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The goby has disappeared from half of California's few remaining wetlands and 
has been listed as a "state species of special concern" by the state Fish and 
Game Department for more than five years. Tidewater goby live in estuaries from 
Humboldt to San Diego counties, where, according to Cat Brown, a wildlife 
biologist with the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, they are in imminent 
danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The goby died off in the lagoon in the 1960s when the dredging of Malibu Creek 
and bulldozing of the upper lagoon for flood control covered the course, sandy 
bottom of the lagoon with sediment, destroying the goby's nesting area, said 
Sean Manion, an ecologist with the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, Manion, using an $18,000 state parks department grant, 
reintroduced 52 goby to the Malibu Lagoon. They have reproduced to 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'What is so special about the goby?' " Manion said. "It's just 
one more cog in the wheel of biodiversity interconnected to all other species 
ecologically, including man. The fear ecologists have is that you take a 
species out and there will be an environmental ripple effect or a cascade of 
extinctions to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The lagoon, located at the mouth of Malibu Creek at Surfrider Beach, has been 
polluted by treated sewage flowing in from the Tapia Water Reclamation Plant 
along the creek as well as pesticides and human and animal waste from 
communities upstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pollutants have had little effect on the goby, whose worst threat 
is the rapid increase of water salinity brought on by breaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks employees began bulldozing the berm in 1983 after Malibu residents 
complained that their septic tanks were backing up. The berm is breached 
whenever the water level of the lagoon reaches 3.5 feet above the average low 
tide, Manion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers, or "the shovel brigade," as they have been nicknamed, dig out their 
own break to avoid natural breaching, which occurs in the middle of Surfrider 
Beach's long wave break. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists believe surfers pose the greatest threat to the goby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad situation," said Rainer Hoenecke, a scientist for the Santa Monica 
Bay Restoration Project. "You are going to have to keep an officer posted there 
to keep surfers from shoveling out breaks."

HOW OPPOSITES ATTRACT; POLITICS: AN ADVOCATE FOR ISRAEL AND A SUPPORTER OF ARAB 
CAUSES ARE WORKING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. MEL LEVINE AND 
JAMES ZOGBY HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES, BUT THEY'RE DOING BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Westside Congressman Mel Levine, a leading advocate for Israel, and 
James Zogby, a prominent supporter of Arab causes, used to have very little in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 They often tangled on TV and at Democratic Party conclaves over their wildly 
different views on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, they're in the odd position of sharing the presidency of 
Builders for Peace, a nonprofit organization devoted to attracting American 
investment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our differences about the past and we have our differences about the 
future, but right now our focus is on making the present work," said Zogby, 
president of the Washington-based Arab American Institute, which researches 
policy issues and trains grass-roots political organizers in Arab-American 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Washington, Builders for Peace was set up by Vice President Al Gore 
after President Clinton called on Arab and Jewish Americans gathered for the 
signing of the Sept. 13, 1993, peace accords between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization to help keep the process moving. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the group has taken a delegation of Arab- and Jewish-Americans to the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The group also plans to organize a visit to 
the United States by Palestinian businessmen in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hands have been shaken on half a dozen business deals, more progress 
will have to wait until the turmoil subsides following the Feb. 25 massacre of 
dozens of Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron, both men said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the informal deals have included forming garment manufacturing and 
pharmaceutical firms in Gaza and the West Bank and building a hotel on the Gaza 
beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been talk of selling Palestinian crafts on an American TV 
shopping network, setting up an investment fund, building housing for 
Palestinian refugees and developing a corps of young Americans with management 
and business skills to help modernize the Palestinian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the sides disagree on major issues, such as the establishment of a 
Palestinian state, "we both believe very strongly that economic development is 
very important to the success of the peace process," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work is ongoing," Zogby said. "We're not waiting for implementation (of 
the accords) to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with a Palestinian state," said Merv Adelson, an 
entertainment mogul on the Builders board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to do with strengthening the peace that has been negotiated through 
strengthening the economic situation of the Palestinians," Adelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to create jobs with the hopes of getting the people off the 
streets and busy doing something and improving their way of life," said Jesse 
Awaida, a Middle East-born computer businessman now based in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperation of Levine and Zogby is a long way from the days when, at the 
1988 Democratic Convention, they debated the party's Mideast platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had my toughest debates with Zogby," said Levine, who, after losing 
the Democratic Senate primary in 1992 to Barbara Boxer, returned to Los Angeles 
as a partner in the venerable law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. "We always 
fought a lot but I respected his ability." 
</P>
<P>
 These days the pair, both Little League coaches, have found a common love: 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk baseball," Levine said, "and even Middle East politics once in a 
while."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City resident Ed Little has been appointed to the board of directors of 
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He will represent the West Basin Municipal Water District, which serves nearly 
1 million people from the South Bay to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Little became active in water issues when he worked to have the West Basin 
district include Culver City in the early 1950s. Since then, he has served on 
the county Resources and Reclamation Advisory Commission. For the past five 
years, he has been a member of the West Basin board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently retired from operating Ed Little Auto Service in Culver City. He 
is a USC graduate and has served as a member of several Culver City 
philanthropic organizations.

POLITICS; GROWTH, CLERK'S PAY KEY TO CULVER CITY ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what looks like a repeat of Culver City's 1992 elections, growth issues are 
dominating the debate this year among the four candidates seeking two City 
Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something else: The city clerk's race, usually a non-event, is 
downright contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Pauline Dolce is being challenged for the first time in her 16-year 
tenure. Her opponent, computer consultant Tom Crunk, has taken aim at her for 
opposing a council decision in January to drastically cut her $75,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunk says the cut, which will reduce the clerk's monthly pay from $6,327 to 
$732 in 1996, was long overdue. But Dolce disagrees, saying her pay is 
justified by her wide-ranging duties. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, to be sure, a variety of other issues at stake in Culver City's 
April 12 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In votes on two binding ballot questions, for instance, residents will decide 
whether to limit council members to two consecutive four-year terms, and 
whether to transfer the city clerk's financial accounting responsibilities to 
the city treasurer's office. The term limits are intended to ensure fresh 
perspectives on the council, and the accounting move would help streamline 
operations, said Councilman Albert Vera, who co-sponsored the measures with 
Councilman Steven Gourley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the City Council race, Mayor Mike Balkman, a pro-growth candidate and 
president of an electrical contracting firm, is seeking his second four-year 
term on the five-member council. Balkman proudly points to his support for 
renewal projects under way to build a new City Hall and renovate downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are film company controller Richard Marcus, attorney Ed 
Wolkowitzand Jim Hilfenhaus, a political organizer. Councilwoman Jozelle Smith 
decided not to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus and Hilfenhaus support the term-limit measure, while Balkman and 
Wolkowitz oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilfenhaus, 43, is a slow-growth candidate who criticizes city planners for 
not using enough foresight when considering projects such as the controversial 
Marina Place retail mall approved almost five years ago. The 18-acre lot, near 
Lincoln and Washington boulevards, has yet to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned, $169-million mall is an example of growth the city doesn't need, 
Hilfenhaus said, asserting that it would significantly worsen traffic in an 
already heavily traveled area. "I can't see building on the most impacted 
intersection in the Westside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marcus, a pro-growth candidate, argues that the city has not done enough 
to attract business. Marcus, 39, said existing businesses are being scared away 
by restrictive ordinances such as an interim sign ordinance, which limits the 
size of wall and free-standing signs outside businesses. A new sign ordinance 
will be up for consideration at next week's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolkowitz, who also wants the city to become more business-friendly, staunchly 
opposes a proposal for the city to take over electrical service by buying out 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move, said Wolkowitz, 44, would send the wrong message to business. 
"What business in their right mind would want to come to Culver City, knowing 
the city will take its profits?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the competition seems fiercest in the race for the clerk's post, in 
which Dolce, 73, seeks a fifth, four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce said she is "sick and tired" of the attention being given to her salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Her salary, in fact, seems comparable to those of city clerks elsewhere on the 
Westside. Beverly Hills' city clerk makes $68,000 a year; Santa Monica's, 
$75,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of the clerk's pay, Crunk is adamant. The $75,000 salary, he 
said, is "not appropriate" for a position he considers a community service, 
comparable to that of council members, who are paid $485 monthly. The 
Candidates

 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTWOOD SHUTTLE -- Authorized the discontinuance of the weekend DASH 
shuttle service in Westwood, due to low ridership.The shuttle, which ran every 
five minutes from the Federal Building parking lot to Westwood Village, had an 
average monthly ridership of 618 last year, compared to 7,566 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * BRENTWOOD ARTS FESTIVAL -- Approved the temporary street closure of the 
eastbound lanes of San Vicente Boulevard, between Bringham Avenue and Bundy 
Drive on April 23 from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. for the annual Brentwood Arts Festival.

<P>
 * DWP CATERING -- Approved city controller recommendations aimed at reducing 
the catering costs of the Department of Water and Power in the event of an 
employee strike. The recommendations included developing lists of vendors with 
their estimated costs and checking with other city departments to see if 
existing catering contracts could be expanded to provide services to the DWP. 
City Council members expressed disdain with the DWP's catering practices during 
a recent eight-day strike. The DWP reported more then $870,000 in catering 
costs to feed its managers and executives, who kept the department's offices 
open during the strike.

</P>
<P>

the city's ban on smoking in restaurants and at the new Convention Center. In

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; PLAN FOR AFRICA-THEMED ZONE GAINS MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The African International Village Assn. has enlisted the help of an 
architectural team to shape its plans to transform the Crenshaw area into an 
Africa-themed business and cultural district. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three months, 10 architects, artists and engineers have worked to 
develop conceptual drawings to give the Crenshaw corridor a new look from Adams 
Boulevard to Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The association was founded three years ago by community activist and Cal 
State Los Angeles student Melva Parhams to work for the official declaration of 
the Crenshaw district as the African International Village. The designation 
would make Crenshaw an African-themed cultural and business district similar to 
Chinatown, Koreatown and Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 AIVA will present its plans at community meetings later this year, then will 
submit them to the city in hopes that they will be incorporated into the 
General Plan for Los Angeles, architectural team chairman Okey Okonkwo said. 
The General Plan is undergoing revision. 
</P>
<P>
 Okonkwo said that a model of the Crenshaw corridor, to be completed within the 
next three months, will inject a cultural element into plans for improving the 
area and to allow the community to have a direct say in its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We here in the area need to reflect our culture somehow," said Okonkwo, a 
Nigerian-born architect who is on the board of several community institutions, 
including First African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Sheenway School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the model is still in preliminary stages, some elements have already 
been drafted, including pyramid-shaped buildings and a memorial wall inscribed 
with the names of people who have died in violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The African International Village "is an effort that's going forward against 
all odds," Parhams said. "It's time to go for it and claim our legacy as our 
own." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA/MALIBU; $10 HIKE IN PARCEL TAX FOR SCHOOLS 
PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District officials will conduct public 
hearings this week and next month to discuss a proposed parcel tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 A measure to institute a six-year hike in the parcel tax would be placed on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of residents, business people and teachers recently proposed a $10 
increase in the $58 tax, which is assessed on each parcel of property within 
district boundaries. The panel recommended the increase as an adjustment for 
inflation. The tax, which has been in effect since 1988, is scheduled to expire 
in June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Cohen, the district's finance director, said the levy generates about 
$1.8 million annually to help pay for teachers' salaries, books, insurance and 
other operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing will be in Malibu on Thursday at 8 p.m. in the George F. 
Smith Auditorium, Hughes Research Lab, 3011 Malibu Canyon Road. Another hearing 
is scheduled for April 14 at 8 p.m. in the district's board room, 1651 16th 
St., Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board is expected to vote on the proposal April 14 after the public 
hearing.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; BUS LINE TO CLOSE DUE TO LOW RIDERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An experimental bus line in Venice will be canceled June 26 due to low 
ridership, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation of Line 34 along Rose Avenue will reduce the MTA's operating 
budget deficit by about $268,000 annually, spokesman Steve Chesser said 
Thursday. The line had been instituted in response to customer requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one year, the line has averaged only 100 boardings per day, a fourth 
of the anticipated 400. Instead of Line 34, MTA patrons can use Line 33 on Main 
Street, or Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines' Line 3, boarding on Lincoln 
Boulevard.

HOMELESSNESS: SANTA MONICA'S SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A menacing woman defecating in full view of children on the lawn of an 
elementary school is an image one associates with some dismal, backwater town; 
a disease-ridden, war-torn place that one reads about; a symbol of a society 
decayed beyond repair. This act occurred on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica, 
March, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, as most of us know, is a magnet for the homeless, and has been 
for many years. As the numbers swelled we have witnessed our parks, libraries, 
shops and restaurants become targets for displays of aberrant behavior, 
panhandling and, more recently, threats and aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 We have tolerated this antisocial behavior in the name of civil rights. Our 
children have civil rights too! They should be allowed to go to school without 
witnessing acts of behavior so horrible and base that even Hollywood would 
decline to immortalize them for the sake of a buck! 
</P>
<P>
 My plea is to all those who vote, create, interpret and enforce the laws in 
Southern California to find it morally incumbent upon themselves to accept as 
just the rationale for equitable sharing of the burden of the homeless. Santa 
Monica is only 8.3 square miles and the homeless are overrepresented here. Most 
people in Santa Monica are not millionaires living in luxury. Yes, there is 
affluence, but most residents of this community are renters. We, as a nation of 
people, are very giving and generous. A plan which takes into account 
economics, size, number of public parks and other parameters can be formulated 
but it must be kept simple and consistent. These details can be worked through 
if local governments are willing to abandon animosities, jealousies, egos and 
cowardice. I know that many communities are helping the homeless without 
suffering abuses. What can we learn, what can we share, what are they doing 
right, and what are we doing so wrong? Let us dilute the problem so no 
community will feel overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope we do not have to explain to our children that such base primitive 
behavior displayed at my 8-year-old's elementary school has recently become 
just another vicissitude of life.

FOR SENIORS; 'GRANDMA' PUTS THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The telephone rang at 5:30 a.m. The voice at the other end said, "Is Grandma 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
 With those words, my status in life changed forever, and my DNA stretched a 
little farther into the future. Truth is, I'm a bit stunned by it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaya (middle name to be announced) Mendelsohn was born March 2, with a full 
head of black hair, a round face like her mother's, and ears that stick out 
like her father's. She was born at home, in Santa Cruz, Calif., in the presence 
of her father, a midwife and her assistant, and a dog named Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter, Julia, gave birth to her child the way she wanted. She is a 
feminist, and that's what the whole thing was about -- making choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that sometimes the choice isn't yours. 
</P>
<P>
 When she told me she wanted to be a midwife, I was ecstatic. When she told me 
she wanted to have a midwife deliver her baby at home, the muscles in the back 
of my neck locked and are only beginning to uncoil. I wrote her a letter 
expressing my concern. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I do with both my children. (My son is a second-year student at 
Lewis & Clark Law School in Oregon.) The opening sentence is: "This is a letter 
of concern." I write what's on my mind and then never mention it again. 
</P>
<P>
 They can do with my concern what they will. My daughter disregarded it. I'm 
not surprised. She was raised to have a mind of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother raised me to be tough. Julia was raised to be courageous. My mother 
is of the generation that gave you the answers to problems you didn't know 
existed and then made sure they did. She's always unanimous in her own opinion. 
My mother suffered through her marriage; I divorced out of mine, and Julia. . . 
. She and Joseph are getting married in August. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the children of divorce. They live far away from their parents. He 
makes beautiful glass dishes that are exhibited in galleries and fine stores. 
She managed a health food store and was studying midwifery. She's a university 
graduate, and he's still doing homework. They take getting married very 
seriously. They take each other very seriously, which is why they announced 
that they didn't want the "elders" to visit until two weeks after the birth, so 
that they could bond with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 That included me, the grandma. 
</P>
<P>
 When I explain to friends my age why I didn't go to see the baby for two 
weeks, they said things like, "Are you crazy?" or "If it was me, I'd be up 
there no matter what they said," or, "You couldn't keep me away for two weeks." 
It's as if I have violated the first rule of being a grandma: Rush in and take 
over; show the kids how to do things. 
</P>
<P>
 My younger friends say quite the opposite, especially men: "You're doing 
everything perfect. The worst thing was having my mother-in-law with us those 
first couple of days. I was an alien in my own home. And now I don't want her 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 When I announce that I'm a grandma, people respond in odd ways. "You're not 
that old" is the most common. What's old? I'm a grandma of the '90s. I work. I 
still like rock 'n' roll. I date. I can use three different word-processing 
systems. I wear a size 8. 
</P>
<P>
 And I try to get the pronouns straight in my head. This is "their" baby, not 
"my" baby. This is "their" life, not "mine." I say how wonderful it is that my 
daughter can talk to me in a loving way and know that it's not about hurting my 
feelings but revealing hers. I'm relieved. I admire her. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, Julia and I each had our first child at age 27. I feel a new 
closeness to my daughter now that she is a mother. I loved it when she asked 
me, "When do you stop staring at the baby for 24 hours?" I love the wonder in 
her voice when she describes the child she has brought into the world and the 
responsibility she feels to bring her up with integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 I love the conversations we have every day about things intestinal, and breast 
milk and diaper-changing. And I love what she said to me when I suggested she 
get some rest: "There's no rest for me, Mom, for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how the arrival of this 6-pound, 2-ounce girl has put things into 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter, Julia, the sweetest girl that ever lived, is a mother. My little 
girl, who was not allowed to have a Barbie doll because her mother took 
feminism so seriously, has a baby. She delivered her baby in the safety and 
comfort of her own home in the presence of her loving partner with the help of 
two women who knew exactly what they were doing every step of the way. Julia 
was in charge. This is the life she wants to live. What more can I do for her 
as a mother except be there, on call, whenever she needs me? 
</P>
<P>
 I admire Joseph too. He's doing everything for Julia. He cooks, he cleans, he 
does the wash, and he comforts her. He gets up with her during the night, and 
he holds the baby when Julia needs privacy. I spoke to him during one of those 
moments, and he said Kaya was a little fussy so he was going to play some Miles 
Davis for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The wedding is Aug. 21. On the beach in Santa Cruz. I'm the mother of the 
bride and the grandma. I bought Kaya a white cotton dress with a tiny pink 
satin bow at the collar, tiny white satin slippers with a row of pink satin 
flowers around the rim, white lace tights and a bonnet with streamers coming 
down the sides. She's the flower baby. I'll hold her during the ceremony. All 
of my friends are coming to celebrate a wedding, a birth and most of all, love. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're coming to check out what this grandma thing is about.
