WASC DIVERSITY STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges approved a 20-page "statement on 
diversity" over the objections of 14 colleges and universities, including USC, 
Stanford, and Caltech (Feb. 23, 24). 
</P>
<P>
 We objected because we believe WASC is overreaching its legitimate authority 
and purpose, not because we objected to the diversity statement itself. There 
is nothing in the document that we could not live with; in fact, our own 
commitments and achievements with respect to diversity go well beyond the 
document and well beyond the commitments and achievements of the vast majority 
of institutions that are accredited by WASC. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years accrediting agencies have grown increasingly bureaucratic, and 
have begun to intrude more and more into the life of established colleges and 
universities in a misguided effort to "improve" them. The net result has not 
been an improvement of American higher education, but rather a further 
restriction of each institution's ability to formulate and pursue its own 
unique goals and objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those of us in academe should be held accountable for our actions. 
We are in fact held accountable to the law by the courts and by myriad state, 
federal, and local agencies. We are directly accountable to our board of 
trustees, who hold the university in trust for the benefit of humanity. And, 
most important of all, we in private higher education are directly accountable 
to our students and their parents, who can take their tuition money elsewhere 
at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is universally admired for having the finest system of 
higher education in the world. No one I've ever met believes this extraordinary 
level of excellence is due to increasingly intrusive accrediting bodies or 
increasingly burdensome governmental regulation. Rather, the excellence of our 
colleges and universities is attributed to their freedom to be different from 
each other -- to their ability to take risks and chart their own destinies in a 
highly competitive environment.

 * A letter by Stanley Hart of the Sierra Club (Feb. 22) repeats the persistent 
myth of outrageous subsidies to automobile drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact the opposite is true.In 1989, total U.S. expenditures by all levels of 
government for the administration, planning, research, development, land 
procurement, building, maintaining, operating, enforcing, and debt service for 
our national road system were $70.9 billion. In that same year, total user 
fees, defined as all government receipts incident to the ownership and use of 
road vehicles and roads, were $87.3 billion. Uniquely among transportation 
systems, our road system more than paid for itself, and, in fact, returned a 
significant profit of some $16 billion or 23% to the government. Since the 
imposition in the last year of an additional 4-cent gas tax for deficit 
reduction, this profit is probably somewhat higher.

A 'PRETTY' PARODY STANDS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freedom of speech, if it is to be effectively protected, must be knowledgeably 
protected. Everyone can appreciate that crying "Fire!" in a crowded theater 
when there is no fire is an abuse of freedom of speech. But the finer 
distinctions are not always so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 It is reassuring, therefore, to see several distinctions finely made in the 
unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the rights of the elusive 
variety of speech we call parody. 
</P>
<P>
 The holders of the copyright to Roy Orbison's song "Pretty Woman" had sued 
over a parody of that song by the rap group 2 Live Crew. Though some matters of 
fact remain to be determined by a lower court, Justice David H. Souter, writing 
for the Supreme Court, has now recognized both the legitimacy of parody and the 
functionally legitimate needs of parody -- the need to quote the original, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 In another literarily informed move, Souter has recognized that parody is a 
form of criticism and deserves the legal protection that criticism enjoys, even 
when it reduces the commercial value of the original. In ruling for 2 Live 
Crew, Souter distinguished "between biting criticism that merely suppresses 
demand and copyright infringement which usurps it."  
</P>
<P>
 In another literary lawsuit destined eventually to reach the Supreme Court, a 
crime journalist, Dan E. Moldea, alleges that the reviewer of Moldea's book 
"Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional Football" made 
factual errors about the book that the New York Times, which published the 
review, failed to correct even by printing a brief letter from Moldea. Can a 
writer sue over a negative opinion? Over the opinion as such, no, but over 
factual error offered as the basis of the opinion, yes, Moldea insists. So did 
a federal appeals court in Washington last month. The resolution of this 
question by the Supreme Court calls for a discriminating literary eye. It is 
gratifying to note that, in Souter, the court seems to have such an eye.

GROWING MYSTERY OF EARTHQUAKE FINANCING; HAVE WE SQUEEZED EVERYTHING WE CAN OUT 
OF WHAT WE HAVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson wants to finance earthquake repairs with $1.05 billion in new 
bonds. Democrats, in a blocking maneuver, have amended his proposal to 
automatically impose a temporary quarter-cent sales tax increase if voters 
reject the bond issue, scheduled for the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor opposes this tax increase. The Democrats, wary about asking 
Californians to assume more debt, favor a pay-as-you-go approach. But there's a 
third way, isn't there? California could finance at least some earthquake 
repairs with millions in previously approved but unspent bonds. And until the 
bonds can be sold, agencies could tap into another source of funds, the 
$26-billion investment fund run by the state's Pooled Money Investment Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento ought to exhaust these alternatives before initiating the 
cumbersome process of issuing yet another pile of bonds. If more financing is 
needed, paying as we go with a temporary quarter-cent sales tax and/or a 
gasoline tax dedicated to highway repair is preferable to increasing the 
state's indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
 THE AMAZING BACKLOG: California already has an earthquake bond backlog. In 
1990 voters approved the Earthquake Safety and Public Buildings Rehabilitation 
Bond Act to provide $300 million for seismic retrofitting and replacement of 
state and local government facilities. Most of this money, $196 million, 
remains unspent.  
</P>
<P>
 Why the backlog? Part of the problem is the excruciatingly slow process to 
activate bonds. Once the voters OK a bond issue, the Legislature must approve 
use of the funds. Then the specific plans must be certified by bureaucrats. 
It's no wonder that, amid the snarl, the state treasurer's backlog includes 
unsold bonds authorized 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bond funds also could be appropriated for earthquake repair. Wilson's 
office already has identified $75 million in higher-education bonds -- approved 
in 1988, 1990 and 1992 -- that could be used to help rebuild Cal State 
Northridge as well as buildings on other college and university campuses 
damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. However, Wilson submitted the appropriation to 
use these bonds to the Legislature in the same bill proposing the $1.05-billion 
bond issue for the June ballot. The higher-education bond appropriation should 
not be stalled this way. Spin it off separately to get those repair funds spent 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 THE UNDERRATED OPTION: The State Allocation Board, which oversees a reserve 
account, may have discretion to allocate an additional $74 million in K-12 
school bonds for earthquake repairs. Until any bonds to finance earthquake 
repair are sold, the State Pooled Money Investment Board, a short-term 
investment fund, can provide a line of credit of up to $1 billion to enable 
state agencies to begin construction more quickly. Agencies use the unsold 
bonds as collateral for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the governor's office insists otherwise, surely existing bonds could be 
used to finance some of what Wilson proposes now. For example, might not the 
$65 million for earthquake repairs to state buildings that Wilson wants be 
financed with the 1990 bonds? Similarly, could not parts of the $265 million 
for public infrastructure and schools be covered with existing bonds? Roughly 
half of the proposed $1.05 billion from new bonds is for the California 
Disaster Housing Repair Agency. Yet after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, the 
agency was funded at $130 million with a temporary sales tax to help 
single-family and apartment owners rebuild. Why not again? 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento is making a political game of addressing the state's pressing 
earthquake needs. The federal government acted quickly and responsibly in 
securing aid for California. Sacramento should too -- by the ledger, not by the 
party.

CITY HALL WATCH; AGENDA CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Riordan has a lot of people paying attention as the still relatively 
new mayor goes about the tricky business of redefining city government. Monday, 
in his first State of the City address, the mayor, though no Demosthenes as an 
orator, had a packed City Council chamber hanging on every sentence because, 
among other things, this guy is a new kind of city executive. He questions more 
than he accepts -- a huge plus in a city where some (though far from all) parts 
of government have fallen asleep in the relative security that no new idea is 
likely to disturb them. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course Riordan wants to only overhaul city government. That disappoints 
those who would prefer far more radical surgery. But for all his 
unpredictability, this former businessman is solid and sensible. He knows that 
he must move carefully, though constantly, in the direction of privatizing -- 
through contracts and leases -- those parts of government that can be; 
consolidating city agencies or functions that overlap, and squeezing down costs 
without squeezing services. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech Monday was not as detailed as some council members wanted, but it 
was a welcome effort to set a general direction for city government. About 10 
days ago a Riordan commission laid out some interesting, indeed provocative, 
proposals for redirection. The City Council will have every opportunity to 
debate them once the mayor presents them in the form of specific proposals. 
Coming up with specifics is Riordan's next challenge, and it is a big one. If 
he does that, he will continue to control the agenda.

CURBS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "DMV Check of Immigration Touches Off Anger and Praise," 
March 2: 
</P>
<P>
 As a former prosecutor for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the 
lesson of this new law is when a state (DMV) agency tries to interpret a 
federal (immigration) law, what you get is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluntly put, the DMV's newly published pamphlet, "All You Need to Know About 
Birth Verification and Legal Presence Requirements," is a joke. It indicates 
that the DMV will issue a driver's license to anyone with a Canadian passport 
or a Mexican Border Crossing Card. Since when does the possession of foreign 
documents prove "legal presence" in California? On the other hand, the DMV 
won't issue a license to a foreign-born student, professional or investor who 
the INS certifies is lawfully residing in California! 
</P>
<P>
 You be the judge: Should the taxpayers send California's DMV director to 
Washington to study the intricacies of federal immigration law, or should we 
let INS' Border Patrol, rather than the clerks at the DMV, enforce the 
immigration laws? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone seriously expect illegal aliens to stop coming to California 
because they can't get a driver's licenses? The only predictable effects of the 
new law will be less people driving with licenses and auto insurance, more 
high-speed auto chases and more profits for those who make their living 
manufacturing phony green cards.

 * Regarding the disinformation piece in the Opinion section ("Refine 
Immigration Policy to Reflect History and the Moment We Live In," Opinion, Feb. 
27), I feel that Ruben Martinez and other Reconquistas should be more honest 
and open about their true predilections associated with advocacy of that 
movement, i.e., recover California (for Mexico) by the time-honored 
non-militant tactic of overwhelming the "enemy" and its resources with massive 
population inundation, leading to political control (note that already he wants 
to give illegals the right to vote), the redistribution of wealth (expanded 
entitlements eligibility), and ultimately realignment with the madre patria .

 * Regarding immigration, one has to question a system that makes it far easier 
to enter this country illegally than legally. What sense does it make? I 
suggest we put up along all borders turnstile gates that are accessed by simply 
pressing fingerprints onto a recording screen, which activates an instant photo 
ID-Social Security card along with a multilingual note that informs our guests, 
"While you're here, you will pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The current system drives people and potential tax revenues underground. 
</P>
<P>
 I am going through the system now, legally, and I'm paying the price -- in the 
only non-expendable commodity: time. But, don't look to the INS. It doesn't 
make the laws. Actually, my experience with the INS has been quite good. The 
logjams are at the U.S. consulates. It has to do with an overall self-image by 
our government that its mission is to control and regulate. What a wonderful 
world it will be when our adolescent government discovers the joy and 
productivity outlined by the framers in their "of, by and for the people" 
foundation for a government in service of its populace.

 * While there is a pressing need to formulate a comprehensive and effective 
immigration policy, organizations such as Proponents for Responsible 
Immigration Debate and Education (PRIDE) obfuscate the real crux of the issue 
(Feb 20). PRIDE carries the torch for the rights of illegal immigrants, but 
what about the rights of the taxpaying citizens? Can we justify spending 
millions of tax dollars for public services to illegal immigrants when the 
state cannot afford to provide a decent education for children or provide 
affordable health care to our elderly population? 
</P>
<P>
 Groups such as PRIDE must realize that California can no longer afford the 
financial burden of illegal immigration. Claims that reform proposals are 
nothing more than racist immigrant-bashing are downright false. The U.S. is the 
only country in the world that cannot control its own borders. Instead of 
hiring thousands more Border Patrol agents, why not use the U.S. military to 
help enforce our immigration policies?

 * I live most of the year every year in Portugal. I don't expect the 
Portuguese government to provide for me in any way nor does the government 
encourage me or anyone else to think it. My children had to spend a semester in 
intensified tutoring in the language before they were permitted to attend 
school. It was incumbent on them to learn the language, not for the school to 
provide them with instruction in English. I don't understand why anyone 
arriving here should expect the American taxpayer to provide anything.

 * Congratulations on your editorial "A Rebuke to the Government" (March 1). It 
was appropriate but did not go far enough.

<P>
 All law is force.Behind each law is the bayonet. How many Wacos lie behind the 
Brady bill and other proposed plans designed to disarm law-abiding citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's rhetoric to the contrary, the chapter on 
Waco is not closed and won't be closed until she resigns and the ATF and FBI 
officials responsible are brought to justice.

 * Chalk one up for the little guy. A Houston jury acquitted all the Branch 
Davidians (Feb. 27) of a murder charge trumped up by government to whitewash 
yet avenge the deaths of four ATF agents characterized by prosecutor Ray Jahn 
as brave and courageous, when in reality they were misguided, untrained fools 
dispatched to Waco by an incompetent, zealous manager -- the real "Waco Wacko" 
-- who had months earlier thrown away the opportunity to peacefully and 
thoroughly examine the defendants' arms cache.  
</P>
<P>
 ATF had also failed to heed lessons learned earlier by its sister, the IRS: 
Texans, in particular, resent federal agents who believe that their government 
employment renders them immune from common law and local statutes designed to 
protect people from oppressive government. (Two IRS agents were convicted of 
criminal trespass despite their protestations that local laws don't apply to 
them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Reno, take note: The little man is at long last resigned to turn and 
defend himself. Never, never ever pick the Lone Star state as the site of a 
caper like this.

PERSPECTIVE ON AIDS; HOW HUMAN BEHAVIOR WOKE THE VIRAL SCOURGE; IT IS NOT A 
MORAL JUDGMENT TO FIND THAT THE GAY SEXUAL REVOLUTION HAD MUCH TO DO WITH 
MAKING AN EPIDEMIC. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If HIV and AIDS are indeed old killers, then one final, explosive question 
remains: Why did a virus that was confined to a tiny ecological niche suddenly 
burst into global pandemic? 
</P>
<P>
 In her forthcoming book, "The Coming Plague," Newsday reporter Laurie Garrett 
outlines a crucial phase needed to transform a low level of virus into the 
outright epidemic phase she calls "amplification." Some thing or things have to 
happen to force a microbe out of its previously placid ecological hole and stir 
it up to critical mass. The history of epidemics shows that such things are 
almost always related to human behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, given the ways of the world, we know much more about the 
precise mechanisms that amplified AIDS in America than we do about Africa, but 
we know that in both continents enormous social and sexual revolutions closely 
predated the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern AIDS (in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan), say 
researchers, is primarily spread by anal sex and IV drug use; southern AIDS (in 
Africa, Central and South America and Asia) mostly by vaginal sex and improper 
medical sterilization of syringes. Northern AIDS overwhelmingly affects men, 
notably homosexual and bisexual men, and there is comparatively little 
female-to-male transmission. Southern AIDS strikes heterosexual men and women 
evenly, and women appear to transmit HIV to men as easily as men to women. 
</P>
<P>
 African historians say that decolonization there was followed by social shocks 
so profound that many cultures experienced greater change in a single 
generation than in the previous 1,000 years. Male African villagers, suddenly 
working in cities far from wives and family, replaced village monogamy or 
polygamy with multipartner urban sexuality. Women in the bustling cities were 
often compelled to engage in prostitution. There was a post-colonial explosion 
of unsterile needle use by ill-trained "needle doctors" and by poorly executed 
mass-immunization programs. Military conflicts were marked by epidemics of mass 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, the golden opportunities for AIDS -- the blood products 
revolution, the IV drug revolution and the gay revolution -- are obvious to 
anyone monitoring the epidemic. Tellingly, all those revolutions were launched 
at around the same time, the era of Woodstock and Stonewall. 
</P>
<P>
 Culling blood products from multiple donors began only in the 1960s, and the 
manufacture of clotting factors -- developed from the blood of thousands of 
donors -- began only in 1970. As a source of disease amplification, the blood 
revolution has built-in limitations. While it is medically easy for blood 
recipients to receive infectious agents, it is socially difficult for them to 
pass diseases on. Many blood recipients are elderly or chronically ill and do 
not donate blood or engage in IV drug use or sexual activity that might spread 
their infections. The main exceptions are hemophiliacs, but there are 
relatively few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of U.S. AIDS cases -- about 113,000 -- are associated with 
IV drug use, while more than 80% of HIV-positive women inject drugs or have 
sexual partners who do. For the most part, however, users share needles with 
the same small cluster of people, keeping infection within a relatively 
restricted community, while poverty, lack of social mobility and a high death 
rate among IV users may impede HIV's spread to the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 If the blood and IV drug revolutions created new viral highways that were 
medically efficient but socially limited, the sexual revolution among gay men 
in the 1970s created near-perfect conditions for viral amplification. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men, according to Alfred Kinsey's famous 1948 study of the sexual habits 
of American males, had relatively few sexual partners before liberation. As 
social conditions and sexual opportunities improved for gay men in the 1960s, 
health conditions in the '70s declined to the point where, by 1985, certain 
pockets of Manhattan's growing gay community had incidences of genital herpes 
and other sexually transmitted diseases up to 20 times higher than heterosexual 
men of the same age. As the late AIDS activist Michael Callen noted, the gay 
male community was "wallowing . . . in an increasingly polluted microbiological 
sewer." 
</P>
<P>
 The vortex of desire and disease facilitated the amplification of HIV in 
several interrelated ways. For starters, multi-partner sexual activity was 
raised to unprecedented levels, guaranteeing that any sexually transmitted 
microbe entering the gay reservoir would quickly spread to thousands and tens 
of thousands. Another was the practice of anal sex. While all forms of 
unprotected sex carry some risk of HIV transmission, studies show that for the 
receptive partner, unprotected anal sex is extremely risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally there's the virulence factor. According to a theory advanced by 
Amherst's Paul Ewald, author of "Evolution of Infectious Disease," increased 
transmission may have literally amplified the virulence of HIV, which means two 
things: how easily a virus is spread and how fast it makes you sick. 
</P>
<P>
 According to natural selection, only those viral strains best suited to their 
environment will survive and reproduce. In a world when people had relatively 
few sex partners, the only strains of HIV likely to survive over the long haul 
were those that delayed making their hosts sick for decades and gave relatively 
monogamous hosts a chance to have sexual relations with several partners. But 
when HIV entered gay communities in which multipartner sex was the norm, this 
selective favoring of the least-virulent strains came to an end. Now, even 
though virulent strains made their hosts sicken faster, the time periods 
involved -- several years instead of several decades -- still gave those hosts 
ample time to infect many others. The result was a genetic favoring of the most 
virulent strains. Today, despite those who would have us believe that the 
pandemic is still confined to certain groups, infection has advanced to the 
point where everyone who engages in blood-sharing or unprotected sex outside a 
long-term monogamous relationship is at risk.

MORE EFFICIENT POWER FOR LEAN, COMPETITIVE TIMES; ELECTRICITY: PUBLIC UTILITIES 
ARE RIGHT TO BALK AT FINANCING ANY MORE INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN M. STELZER, Irwin M. Stelzer is director of regulatory policy studies 
at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New power plants for California, already awash in excess generating capacity? 
Definitely a bad idea, but not one that's coming from the state's power 
utilities. The California Public Utilities Commission must be sensible and 
courageous enough when it meets next week to abandon a once-useful but 
now-obsolete regulatory policy, and encourage the more efficient energy 
infrastructure that California needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the state's electric utilities -- and I should say at the outset that 
I have served as a consultant to almost all of them -- are closely regulated, 
they have provided a means of implementing a variety of social programs. Many 
have been beneficial. California has led the way in giving electric companies 
incentives to develop programs that help consumers conserve energy and save 
money. Environmental factors are taken into account in utility planning, with 
the result that it is safer to inhale than it has been for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing the state's regulators were there to give a push, for the 
state's electric utilities have not in the past seemed overly enthusiastic 
about adapting to change, whether to preserve the environment or to prepare for 
the competitive era that is already upon them and will strike with full force 
at around the turn of the century. Unfortunately, the situation now seems about 
to reverse, with the commission defending the status quo against a new era, one 
in which California will have to compete for jobs by, among other things, 
providing low-cost, reliable electricity to all consumers: large manufacturers, 
small service establishments and struggling residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of history. At one time, the commission properly sought to end the 
utilities' infatuation with the erection of ever-larger plants by imposing a 
bidding process that would require Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & 
Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric to buy power from independent producers, 
including wind farms and solar arrays, when those competitors could supply 
electricity more economically than the utility could. Leave aside the question 
of whether the bidding was conducted fairly or was rigged to favor suppliers 
using generation methods the commission felt were environmentally superior. The 
result was a vibrant independent power sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for California is that this once-desirable policy has outlived its 
usefulness. Partly because of past overbuilding by the utilities, partly 
because the companies were forced to buy more power than they thought necessary 
and partly because of the recession, California is burdened with a large amount 
of excess generation capacity. Edison, for example, estimates that it has more 
than enough power-generating capacity to serve its customers' needs until 2005. 
The excess sits there, paid for by customers in high rates and by shareholders 
in low profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, because of a process begun in 1988, before recession, riots and assorted 
calamities slowed growth, Edison and other utilities may be forced by 
regulators to finance the construction of still more capacity. This, in pursuit 
of a policy that has already achieved its objectives: Edison already obtains 
23% of its energy from renewable resources and 34% from independent power 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the commission force an industry with too much capacity to contract for 
still more, it would load hundreds of millions of dollars of costs onto 
businesses that California is already struggling to keep in the state, and onto 
ordinary, recession-afflicted residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, California regulators should reflect. President Clinton has had the 
courage to say that the welfare system once favored by liberal Democrats has 
become obsolete. So, too, with state energy policy. Forcing utilities to buy 
new capacity, now unneeded, would be folly. Instead, we should require them to 
do so only when such power can be made available at an economic cost below what 
Edison and others would incur by using their own idle facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensible regulatory policy cannot, alone, solve California's economic 
problems. But clinging to old nostrums can certainly hinder recovery. UCLA's 
business forecasters had it right when they said, "Pretending that the old 
glory days will return, when economic growth could be taken for granted, or 
even turned away, is unrealistic." Growth will return, to be sure. But its 
vigor could depend on those responsible for regulating the state's energy 
supply system.

DIVERSITY, NOT QUOTAS, FOR COLLEGES; SHARING OF INTELLECTUAL SPACE BOTH 
EDUCATES AND EMPOWERS STUDENTS. BUT CAMPUSES SHOULD BEWARE BUREAUCRATIC 
TOKENISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADELA de la TORRE, Adela de la Torre is an economist and chair of the 
department of Chicano and Latino studies at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Campus diversity is now a measure of a university's success. But unlike 
affirmative-action programs that have polarized faculty both on the left and on 
the right by their narrow, bureaucratic intrusions on faculty selection, there 
has yet to be a standardized policy developed for achieving campus diversity. 
Campuses most engaged in the diversity debate are those that have seen the most 
change in their undergraduate student population in the last five years. 
Faculty discussions on diversity do not mirror the affirmative-action agenda 
because diversity is not defined solely by race, sex or ethnicity but includes 
sexual preference, age, income and educational background. 
</P>
<P>
 For elite institutions such as Harvard or Yale, discussions of diversity have 
little immediate relevance due to selection processes that ensure a relatively 
homogeneous student population -- that is, Harvard may have a racial and ethnic 
mix, but from a relatively homogeneous class background. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, public institutions such as the California State University 
system draw from public high schools. Demographic shifts in enrollment and 
differences in income levels of students are forcing Cal State faculty to 
address the issue of diversity to increase their own teaching effectiveness. 
This is based on neither moral nor political grounds, but rather on pragmatism, 
to ensure that we teachers can meet our students' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity in higher education forces faculty and administrators to accept new 
power relationships. In the past, curricula were rigidly defined by faculty 
experts, but diversity requires breaking traditional disciplinary boundaries 
and acknowledging that curricula must be expanded to train our students in 
applied skills and critical thinking. Faculty must become more creative to 
retain undergraduate students and maintain their quality of instruction.  
</P>
<P>
 The incentive to hire diverse faculty does not stem from government mandates 
and quotas, nor should advocates of diversity allow affirmative-action 
bureaucrats to reduce the debate to tokenism and color-coding applicants. 
Rather, the discussion should be rooted in the comparative advantage that 
departments will have in hiring educators who are better equipped in the method 
as well as the content of teaching. We expand the base of knowledge that will 
prepare students to compete in the global market by including in their 
portfolio of knowledge an understanding of diverse cultures, history and 
languages.  
</P>
<P>
 Those opposed to diversity in education fear the loss of quality and continued 
Balkanization of our student population, and that group rights will take 
precedence over individual rights. Yet a major goal of such curricula is to 
provide a platform for acknowledging individual differences, particularly those 
within groups. From this knowledge, students should begin to recognize a common 
ground where alliances can form.  
</P>
<P>
 As an economist who recently began teaching in ethnic studies, I value the 
opportunity of using contemporary Chicano scholarship to teach students who 
would normally view economics as irrelevant to their lives. Adam Smith's 
"Wealth of Nations" shares the bookshelf with Chicana scholars. By whetting 
students' intellectual appetite with relevant literature, I open the path for 
acceptance of alternative views and disciplines. This sharing of intellectual 
space is not a pedagogy of entitlement; rather, it is a pedagogy of 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 That few faculty on college campuses have opportunities for cross-disciplinary 
teaching is unfortunate. Yet we who are on increasingly diverse campuses know 
that curriculum change is inevitable. Shifting power relationships within 
departments and colleges will result in acrimonious academic struggles not only 
in the Cal State system, but also at UC, where doctoral education will require 
greater public scrutiny to ensure that graduate-student training meets the 
hiring needs of state universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity in our student population has forced us to challenge ourselves and 
our disciplines to regain student trust and public confidence. Though no 
college has resolved the issue of diversity in the intellectual playing field, 
we know that if it is to be effective, it must go beyond political correctness, 
tokenism and bureaucratic manipulation of faculty and curricula.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; KILLED IN BATTLE BY A DIFFERENT KIND OF FRIENDLY FIRE; 
LEFT TO DIE: THE TRAGEDY OF THE USS JUNEAU BY DAN KURZMAN ; POCKET BOOKS $23, 
336 PAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Friday, the 13th of November, 1942, a rag-tag flotilla of battle-ravaged 
American warships was rocked by a single massive explosion. When the smoke 
cleared, one of the ships had simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the atomic bomb," writes Dan Kurzman in "Left to Die," "this was 
perhaps the greatest single explosion of the war." 
</P>
<P>
 The missing ship was the Juneau, a cruiser that exploded and sank in the South 
Pacific when a single torpedo from a Japanese submarine struck the ship and 
ignited its supply of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the saga of the Juneau only begins with the sinking of the ship. It is 
the story of the miraculous survival of a handful of sailors whose real enemy 
was not the Imperial Navy, but the timidity, inertia, appallingly poor judgment 
and sheer incompetence of some of their own comrades-in-arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 700 or so officers and men on the Juneau -- including the famous 
Sullivan brothers, five siblings who served (and died) on the same ship -- more 
than 140 managed to survive the torpedo attack. A week later, when the U.S. 
Navy finally woke up to the fact that the ship was gone and survivors were 
still in the water, only 10 men were alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Left to Die" smokes and crackles with outrage as Kurzman introduces us to the 
officers and men of the Juneau, and then explains how they were condemned to a 
slow and terrible death at sea, first by a stalking Japanese submarine and then 
by the wooden-headedness of the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn, for example, that the officer in command of the flotilla in which 
the Juneau was sailing, fearful of lurking Japanese submarines, refused to 
search for survivors or even to break radio silence to report the sinking. A 
B-17 pilot who happened upon the survivors within minutes after the ship went 
down dutifully reported their plight on no less than three occasions -- but his 
report was lost or merely ignored by an unidentified intelligence officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As hours and then days passed, the men of the Juneau began to die. As Kurzman 
shows us in heart-rending detail, the survivors clung desperately to a few 
rafts and nets while starvation, thirst, foul weather and a huge armada of 
sharks slowly chewed them up. The wounded men died quickly, if horribly; the 
others were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 By daylight, the men of the Juneau were scorched by the tropical sun; by 
night, they were reduced to urinating on their own bodies in a futile effort to 
warm themselves. When their meager supplies of food and fresh water ran out, 
many of the sailors drank seawater -- and promptly succumbed to a deadly 
delirium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madness soon overcame them," Kurzman writes, "and some jumped into the sea to 
go 'below' on watch duty, to get fresh water and a sandwich, or to swim to 
shore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the cool and inviting water posed the threat of certain death: "The 
sharks," Kurzman observes, "would not go hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the sailors who left the life-rafts were set upon and devoured by 
hordes of sharks. At one point, when the starving men on one raft managed to 
land a shark and cut open its belly, a human arm spilled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the story that Kurzman tells in "Left to Die" is dramatic enough, but 
the author insists on hyping what is already a ghastly and tragic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Kurzman introduces us to a sailor named Glycky, a gifted 
violinist who dreamed of playing in the Philadelphia Orchestra. The unlucky 
sailor tumbled into the sea, and the sharks took off his shoulder before he 
could clamber back into the raft. And when his Glycky saw the revulsion in the 
eyes of his shipmates, he threw himself back into the sea to spare them. Or, 
Kurzman wonders, was he pushed by one of his disgusted fellow sailors? 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is terrible enough, of course. But when Kurzman describes how the 
sharks finished their meal, he cannot resist a sentimental flourish: 
</P>
<P>
 "Glycky did not scream," Kurzman writes. "Perhaps because he knew he would be 
playing forever in an orchestra of sublime repute." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a sharper edge in Kurzman's book, a certain visceral anger that 
every reader will share when contemplating the fate of sailors who watched 
helplessly as the rest of the flotilla sailed away. No bathos or bombast is 
really necessary to put a catch in the reader's throat -- or to ignite a hot 
resentment as the abandoned survivors start to suffer and die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rescuing the survivors of the Juneau had become a priority mission at last -- 
six days after the ship had been sunk," writes Kurzman in a moment of bitter 
sarcasm. "Priority of a sort. No great excitement. One PBY (seaplane) was sent 
out to search for the men so that a ship, if it wasn't already engaged, would 
know where to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, only a suffering remnant of the ship's company was still alive. "We 
are survivors of the Juneau," the last of them signaled to their rescuers in a 
semaphore message sent by hand. At the moment of rescue, we do not need any 
prompting at all to recognize the poignancy, the waste and the misspent hope 
that are expressed in those six words.

LUSH 'SIRENS' LURES ART ON A SEXY ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sirens," set in the 1930s, is a high-class exploitation film about letting 
yourself go in the lush Australian Blue Mountains. The Rev. Anthony Campion 
(Hugh Grant) and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) are visiting the mountain 
retreat of artist Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill) at the behest of the archbishop of 
Sydney to persuade him to withdraw his scandalous painting "The Crucified 
Venus" from an international exhibition. It's not long before the couple become 
transfixed by pagan revelry and prancing nude models. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of those films that's usually described in deep tones as a 
"sensual awakening," but, to its credit, the cast seems to be having a high old 
time acting flouncy and coy. They don't make too much of the "awakening" stuff 
because they're too busy trying to put the audience into a dreamy, woozy 
snooze, filled with images of naked Amazonian maidens paddling delicately 
through lily ponds or wafting through the air in their see-through chiffon 
nighties. Writer-director John Duigan doesn't have a perfervid imagination, and 
it's probably just as well. Given the flimsiness of the material, why settle 
for D. H. Lawrence when you can have the Playboy Channel instead? 
</P>
<P>
 There's more than a little of the Playboy Philosophy in Lindsay's spoutings 
about free love and Bohemia. (Lindsay, a real painter, died in 1969 at the age 
of 90; so much for clean living.) But he spends most of his time painting while 
everyone else is panting. His three muse voluptuaries -- Sheela (Elle 
Macpherson), Prue (Kate Frischer) and Giddy (Portia De Rossi) -- can't seem to 
touch anything without fondling it. The prim Estella can't keep her eyes off 
them and their dalliances with the odd-job man (Mark Gerber) and other assorted 
locals. She's being "sensually awakened," remember? 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is doing his fuddy-dud gent number, but he's aware of how silly the 
reverend must seem in this roundelay. His Anthony pretends to be a kind of 
swinger himself, trying to match wits with Lindsay by shocking him with quotes 
from James Joyce. But he's no match for the lushness or the ladies, and, at 
least intellectually, he gives in to his frailty, and his wife's, with aplomb. 
He's a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's sexual imagery is deliberately obvious -- lots of snakes winding 
through the grass and flower petals falling on pillows. It's a soft-porn Eden 
aerie where all jealousies and passions are perfumed, and everything turns out 
for the best. In other words, it's a fairy-tale for grown-ups who are afraid to 
be caught reading Harlequin romances. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's Macpherson's screen debut, which ought to be worth a footnote in the 
film history books (and a photo spread in Playboy's "Sex in the Cinema 1994"). 
According to the press kit, Macpherson gained 20 pounds for the film, "lending 
her body a Boticelli contour." It then goes to reassure us that "she resumed 
her typical diet midway through production to prepare for her next assignment, 
a cover shoot for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue."

<P>
 "Why am I always at weddings," wonders the boyish Charles, "and never get 
married?" "Four Weddings and a Funeral," a cheerful and witty bit of business 
that belies its no-nonsense title, not only answers Charles' question, it 
offers the kind of sly pleasure only British comedy seems to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Deftly written by Richard Curtis (who wanted some revenge after attending 65 
weddings in 11 years) and directed by the versatile Mike Newell (responsible 
for everything from "Dance With a Stranger" to "Enchanted April"), "Four 
Weddings" is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends 
through every one of the events the title promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Three couples make up the core group, but none of them are particularly in an 
altar frame of mind. Fiona and Tom (Kristin Scott Thomas and James Fleet) are 
brother and sister, Gareth and Matthew (the ebullient Simon Callow and John 
Hannah) are gay, and Charles (Hugh Grant) and Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) are 
good friends more than passion's playmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though we occasionally catch a glimpse of these folks outside the weekend 
wedding whirl, it is the playful conceit of "Four Weddings" to tell us almost 
nothing about the group that doesn't come to light at one of those social 
events. So while we learn that the endearingly oafish Tom is "the 
seventh-richest man in England, more or less," we never see the rest of the 
comfortably well-off characters' lives or even find out how anyone earns a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 First among equals is the boyish Charles, a man of considerable if chaotic 
charm who is invariably late to these weddings, even when he is the best man 
and has to apologize by promising, "I'll be killing myself after the service if 
it's any consolation." 
</P>
<P>
 As played by Hugh Grant (best known for "Maurice," but now in "Sirens" and 
Roman Polanski's forthcoming "Bitter Moon"), Charles is suave but scattered, 
using his considerable wit to compensate for his lack of focus. A handsome 
pixie with something of the look and verve of a youthful British Kennedy, Grant 
gives a sunnily self-confident performance that anchors the film in the good 
spirits it never loses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the film's first wedding, Charles catches a glimpse of Carrie (Andie 
MacDowell), an American who used to work for Vogue. Actually, wearing an 
enormous black hat, she is difficult to miss, but the tart Fiona warns him "she 
went out with very glamorous people. She's quite out of your league." 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles, though a sturdy bachelor "in bewildered awe" of married people, 
is clearly smitten, and Carrie, temperamentally bolder than he, is interested 
as well. But it is the gift of screenwriter Richard Curtis to find endlessly 
clever ways to alternately bring these two together and then push them apart as 
they try to sort out what they want out of romantic love and how much 
commitment they can handle.

 Curtis, who wrote the script for the little-seen but seriously funny "The Tall 
Guy" starring Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum, is concerned not just with 
romance. He and polished director Newell are fascinated as well by the humor to 
be found in ritual situations, by the crazy way people act in public emotional 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 So "Four Weddings" is rife with matrimonial madness, everything from a 
grotesque version of "Stand by Your Man" to the nightmare of being seated at a 
table filled with old girlfriends to a classic bit involving a newly minted 
priest (the dead-on Rowan Atkinson) who can't seem to get the words of the 
ceremony out of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 As Atkinson proves, when you are doing delicate farce it helps to have actors 
who can pull this kind of business off, and, with the exception of MacDowell, 
who could do with a bit more animation, the cast here is peerless. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do Grant, Scott Thomas, Callow and company handle the sprightly 
dialogue with aplomb, they are also adept at the doubletakes and befuddled 
looks that make "Four Weddings" both amusing and irresistible all the way 
through the not-to-be-missed final credits. 
</P>
<P>
 So when screenwriter Curtis notes in the press material that perhaps "in the 
passing of time I'll write a screenplay called 'Four Funerals and a Wedding,' " 
one can only hope that it turns out as well as this tasty, sophisticated romp, 
a romantic comedy that wears its skill lightly and garnishes its humor with 
style.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'THE REF ': RAZOR-SHARP; ANCHORED BY EXPERT PERFORMANCES AND A 
BITING SCRIPT AND DIRECTION, THE TOUCHSTONE RELEASE CARRIES A MEAN VERBAL 
STILETTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "The Ref" (citywide) puts the devil into business with Disney. An 
enthusiastically mean-spirited comedy about family problems and a rather 
extreme way to solve them, it has as much fun being malicious as Snow White did 
being squeaky clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored by expert performances from Denis Leary, Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey 
and the appropriately biting script and direction, "The Ref" is one of those 
films in which everyone has a verbal stiletto out for everyone else. Though it 
doesn't manage to hold its edge all the way to the end -- that darn Disney 
influence finally proves too strong -- its comic venom is refreshing for as 
long as it lasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ref's" setting couldn't be more mainstream: the Norman Rockwell town of 
Old Baybrook, Conn., on the night before Christmas. Several creatures are 
stirring, including a skilled cat burglar named Gus (Leary), hoping to make the 
proverbial last big score, and the Chasseurs, Lloyd (Spacey) and Caroline 
(Davis), a couple that after 15 years of marriage can't go 15 seconds without 
attempting to rip each other's throats out. 
</P>
<P>
 Squaring off before the blissful local marriage counselor (a just-so 
performance by an unbilled B. D. Wong) the Chasseurs engage in some dazzlingly 
hostile bickering, tossing knives at each other like an experienced circus act. 
First prize goes to Caroline for her vivid description of a dream in which 
various parts of her husband's anatomy are served up like a salad, but Lloyd is 
not without verbal resources of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gus' robbery is going comically wrong, and he ends up needing a 
house to hide out in to avoid a police dragnet. Naturally he ends up with the 
Chasseurs, who are so bilious they keep on eviscerating each other even though 
their lives are in danger. "Oh my God," says Gus when he realizes what he's 
into. "I hijacked my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of "The Ref" involves this neat reversal of expectations, with 
the nominal hostage-taker ending up at the mercy of the out-of-control 
hostages, with Gus having no choice but to attempt to bring order out of the 
Chasseurs' chaos. "The only person who yells is me," he screams in 
exasperation, brandishing his weapon. "Only people with guns get to yell." 
</P>
<P>
 That line is typical of the dark spirit screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and 
Marie Weiss bring to "The Ref," a spirit that director Ted Demme, who recently 
did a Leary concert film, is not shy about conveying. 
</P>
<P>
 And aside from the forever out-of-sorts comic, well cast as the exasperated 
burglar, "The Ref" benefits from having actor's actors like Davis and Spacey in 
the leads. Both are impeccable, but not even Spacey can match the panache of 
Davis when she disdainfully calls sex with her husband "not really noteworthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing Gus to referee the Chasseurs' marital battles is a clever conceit, and 
even though other elements of the film are amusing -- like a Keystone Kops 
police force that would rather watch "It's a Wonderful Life" than solve crime 
-- when the picture strays from that central premise it tends to lose comic 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ref's" main subplots have to do with who is coming to the Chasseur's 
Christmas Eve dinner, everyone from bad-seed teen-age son Jesse (Robert J. 
Steinmiller Jr.) to the rest of Lloyd's family, especially his rich and 
grasping mother Rose (Glynis Johns) and Connie the relentless in-law (Christine 
Baranski). 
</P>
<P>
 Both Johns and Baranski are quite funny, but this flatter-the-rich-relative 
plot doesn't have the originality and bite of the rest of the picture and 
echoes the main outlines of the just-released and much less amusing "Greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ref" gets it into its head to actually solve all of the Chasseur family's 
multifarious problems -- in a typical Touchstone/Disney sort of manner -- which 
is a nice thought except that it forces several of the actors to make 
regrettably serious speeches. Still, it's not every movie that can create so 
much comedy out of misery, and it's "The Ref's" bad intentions that finally 
carry the day.

 People's Choice: ABC reigned as the network of choice in Tuesday night's 
People's Choice Awards, with "Home Improvement" taking honors for favorite TV 
comedy series and male performer (Tim Allen), and "NYPD Blue" winning for both 
favorite dramatic series and new dramatic series. ABC nabbed all the TV awards 
but two, which went to NBC's "Frasier." That series tied with "Grace Under 
Fire" for favorite new comedy, and "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer was named 
favorite male performer in a new series. In addition, "Roseanne" star Roseanne 
Arnold won her fourth People's Choice Award for favorite female performer, and 
"Grace Under Fire" star Brett Butler took home the trophy for favorite female 
in a new series. Other winners in the ceremony, which was hosted by comedian 
Paul Reiser and telecast on CBS, included Steven Spielberg's box-office smash 
"Jurassic Park," named favorite motion picture; the Robin Williams starrer 
"Mrs. Doubtfire," dubbed favorite comedy movie, and "The Firm," starring Tom 
Cruise, as the favorite drama. Cruise and Williams, along with Whoopi Goldberg 
and Julia Roberts, won acting honors in the populist awards. The event also 
included a tribute to the career of filmmaker Spielberg, plus awards for Garth 
Brooks, Reba McEntire and the group Aerosmith as favorite musical performers.

Museum of Contemporary Art since 1983, is a candidate for the directorship of 
New York's Dia Center for the Arts. The nonprofit center, which has large 
holdings of art from the 1960s and '70s, presents exhibitions in a renovated 
warehouse in Manhattan's Chelsea district. The Dia is also a partner in 
founding the Andy Warhol Museum, which is expected to open in May in 
Pittsburgh. Koshalek said he has not been offered the Dia directorship, but he 
confirmed that he had met with Dia trustees on Monday and discussed the 
institution's future. Koshalek also has been a candidate for director of the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York, but he said he has withdrawn from that

 Remembering Dinah: Dinah Shore, who died Feb. 24 of cancer, was remembered as 
fun-loving, spirited, warm and caring by her "family of friends" who gathered 
at the Directors Guild Monday afternoon for a celebration of her life. 
Interspersed with film clips from some of Shore's many television shows were 
in-person recollections from former President Gerald Ford, singer Rosemary 
Clooney, actor Kirk Douglas, columnist Art Buchwald, producer Fred Tatashore 
and Nabisco executive John Manfredi. Buchwald remembered Shore as a "life 
enhancer with a beautiful soul," and Ford called her a "universal icon."

 Stern Dealing: Radio "Shock Jock" Howard Stern said Tuesday that he is just 
days away from announcing a deal for a film and that he remains in negotiations 
with Fox Broadcasting for a television deal. "Fox is still pitching me. . . . 
We are talking about everything under the sun with Fox," Stern told Reuters, 
discounting reports that the network backed out of discussions about a possible 
late-night talk show after being shocked by the contents of Stern's raunchy 
pay-for-view TV special. Although Stern did not disclose details about the 
proposed film version of his best-selling autobiography, "Private Parts," trade 
reports said that Stern is expected to star in the picture, which would 
tentatively be released in 1995 through 20th Century Fox. POP/ROCK

 Hendrix Death Investigation Over: The British government said Tuesday that it 
would not hold a new inquest into the death 24 years ago of rock legend Jimi 
Hendrix, who died of a drug overdose at age 27. The decision came after a new 
police investigation into the case, of which no details were given. The 
investigation was prompted by an application to Atty.-Gen. Sir Nicholas Lyell 
for a new inquest, on the grounds that fresh evidence cast doubt on the 
reliability of the 1970 inquest. SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MERLE SHOWS HIS MANY HAGGARD FACES; AT THE CRAZY HORSE, THE 
LEGEND SOMETIMES LOOKS AS NOBLE AS LINCOLN, THEN AS HUMBLE AS A HOBO AT YOUR 
BACK DOOR. HIS SET WAS SOLID, IF SHORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What goes on in Merle Haggard's head? I'm starting to wonder whether along 
with the hand-beaten sterling of his songwriting and his wonderfully weathered 
voice, one of the main appeals of seeing Haggard perform isn't the mystery of 
trying to fathom what drives him. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to wonder sometimes if the brutal geology of his face was formed by 
all the conflicting notions he keeps behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he the simple happy dog singing "It's Been a Great Afternoon" or the man 
with a hellhound on his trail in "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive"? Is he the fragile 
heart watching his dreams recede in "Silver Wings" or the corroded liver of "I 
Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink"? 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard once said that the only time he isn't bored by life is when he's 
performing. Yet while he was singing Monday at the Crazy Horse (his first 
appearance at the club since 1981; he was also scheduled for a second night on 
Tuesday), he often looked as if he wished he were somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an enigma, looking at once as noble as Lincoln and as humble as a hobo at 
your back door with his hat in his hand. Nearly every instance Monday when he 
looked to be having a good time -- sharing a joke with a band mate or playfully 
kicking at his amplifier -- he would follow it with furtive glances to either 
side, as if he were expecting someone to come and haul him off to prison again. 
What does go on in that head? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, his mind has had to process a lot of information: He's gone from 
being a troubled Bakersfield reform-school kid and San Quentin prison number to 
a guy who has played in the White House, becoming a true musical legend along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a hard-hat hero for his anti-hippie "Okie From Muskogee" and a hero 
to hippie bands like the Grateful Dead for the undeniable humanity of his other 
songs. He's been an inspiration to a new generation of country artists, and 
brain-dead country radio stations have even awakened recently to let him back 
on the charts with the current single "In My Next Life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard didn't perform that song in his first of two shows Monday. Indeed, 
there was a wealth of his greatest songs he didn't sing. That's one of the 
problems with short sets, and his wasn't just brief -- it was abrupt, ending 
without warning, or encore, after 13 songs, seemingly in the middle of his 
minor 1985 hit "Makeup and Faded Blue Jeans."  
</P>
<P>
 With the first 10 minutes of the show given over to his band, the Strangers, 
and ex-wife and singer Bonnie Owens, Haggard was on for only about 45 minutes. 
Fortunately, he's such a personality -- maybe even multiple personalities -- 
that he can get a lot across in such a short span. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard opened strongly with one of his earliest hits, 1965's "(My Friends Are 
Gonna Be) Strangers," which set the dark fugitive theme that was to run through 
much of his best work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those appeared in his show, including "Running Kind," "I'm a Lonesome 
Fugitive" and the chilling "Mama Tried," in which the bad-seed narrator ends up 
"turning 21 in prison, serving life without parole" despite the best of 
motherly remonstrations. He has sung the song better, but there is still no one 
in country music who could come close to singing it as convincingly as Haggard 
always does. 
</P>
<P>
 He was no less compelling voicing the tender regrets of the Lefty Frizzell 
ballad "That's the Way Love Goes." 
</P>
<P>
 His eight-piece Strangers have been getting stranger with time, with only 
bandleader/pedal-steel wizard Norm Hamlet remaining from Haggard's classic 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even with some personnel changes since his appearance last summer at the 
Orange County Fair, their playing was tight and empathetic. Haggard's music is 
still a miraculous melding of hard-driving Bakersfield sound and the nimble, 
jazz-inflected Western swing music of Bob Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Hamlet, Haggard has some fine players, notably guitarist Clint 
Strong, who, despite a mellow tone on his Tele, burned through every solo he 
touched. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Haggard's own guitar soloing couldn't touch Strong on technique, it 
more than made up for it in personality. Curiously, it recalled Bob Dylan's 
newfound love for soloing: Both he and Haggard play as if they couldn't give a 
hang for musical theory or the standard riffs of the trade, instead using their 
instruments as voices as distinctive, expressive and idiosyncratic as their 
own.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DR. BETHUNE' TOO CONVENTIONAL FOR ITS SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dr. Bethune", an often absorbing and intelligent film biography, boasts one 
of Donald Sutherland's best portrayals, as the Canadian legend Dr. Norman 
Bethune. Bethune, born in 1890, was a brilliant, tempestuous physician who 
pioneered socialized medicine and introduced blood transfusions on the 
battlefields of the Spanish Civil War, though he was ultimately driven away by 
the Republicans for his hard drinking and incessant womanizing. He ended up 
finding contentment and respect at last as chief medical officer to Mao 
Tse-Tung and his 8th Route Army, dying in China in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the makings of a distinctive, "Schindler's List"-scale saga here, 
but instead we get a genteel treatment typical of the English-speaking Canadian 
cinema. It has been directed briskly by "The Grey Fox's" Phillip Borsos, but 
with not nearly as much panache as a headstrong genius rake like Bethune 
deserves. "Dr. Bethune" is far too conventional a film for so unconventional a 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Allan, Canada's most honored screenwriter, a man who actually knew 
Bethune, wrote his script in 1942, which Darryl Zanuck was to produce. Best 
known for the autobiographical 1975 Canadian production "Lies My Father Never 
Told Me" and for John Cassavetes' last film, "Love Streams," Allan has come up 
with pithy dialogue, some sharp characterizations and a classic "Citizen 
Kane"-like structure, an intricate interweaving of flashbacks triggered by a 
reporter's interviews with people who had been important in Bethune's life.  
</P>
<P>
 To pull this off with maximum clarity and impact, you need a stronger, more 
dynamic personality than Borsos possesses; you need a director who could have 
given the film more shape and distinction. The result is a movie that is good 
when it needs to be great. You come away sorry that Norman Jewison, who tried, 
didn't get his "Dr. Bethune" off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Dr. Bethune" is well worth seeing as a refreshingly adult, socially 
conscious drama, especially for Sutherland's persuasive, charismatic portrayal, 
which is well-matched by Helen Mirren's Frances Bethune. The physical 
attraction between the Bethunes is tangible, their love intense and enduring, 
but they were spectacularly ill-matched in temperament. Frances is far too 
prudish and traditional for Norman, who probably would have been bad husband 
material for practically any woman. Even so, Frances is no fool, and she is 
probably right to regard her husband as "politically naive." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland and Mirren work up plenty of fire, but they're the film's only 
truly vivid presences; all Anouk Aimee, as a beautiful French-Canadian who 
deals with Norman with far more sophistication and calm than his wife, gets to 
do is look soulful and sympathetic. As a writer, Allan laid a solid foundation, 
but needed to have been inspired -- or given the chance -- to flesh out the 
subsidiary characters more fully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Bethune" has been on the shelf undeservedly for several years, but that's 
understandable to a certain extent, given its subject's lack of familiarity in 
the U.S. and the film's serviceable, yet overly prosaic style. It certainly 
possesses scope, spanning the last decade or so of the doctor's life and 
stretching from Montreal to Madrid to actual remote Chinese locales. What 
Norman Bethune did and had to say is of enduring importance, and it may well be 
that his message will come across more effectively if the film eventually winds 
up on television.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SIRENS' A SILLY OUTING IN THE OUTBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sirens," set in the 1930s, is a high-class exploitation film about letting 
yourself go in the lush Australian Blue Mountains. The Rev. Anthony Campion 
(Hugh Grant) and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) are visiting the mountain 
retreat of artist Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill) at the behest of the Archbishop of 
Sydney to convince him to withdraw his scandalous painting "The Crucified 
Venus" from an international exhibition. It's not long before the couple become 
transfixed by pagan revelry and prancing nude models. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of those films that's usually described in deep tones as a 
"sensual awakening," but, to its credit, the cast seems to be having a high old 
time acting flouncy and coy. They don't make too much of the "awakening" stuff 
because they're too busy trying to put the audience into a dreamy, woozy 
snooze, filled with images of naked Amazonian maidens paddling delicately 
through lily ponds or wafting through the air in see-through chiffon nighties. 
Writer-director John Duigan doesn't have a perfervid imagination, and it's 
probably just as well. Given the flimsiness of the material, why settle for D. 
H. Lawrence when you can have the Playboy Channel instead? 
</P>
<P>
 There's more than a little of the Playboy philosophy in Lindsay's spoutings 
about free love and Bohemia. (Lindsay, a real painter, died in 1969 at the age 
of 90; so much for clean living.) But he spends most of his time painting while 
everyone else is panting. His three muse voluptuaries -- Sheela (Elle 
Macpherson), Prue (Kate Frischer) and Giddy (Portia De Rossi) -- can't seem to 
touch anything without fondling it. The prim Estella can't keep her eyes off 
them and their dalliances with the odd-job man (Mark Gerber) and other assorted 
locals. She's being "sensually awakened," remember? 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is doing his fuddy-dud gent number but he's aware of how silly the 
reverend must seem in this roundelay. His Anthony pretends to be a kind of 
swinger himself, trying to match wits with Lindsay by shocking him with quotes 
from James Joyce. But he's no match for the lushness or the ladies, and, at 
least intellectually, he gives in to his frailty, and his wife's, with aplomb. 
He's a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's Elle Macpherson's screen debut, which ought to be worth a footnote in 
the film history books (and a photo spread in Playboy's "Sex in the Cinema 
1994"). According to the press kit, Macpherson gained 20 pounds for the film, 
"lending her body a Botticelli contour." It then goes to reassure us that "she 
resumed her typical diet midway through production to prepare for her next 
assignment, a cover shoot for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue."

TV REVIEWS; '24 HOURS IN ROCK': CHUTZPAH, KITSCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea behind the MTV special "24 Hours in Rock and Roll" is none too 
original: For reference, check out all the "A Day in the Life of . . . " books 
and specials from which this constitutes a pretty direct crib. But what it 
lacks in conceptual novelty, it makes up for in the expected chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the recent glossified network special "A Day in the Life of Country 
Music" didn't bother to include strippers, karaoke bars, people who dig through 
celebrity trash, prison lifers or bad cover bands, all of which appear here. 
</P>
<P>
 The special was filmed Oct. 28 in 14 cities and, wisely, places at least as 
strong an emphasis on rockers-on-the-street as on "stars" letting their hair 
down or putting it up. 
</P>
<P>
 This being rock 'n' roll, after all, there's not much to be found going on in 
the morning hours -- though you do get glimpses of Smashing Pumpkins rehearsing 
their "Saturday Night Live" appearance, Janet Jackson's dancers limbering up, 
Courtney Love ordering room service, and Rick Rubin getting in touch with his 
spirituality (!) via a yoga lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 On the populist side, there's also a Boston neurosurgeon who performs brain 
surgery while grooving on Alice in Chains tapes (remind us never to develop an 
aneurysm back East). 
</P>
<P>
 Come evening, things pick up, natch, with limo drivers, jazz/rap bands, DJs, 
clubgoers and Robert Plant explaining it all for you. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Lynyrd Skynryd concert, we meet some fans so rabid they went to the 
famous plane crash sight and stole artifacts. A guy in full Kabuki makeup in a 
KISS tribute band explains, "Everybody's looking at you, and that's what it's 
all about, y'know?" Declares an erotic dancer, "The reason why rock stars and 
strippers get along well is because they're on the same wavelength. There's no 
love in rock 'n' roll. . . . I don't believe in love anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And -- our favorite -- a punk kid takes his girlfriend dancing for the first 
time at a mosh-pit club, explaining the latest steps: "Just make sure you keep 
your face protected." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything lacking in this often kitschily entertaining 90 minutes, 
it's a glimpse of a band actually involved in the creation -- not exploitation 
-- of music. Still, as pop-documentary goes, this is one of MTV's best and 
real-est forays into "the real world" yet. CHRIS WILLMAN

MUSIC REVIEW; SERIOUS RECORDER PROGRAM FROM ABREU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A player of the friendly, gentle and ancient recorder would seem to have his 
work cut out in grabbing and holding the distracted attention of the late 
20th-Century listener. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize-winning Venezuelan recorder player Aldo Abreu attempted the feat with an 
uncompromisingly serious, no-frills program in a Gold Medal concert at 
Ambassador Auditorium Monday night and didn't quite bring it off. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, the two works on the agenda written in the 20th Century proved most 
engaging and trenchant. Mexican avant-gardist Mario Lavista's 1986 "Ofrenda" 
haunted and wailed and slithered in an evocative 10 minutes, making integrated 
use (for once) of rich multiphonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Luciano Berio's 1966 "Gesti" turned the instrument into a frantic, nervous 
sound-maker in an exercise almost exclusively in extended techniques, including 
a startling, unpitched flutter-tongue effect. Abreu brought both works off with 
considerable enthusiasm and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the young musician seemed more a highly skilled than a compelling 
artist. But certainly the program had something to do with it. He opened with a 
meandering set of Renaissance pieces by Bassano, Rore, Selma and others and 
continued with a sturdily made but unremarkable Telemann Sonata in C. 
</P>
<P>
 He closed dourly and spun his wheels with Jacob van Eyck's "Pavaen lachrymae," 
two G-minor preludes and a G-minor chaconne by Vitali and then, as an encore, 
another G-minor chaconne by Anon. 
</P>
<P>
 The only old work to make much of an impact on this occasion was Bach's 
unaccompanied Partita, BWV 1030, which Abreu played fluently and lyrically, 
with vivacious virtuosity where required. Arthur Haas was on hand throughout 
the evening for the minimal harpsichord duties. TIMOTHY MANGAN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: WIDE-RANGING SURVEY OF SPANISH CINEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Cinematheque's "Recent Spanish Cinema" (Friday through Sunday at 
the Directors Guild) reveals the diversity, vitality and daring of Spanish 
films, most of which unfortunately never make it to American screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cinematheque's selection is venturesome, to say the least, ranging from 
the supersexy, dark-pitched comedies for which Spain is best known, to several 
demanding experimental films, and a well-mounted, straightforward TV adaptation 
of "Don Quixote." 
</P>
<P>
 The series commences Friday at 7 p.m. with Victor Erice's formidable 
138-minute "Dream of Light," an exquisite, mysterious study of a painter, 
Antonio Lopez, and his steadfast attempt to capture the beauty of a quince tree 
with a geometric precision that causes him even to factor in the drooping of 
the fruit as it ripens.  
</P>
<P>
 No photorealist, Lopez is caught up in exploring the relationship between art 
and nature, and Erice, best known for "The Spirit of Beehive" and "The South," 
celebrates the creative impulse as a triumph over the inevitability of 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed at 9:30 p.m. with Bigas Luna's "Golden Balls," an 
outrageous and entertaining send-up of self-deluding machismo starring Javier 
Bardem, who played the stud in Luna's recent "Jamon, Jamon." Bardem is 
exceedingly, almost comically handsome and virile, but he's also a superb actor 
capable of commenting on the Latin lover stereotype, who in this instance is a 
ruthless, struggling builder who equates erecting skyscrapers with his sexual 
potency. Producer Andres Vicente Gomez will be on hand for a post-screening 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Guerin's "Innisfree" (Saturday at 2:45 p.m.) returns to the lush 
Irish countryside where John Ford shot "The Quiet Man" in 1951, and the making 
of that classic becomes a point of departure for considering Irish politics, 
history and folklore. This is an evocative but overly leisurely film with 
long-held shots of idyllic locales, and it becomes tedious way before it 
reaches its full 110-minute running time.  
</P>
<P>
 The least impressive offering in the series, Francisco Rigueiro's "Mother 
Gilda" (Saturday at 4:45 p.m.) ponderously explores the madonna/whore complex, 
epitomized here by Rita Hayworth in "Gilda," while skewering the dreary, 
extravagant decadence of the Franco regime. Such themes have been dealt with 
before far more effectively, and "Mother Gilda" really belongs on the stage, 
since its unfolds like a filmed play.  
</P>
<P>
 Superbly designed and beautifully lit, Manuel Gutierrez Aragon's two-part, 
310-minute "El Quijote" -- Part I screens Saturday at 7 p.m. -- is a faithful, 
vigorous adaptation of Cervantes that probably plays better on the small screen 
for which it was intended but is enlivened by that suave and versatile veteran 
Fernando Rey, whose glorious portrayal caps a distinguished international 
career. Aragon will be present for a Q&A; Part II screens Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bilingual Lover" (Saturday at 10 p.m.) is another but more impressive 
exploration of obsessive passion from Vicente Aranda, director of "Lovers." 
Imanol Arias stars as an impoverished Catalan who marries a rich Barcelona 
beauty (Ornella Muti) but ends up a street accordionist dressed like the 
Phantom of the Opera. What happens next attests to Arias' fine skills as an 
actor and to Aranda's bold imagination. Aranda and producer Andres Vicente 
Gomez will be present for a discussion following the film. 
</P>
<P>
 In an instance of saving the best for the last, Imanol Uribe's "The 
Dumbfounded King" (Sunday at 1 p.m.) is the lightest, sliest of satires in 
which a shy 17th-Century 20-year-old king (Gabino Diego) -- never named but 
surely Phillip IV -- loses his virginity with the most celebrated prostitute of 
the day (Laura del Sol) in an assignation arranged by a worldly count. 
</P>
<P>
 When as a result the young monarch demands to see his beautiful French queen 
(Anna Roussel) naked, scandal erupts, even provoking a hearing of the high 
tribunal of the Inquisition, where one priest proclaims that if Spain loses its 
war with Flanders or its fleet to English privateers it would be on account of 
the king's request. This is a timeless, witty observation suggesting that those 
most eager to repress sex seem ever to be those most obsessed by it.

TV REVIEWS; 'QUEEN OF ELEPHANTS' AWASH IN CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month brought that admirable documentary "Reflections on Elephants" on 
PBS. And at 12:30 p.m. Friday, CNN devotes a half hour to the desperate 
survival struggle of the African elephant.Yet casual viewers along with 
die-hard elephant-philes may find fault with tonight's "Queen of the 
Elephants." 
</P>
<P>
 This beautifully photographed, two-hour ride with English adventurer Mark 
Shand gives you a sense of the life-and-death conflict between the endangered 
Asian elephant and its modern environment in India. The elephant is now a 
symbol of devastation to Indians who once regarded it as a symbol of virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 But elephants almost become second bananas here to Shand himself and to Indian 
driver-trainer Parbati Barua, as she teachers her British guest how to ride 
these huge, graceful animals, which for thousands of years, she says, were this 
land's "supreme work force." 
</P>
<P>
 "Queen of the Elephants" impales itself on its own contradictions. On the one 
hand, Barua laments the demise of the elephants, as their traditional natural 
habitats increasingly become tea farms. You don't doubt her sincerity or 
compassion. But on the other hand, as someone who learned from her father the 
art of capturing and training elephants to serve humans virtually as machines, 
she has contributed to their ruination in the wild, a conflict the program does 
not address. 
</P>
<P>
 It does relentlessly address Shand's own feelings ("Gradually, I was slowing 
down, slowing down to the pace of the country. . . ."). But who cares? His 
journey across India by elephant takes three months. This program seems to take 
almost as long. HOWARD ROSENBERG

NUSSBAUM WAS SERVING THE WRONG MASTER; WHITEWATER: THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL IS 
NOT THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER; HE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN BYCEL, Benjamin Bycel is the executive director of the Los Angeles 
city Ethics Commission. A lawyer, he teaches law-school courses on legal 
ethics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week thousands of law students across the country will be taking a 
mandatory "professional responsibility" examination, which tests their 
knowledge of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern the practice of 
law.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone should save a seat for recently deposed White House counsel Bernard W. 
Nussbaum, though he might have a serious problem passing the test. The former 
Wall Street corporate litigator appears to have forgotten at least one of the 
basics of legal ethics -- loyalty to one's client. 
</P>
<P>
 What? Didn't Nussbaum do everything to zealously protect Bill Clinton's 
position in the brewing Whitewater scandal? After all, he shielded documents, 
fought a special prosecutor and met with federal regulators. What more could he 
have done for Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Clinton was not his client. Nussbaum's client was the 
United States government, not the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
The White House counsel is a public servant paid by the government, not by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear to Nussbaum that any connection Clinton might have had to 
the case in Arkansas did not involve his duties as President, Nussbaum should 
have taken the steps necessary to separate himself from the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, taking this step would not have been easy, considering the political 
realities and the years of friendship with the President. But the American Bar 
Assn. model rules of professional conduct make it very clear that a lawyer who 
represents a government agency, like a lawyer who represents a corporation, 
owes a duty to the agency, not to any one individual in the agency. Imagine the 
situation if Nussbaum were an attorney for a major corporation whose CEO had 
legal problems stemming from his previous job. You can bet the board of 
directors would not be pleased if their general counsel was spending his time 
on a matter unrelated to the CEO's current job. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be politically naive to think that this general rule covers the 
White House, there is no ethical reason to make an exception for the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum should have counseled the President that it was in the government's 
best interest to turn over all information related to Whitewater as quickly as 
possible. If the President refused, Nussbaum should have stepped aside and 
advised him to obtain independent counsel. If the President refused that advice 
and ordered Nussbaum to continue working on Whitewater, Nussbaum should have 
resigned.  
</P>
<P>
 This may have been what happened but I doubt it. Nussbaum believed and acted 
as every White House counsel before him has -- as if the President was his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wrong. But that isn't why he was asked by the President to take the 
sacrificial bullet. He was fired not because of his tactics but because they 
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that there still may be a serious problem in the White House. 
Either the President and his advisers do not understand what the proper role of 
White House counsel is, or, worse yet, they understand but don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody in the government -- the attorney general? -- must have the political 
courage to make it clear to the President that the White House counsel can 
represent the interest of the President only when the President is acting in 
his official capacity. For any other legal advice or service, the President 
must do just what the rest of us have to do when we have a legal problem: Go 
out and hire a private attorney.

DUCKS GET BURNED IN PHOENIX; HOCKEY: BLACKHAWKS ADMINISTER TEAM'S FIRST 
BACK-TO-BACK SHUTOUTS, 3-0, BEFORE PARTISAN CHICAGO CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What was this, Chicago Stadium West? Or HoHoKam Park? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' neutral-site game against the Chicago Blackhawks at America 
West Arena on Wednesday night was Cactus League hockey: There were legions of 
Cub fans in the stands pulling like mad for the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the crowd of 13,847 stood and did an Arizona version of the Chicago 
Stadium roar during the national anthem, then chanted, "Eddie! Eddie" as goalie 
Ed Belfour put the finishing touches on a 3-0 shutout of the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time this season Belfour has shut out the Ducks, but the 
ugly fact for the Ducks is that for the first time in their 68-game existence 
they have been shut out twice in a row, first by the San Jose's Arturs Irbe on 
Sunday in a loss that dealt a blow to their playoff hopes, and now by Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two games, they have been outscored, 9-0 -- and they might have to 
face Buffalo's Dominik Hasek tonight at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Ducks' playoff push began with 20 games remaining, they have gone 
1-3 and have fallen behind San Jose by six. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you do?" Coach Ron Wilson said. "I mean, Eddie Belfour made some big 
saves when he needed to, and had some luck when we had opportunities when the 
net was a little open and we couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything negative to say about our team. We tried hard, we 
skated well, we were physical, we just didn't score. You won't win any games if 
you don't score." 
</P>
<P>
 The power play was 0 for 6, compounding the horrid streak they brought in -- 
three for their last 46. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, a bunch so positive they wore "Skate for Eight" playoff shirts in 
their first training camp, said the loss was not as devastating as it would 
seem. 
</P>
<P>
 "After last game, which was probably our worst of the season, I thought we 
came out and played well," said Joe Sacco, who had by far the most chances of 
any player on the team, with six shots. We were only down, 1-0, after the first 
and even after two periods we were still in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Murphy gave the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead at 12:09 of the first, scoring with 
the Blackhawks holding a two-mad advantage after Tim Sweeney went off for 
tripping and then Garry Valk followed him for high-sticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago didn't score again until the third period, when Michel Goulet lifted a 
loose rebound over goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov and sprawling defenseman Mark 
Ferner at 3:28. 
</P>
<P>
 The final goal was an empty-netter by Murphy with 1:16 left. Defenseman Chris 
Chelios assisted on all three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had chances, but Belfour came up with 31 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco had another of the opportunities that have become his trademark -- a 
shorthanded breakaway -- but Keith Carney's hook went uncalled and Belfour 
stopped a weakened shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson tried shaking up the lines, putting newcomer Stephan Lebeau with Troy 
Loney and Sacco. It worked well, but it didn't result in a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating right now," Lebeau said. "You don't want a chance, you want 
a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 What the crowd wanted was what they got, a Chicago victory and a Belfour 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chicago of the West," Blackhawk Coach Darryl Sutter said. "You could tell 
there were a lot of Chicago fans, and probably some Canadians that like our 
type of hockey, which is if someone's in the way, run them over." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Belfour: "I could hear the chants -- it reminded me of home." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Olympic star Paul Kariya is giving up his college eligibility to turn 
professional -- but that doesn't mean he's close to agreeing to contract terms 
with the Mighty Ducks. "He's made the decision to leave school," said Don 
Baizley, Kariya's legal adviser. "(But) right now, it looks like we won't have 
a deal in the short run." He defined "short run" as the remainder of the 
season. Still, the decision means Kariya, a University of Maine sophomore, can 
now negotiate openly with the Ducks, instead of only listening to offers in 
order to protect his NCAA eligibility. The sides remain far apart. The Ducks 
have made an offer worth at least $850,000 a year, which is slotted between the 
contracts signed by last year's No. 3 and No. 5 picks. Kariya, who was drafted 
fourth, is reportedly seeking as much as $1.5 million a year. "This doesn't 
mean we'll get a deal done any faster," said club president Tony Tavares. "I 
would say it removes an impediment to making a deal. . . . It increases the 
possibility of coming to an agreement this year, but it's impossible to predict 
how long negotiations are going to take . . . . Before, we were just sitting 
around throwing darts in the ocean, not knowing where the bull's eye was. At 
least now we know where the board's at."

MIKE DOWNEY: ARE THESE DODGERS OR U.N.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On that day Chan Ho Park, Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Delino DeShields, Jose 
Offerman and Tim Wallach meet in the infield of Dodger Stadium to discuss a 
batter, it's going to resemble an emergency meeting of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers now have everything but a British bullpen stopper and 
Vietnamese outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ahhh, I can almost hear Vin Scully now. "Doesn't a combination of Park and 
Piazza sound like a pleasant place to spend a summer afternoon?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maybe Michael Jordan should start with T-ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jose Canseco's won-lost record this spring is still 0-0, with an earned-run 
average of 0.00. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leo Durocher, R.I.P.: Nice guys get into Hall of Fame last. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is my first year as a baseball fan that I can't name the managers of 
all the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Michael Jordan can turn White Sox baseball into a pro-am event, I don't 
see any reason Bill Murray can't with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Baseball doesn't even have a commissioner to keep Bill off the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I can't wait for "Everything I Did as Baseball Commissioner," Fay Vincent's 
new two-page biography. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More bedtime stories: "We Played the Game: 65 Players Remember Baseball's 
Greatest Era, 1947-1964" (Hyperion, $35), edited by Danny Peary. Good news is, 
it's good reading. Bad news is, at 643 pages, bring a lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right now I foresee the 1995 all-lefty pitching rotation for the Angels as 
being Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, Joe Magrane and Ila Borders of Southern 
California College, so somebody start getting her uniform ready. 
</P>
<P>
 -- My 4-5-6 hitters for the Angels would be Eduardo, Snow and Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In "Blue Chips II," Temple Coach John Chaney threatens to kill Nick Nolte. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I now fear two loud noises: One, another earthquake. Two, if a Bob Knight 
team ever loses again by 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Next Sunday, the NCAA will announce who gets to defeat Arizona in the first 
round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I don't believe for a minute that Arizona State's basketball players shaved 
points. I have never seen an Arizona State player who needed to miss shots on 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NBA MVP? David Robinson, an officer and a gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robinson should take all the major awards this season, including most 
bizarre teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scottie Pippen claims white guys don't get booed. He should read my mail. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Here's a trade proposal: Ron Harper to the Chicago Bulls for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I hear the catch holding up the Lakers from getting Derrick Coleman away 
from New Jersey is the Benoit has to stay there clause. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Tyson supposedly now weighs well under 200 pounds. By the time he's 
out, he might have to fight welterweight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Donald Trump's attorneys are lining up a prison charity bout between Tyson 
and that guy who was so fond of Marla's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The runner-up runner in the L.A. Marathon kept waiting for the 
front-running runner to quit running. Funny, this is the same thing that keeps 
happening to the horses I bet on at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It took the L.A. Marathon winner 2 hours 12 minutes 13 seconds to win, 
exactly what it took me to drive home from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two of the things we keep running in the newspaper are the world tennis 
rankings and the world golf rankings. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever 
heard anybody discuss the world tennis rankings or the world golf rankings? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Miller could be just the quarterback to lift the Rams as high as 
third in their division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Well, it's Wednesday. Isn't it about time the Kings made a trade involving 
Marty McSorley? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I see no reason Gordie Howe has to jump up and hop on a plane every time 
Wayne Gretzky approaches one of his records. That's a lot of jumping and a lot 
of hopping. Stay home, Gordie. You don't have to congratulate a person in 
person. That's why God invented telegrams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sorry, Kings. I still see a Canadien-Duck championship series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The late, great John Candy was a big man and a big sports fan. Funniest TV 
skit I ever saw him do, he played Babe Ruth. A sick kid in a hospital asks the 
Babe to hit him a homer. Babe (Candy) says, "Sure, kid." Sick kid says: "Make 
it two homers." Babe says OK. Sick kid says: "Now eat 20 hot dogs." Babe starts 
eating the dogs. Sick kid says: "Hopping on one foot." Babe hops. Sick kid 
says: "Now do a cartwheel." Babe goes for the kid's throat and has to be pulled 
off him. Thank you, John. You made us laugh and laugh and laugh.

NHL ROUNDUP; STRAKA'S THREE GOALS COOL BRUINS, LEAD PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hottest team in the NHL, the Boston Bruins, was put on ice in Pittsburgh 
by Martin Straka, who scored three goals to lead the Penguins to a 7-3 victory 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the team to beat right now, so I think we were geared up for them," 
said right wing Doug Brown, who had three assists for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for us to finish first in our (Eastern) conference. To 
do that, we have to beat the Bruins." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Straka's goals came 21 seconds apart in a four-goal second period, as 
the Penguins ended Boston's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Penguins within five points of Boston for the Northeast 
Division lead. Pittsburgh and Montreal each have 78 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a time of year where you want to get going and not have any lapses," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston defenseman Ray Bourque said the Bruins had one of those unfortunate 
lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity level was not where it needed to be tonight," Bourque said. "No 
excuses. We should have played a lot better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston also may have been dragging a bit after playing three games in four 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 5, Ottawa 2 -- Ron Sutter scored two goals -- the second into an empty 
net in the last minute -- at Quebec as the Nordiques handed the Senators their 
sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques, who rank 25th of 26 teams in power-play efficiency, scored 
three goals with a man advantage. Besides Sutter, Valeri Kamensky and Joe Sakic 
also connected for power-play goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators have lost 10 of their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Neal Broten scored a power-play goal 2:43 into 
overtime to give the Stars a victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Broten poked in a rebound from the left side of the net for the game-winner as 
the Stars snapped a three-game winless streak (0-2-1). Dallas is 11-1-1 this 
season when Broten scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, San Jose 4 -- Alexander Mogilny scored power-play goals in the 
second and third periods as the Sabres overcame a 4-2 Shark advantage at San 
Jose in a game in which neither team had a shot on goal in overtime.

MORNING BRIEFING: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE PLANNING A REAL SHAKEUP WITH MONIKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miami has the Hurricanes, Alabama the Crimson Tide, UC Santa Cruz the Banana 
Slugs and Iowa State the Cyclones, so why not the Quakes for Cal State 
Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
 What started out as a playful suggestion, after the Jan. 17 earthquake, that 
the school change its nickname from the Matadors to Quakes, is becoming 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball Coach Pete Cassidy, who has long winced at the existing moniker's 
echo of an ignominious tactic -- the "matador defense," backs the change. So 
does Rodney Lazar, CSUN Associated Students vice president who drafted a formal 
resolution proposing the name change be put to a student vote on April 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would help the campus be recognized nationally," Lazar said. "Everyone 
knows where Northridge is now."

 Trivia time: When and where was the first NBA game played? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Warm welcome: Former Texas football and track star James Lott went to the 
dinner to be inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame. 
Instead, he was arrested for outstanding warrants midway through the banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott, an assistant track coach at Indiana, was called from the dais by being 
told there was a family emergency. When he stepped outside, McLennan County 
sheriff's deputies arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they couldn't have waited until afterward," Lott said 
after being jailed briefly for an outstanding felony theft-by-check warrant 
from Travis County and warrants in Fayette County for speeding and failure to 
appear in court. He posted $1,000 bail and paid the fines before being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for him: Senior golfer Walt Zembriski said he expects Deane Beman, who 
has announced that he is retiring as commissioner of the PGA Tour at the end of 
next year, to leave the job within three months. "Then, he's coming out on our 
tour," Zembriski said. "There will be a number of guys out here who will enjoy 
beating (him)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Different ideas: Hakeem Olajuwon is an All-Star center, but the Houston player 
doesn't think of himself as such. 
</P>
<P>
 "My game is putting things that guards and forwards do into a big man's game," 
Olajuwon told Hoop. "I don't compare myself with 7-foot centers. My game is for 
those who like to shake and fake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Different perspective: Arnold Palmer and Don January, a pair of 64-year-olds, 
were chatting on the practice tee at Ojai Valley during the GTE West Classic 
when Palmer asked, "How's your health, Don?" 
</P>
<P>
 January, known as "Bones" on the senior tour, replied: "I don't worry about my 
health. I'm just glad to be alive." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Losing winner: Dean Smith's North Carolina basketball team keeps winning 
games, but the arena named after him keeps losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for 1987-88, when a string of concerts helped it turn a profit, the 
$34-million Dean E. Smith Center has lost money every year since it opened in 
1986. Last year, the arena lost $611,000, even though North Carolina won the 
NCAA basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is at the critical point, because we cannot afford to continue the trend 
any longer," said Jeff Elliott, Smith Center director. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Nov. 1, 1946, in Toronto, where the New York Knickerbockers 
beat the hometown Huskies, 68-66.

NBA ROUNDUP; HORNETS TAKE ON NEW LOOK WHEN MOURNING RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there was any question about Alonzo Mourning's value to the Charlotte 
Hornets, it was answered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He's back and so are the Hornets. Well, halfway back. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning returned from a 15-game absence to score 24 points and help them snap 
an eight-game losing streak with a 97-89 victory over the Phoenix Suns on 
Tuesday night at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played tenacious defense," said Mourning, who also had 15 rebounds. "We 
came together as a unit and worked as hard as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Mourning, out because of a torn calf muscle, the Hornets were 1-14 and 
gave up an average of 116 points per game. The victory over the NBA's 
highest-scoring team pulled Charlotte 5 1/2 games behind New Jersey for the 
final Eastern Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets' playoff chances could improve even more with the return of 
forward Larry Johnson, who has missed 31 games because of a strained lower 
back. Johnson might play Friday at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 116, Atlanta 95 -- Scottie Pippen scored a season-high 39 points at 
Chicago as the Bulls snapped their five-game losing streak and the Hawks' 
six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls pulled away with the help of 10 three-point goals and three runs of 
13 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 100, Minnesota 86 -- The Jazz tied a franchise record with their 10th 
consecutive victory as Karl Malone had 30 points and 11 rebounds at Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 95, Denver 88 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 29 points and 16 rebounds and 
the Magic got an unexpected lift from his backup, Tree Rollins, who scored 
eight fourth-quarter points at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 103, Sacramento 82 -- The Cavaliers matched a team record with their 
11th consecutive victory, getting 18 points each from Terrell Brandon -- who 
filled in for banged-up Mark Price -- and John Williams at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 115, Houston 99 -- J.R. Reid scored a season-high 24 points as the 
Spurs moved into first place in the NBA Midwest Division at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 113, Golden State 98 -- Shawn Kemp had 24 points and 14 rebounds at 
Seattle as the SuperSonics won their sixth in a row. The Warriors' Chris Webber 
did not play because of a bruised hip.

HARPER, WILKINS PLAY LIKE LIFELONG FRIENDS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY COMBINE FOR 70 
POINTS AS THE CLIPPERS HOLD OFF THE MAVERICKS, 116-110. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Harper still misses his good friend Danny Manning, but he hasn't taken 
long to adjust to playing with Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins and Harper have only been playing together for nine days, but you 
wouldn't know it from watching them on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper scored 36 points and Wilkins got 34 as the Clippers beat the Dallas 
Mavericks, 116-110, Tuesday night before an announced crowd of 10,784 at 
Reunion Arena. The victory lifted the Clippers out of a last-place Pacific 
Division tie with the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fun to watch out there together," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said of 
Wilkins and Harper. "They seem to have a good flow with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper scored 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Clippers held off the 
Mavericks after squandering a 18-point first-half lead. Harper, who wasn't in 
uniform for the last two games because of a strained left hamstring, made 11 of 
22 shots and 14 of 17 free throws. He also had eight rebounds, four blocked 
shots and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feed off each other," forward Harold Ellis said of Harper and Wilkins. 
"It's like a competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who made nine of 23 shots in last Saturday's 17-point loss at Houston 
after suffering a sprained left wrist, made 11 of 23 shots, including three 
three-pointers. He also had eight rebounds and four assists as the Clippers 
beat the Mavericks for the 10th game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun playing with (Harper)," Wilkins said. "When you're a player, it 
isn't that hard to adjust to somebody else's game, you just have to come out 
and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired from the Atlanta Hawks on Feb. 24 for Manning, Wilkins has averaged 
30.5 points in six games as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who has declined public comment since he was suspended for one game by 
the Clippers on Feb. 17 for making negative statements about the team, has 
averaged 24.5 points in eight games since the suspension. It was the third time 
that he has scored 30 or more points since he returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, in the final year of a contract that pays him a reported $3.5 
million, and Harper, who earns $4 million, could both become unrestricted free 
agents at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are handling it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk, we talk all the time and I tell him, 'You ain't going nowhere, so 
shut up and keep quiet,' " Wilkins said of Harper. "He's in the same situation 
that I'm in. He's a free agent at the end of the year, and he's trying to 
accomplish something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about it. When I step on the floor, it's all about business to 
me, I don't worry about anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could go off about the trade and get angry. . . . I'm angry in my own way, 
but I don't bring it to my place of work. I let it stay at home or inside me 
where nobody knows. . . . But that just makes me want to play that much harder. 
That's the attitude I want to take." 
</P>
<P>
 The game matched two of the NBA's worst teams. The Mavericks have the worst 
record (8-51) in the NBA and the Clippers brought the NBA's sixth worst record 
(now 20-38) into the game, losing nine of their first 12 games after the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 11 points with 10:08 remaining, the Clippers were outscored, 16-5, 
as Dallas took a 100-99 lead on a basket by guard Jim Jackson, who had a 
season-high 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Harper, who made four of six shots in the fourth quarter, scored nine 
points and set up another with a steal as the Clippers outscored the Mavericks, 
17-10, in the final four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that the Clippers have had two players score 30 or more 
points in a game this season. . . . Guard Mark Jackson declined comment after 
being held out of the game in the fourth quarter. It was the second time in the 
last week that Jackson, who had four points, four rebounds and six assists 
against Dallas, was benched for the last quarter as Coach Bob Weiss used guard 
Gary Grant. . . . Forward Tom Tolbert sat out his fifth game in a row because 
of a strained back. . . . Charles Outlaw, who signed for the remainder of the 
season on Monday, started at forward in place of Loy Vaught, sidelined because 
of a hip injury. Outlaw had nine points and a game-high nine rebounds. . . . 
Maverick rookie forward Jamal Mashburn suffered a strained left hip.

RIVERSIDE NORTH EDGES ST. JOHN BOSCO, 66-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They had seen him do it so many times that when Jelani Gardner took a 10-foot 
jump shot with eight seconds left Tuesday night, his Bellflower St. John Bosco 
teammates expected more heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the shot popped in and out, and Riverside North grabbed the rebound, 
came the real surprise. The Huskies' Brian Hooks took an outlet pass at 
halfcourt and raced for an uncontested layup with two seconds left, giving 
North a 66-64 victory in the first round of the Division II Southern Regional 
State Tournament at Cypress College before 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one thought they'd send a guy down court like that," Gardner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Particularly not North Coach Mike Bartee. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hooks) is a forward, he's supposed to be rebounding," Bartee said, smiling. 
"But I'll let that one go." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 Hooks, who scored 19 points, slipped as he tried to guard Gardner 
on the Braves' possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the shot went off, I busted loose," Hooks said. "They were more 
worried about getting the ball back." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brian Breslin, coach of the Braves (28-3): "Normally, we don't take that 
shot until four seconds are left. But (Gardner) beat his man so well he was 
forced to take the shot so early. Then I saw a North jersey down the court, and 
I knew we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiva Anderson of the Huskies (29-1) scored a game-high 26 points, had eight 
rebounds and three assists, including the pass to Hooks for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-6 Gardner, who was the target of the North defense, was held to a 
team-high 16 points, only five after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe he makes everyone around him better," Bartee said of Gardner. "We 
said if we boxed him, he doesn't get a chance to do that. It throws them out of 
a constant offense." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the game was on the line, Gardner thought he would find a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was in," Gardner said of his last shot. "But that's the way it 
goes sometimes."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw High moved one step closer in its bid to repeat as Division I state 
champion by routing Huntington Beach Edison, 79-45, in the opening round of the 
Southern Regional tournament Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Dominguez Hills, the second-seeded Cougars (26-2) took an 18-6 
first quarter lead and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (19-11), coming off a tough loss to Mater Dei on Saturday, had five 
turnovers in the first three minutes and made only three of 15 shots in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the team was overanxious," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. "They had a 
good showing against Mater Dei, and they thought another good showing and they 
would be competitive with Crenshaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Kroeger led the Chargers with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Arch led Crenshaw with 24 points, including six three-pointers. 
Kristaan Johnson added 21 points. Tremaine Fowlkes, who is averaging 25 points, 
was held to five.

 Inglewood 80, Bakersfield South 67 -- Paul Pierce, who has been unstoppable in 
the playoffs, had 23 points and 13 rebounds to lead Inglewood (29-3) in a 
Division II game at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Pacifica 70, Anaheim Servite 55 -- Chris Vlasic scored 16 of his 
game-high 22 points in the first half as Pacifica (28-1) rolled to a Division 
III victory at Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Surface added 20 points and six rebounds for the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (20-10) was led by Mark Seaton's 16 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita 75, San Dimas 73 -- Jeremy Veal of San Dimas scored a 
game-high 43 points, but Santa Margarita guard Brian Scoggin made two free 
throws with 22 seconds to play to clinch a Division III victory for the Eagles 
(25-6) at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoggin finished with 23 points, including five three-pointers. Brian and Brad 
Finneran added 19 and 18 points, respectively, for Santa Margarita. 
</P>

 * Kudos to the Clinton Administration for changing the emphasis from 
interdiction to education and treatment in an effort to combat drug addiction. 
This change in direction is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, prison space will also become available to incarcerate violent 
criminals -- which should always be law enforcement's primary emphasis.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SAVE SOME MONEY, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Space-saver" schools -- designed to be built upward rather than outward and 
to avoid condemnation of residential property -- promise to be a welcome 
innovation. But Santa Ana, in line to have the state's first such school, must 
be sure it does not pay too much for the land involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of observers have questioned paying nearly $22 million for a strip in 
the Bristol Market Place shopping mall that would accommodate the building. 
Given depressed real estate prices, the question is a good one, raised even by 
the author of California's "space-saver" legislation, state Sen. Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael). 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District needs to be more forthcoming about the 
proposed purchase. Merely saying that the price reflects an appraisal is 
insufficient, because there are questions about the assumptions in that 
appraisal. Nor is it right to say that the state, which will foot the entire 
bill for the school's land, will scrutinize the deal and thereby prevent 
overpayment. The school district must do its part, even if another governmental 
entity is paying, because the taxpayers ultimately bear the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed school, which will have a ground-level garage and two floors of 
classrooms above for 1,300 middle-school students, has been controversial. Some 
neighbors object to the prospect of increased traffic, noise and numerous 
teen-agers in the mall. The school board rightly approved the project, but it 
and the state should be ready to renegotiate or even look elsewhere if the cost 
proves unjustified.

 Los Angeles Crenshaw, the No. 5-ranked boys' basketball team in the nation 
according to USA Today, blew out Edison, 79-45, Tuesday in the first round of 
the Southern California Division I Regionals at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After pushing Mater Dei to the limit in the Southern Section Division I-A 
final, the Chargers (19-11) appeared ready to compete with Crenshaw.However, 
they were caught in a running game with Crenshaw and had five turnovers in the 
first three minutes. They made only three of 15 field goals and trailed, 18-6, 
after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (23-5) maintained at least a 15-point lead through the second and 
third quarters and then outscored Edison, 28-11, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the team was overanxious," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. "They had a 
good showing against Mater Dei and they thought another good showing and they 
would be competitive with Crenshaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Kroeger led Edison with 13 points, making seven of eight free throws. He 
was three of 15 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to run with them and we got burned," Kroeger said. "To beat a team 
like Crenshaw, you have to be patient. You can't play their up-tempo style." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Arch led Crenshaw with 24 points, including six three-pointers, and 
Kristaan Johnson had 21. Tremaine Fowlkes, a 6-6 1/2 center who was averaging 
25.5 points and 15.8 rebounds, had five points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw used its bench more than at any time this season and rarely ran its 
full-court press.

PACIFICA WAKES UP, ADVANCES; DIVISION III: VLASIC FUELS HIS TEAM TO A 70-55 
VICTORY OVER SERVITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the euphoria of Saturday's Southern Section title fresh in his mind, 
Pacifica Coach Bob Becker acknowledged he had a hard time getting up for 
Tuesday night's Southern California Division III Regional opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Pacifica, Chris Vlasic didn't have the same problem. He 
jump-started the Mariners by scoring 16 first-half points as his team took a 
13-point halftime lead. Pacifica held on from there and defeated Servite, 
70-55, Tuesday night at Long Beach City College before about 3,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pacifica (28-1) will play host to fifth-seeded San Diego St. 
Augustine (25-5) Thursday night, probably at an alternate site. St. Augustine 
defeated Shafter, 46-43. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic scored only four points in the first quarter, but he caught fire in the 
second quarter as he scored eight consecutive points on an eight-foot baseline 
jumper and consecutive three-pointers. Vlasic's spurt lengthened Pacifica's 
lead from 17-16 to 25-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those nights where my teammates were getting me the ball," 
Vlasic said. "It was falling for me and I was taking the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Becker: "Vlasic was really on (Tuesday). Unfortunately for Chris, he 
plays for me. I sat him for a long time in the second half because I wanted him 
fresh when they made their run." 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind by 19 early in the third quarter, Servite (20-10) managed 
to trim the lead to 49-37 after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of pride," Vlasic said. "We knew they weren't going to die. 
This is the state playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But each time Servite made a run, Pacifica countered with a fast-break basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface's dunked after Servite had closed to 52-43. Then, minutes later Eric 
Maurer's bucket off a nifty feed from Surface gave Pacifica a 59-45 lead with 
5:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
 When Servite pressed Pacifica during the last five minutes, Becker reinserted 
Vlasic to handle the ball and shoot free throws. Servite closed to 59-51 with 
2:40 left, Ryan Teague hit two free throws and Surface hit one of two to extend 
the lead to 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite never got closer than nine points after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Becker thanked his players for motivating him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was tougher for me than it was for the kids," he said. "Me and my 
assistants felt really drained from Saturday. (Tuesday), it was the kids who 
had to light a fire under me." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic wasn't the only Mariner lighting fires. Surface scored 20, including 11 
in the second half and Ramon Alliman came off the bench to score 10 points. 
Miller finished with seven points and four rebounds and Ryan Teague added six 
points and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Seaton led Servite with 16 points and 16 rebounds before fouling out. 
Kieran Betts added 13 and David Downs had 11 points and four rebounds.

 San Dimas guard Jeremy Veal almost proved that a great player can beat a good 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Veal poured in 43 points, 18 in the fourth quarter, but third-seeded Santa 
Margarita had just enough to escape with a 75-73 victory in the first round of 
the Division III Southern California Regional boys' basketball playoffs Tuesday 
at Santa Margarita High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (25-6) shot 64% (30 of 47) from the field in advancing to the 
semifinals Thursday to play University of San Diego High, a 68-39 winner over 
Wasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Veal scored on a rebound basket to cut the lead to 73-70 with 25 seconds 
remaining and the Saints (24-6) quickly fouled to stop the clock with 22 
seconds remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita guard Brian Scoggin, who had 23 points and made five of six 
three-pointers, calmly sank both ends of the one-and-one to push the lead to 
75-70, making Veal's off-balance three-pointer with two seconds remaining 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought all year long we were pretty good defensively," Santa Margarita 
Coach Jerry DeBusk said. "But we never saw a player like Veal. . . . Is that 
guy good or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Veal, a 6-foot-3 senior who has signed with Arizona State, made 16 of 22 
shots, including six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to mix it up defensively," DeBusk said. "We ran a trap at him, some 
zones, man-to-man. I was ready to get the custodian to see if he could cover 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Veal made nine consecutive shots at one point in the second half, but his 
final three-pointer needed to be a five-pointer, and the Eagles ran off the 
final two seconds when Brian Finneran lofted a 3/4-court pass to his twin 
brother Brad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnerans started the game strong scoring Santa Margarita's first six 
points. Both Finnerans made nine of 12 shots from the field, typifying the 
sharp shooting night Santa Margarita enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played as good defensively that we could have," San Dimas Coach 
Gary Prestesater said. "But they did a good job shooting the ball. It was a 
heck of a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Finneran finished with 19 points, nine assists, five rebounds, and five 
steals. Brad Finneran had 18 points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnerans and teammate Brendan Mulligan, who had 15 points and five 
rebounds, took turns guarding Veal in the Eagles' man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game plan was to stop Veal, but obviously we didn't do that," Scoggin 
said. "Luckily, we were able to just trade baskets with them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Santa Margarita missed its first two shots of the game, they made nine 
of their next 10 to take a 21-15 lead after one quarter. The Eagles made 68% 
(15 of 22) from the field in the first half and didn't have a turnover, but 
still led only 36-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Finneran's steal and dunk with a minute remaining in the third quarter 
gave Santa Margarita its biggest lead at 57-44. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Saints wouldn't fold. Veal made a three-pointer with three seconds 
left in the quarter, and he scored all but eight of his team's 26 
fourth-quarter points.

MATER DEI BACK IN THE ROUT BUSINESS; DIVISION I: AFTER SCARE AGAINST EDISON, 
MONARCHS RETURN TO FORM WITH AN 85-54 POUNDING OF CRESCENTA VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mater Dei got back to the business of being Mater Dei on Tuesday night in the 
first round of the Southern California Regional Division I boys' basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, shaken and rattled by Edison in the Southern Section I-A final, 
found a perfect way to vent their frustrations. They pummeled La Crescenta 
Crescenta Valley, 85-54, at the Bren Center to advance to Thursday's regional 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (32-0) will play Fresno Bullard at Ocean View High. "I'm a lot 
happier with that performance," Monarch Coach Gary McKnight said. "I have a 
smile on my face tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from the scowl he had Saturday after the Monarchs barely held 
on for a 65-59 victory in the section final. Mater Dei nearly blew a 15-point 
fourth quarter lead, which prompted McKnight to tear into his team in the 
locker room afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 All was forgotten and forgiven Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley was the perfect ego-booster. The Falcons had little quickness 
and not much depth.  
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, ranked second in the nation by USA Today, still looked wobbly at 
times. But they also showed the kind of killer instinct that had chewed up one 
opponent after another during the regular season and most of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs led, 40-28, at halftime, and just kept extending that lead. 
Crescenta Valley (19-11) got no closer than 14 points in the second half. It 
was a 20-point spread most of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley was smothered offensively. Richard O'Neill scored 17 points, 
three below his average. The 6-foot guard made only four of 25 shots, as the 
6-4 Miles Simon hounded him and pounded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock Jacobsen had 10 points in the first quarter, but only eight the rest of 
the game. No one else made a ripple for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready tonight," Simon said. "We were ready from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton certainly was. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, a 6-foot-5 freshman forward, had his first shot attempt blocked by 
Mike Crowder. Cotton then scored nine of Mater Dei's first 12 points -- six on 
dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley had no one who could match up with him. The Falcons only 
inside force was gone before the second half was a minute old. Blake Jacobson, 
a 6-8 center, fouled out with 7 minutes 9 seconds left in the quarter. The 
middle was left wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton made 12 of 19 shots, scored 29 points and had 16 rebounds. Shaun 
Jackson scored 12 points and had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton and Simon had accounted for 51 of the Monarchs' 65 points against 
Edison. The Monarchs had four players in double figures Tuesday. Clay McKnight 
scored 17 and Simon 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were balanced tonight," McKnight said. "That's what is best for Mater 
Dei."

SAILORS SURVIVE ROUGH GAME TO TURN BACK LOMPOC

 Newport Harbor survived a physical battle to beat Lompoc, 49-43, in the 
opening round of the Southern California Division III girls' basketball 
playoffs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to be more of a football game than a basketball game," Newport 
Harbor Coach Shannon Jakosky said after the Sailors stopped Lompoc's 17-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The referees basically let the teams play and allowed a lot of contact under 
the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor senior Gina Heads had three blocked shots and five steals to 
pace the Sailors' strong defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gina did an excellent job on their point guard (Danielle Petty, who was held 
the two three-pointers after the game was out of reach)," Jakosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (23-7) showed few ill-effects after its 70-40 loss to 
Brea-Olinda Saturday in the Southern Section Division III-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc (24-5) led, 11-10, after the first quarter, but the Sailors took the 
lead for good on baskets by Heads, Genevieve Evarts and Melissa Schutz to open 
the second quarter. By halftime, Newport Harbor led 26-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc reduced the lead to 32-30 late in the third quarter but two free throws 
by Heads with no time left in the quarter gave the Sailors a 34-30 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport's defense held Lompoc to one shot in the first five minutes of the 
final quarter as the Sailors built a 45-33 lead to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Evarts had 16 points and Schutz 14 for Newport Harbor. Colleen Mitchell had 17 
points and Kim Wuest had 14 for Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors will play at Santana Santee, a 86-46 winner over Dinuba, in the 
semifinals Thursday.

BURGESS IS TOO BIG FOR BAKERSFIELD EAST; DIVISION II: THE 6-FOOT-4 CENTER 
SCORES AT EASE IN THE FIRST HALF OF WOODBRIDGE'S 71-41 VICTORY. 
</P>

 Angela Burgess was prepared to spend another night being encircled, shoved and 
elbowed. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how opponents of the Woodbridge High girls' basketball team have 
attempted to defend Burgess, the Warriors' powerful 6-feet-4 junior center. 
But, to her surprise, Bakersfield East chose not to assign several players to 
Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad move. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring at ease near the basket, Burgess led undefeated Woodbridge to a 71-41 
rout of Bakersfield East Tuesday in the first round of the Southern California 
Regional Division II playoffs at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, who is at least five inches taller than any of Bakersfield East's 
players, scored 12 of her team-high 16 points in the first half as Woodbridge 
led, 45-14, at halftime. Burgess, who played only a few minutes after halftime, 
also had a game-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (30-0), who defeated Hemet, 59-47, for the Southern Section 
Division II-AA title Saturday, will play host to San Bernardino in the regional 
semifinals Thursday. San Bernardino (26-6) defeated Bakersfield North, 64-57, 
in another first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teams try to (double-team) me, but they just left one person on me, so I 
just kept shooting because I was always open," Burgess said. "We were all 
really on in the first half -- especially the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't seem like anyone was missing (shots)." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield East, which lost to Bakersfield North, 68-45, in the Central 
Section Division II title game, ends the season 17-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge outscored the Blades, 24-1, in the opening quarter. Woodbridge 
guards Jamie Oenning, Erin Stovall and Tami Weaver controlled the quarter, 
driving through the Blades' defense and setting up Burgess and forward Melanie 
Pearson (14 points, six rebounds) for open shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning scored six of her 10 points in the quarter and Stovall scored six of 
her nine. The Blades did not score until guard DeAundra Akins (10 points) made 
one of two free throws with 21 seconds remaining in the quarter. The Blades' 
first field goal did not come until 6 minutes 35 seconds remained in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams were really flying blind in this game because there wasn't a lot 
of time to prepare," Oenning said. "They didn't know what to expect, then we 
hit them with power and speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess dominated the second quarter, scoring eight points and grabbing five 
rebounds. The Warriors' lead grew to 32 points, 39-7, when Burgess hit a shot 
in the lane following an offensive rebound. Her layup 45 seconds before 
halftime gave Woodbridge a 43-10 lead.

DIVISION I; CLOVIS WEST SHOOTS 62% FROM FIELD TO ROUT MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK LOYD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Clovis West's best shooting night of the season was enough to easily defeat 
Mater Dei, 85-49, in a Southern California Regional Division I girls' 
basketball game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Golden Eagles (26-1) made 33 of 53 shots (62%) from the 
field and made 18 of 24 free throws to bury No. 7 Mater Dei (24-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Four Clovis West players scored in double figures, with Adrian Williams 
leading the way with 18 points. Gilke Jobs made seven of eight shots to finish 
with 17 points, while freshman Lindsey Dion added 16 and Paige Bowie had 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also led Clovis West with 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was by far our best performance," Eagle Coach Jose Hernandez said. "It 
came at a good time against a strong team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles took a quick 12-0 lead before the Monarchs stormed back to trail, 
14-13, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Peterson's three-pointer to start the second quarter gave Mater Dei a 
short-lived 16-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams scored eight points and Sara Lien seven in the second quarter for 
Clovis West, which made 10 of its next 14 shots and outscored Mater Dei, 23-12, 
to take a 37-25 halftime lead. The Monarchs managed to make five of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just came out flat and cold," Mater Dei Coach Mary Hauser said. "We 
self-destructed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clovis West's occasional press limited Mater Dei's options to a half-court 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We average about 70 points per game," Hauser said, "and we like the running 
game. It's the only way we're going to win this. We just couldn't get it all 
together, and Clovis West has too many weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who averages 15 points, fouled out midway through the fourth 
quarter. She had a team-high 18 points and teammate Leticia Oseguera finished 
with 14 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles continued their torrid shooting in the third quarter, going nine 
for 14 and making all five free throws to lead, 60-41. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei made only two field goals in the fourth quarter, both with about 
four minutes left after Clovis West's lead ballooned to 72-42.

 MOVIE MAGIC: Moviegoers have streamed to the theaters in big numbers recently, 
an industry survey shows (D1). . . . More than 1.2 billion people went to the 
movies last year alone. That's a lot of popcorn. . . . The boom was fueled in 
part by the success of the mega-hit "Jurassic Park." . . . Blockbusters "get 
people back into the idea of going into a movie theater," said Ken Kramer, 
manager of Pacific's Carriage Square Theater in Oxnard. 
</P>

 MALE ORDER: The Order of St. Augustine, which oversees Ojai's St. Thomas 
Aquinas Parish and Villanova Preparatory School, is celebrating its 750th 
anniversary. Pope Innocent IV called the order together in 1244 in the Tuscany 
region of Italy. . . . In Ventura County, the Catholic order of men dates back 
to 1923, when Villanova Prep was founded, Father John Pejza said. . . . In 
celebration, a spirituality course will be offered in Rome, but locally members 
"are waiting to see what comes out of Rome as far as suggested celebrations are 
concerned," Pejza said.

lies. The surreal film was Russia's contender for an Academy Award as best

DEMOCRATIC RACE CREATES DRAMA AS TEXAS POLITICAL SEASON OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 political season opened Tuesday in Texas, where a former state 
attorney general, a Ross Perot supporter and a congressman battled in a 
Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate. The winner hopes to take back the seat 
now held by Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. Ann Richards and former President Bush's son, George, were up 
against token opponents in bids for their party's gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the state's congressional delegation faced tough challenges: 
Houston Democratic Reps. Craig A. Washington and Gene Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston City Councilor Sheila Jackson Lee ran an aggressive campaign against 
Washington, criticizing him for missed votes. Green's challenger in a mostly 
Latino district was another member of the City Council, Ben Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, former state Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox was vying with Perot 
supporter Richard Fisher and Rep. Mike Andrews. The election came a month after 
state ethics charges against Hutchison were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison, who won a special election for the seat vacated by Democrat Lloyd 
Bentsen when he became President Clinton's Treasury secretary in 1993, faced 
token opposition in her bid to win the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting was reported slow across much of the state Tuesday, partly because of 
the snow. Secretary of State John Hannah forecast a 16% turnout. Mattox and 
Andrews said they were concerned about how a light turnout could affect 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison was expected to have little trouble winning the nomination against 
six opponents. But the Democrats fought to the wire; if no candidate won more 
than 50% Tuesday, the top two finishers would advance to an April 12 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards and George W. Bush, managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball 
team, each faced a little-known opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas primaries were the first of the year for Senate and gubernatorial 
elections. Clinton's party enjoys a 56-44 majority in the Senate, and must 
defend 21 of the 34 seats up for election this year. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are 36 gubernatorial races this year. Twenty-two are in states held 
by Democrats, 12 by Republicans and two by Independents.

 It will be a disappointing season if the Sea Kings don't exceed last year's 
sixth-place finish. They have a strong pitching staff with considerable depth, 
and they have a solid defensive unit. All-league pitcher MacMillan had Orange 
County's 12th-best earned-run average (1.88) and was 14th in strikeouts (58 
during the regular season). Wills, Bowman and Stuart should provide plenty of 
support. The offense is led by Huston, who batted .412, and Davis, who had 15 
stolen bases. Corona del Mar also should benefit from the cohesiveness that 
develops from having a unit that has played together several years. The Sea 
Kings are also bolstered by good team speed, and first-year Coach Lundin has 
already noticed a strong leadership base.

 The Vaqueros shared the league title with Woodbridge and reached the Division 
III finals before losing to Tustin, 8-5. Even though they lost 17 players to 
graduation, Irvine will continue to be competitive simply because Louie is 
still in the program. Louie, a right-hander, was the league's most valuable 
player, MVP of the Upper Deck Classic, pitched two no-hitters, went 12-3 with 
two saves and had a 2.24 earned-run average. At the plate, he batted .348 with 
25 runs batted in and had a school record-tying five triples and 37 runs. 
Irvine also gets a shot in the arm from Sobeck, who batted .336 with 28 RBIs, 
hit five triples and scored 29 runs, and who went 4-1 with five saves and 1.82 
ERA in 42 1/3 innings. Noisy (.240, 17 runs), Hongslo (.206) and Kowalewsky 
will be asked to step up their games to help offset the departure of Scott Seal 
(five triples, 24 RBIs), Ryan Jones (.483, six home runs, 29 RBIs, 26 runs) and 
Aron Garcia (.432, 37 runs). Although it would take quite a run to reach the 
section finals for a third consecutive season, it wouldn't be unfathomable, 
either.

 The Tillers barely reached the playoffs last year, entering the postseason as 
a third-place team, but they got hot at the right time and won the school's 
first Southern Section Division III title. Tustin hopes to become Orange 
County's first back-to-back champion, and it has a strong nucleus returning. 
The infield remains intact, but to repeat, the Tillers need a strong 
performance by their pitchers, which is the greatest question mark on the team. 
There are no such questions about the offense: It's potent. Baker batted .405, 
and Lloyd, Winmill and Lauderdale all batted better than .300. Baker was a 
first-team All-Southern Section selection, as well as a Times Orange County 
first-team selection. O'Donoghue was named the section's coach of the year.

</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have their work cut out for them. After finishing fourth last 
year, they return starters Corrigan and Hullings on the left side of the 
infield and Wei and Willmott in the outfield. Conlin expects the defense to be 
fairly solid, but University's lack of experience on the mound means the 
Trojans will probably have to rely heavily on Rockness' handling of the 
pitchers: O'Connell and juniors Ernesto Medina, Tim Blackburn and Reza 
Dadrimazi. The loss of All-American catcher Stephan Hagins (.507, 29 runs 
batted in, 35 runs) in the lineup might be softened if Wei can improve upon 
last year's numbers (.380, 25 RBIs, 28 runs). But that's asking a lot; his 
teammates probably will have to pick up the slack as University tries to 
manufacture runs rather than waiting for the big inning. One asset the Trojans 
always seem to have year in and year out is hard-working players, which should 
help them get better as the season progresses.

<P>
 The Sailors took their lumps last season with six sophomore starters, but one 
of those youngsters who made an impact was Freeman, the team's lone returning 
all-leaguer. He and Hlista must produce in the middle of the lineup behind 
Sandstrom, the team's catalyst. Crucial to the Sailors' development is the role 
the seniors take on: Hlista, Burns, Bullard and Smith must step forward and 
accept some leadership responsibility. Buist is the No. 1 pitcher and should be 
ready by the time league play begins; he's rehabilitating a muscle imbalance in 
his arm. After that, it's Urban, Grodach and bullpen by committee; McMiniment, 
a transfer from Corona del Mar, gives the Sailors additional depth. Making the 
routine plays, offensively and defensively, should go a long way toward their 
success.

 The Warriors got in on the worst-to-first phenomena, sharing the league title 
with Irvine and winning the school's first baseball playoff game. But they lost 
a lot of talent to graduation, including All-Southern Section player Ryan 
Lemmon (.455, 25 RBIs). To repeat last season's success, Woodbridge must get 
significant contributions from those who were role players a year ago: Watts 
batted .423 in 29 at-bats, and Richey hit .368 in 19 at-bats and stole 13 
bases. The team's strength is pitching. Those who are returning aren't bad: 
Talbot was the No. 2 man on the staff, going 6-1 with a 3.41 ERA; Bruckler was 
2-1 with a 2.03 ERA, and Tourtellot, then a sophomore, was 2-0 on the varsity. 
That's a good strength to have in this league, but it might not be enough. The 
team's outfield play is questionable, as is the Warriors' ability to hit the 
ball with authority. Pitching should make them competitive; hitting could make 
them frustrated. The program should flourish under Brown, though; his career 
record, including his years at Tustin, is 162-52 (76%).

PREP BASEBALL '94: SEA VIEW LEAGUE; TALENT ISN'T A CONCERN FOR BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confession is good for the soul, but it's a bear to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Baker knows he has all the talent in the world. He knows Baseball 
America has ranked him as the seventh-best high school prospect in the nation. 
He knows he has some jealous teammates who make digs at him. And he knows that, 
in some ways, they are right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too worried about failure," said the Tustin third baseman who has 
known very little of it. "I feel if I put my best effort forward each time out, 
I can be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Can you put your best effort forward each time out, he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my absolute best forward each time out is not impossible, but 
improbable," Baker said, referring to practices and games. "It all depends on 
how much self-discipline I have, and I'm already a very disciplined baseball 
player. I know I can be more disciplined in my work ethic; that's one of the 
reasons some guys call me a 'big-leaguer.' That's one of my goals, to improve 
my work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, including his team's playoff games en route to the Southern Section 
Division III championship game, batted .426 last year; he scored a 
school-record 39 runs and had 35 runs batted in in 32 games. His 15 extra-base 
hits raised his slugging average to .713. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to improving his work ethic, Baker -- who bats left-handed -- vows 
to not get cheated during an at-bat and to be more focused on defense this 
season. His mind tends to wander, thinking about his previous at-bat, his next 
at-bat, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a surprising admission from someone so accomplished. His coach, Tim 
O'Donoghue, met with Baker at the end of last season and together they examined 
Baker's game. Their conclusion? Baker should concentrate more on his first 
throw of the game, O'Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to be nitpicky can tell the 6-foot-3, 195-pound senior to 
improve on his speed, although he is by no means slow. If he stays healthy, he 
will definitely get a chance at the major leagues, either this summer when he 
is drafted out of high school, or down the road near the end of his career at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He has given little consideration to baseball's financial state and what that 
might mean to him if he is a first-round selection in June. He said right now 
he doesn't favor professional baseball or the USC experience. He likes having 
his options open, and for now, he'll have to live with being Tustin's leader by 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 "My responsibility to the team is to be a team leader," Baker said. "I'm not a 
rah-rah player. I consider myself a catalyst for offensive purposes. If I have 
a good game, the team will have a good game. I don't say that to be cocky, but 
it's been like that in the past with all the teams I've played for." 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows that he is better because his teammates complement him. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he had eight home runs in 22 games during the summer of 1991 as 
Tustin won the Colt World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got the most out of my talent, I think I can accomplish anything," Baker 
said. "And that goes back to the work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean I don't work hard, it just means I could work harder." 1993 
IN REVIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights 
</P>

 How evenly balanced was the Sea View League? Tustin reached the playoffs 
because Newport Harbor upset University. Third-place Tustin defeated Irvine in 
the Division III semifinals and La Quinta in the title game. Woodbridge lost to 
La Quinta in the second round. . . . League honors were split: Irvine's Tommy 
Louie was the league player of the year and Tustin Coach Tim O'Donoghue the 
coach of the year. . . . The league's leading hitter was University's Stephan 
Hagins (.507 during the regular season); the premier power hitter was Corona 
del Mar's David Angeloni (11 home runs); and the top clutch hitter was Tustin's 
Derek Baker (37 runs batted in). Standings 05,17,05,05,06,05 *2*League

INTEREST RATES SURGE AGAIN; STOCKS CLOSE MODESTLY LOWER

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields jumped to eight-month highs Tuesday as the bears 
regained control of the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks closed only slightly off despite the latest rate surge. Gold prices 
inched up even though Japan said it would sell a large quantity of the metal. 
Credit 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates rose across the board as investors focused again on the 
probability of another credit-tightening move by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond soared from 6.79% on Monday to 6.87% 
on Tuesday, its highest closing since June. 
</P>
<P>
 Among shorter-term securities, the yield on one-year T-bills rose to 4.29% 
from 4.26% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a rally Monday, the bond market slumped back into the worry mode. 
Traders fear that the Fed is in the midst of an aggressive campaign to boost 
interest rates, seeking to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty as to how high the Fed might raise short rates is driving 
potential bond buyers out of the market, traders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors simply are not doing anything -- not necessarily selling or 
buying," said Sung Won Sohn, economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the trading is among the Wall Street professionals. They are passing 
bonds around and marking prices down along the way," Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, the market was buoyed by reports that Fed Gov. Lawrence 
Lindsey had said Monday that he expected short-term rates to remain around "3 
something" this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Lindsey aide later said the official's remark was not meant to be taken 
literally, and that turned sentiment bearish again. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Stock trading action was downbeat as bond yields jumped, but analysts said the 
market's continuing resilience was a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials lost just 4.50 points to 3,851.72, after rising nearly 24 
points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers topped winners 1,174 to 944 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. And the Nasdaq composite index, which Monday made a run at its 
all-time high of 800.47, slipped 2.93 points to 792.12. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me like a little bit of a breather after the strength that we've 
seen at the tail end of last week and (Monday)," said Bob Dickey, analyst at 
Dain Bosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the underpinnings of strong corporate earnings, many analysts say 
stocks will have trouble running up to new highs if the Fed does raise rates 
again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy-industry issues, recent market leaders, were mixed. Auto parts maker 
Varity surged 4 3/8 to 48 7/8 on its earnings report. Other winners included 
Kennametal, up 1 5/8 to 56; Fluor, up 1 3/8 to 51, and Inland Steel, up 5/8 to 
34 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But profit takers clipped Eaton, off 1 5/8 to 58; Cummins, down 1 1/2 to 46 
3/4, and Deere, down 1 7/8 to 88. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail issues were strong. Dayton Hudson surged 2 1/2 to 75 3/4 after 
Lehman Bros. upgraded the stock. Also rising was California electronics 
retailer Good Guys, up 1 1/8 to 17 7/8 after it said sales are running above 
expectations and that it will open eight or nine new stores in the Southland 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCEcorp, parent of Southern California Edison, fell 7/8 to 17 1/2 in heavy 
trading. The Times reported Monday that some analysts expect the company to cut 
its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, markets were mixed. London's FTSE-100 index sank 41.5 points to 
3,264.4 on fears that no additional interest rate cuts are forthcoming in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 86.51 points to 19,898.39, and Frankfurt's DAX 
index added 15.13 points to 2,124.04. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index slid 30.48 points to 2,571.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold held steady, reacting calmly to news that Japan plans to sell 90 metric 
tons of gold, or $1.14 billion worth. On New York's Comex, April gold futures 
added 80 cents to $377.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount (of gold) is insignificant . . . (but) the symbolism of this is 
immeasurable, in that we have the first-ever gold sale from one of the Western 
world's principal hoarding nations," said Andy Smith, bullion analyst with 
Union Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures prices were unchanged after tumbling Monday.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: KEEPING UP ON THINGS WHEREVER YOU ARE

<P>
 In today's work world, timely information is an essential commodity for doing 
business. But getting information on the road can be tricky. As a business 
traveler, you may be cut off from your routine sources of information -- the 
publications you usually read or the electronic databases to which you usually 
have access. 
</P>
<P>
 But information purveyors are figuring out new ways to deliver information 
while you're on the road. Here are some of the options available to business 
travelers hungry for news, especially about the place they are visiting or 
developments back home. Newspapers 
</P>
<P>
 Most major hotels, of course, offer guests complimentary morning newspapers 
delivered to their doors. In most cases, it is the local paper for the city in 
which the hotel is located. Other hotel chains will deliver a national paper, 
such as USA Today or the Wall Street Journal. In addition, many hotels 
subscribe to several papers, which they place in the lobby for the use of 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business travelers take the opportunity to read local papers when they're 
traveling as a way to learn about events that might not make the papers at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 When traveling internationally, ask the hotel concierge about international 
papers, such as the Financial Times, the International Herald Tribune or, if 
you're traveling through the Pacific Rim, the Asian Wall Street Journal. Hotels 
can usually obtain these papers for you. Faxes 
</P>
<P>
 For people who either can't get or can't wait for the paper, a growing number 
of news organizations are offering condensed versions of the next day's paper 
by fax the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, for example, CPC Communications Inc., a subsidiary of New 
York-based CPC Printing, which is one of the largest printers of financial 
documents in the world, is launching a 10-page fax newspaper geared to business 
users both on the road and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper, called Info-Wire, comes out at 2 p.m. PST and is designed to reach 
business travelers through airlines, resorts, hotels and cruise ships, as well 
as in local corporate offices. For example, a hotel or airline would receive 
the faxed version daily, then copy it and distribute it to travelers. CPC is 
negotiating with a chain of Caribbean resorts, as well as with numerous hotel 
companies and the major airlines, Publisher Paul Schaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aimed at the person who is off-line," Schaye said. "The person in a 
hotel is not in their standard flow of information, and they're really starved 
for their flow of information." 
</P>
<P>
 Info-Wire, which is compiled from staff reports and wire services, contains 
mostly business news and stock market information, but it also includes a page 
of world news and a page of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Info-Wire may be the latest, but it is not the first to put faxed information 
into the hands of travelers. In November, 1990, New York Times Co. started a 
six-page fax for people who don't have ready access to the newspaper. The fax 
is a condensed version of the newspaper, with a cross-section of news, features 
and sports -- even the crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 The fax, which goes out at 8 p.m. PST in advance of the next day's paper, has 
about 150,000 readers, more than 75% of them Americans who are traveling, 
Publisher Patricia Ecke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most travelers read copies of the fax paper distributed by their hotels or 
cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Jones & Co., publishers of the Wall Street Journal, has also begun 
distributing a two-page fax of financial news from the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Journal Fax comes out at 2 p.m. PST and contains highlights from the next 
day's Wall Street Journal, said Pat McParland, product manager for Dow Jones' 
personal publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is just one version, which goes to hotels and individual 
subscribers. However, the company is working on a customized version that would 
allow individuals to receive selected stock quotes for their portfolios in 
addition to the news, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Los Angeles Times Syndicate has been offering Financial Fax 
since 1992. The one-page executive summary of stock information has been 
customized for each subscriber's portfolio. Each report contains business news 
notes and commentary. Travelers can have Financial Fax forwarded to any fax 
number they choose so their reports can reach them when they're on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 And the London-based Financial Times is looking into providing faxed 
information, according to spokesman Keith Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although faxed information offers some advantages to people in remote 
locations, or to those who need information sooner than they can get it in the 
regular paper, fax is really a transitional technology, Ecke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bridge between print and the new electronic distribution of news," he 
said. "It's an in-between mode." Interactive Technology 
</P>
<P>
 For travelers who can take their computers with them, or who know they will 
have access to a computer at their destination, there are several on-line news 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers with a laptop, modem and a phone line can get access to news 
sources ranging from wire services, such as Associated Press or Reuters, to 
newspapers, such as the Washington Post or the Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The three largest on-line services are CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online. 
In September, the Los Angeles Times will introduce its own on-line news service 
that will be distributed through Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Financial Times is available on FT Profile, as is information 
from BBC World Broadcasts, the Economist and Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the on-line services, including CompuServe, also offer electronic 
clipping services that will search out articles on topics of interest to the 
subscriber and put them in a special file.

 Argentina has made great strides in taming its economy, particularly in curing

A YEAR LATER . . .; BITE TAKEN OUT OF FEAR FOR SURFERS; HAWAII'S SHARK HUNT 
KILLS 58, BUT CAUTION ISN'T BEING THROWN TO THE WIND QUITE YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a little more than a year ago when Rick Gruzinsky, a construction 
worker from suburban Honolulu, was sitting on his surfboard at dawn at an 
offshore reef near Laniakea on Oahu's North Shore. His friend had caught a 
small wave in. Gruzinsky was alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking nearby in the blue-green sea was a 14-foot tiger shark. It swirled 
beneath Gruzinsky, then crashed the surface and clamped down on the front of 
his surfboard, shaking its head and snapping off a large chunk. Gruzinsky 
vividly remembers seeing the chunk stuck in the shark's open mouth as the 
startled surfer climbed back onto his broken board and raced back to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached the other day at his home in Hawaii Kai, Gruzinsky, 28, said he has 
not quit surfing, but he can't shake the memory of that attack on Oct. 22, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can anyone else in and even beyond the surfing community on Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruzinsky's was only the first of three confirmed attacks within a period of 
two months, including the fatal attack at Keaau Beach Park on bodyboarder Aaron 
Romento, who bled to death after being bitten on the leg shortly after reaching 
shore screaming for help. And then there was Gary Chun, who like Gruzinsky saw 
his board snatched and bitten by a large shark while Chun was waiting for a 
wave near Laniakea. He escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent sightings and alleged sightings were reported by the dozens last 
winter as the situation bordered on hysteria, prompting a shark scare of 
unprecedented proportions, and the first comprehensive shark hunts since the 
early 1970s.  
</P>
<P>
 State shark experts, whose policy is to hunt sharks only after an attack or if 
it is determined that a genuine threat exists, were not the only ones involved. 
Surfers, fishermen, divers and even prominent businessmen concerned about the 
welfare of their children went to sea to catch and kill as many sharks as they 
could get their hooks into. The shark fishing effort continued into the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to my records, 58 large tiger sharks were taken around Oahu, so I 
think we may have made a substantial dent in the population," said John 
Naughton, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist and prominent member of 
the recently disbanded state shark task force. "Obviously there are still some 
around . . . but one thing, it seems to have really reduced the number of 
attacks around Oahu." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a relative calm has prevailed this winter as the only "shredding" on 
the North Shore of Oahu is being done by surfers, who travel to the island from 
all over the world each winter to ride the large waves generated by Arctic 
storms. There has not been a single confirmed attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But shark experts, none of whom knows how many tiger sharks there are or 
whether they migrate from island to island, are quick to point out that this 
might only be a coincidence. They are certain of only one thing: At least 58 
tiger sharks eight feet or longer were removed from the shores of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if they were 58 out of a population of 59 or 58 out of a 
population of 58,000," said Dr. Kim Holland, a shark expert with Hawaii's 
Department of Land and Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Holland, believe that surfers -- the primary victims of shark 
attacks because they surf well offshore and often at dusk and dawn, when tiger 
sharks are beginning and ending their nighttime feed at the reefs -- might have 
actually been lulled into a false sense of security because of the hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will agree that some good has come of the attacks and subsequent 
scare. Surfers are more aware of their surroundings and for the most part are 
using better judgment, not paddling out near the mouths of rivers, where runoff 
carries dead animals and other debris that sharks feed on, and by not paddling 
out alone at dusk and dawn, particularly in murky waters, where tiger sharks 
prefer to hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 A surfer suffered serious leg wounds after being attacked by a tiger shark 
last October off Kauai while surfing in murky water near the mouth of the 
Wailua River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attacks are still in the minds of people," said George Downing, 63, a 
Honolulu surf shop owner who became legendary in surfing circles in the 1950s 
and '60s for his big-wave riding on the North Shore. "One of the concerns now 
is to stop certain things from taking place, and I think more attention is 
being given to such areas by the lifeguard service. There's more awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gruzinsky: "People are a lot more aware. They even talk about it on the 
(telephonic) surf report. The other day after a lot of rain and runoff, it was 
the first I'd ever heard, on the surf line they said, 'Watch out for the guys 
in the gray suits because of the muddy water.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In large part because of the attacks and the attention they received, the 
state -- which was urged by surfers after each attack to do more hunting and by 
conservationists after each hunt to leave the sharks alone -- decided to make a 
serious attempt to learn more about "the guys in the gray suits," which were 
patrolling Hawaii's offshore reefs long before anyone thought of riding the 
waves that break over them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to determine what are typical ranges and movements of tiger 
sharks around heavily populated coastlines," said Holland, who directs a new 
tagging program in which sonic devices are used to track the creatures' 
movements. "The idea being that if you know more about what the animal is 
doing, then you can more rationally evaluate management options." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach seems to be keeping attacks to a minimum while at the same time 
saving the tiger shark from random hunts. Such hunts could adversely affect 
Hawaii's coastal marine ecosystem, in which tiger sharks play a vital role by 
keeping the number of smaller reef sharks and other animals in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's tagging program has been slow to develop, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, only three tiger sharks have been tracked, and merely for 
short periods of time. The results were somewhat surprising in that all three 
sharks traveled across the channel from Oahu to Molokai. The popular belief was 
that tiger sharks are predominantly coastal animals that prefer fairly shallow 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They traveled about 29 miles from where they were released, but that to me is 
not surprising," Holland said. "What surprises me is that it wasn't along the 
shore. It was straight out to sea and hang left. And that brought them up along 
a shallow area off the coast of Molokai." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two sharks -- a 7-foot immature male and a 12-foot mature female -- 
were tracked late last fall for 24 and 30 hours, respectively. One of the 
sharks dived 1,000 feet and was still far from the bottom, which was also 
surprising because tiger sharks in coastal areas generally stay close to the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, both transmitters failed, and the knowledge gained from such a 
small sample is basically useless. Stress, too, may have been a factor in the 
sharks' behavior immediately after being tagged. A longer tracking period would 
have been more helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 A third shark was tagged and tracked recently, but for only about six hours 
before the transmitter's battery failed. Then the engine on the boat used to 
track the animals failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland acknowledges that the results of the program thus far are "not very 
conclusive," but he said money has been raised to fix the boat and that the 
DLNR remains optimistic that many of the mysteries of the tiger shark can be 
solved, given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers, meanwhile, still are watching the horizon for more than the next set 
of waves, but are more comfortable knowing there are fewer sharks.

BRONCOS EXPECTED TO MAKE OFFER TO BROWN; PRO FOOTBALL: DENVER IS CONSIDERING 
GIVING THE RECEIVER AS MUCH AS $11 MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS. THE RAIDERS WOULD 
HAVE A CHANCE TO MATCH IT. 
</P>

<P>
 Denver is prepared to make Raider wide receiver Tim Brown an offer that could 
go as high as $11 million over four years, according to a Bronco official. 
Should the offer be that big, it would be worth $2.7 million per season, which 
would make Brown the highest-paid receiver in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, coming off his best season, is a transition player, meaning the Raiders 
can retain him by matching any offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown arrived in Denver on Tuesday night to meet with Bronco officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has already rejected an opportunity to become the Raiders' franchise 
player, which would have guaranteed him an annual salary of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, another Raider, tight end Ethan Horton, has visited the 
Washington Redskins' camp. Redskin officials are reportedly optimistic they can 
sign Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington would be an attractive spot for him because his former positions 
coach with the Raiders, Terry Robiskie, recently left to join new Redskin Coach 
Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 And what have the Raiders been doing while all this is going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Raiders signed offensive tackle Gerald Perry shortly after it 
was permissible, by league rules, to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who lost Perry, argued the Raiders had signed him before it was 
permissible to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 They concede their prime need this year is a running back, but the only two 
free agents invited to their El Segundo training headquarters thus far have 
been tight ends, Jamie Williams of the San Francisco 49ers and Ed West of the 
Green Bay Packers, both unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence indicates how serious the Raiders are taking Horton's talks 
with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the running back situation, the Raiders are looking at the Atlanta 
Falcons' Steve Broussard, an unrestricted free agent, who is holding a workout 
in the Los Angeles area for any and all interested clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Oiler running back Lorenzo White, also an unrestricted free agent, has 
expressed an interest in playing for either the Raiders or the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 White visited Green Bay last week. But he is asking for about $2 million per 
season, probably too steep for the salary-cap conscious Raiders. Especially if 
they find themselves forced to hand $11 million to Brown.

RAMS ARE PURSUING JEFFIRES, TWO OTHER FREE AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After signing Chris Miller on Monday, the Rams began pursuing protection and 
potential targets for their new quarterback -- Houston offensive tackle Kevin 
Donnalley and wide receiver Haywood Jeffires, and Detroit wide receiver Brett 
Perriman. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley, a restricted free agent, is expected to visit Rams Park late this 
week or early next week, said Jay Zygmunt, senior vice president.Jeffires, a 
Pro Bowl selection and unrestricted free agent, will visit early next week, 
Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perriman, an unrestricted free agent who spent the last three seasons with the 
Lions, visited the Rams on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have considered extending an offer sheet to Donnalley for the last 
few weeks, but feared it could damage potential trade talks with the Oilers for 
quarterback Warren Moon. But those talks ended Monday when the Rams signed 
Miller to a three-year, $9-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, 29, is considered the best of the unrestricted wide receivers not 
designated a transition player, meaning the Oilers don't have right of first 
refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign Donnalley, the Rams would have to give up a third-round draft pick as 
compensation. Houston tendered a $298,000 contract to Donnalley, the minimum 
for a restricted free agent. The Oilers would be free to match any offer by the 
Rams to retain the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley, 6 feet 5 and 305 pounds, has started eight games in three seasons 
with the Oilers. MIKE REILLEY

NEWSWIRE: JUDGE WILL RULE TODAY ON REQUEST BY HARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Tonya Harding observed, U.S. District Judge Owen Panner said Tuesday 
that he would rule today on whether to grant a temporary restraining order that 
would delay possible disciplinary action against her by the U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to arguments for almost two hours in a Portland, Ore., court, 
Panner called for a recess. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member USFSA panel is scheduled to begin a hearing Thursday in Colorado 
Springs, Colo. The panel earlier found that there were reasonable grounds to 
believe Harding was involved in the plot to injure rival Nancy Kerrigan and if 
those findings were confirmed, Harding could be suspended from the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 Harding's lawyers are seeking to postpone the USFSA hearing so she will have 
more time to prepare her defense. RANDY HARVEY

KERRIGAN ANSWERS HER CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Nancy Kerrigan's popularity dwindles, she is starting to question whether 
the accolades earned from figure skating are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wish I'd stopped (skating), when I was 10," she said Tuesday 
night during an interview with Jane Pauley on "Dateline NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 A tearful Kerrigan also defended her actions since winning an Olympic silver 
medal in Norway last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not somebody who has a script," Kerrigan said. "I talk and feel what's in 
my heart and in my head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair that they put me up on that pedestal because I didn't want to 
be there, and I don't understand why the same people . . . want to take me down 
so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan apologized for any actions that might have tainted her image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an athlete." she said. "I'm not perfect, I'm not a Disney character. I'm 
a person."

DISTRAUGHT PARISIEN TO SKIP SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skier Julie Parisien, still distraught over the death of her brother more than 
a year ago, announced Tuesday that she will take the rest of the season off. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was no surprise.At the Olympics, Parisien strongly suggested 
that she would take a sabbatical from ski racing because of lingering emotional 
duress over the death of older brother, Jean-Paul, killed in an automobile 
accident in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thinking about him every day on the hill has been incredibly taxing," 
Parisien said. "I didn't think it would come to this end." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, 22, was once the world's top-ranked slalom skier. But since she won 
silver in slalom at the 1993 World Championships, a medal she dedicated to her 
brother, her performance has dropped off dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only person I can really blame for this is the drunk driver who killed my 
brother," Parisien said of her decision. "That's the only reason for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien said she suffered an emotional breakdown here Monday, which prompted 
her to make her decision public. CHRIS DUFRESNE

SKIING; OLYMPIAN RACERS COME TO MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, World Cup officials went in search of a mountain for two women's 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 The resort at Vail, Colo., the original site, had to drop the races when it 
accepted an invitation to stage the World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to help, folks at Mammoth Mountain raised their hands, not knowing at 
the time just how good a deal they were getting. 
</P>
<P>
 Today through Friday, the Eastern Sierra resort will conduct its first World 
Cup races, the first in California in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 And not only are these the first women's World Cup races to be held after the 
Olympic Games, there is now considerable home-country interest, considering the 
successes of U.S. skiers at Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Olympic medalists who will complete in three races -- wo super-Gs 
and a slalom -- are American super-G gold medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter and 
Picabo Street, the downhill silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Another super-G was added on Friday to make up for an earlier cancellation in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's super-G will be one of the last for Roffe-Steinrotter, the 26-year-old 
from Potsdam, N.Y., who plans to retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard," she said of her retirement. "But I'm ready to move 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter pulled off perhaps the biggest upset of the Olympics when 
she won the super-G on the Kvitfjell course. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, she had not won an international race in eight years and was 
ranked only 36th in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Street will also be competing in her first post-Olympic races, although 
super-G is not her strength. She did not race the event at Lillehammer, but 
U.S. ski team coaches believe she can develop into a top-level performer in the 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to skiing something other than downhill," Street said 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Street is glad to be home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels awesome to ski back in the States, eating our own food, speaking our 
own language, being around all the people who know who we are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Katja Seizinger, the Olympic downhill champion, will be looking to 
avenge her disappointment in the super-G, in which she crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger is the world's top-ranked skier in both events. 
</P>
<P>
 All 15 Olympic medalists are expected to compete in the Mammoth races, 
including Switzerland's Vreni Schneider, who won three medals at Lillehammer, 
including the gold in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider has won five Olympic medals, more than any other woman skier.

NOTHING NEW UNDER SUN -- OR WATER; HAWAII HAS HAD SHARK ATTACKS AS LONG AS 
SURFERS HAVE BRAVED THE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shark attacks are nothing new in Hawaii. Tiger sharks have been tangling with 
wave riders for as long as anyone can recall. 
</P>
<P>
 George Balazs, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist and sea turtle 
expert, using several sources, has compiled a list of more than 100 attacks -- 
most of them on surfers -- dating to 1779, when a young male was gashed on the 
buttocks after being pursued while surfing. He later suffered "great pain" and 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1828, "A man out riding surf (off Maui) was killed by a shark which bit off 
his limbs and left his body floating." The attack was reportedly witnessed by 
several Hawaiian chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, partial remains of a swimmer who had disappeared off Diamond Head 
were found inside a "monstrous shark." The body "was complete from the waist 
down with the exception of one leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Also found in the stomach were ducks, tin cans and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1931, a Lt. Williamson had harpooned a 10-foot tiger shark off Pearl 
Harbor, and while he was using a gaff to bring it aboard, the shark bit off the 
tips of his fingers and chewed the two-inch oak pole of the gaff in half. In 
the shark's stomach were "the hind leg of a mule, two bathing suits nearly 
digested, a soldier's belt buckle, a pint of buttons, two horse shoes, the 
corner of a wooden soap box, an anchor chain, two small anchors and assorted 
bolts, nails and copper fittings." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Harold Riley was swept to sea while net fishing off Maile Point, 
Oahu. A 20-foot shark was observed attacking the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Danson Nakima apparently passed out while diving for coral at 180 
feet. About 30 large sharks were observed attacking the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Mark Skidgel was lying on his bodyboard off Lahaina, Maui, when a 
14-foot tiger shark bit him on the left side of his body. The wound required 52 
stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on. And chances are, it will continue to grow. The average is is 
up to about four attacks a year, due more to an increase in the human 
population than to an increase in sharks, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is an alarming statistic nonetheless for those who paddle out to the 
offshore reefs on almost a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Also alarming, some might think, is a recent increase in green sea turtles 
around the Hawaiian islands. The turtles, which feed on algae in and slightly 
beyond the surf zone, were protected as a federally "threatened" species in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be that (the sharks) are learning now, with more turtles here, to 
concentrate their feeding on turtles, which would put them into close proximity 
to surfers," said John Naughton, a NMFS biologist based in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that is the case, but in the 1960s there was roughly a 20% 
occurrence of turtles in the stomach contents (of tiger sharks), and now we're 
seeing a 42% occurrence, which would make sense because turtles are more 
abundant than they were in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers have voiced a concern that tiger sharks might be mistaking them for 
turtles, which would help explain the rash of attacks -- three confirmed -- and 
sightings last winter at the North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Balazs discounted that theory, claiming there is "no credible evidence" to 
support it. But there is no disputing that turtles often swim near the surface, 
and tiger sharks often attack floating objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Naughton: "I don't think they mistake people for turtles. I think they 
just happen to be in there looking for turtles and they see something moving up 
there and they just whack it. They don't care what it is. They'll eat anything 
." PETE THOMAS

KARIYA GIVES UP COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY TO FOCUS ON CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya is giving up his college eligibility to turn professional -- but 
that doesn't mean he's close to agreeing to contract terms with the Mighty 
Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made the decision to leave school," said Don Baizley, Kariya's legal 
adviser."(But) right now, it looks like we won't have a deal in the short run." 
He defined "short run" as the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the decision means Kariya, a sophomore, can negotiate openly with the 
Ducks instead of only listening to offers -- in order to protect his NCAA 
eligibility. It also means the Ducks, who picked him fourth overall in the 1993 
entry draft, don't have to worry about the Canadian Olympic star returning to 
Maine next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sides remain far apart. The Ducks have offered at least $850,000 
a year -- and perhaps close to $1 million a year -- that is slotted between the 
contracts signed by last year's Nos. 3 and 5 picks. Kariya is reportedly 
seeking as much as $1.5 million a year, which is more than Petr Nedved, an NHL 
veteran and Kariya's teammate on the Canadian Olympic team, received when he 
signed an offer sheet worth $1.35 million a year with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't mean we'll get a deal done any faster," said Ducks' President 
Tony Tavares. "I would say it removes an impediment to making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It increases the possibility of coming to an agreement this year, but it's 
impossible to predict how long negotiations are going to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we were just sitting around throwing darts in the ocean, not knowing 
where the bull's-eye was. At least now we know where the board's at." ROBYN

RAMS NOT QUITE DONE SHOPPING FOR PLAYERS; FOOTBALL: PROTECTION AND RECEIVERS 
FOR NEW QUARTERBACK CHRIS MILLER TOP THE LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After signing Chris Miller on Monday, the Rams began pursuing protection and 
potential targets for their new quarterback -- Houston offensive tackle Kevin 
Donnalley, Oilers' wide receiver Haywood Jeffires and Detroit wide receiver 
Brett Perriman. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley, a restricted free agent, is expected to visit Rams Park later this 
week or early next week, said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president. Jeffires, 
a Pro Bowl selection and unrestricted free agent, will visit early next week, 
Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perriman, an unrestricted free agent who spent the last three seasons with the 
Lions, visited the Rams Tuesday. Drew Rosenhaus, Perriman's agent, said 
contract negotiations are "still in the infant stages." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have considered extending an offer sheet to Donnalley for the last 
few weeks, but feared it could damage potential trade talks with the Oilers for 
quarterback Warren Moon. But those talks ended Monday when the Rams signed 
Miller to a three-year, $9 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, 29, is considered the best of the unrestricted wide receivers who 
haven't been designated a transition player, meaning the Oilers don't have 
right-of-first-refusal on the All-Pro receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign Donnalley, the Rams would have to give up a third-round draft pick to 
the Oilers as compensation. Houston tendered a $298,000 contract to Donnalley, 
the minimum amount for a restricted free agent. The Oilers would be free to 
match any offer by the Rams to retain the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Rudoy, Donnalley's agent, said the tackle was "very interested" in the 
Rams and that he currently is not negotiating with the Oilers. Donnalley made 
$275,000 last season, the last of a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have my hopes up about it (an offer sheet)," Donnalley told the 
Houston media Tuesday. "I don't want to leave Houston, but if the Rams were to 
go through with it, it would certainly up the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll believe this when I see it. I know I got some good playing time last 
season against some good opponents. I was hoping someone would notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley, 6 feet 5 and 305 pounds, has started eight games in three seasons 
with the Oilers, including six this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are interested in Donnalley because of his size and versatility -- he 
was used primarily as a backup guard and tackle -- and his skills on field goal 
and PAT protection. Donnalley has studied Tae Kwon Do the last two years in an 
attempt to improve his quickness. 
</P>

 Jeffires, 6-2 and 200 pounds, has started every game the last four seasons in 
Houston and was the AFC's leading pass-catcher in three of them.

 Ram strong safety Michael Stewart, an unrestricted free agent, could be headed 
to the Miami Dolphins. Reports from Miami said Jerome Stanley, Stewart's agent, 
met with Bryan Weidmeier, Dolphins' assistant general manager, on Tuesday 
regarding Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest in Stewart could indicate that the Dolphins are willing to let go 
of Louis Oliver, an unrestricted free agent and transition player. Stewart 
would likely join Gene Atkins, the Dolphins' recently acquired free safety, as 
a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart started 14 games for the Rams last season, finishing with 74 tackles.

CSUN FAR FROM PERFECT, SO IT'S GETTING THE PRACTICE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 
MATADORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RULE THAT ALLOWS TEAMS TO WORK OUT THROUGH THE 
END OF THE NCAA TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With 15th-ranked UCLA next up on the basketball schedule, big changes are 
planned at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador Coach Pete Cassidy is ready to scrap his offense and start over. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of using its usual motion attack, Northridge will attempt to scuttle 
the Bruins with more structured patterns the Matadors will learn in practice 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the game won't be played until Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Northridge coaches plan to take advantage of a rule that 
allows basketball teams to practice through the conclusion of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In its season finale last Thursday, Northridge downed San Diego State, 95-87.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of seniors Andre Chevalier, Brent Lofton, Brooklyn 
McLinn and Chris Yard, the Matadors are expected to report back to practice 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, such is March Madness. 
</P>
<P>
 When told of their coach's plans, most Matador players shrugged and laughed it 
off. "They thought I was kidding," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every season after the last game he says something like, 'See you Monday. 
We're going hard,' " Northridge center Peter Micelli said. "When he first 
started talking about this, you couldn't tell. It was kind of the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
 By installing a more structured offense, Cassidy hopes to customize the 
Matador attack into a system that best capitalizes on his players' strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things I'd like to go over with our guys for next year, some 
things I'd like them to learn so they can work on them on their own this 
summer," Cassidy said. "I think if we can get some things done on the floor at 
a time with no stress and no worry, that would be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli, Northridge's top returning player, said the Matadors "should be 
prepared to do whatever we can to help us get better next year. If the 
practices are basic and we stick to the fundamentals, then I think it will be 
beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Northridge's top five scorers this season, only Micelli retains 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose a lot of scoring," Cassidy said. "We need to shore up that area." 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy Ruben Oronoz should provide a boost. The 6-foot-7 Rancho Santiago 
College transfer was expected to be a top scorer until he was sidelined for the 
season because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Oronoz averaged 16.2 points for Rancho Santiago as a sophomore. He has 
recovered from back surgery last fall and has been practicing with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge hopes to bring in additional scoring punch and rebounding strength 
through its recruiting efforts, Cassidy said. The Matadors have three 
scholarships to offer, at least two of which will go to junior college players. 
</P>
<P>
 A multitalented forward along the lines of Keith Gibbs, a former Northridge 
standout, is a priority. So, too, is a versatile guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill, Chevalier's understudy at point guard, struggled at times when he 
was placed in control of the offense.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill probably is better suited to off-guard, a position in which he would 
challenge Oronoz and Ryan Martin for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility at the point is Trenton Cross, an early signee from Reseda 
High. Cross was most valuable player in the Northwest Valley League. His season 
ended last month because of a broken bone in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy gave Hill a tempered vote of confidence this week, saying that the 
junior-to-be from North Hollywood High would be given first look at the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to learn to do it his way with my help and with the help of 
everybody else," Cassidy said. "He's not Andre, and sometimes he tried to be. 
Rob can get it done. It just may have to get done a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy also would like to add bulk and strength to the front line. "I'd like 
to get a tough guy," he said. "You might be surprised who we pick up. I'm real 
good friends with the Goossens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Goossen family runs a professional boxing organization based in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, 8-18 this past season, will need a couple of heavy hitters to 
improve its record against a list of opponents that includes UCLA, California, 
Alabama Birmingham, Xavier and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 A boost from a solid recruiting class would help. But Micelli is of the 
impression that the Matadors can win with what they've got -- as long as the 
returning players work hard to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone comes back not showing a great deal of improvement, it could be a 
long season," Micelli said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's everyone's personal responsibility to improve. No one on our team is 
good enough to say, 'I'm fine. I'm ready for next year.' We'll see who wants 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Cassidy has made strides from a scheduling standpoint. Of the 23 
games he has tentatively scheduled, 11 are at home. Northridge played only 
eight of 26 games this season on its home floor.

BLOWING WHISTLE ON RETIREMENT; SEPTUAGENARIANS STAY ACTIVE AS OFFICIAL 
ADMINISTRATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Recognized as pioneers and revered as father figures to generations of sports 
officials, Cal Houston and Burt Davis keep each other humble with humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's your cane, Burt?" Houston asks as Davis spryly enters a Ventura 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get awfully cocky when you're younger than me," Davis replies, noting 
that he turned 76 in December, leaving Houston behind at 75. 
</P>
<P>
 No grumpy old men, these two. 
</P>
<P>
 As inseparable as Bert and Ernie, Burt and Cal are frisky zebras in winter, 
deans of the Channel Coast Officials Assn., an organization of more than 500 
that provides high school and college officials from Calabasas to Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal, who began officiating in 1944 after moving from Alhambra to Ojai, has 
assigned officials to every event since he founded the CCOA in 1950. He is 
sounding board, answer man, PR flack and liaison. Got a problem? Call Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 His phone rings when a coach complains about an official -- and when an 
official complains about a coach. He relays the concerns of schools to 
officials -- and those of officials to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, a lifelong Fillmore resident, began officiating in 1935 and has served 
as secretary-treasurer of the CCOA since 1960.  
</P>
<P>
 He is the bean counter, negotiating fees for officials and keeping the CCOA in 
the black. 
</P>
<P>
 In their heyday as officials, the pair called a long string of Southern 
Section championship football games at the Coliseum and numerous NCAA Division 
I and Division II basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, sporting a perpetual grin, ran the crew. Cal, quick with a one-liner, 
kept the calm. 
</P>
<P>
 As accomplished as they were with a whistle, their nurturing of other 
officials -- several of whom now call Pacific 10 Conference games -- is their 
greatest legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal and Burt are the Channel Coast Officials Assn.," says Bob Hird, a Royal 
High administrator and a CCOA official for 30 years. "They nursed this thing, 
coddled it, and made it one of the most professional officials' associations 
around. It is almost like it's one of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Of which there is no shortage. Cal and Dorothy, his wife of 53 years, have 
four children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Burt and Phyllis, 
his wife of 52 years, have three children and 10 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the move a bit keeping up with the family," Cal says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is quick to add that CCOA officials indeed are a second family. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of them -- including retired officials such as Paul Morgan, 83 
-- spend a guys-only week every year at Cal's cabin near the Snake River in 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal: "We have a roaring time, don't we Burt?" 
</P>
<P>
 Burt: "Gawd." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks spent in the woods build camaraderie. And to officials that is as 
important as learning the rule book, voices of experience attest. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one outside officiating really understands officials," Burt says. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, postgame gathering places have included the Elephant Bar in Ventura 
and Harry's Plaza Cafe in Santa Barbara. There officials sit, four and five 
tables full, reviewing the games. 
</P>
<P>
 They put away their whistles and pull out the needle, joking and razzing like 
a group of fraternity brothers. For 40 years, socializing with Cal, Burt and 
the rest is a sure-fire way of earning the black and white stripes officials 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officials, like policemen, get a feeling of 'It's us against the world,' " 
says Bob Barrett, a CCOA official from 1969-92. "Most people, even people in 
athletics, do not have an understanding of our job." 
</P>
<P>
 The CCOA's reputation for developing top officials grew during the '50s and 
'60s primarily because there was little of the infighting and back-stabbing 
typical in many associations. J. Kenneth Fagans, the Southern Section 
commissioner from 1954-75, repeatedly called on the crack CCOA crew led by Burt 
and Cal to officiate large-school championship football games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other associations were griping, but Kenny said, 'Until they screw up, I want 
them,' " Burt says in an approving tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans, who lives near San Diego with his wife, Norma, is one of several men 
Burt and Cal admired as young officials. Another they speak of fondly is Red 
Kennedy, now deceased, who assigned officials before Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was football and basketball coach at Fillmore High in the 1930s. These 
guys go way back. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is Cal and Burt whose exploits call to mind a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 They officiated the 1956 football final between Anaheim and Downey that drew 
41,383 at the Coliseum, still the largest crowd to see a Southern Section game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Mater Dei and Anaheim played before 33,374 at Anaheim Stadium with 
Burt and Cal making the calls. Ditto for the 1970 final between Lakewood and 
Pat Haden-led Bishop Amat at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The chosen crew wouldn't think of leaving their brethren behind, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It became a ritual: Barrett would fill his motor home with CCOA officials who 
would attend the game and join the crew for the all-important socializing 
afterward, invariably at Lawry's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be getting near the end of the game and Burt would sidle over to me and 
say, 'Two minutes till beer time,' " says Tony Musial, 69, a member of several 
of the crews that worked the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 A light touch worked well with players too. Etiquette was tightly controlled 
by Burt, invariably the referee and crew chief. If a player danced exuberantly 
after making a tackle, Burt would say, "I thought the prom was Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal, always the umpire, occasionally heard complaints by a defensive lineman 
who claimed he was being held. Cal's response: "Maybe he likes you." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also had a knack for disarming confrontational coaches with a smile 
or a quip. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't stay mad at Burt very long," Hird says, adding that Davis was 
the best official he has seen. "He had this silly grin that made you want to 
hug him." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt's smile still radiates through stadiums and gyms, although now he sits in 
the bleachers. He looks for all the world like a kid at his first ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still call 'em from up in the stands," he says with a twinkle. 
</P>
<P>
 Side by side, Cal and Burt view games and rate officials, claiming to see 
nearly every CCOA member each season. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt: "We know when we see an official who can work." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal: "We have some dandy officials, don't we, Burt?" 
</P>
<P>
 The unyielding support officials receive from their ageless administrators 
begets undying devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of men who see them as father figures in their lives," 
says Rick Scott, a basketball official. Scott is also football coach at Buena 
High, and he occasionally hears from Cal after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been scolded by him more than once," Scott says. "Cal will call and say, 
'Rick, I saw you throw your clipboard last night.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You certainly don't argue back to him. He and Burt see sport in its purist 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 And they spread the word unabashedly. Dial Cal's number -- it's listed -- and 
he'll pick up the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on that phone from early morning on," says retired official and longtime 
Cal pal Fred Lloyd. "That phone rings constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have one of those goofy answering things, either. He likes to talk 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe Cal is too old to appreciate the technology of the '90s. He has 
call waiting ("best thing that every happened," he says) and a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 His wariness of answering machines is well thought out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in them," he says. "It would take me an hour a day to call 
all these people back. I'd be making a long-distance call to tell a school 
secretary how much to pay an official when all she has to do is look it up in 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe the stupid calls I get." 
</P>
<P>
 How long before he kicks up his feet and forwards those calls to a new 
assigner? 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett asked Cal that question a few years ago at a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'll tell you, Bob," Cal replied. "See that old lady? You go talk to 
her for a while. That'll tell you how long I'll be around." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett walked over and discovered the woman was 90 years old. He also learned 
she was Cal's mother. "She was spry, looked you in the eye; she was a wiseacre 
just like Cal," Barrett recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among officials is that no one person will step into either Cal 
or Burt's shoes. There will be an assigner and secretary-treasurer for each 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But that day will not come anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for this, we'd be a couple of old men looking for something on 
TV every night," Cal says. "We're so lucky. This is what life is all about: 
Youth. We don't want to get old yet."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY: HOLLAND WON'T GO OUT ON A BIG WEST 
TOURNAMENT LIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost anybody could pick a favorite from the Big West men's basketball 
tournament field that's as wide open as a rural freeway at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't ask Cal State Fullerton Coach Brad Holland to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't let you put me on the spot like that," Holland said, laughing. "There 
are six or seven possibilities out there. It's wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 But will it be wide-open enough for the eighth-seeded Titans to become a 
factor? They will find out at 3 p.m. Thursday, when they play ninth-seeded 
Nevada in the opening round at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You certainly can't look past anybody the way this conference is," Holland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when the conference champion, New Mexico State (20-7, 12-6 in the 
conference), finished only two games ahead of fifth-place Nevada Las Vegas. 
Utah State, Long Beach State and San Jose State all finished 11-7 in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach State has been playing as well as anyone the last month," Holland 
said. "UNLV is playing at home and deserves top consideration. New Mexico State 
won the regular season, and San Jose State and Pacific are capable of playing 
great basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 And, at times, so can Fullerton (8-18, 6-12). The Titans played one of their 
best games of the season about a month ago at Thomas & Mack, upsetting UNLV, 
84-75. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Titans got a nice draw, facing Nevada, a team they beat twice in the 
regular season. They beat the Wolf Pack, 74-70, at Reno in January and blew 
them out in the second half of a 97-72 victory last month at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada (10-16, 6-12) also will be without one of its best players, forward 
Walt Outlaw, who was suspended Feb. 17 for breaking team rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outlaw is a fine player," Holland said. "But Nevada wasn't missing him when 
they came into our place and were kicking our behind in the first half last 
month. Nevada is certainly capable of beating us." 
</P>
<P>
 How the rest of the tournament field shapes up: 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine (7-19, 4-14) -- The 10th-seeded Anteaters have a decent shot at 
making the semifinals, opening against seventh-seeded UC Santa Barbara, which 
they lost to last week. A victory would put the Anteaters in the quarterfinals 
against second-seeded Utah State. Remember, the Anteaters pulled off a huge 
upset two years ago, beating top-seeded UC Santa Barbara in the first round. 
Sorry, not this season. The Anteaters have a knack for losing close games -- 
three overtime losses and two more by five points or less in a seven-game 
conference losing streak. And a good tournament team must deliver in the 
clutch. One victory, at best, and out for the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (20-7, 12-6) -- Go figure this team. In mid-February, the 
Aggies were nationally ranked, 11-2 in the conference and were heavily favored 
to win the Big West tournament. Now the Aggies are just another contender, 
having lost at Long Beach State, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara in late 
February and barely winning the conference regular-season championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State (17-9, 11-7) -- Here's the hip pick -- take the 49ers to win 
it all. Coach Seth Greenberg's 49ers are playing the best basketball of anybody 
in the conference right now. The third-seeded 49ers, the defending tournament 
champions, have won five of their past six and seven of their past nine. The 
49ers received a tough draw, facing a streak-shooting Pacific team, seeded 
sixth, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas (14-12, 10-8) -- How can the host Rebels, with a lineup that 
includes Reggie Manuel, Kebu Stewart and Dedan Thomas, not be the tournament 
favorite? See: Cal State Fullerton 84, UNLV 75, on Feb. 17 at Thomas & Mack. 
The fifth-seeded Rebels, who face fourth-seeded San Jose State in the 
quarterfinals, are capable of folding at a moment's notice. And it probably 
will happen again, even though the Rebels have the homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific (16-13, 10-8) -- The Tigers had a shot at catching New Mexico State 
entering the final week of the season, but losses to the Aggies and UNLV 
dropped them to sixth place in the standings and a difficult quarterfinal 
matchup with Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State (15-11, 11-7) -- How are the Spartans rewarded for their best 
season since 1986-87 and their first tournament appearance since 1989? They are 
matched against host UNLV in the first round. The Spartans, led by guard Terry 
Cannon, were the Big West's hottest team from mid-January to mid-February, 
winning seven of eight. But they probably won't be around for long in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara (13-16, 9-9) -- The Gauchos have lost three of their last 
four, but their lone victory in that stretch was at home over New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah State (14-12, 11-7) -- Playing as well as they have all season, the 
Aggies enter the tournament on a three-game winning streak, including victories 
at Pacific and San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holland supports the conference's decision to return to the 10-team tournament 
format and invite all teams. For the past few years, only the top eight teams 
qualified for the tournament, which would have meant Nevada and UC Irvine 
stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the format is good for the conference," Holland said, "especially in 
a year such as this, when there's so much parity. I just wish they would 
re-seed all the teams after every round." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was asked at an Orange County Sportswriters Assn. luncheon Tuesday 
what he thought of UNLV Coach Rollie Massimino, who is rumored to be a 
candidate for the Providence job: "I know Rollie is having such a tough time at 
UNLV, that's a surprise. He's been there what? Two years? Maybe they need a 
young, up and coming coach or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland is 37, 22 years younger than Massimino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add basketball: Nothing better than a game against Nevada to help 
Fullerton's Josh King break out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 King, a 6-foot-7 freshman guard-forward, scored 20 points in each of 
Fullerton's regular-season victories over Nevada. But he hasn't scored in the 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every game is a chance for a player like Josh to break out," Holland 
said. "I'm not worried about Josh or (freshman guard) Chris St. Clair at all. 
They've learned a lot in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone, every season, has a lull in their game. And they break through it, 
and I know Josh will."

<P>
 The Titans' second-ranked baseball team suffered a blow when third baseman 
Craig Skyberg, the starting third baseman, quit the team for personal reasons. 
Skyberg was batting .228 with 13 hits and five RBIs this season. . . . The 
women's fencing team finished second to Stanford at the NCAA Western Regionals 
last weekend. The Titans' Shirley Chan placed sixth in the tournament. The 
men's team also finished sixth at the regionals. . . . Seven of the nation's 
top-ranked softball teams, including top-ranked Arizona, are scheduled to 
compete in the PONY tournament, March 23-27 at Fullerton. The host Titans are 
ranked 16th.

DOWN, NOT OUT; BEVERLY HILLS FLASHES ITS OWN VERSION OF A BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The scene: The interior of designer Ralph Lauren's clothing store on Rodeo 
Drive in Beverly Hills. Actor Tom Selleck takes only a brief look at the piles 
of $300 sweaters and $200 shirts on sale, but stops in front of the socks 
marked down almost 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are no 99-cent bargains in this world-famous city, long a 
symbol of Southern California's affluence. But socks at $16.20 a pair are 
something Selleck simply can't ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be un-American to pass up socks that are on sale," he says, flashing his 
trademark dimpled grin as he hands about half a dozen pairs to a sales clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no movie. Selleck -- who once made Forbes' list of the world's richest 
entertainers by earning an estimated $22 million -- is merely bargain hunting, 
Beverly Hills style. 
</P>
<P>
 With Southern California only slowly emerging from recession and the wealthy 
still reluctant to dig too deeply into their designer wallets, the Chamber of 
Commerce set in the 90210 ZIP code area is busy mapping out ways to find new 
customers while offering better values to old ones who are not nearly as 
affluent as they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Most merchants say the need to expand their customer base is clear. Retail 
sales in Beverly Hills have dropped nearly 20% from their peak in 1990. Homes 
in the area are selling for about half what they were five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with lower revenues because of a shrinking commercial base, the city had 
to balance its books last year by resorting to such distasteful measures as 
employee layoffs and a $1.2-million hike in garbage pickup fees. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bill Boyd, executive vice president of the chamber, it is now 
clear that the business district can no longer thrive by catering solely to the 
richest of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not panicking," Boyd said, "but we obviously need to reach out to a 
wider group of people if we want to see business grow. There is a finite number 
of truly rich people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 While visitors to Beverly Hills these days certainly won't hear the sound of 
"Attention, Kmart shoppers," they will see how much shopping in the city has 
changed if they look closely enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Leather handbags, for example, now start at $95 and share shelf space with the 
$4,000 crocodile purses in the store owned by Fred Hayman, founder of the 
pricey Giorgio line of fragrances and the man who outfits television stars Jay 
Leno and Pat Sajak.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also offer men's suits for as little as $650," Hayman said. "A few years 
ago, we had nothing under $1,000."  
</P>
<P>
 At the Bowles/Sorokko Galleries a block away, $4,000 paintings by newcomers 
with names such as Watt and Medvedev hang near $250,000 originals by Picasso 
and Neiman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Tiffany & Co. -- whose spacious store stands like a granite guard dog at 
the southern end of the Rodeo Drive shopping strip -- recently introduced a new 
line of key chains and other stainless steel accessories selling for as little 
as $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wealthy people have been cutting back on their spending," said Mark Aaron, a 
Tiffany spokesman, "but they just don't do it the same way that most consumers 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the recession, Sharper Image on nearby Santa Monica Boulevard could 
barely keep its $1,000 electric shavers in stock and once offered a $64,000 
classic Corvette for that special person seeking "the ultimate toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Now customers appear more practical and price-conscious. Among the store's 
best-selling items during Christmas were a $39 motorized tie rack and a $150 
toothbrush that improves oral hygiene by emitting sonar sound waves.  
</P>
<P>
 "A toothbrush is certainly a practical item, even if it is priced at $150," 
said Sydney Klavett, a Sharper Image spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new cars are still down from their pre-recession levels at 
Rolls-Royce of Beverly Hills, where a 1994 Corniche convertible retails for 
$269,000. But the company's sales of used -- er, "pre-owned" -- autos jumped 
sharply last year, as clients sought older models at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many customers are looking to spend between $60,000 and $100,000, which can 
buy them a new Lexus or a pre-owned Rolls-Royce," said David Murphy, the 
dealership's manager. "We think that we're the better buy."  
</P>
<P>
 For budget-conscious buyers who'd like sportier wheels, Murphy suggests the 
new Lotus Esprit in his showroom that goes for only $71,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many restaurateurs have revamped their menus and lowered prices to 
attract new diners and their slimmer wallets. Some that didn't -- including 
Bice, which was among the priciest and trendiest Beverly Hills eateries in the 
high-flying '80s -- have been forced to close their doors in the toned-down 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants that have long offered more affordable fare barely noticed the 
recession. "People in Beverly Hills still want to eat out, but they seem a 
little more reluctant to spend $50 or $100 to do it," said Mark Stamper, 
manager of Cafe Rodeo, where entrees start at about $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce's efforts to attract more business to the city 
includes an advertising campaign designed to make consumers view shopping there 
more like visiting a huge, upscale mall rather than a disparate group of 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even doing a special event each month, like shopping centers do, to 
sort of tie all our stores together," said Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's "Salute to the Emmys" month in Beverly Hills proved popular, with 
stores displaying many of the outfits worn by the nominees. "Ferrari Concourse" 
was also a hit, when Rodeo Drive was shut down to traffic and dozens of the 
pricey cars were put on display. 
</P>
<P>
 But trying to run a marketing campaign when so many image-conscious retailers 
are involved is tricky. A plan to erect billboards reading "Don't Get Malled: 
Shop in Beverly Hills" was scuttled after some store owners complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people felt that we were relegating ourselves to the level of a common 
shopping center just by acknowledging their presence," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Beverly Hills' best-known residents also have concerns about the 
city's efforts to appeal to a broader range of clientele. Zsa Zsa Gabor, 
herself a bargain shopper, warns that the city's endeavors may backfire if less 
wealthy newcomers "drive out the people who made Beverly Hills famous in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Selleck, who lives on a 60-acre ranch near Thousand Oaks, doesn't share 
Gabor's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that businesses can do to bring in more customers will help the 
economy and create more jobs," he said. "I don't come here to see rich people. 
I just come here to shop." Beverly Hills, 8.25% 
</P>
<P>
 The long recession has even taken its toll on Beverly Hills, where retail 
sales remain well below their 1990 peak. Taxable sales, in millions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 1993: $958* 1992: 957 1991: 1,016 1990: 1,127 1989: 1,107 1988: 984 1987: 967

JAPAN'S MIXING OF RICE SUPPLIES FUELS BACKLASH; IMPORTS: EMERGENCY PURCHASES 
HAVE LED TO AN ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE AS CONSUMERS STRIP STORE SHELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's first, limited experience with importing rice is nearing disaster 
because of the government's insistence on mixing foreign rice with domestic 
varieties, which are held almost sacred by consumers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese families began hoarding domestic varieties of rice last week, when 
the government began widespread sales of a mixture of domestic and foreign 
varieties of the grain. The situation turned into full-scale panic Monday, when 
consumers learned they may have little choice but to swallow some foreign rice 
with every bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The government announced that scarce supplies of domestic rice could be sold 
only if it was mixed with imported rice or sold in double packs containing bags 
of domestic and imported rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Store shelves were quickly emptied of what was left of the pure domestic rice, 
and some consumers turned to a thriving black market in search of their beloved 
home-grown staple. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pleaded Tuesday for consumer 
patience with government policy, the nation was in an uproar. At least one 
tabloid newspaper called the Agriculture Ministry a "war criminal which should 
be hanged five times over." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, under sharp questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, replied with a 
plea for public "understanding that until the new crop is in, it is necessary 
to consume a balance of imported rice together with the limited amount of 
domestic rice." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy underscored a major criticism of Japan heard from many of its 
trading partners, including the United States: that even when Japan decides to 
open a closed market to foreign competition, it does so in a manner that is 
designed primarily to protect its domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the government's decisions are attempts to preserve an irrational 
distribution system -- controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture's Food Agency 
-- that keeps rice prices at eight to 10 times world market prices in order to 
support Japanese farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the government's latest action is threatening to increase the power of the 
black market in rice and undermine the government-controlled system. 
</P>
<P>
 When the government decided last fall that it had to allow foreign rice into 
Japan -- under an emergency exception only -- to make up for last year's poor 
harvest, it also decided to take windfall profits on its monopoly imports by 
setting prices close to the level of domestic varieties, which sell for up to 
$3 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing imports to be freely priced would destroy the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the price incentive to buy foreign rice eliminated, the 
government and officially licensed retail outlets now have little choice but to 
search for ways to force consumers to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the new rules for rice distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 But these rules apply only to the 70,000 licensed retailers who sell most of 
Japan's rice. Estimates are that this year, up to a third of the country's rice 
supply will be distributed through another 200,000 technically illegal outlets, 
ranging from gas stations to convenience stores. The government's edicts are 
fostering growth of this out-of-control black market. 
</P>
<P>
 All varieties of rice, from the most popular domestic varieties to the 
long-grained Thai variety -- which has been the focus of most of the Japanese 
consumer's distaste for foreign rice -- are sold at unlicensed shops that are 
technically illegal but operate openly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are less critical of California rice, a short-grained variety 
that suits their tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Black market prices for domestic varieties and California rice are running at 
40% or more above the official price at approved shops; Thai rice has been 
selling at about half the government price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the black market in rice -- which participants often refer to as a "free 
market" -- gets even bigger, that may do more than just undermine the Food 
Agency's control of rice distribution. A freer sales system could boost 
pressure to offer imported rice to Japanese consumers at prices much closer to 
world levels. It is no longer clear that the government would have the strength 
or determination to stop such a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the government has pledged to open the rice market gradually to comply 
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in the long run, this could 
bode well for imports.

BOX OFFICE STUDY PRODUCES A ROSIER PICTURE; ENTERTAINMENT: A SURVEY OF THEATER 
OWNERS SHOWS THAT TICKET SALES ARE HIGHER AND ADMISSION PRICES LOWER THAN 
REPORTED FOR PAST FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More movie tickets have been sold over the last five years than was previously 
thought -- and the average price paid for a ticket has been lower, according to 
a new study by the National Assn. of Theater Owners and the Motion Picture 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey -- based on a poll of theater owners representing more than half 
the screens in the United States -- found that the average ticket price last 
year was $4.14, a dollar less than the average previously reported in federal 
census samplings. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalculating the numbers on that basis shows that 1.24 billion movie tickets 
were sold last year, the most since 1989, the report said. (Admissions are 
counted by dividing total box office receipts by the average ticket price.) 
</P>
<P>
 The box office gross for 1993 was a record-breaking $5.2 billion, thanks in 
significant measure to Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," which grossed $344 
million in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of making movies is also rising, and producers and distributors are 
finding it harder to make a profit, MPAA President Jack Valenti said at the 
annual ShoWest convention here. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study is significant in two ways, according to Valenti and William 
Kartozian, president of the theater owners group. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, it counters the public perception that the price of a movie 
ticket has been spiraling, they said. On the other, it can serve to reassure 
Wall Street skeptics that movie theaters are drawing bigger crowds than 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 After some members of the theater owners group challenged the census figures 
on average ticket prices, the two organizations hired Ernst & Young to analyze 
five years of price data from the operators of about 57% of the 25,214 movie 
screens nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The findings: Admission prices were lower than previously believed. For 1993, 
the average ticket price was $4.14 (down from $5.15); for 1989, the average was 
$3.99 (down from $4.45). With that information, the MPAA concluded that more 
tickets had been sold each year from 1989 through 1993 than previously 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows movies are a better value than a lot of people realize," said Paul 
Rogers, who heads a 31-screen theater circuit in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said he was not surprised that the average ticket price turned out to 
be lower than believed, because many of his customers take advantage of bargain 
matinees and discount nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti, in his annual state-of-the-industry speech, told about 6,500 ShoWest 
delegates that the average cost of making a movie in 1993 jumped 3.7% for 
MPAA-member companies, to $29.9 million. Add the average $14-million cost of 
advertising, promotion, distribution and prints, and a studio would have to 
recoup about $44 million from a picture just to break even, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other bad news, the MPAA reported that only 28 of the 156 movies produced 
and released by its members last year collected $20 million or more in film 
rentals -- that is, what the producer garners from box office revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the smallest number of films to break the $20-million threshold since 
1988. In 1992, 36 films logged rentals of $20 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a brighter note, Valenti said foreign attendance is on the rise. Attendance 
at British theaters has doubled in the last decade to 112 million admissions, 
from 50 million in 1993, he said. Admissions were up 7% in France, 16% in 
Germany, 25% in Denmark, 12% in Finland, 3% in Sweden and 14% in Norway. More 
and More Silver on Screen 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of producing and marketing a major motion picture -- one made 
by a Hollywood studio -- has risen faster than the rate of inflation, hitting 
$44 million in 1993. Percent changes in average production and marketing costs 
compared to the consumer price index: 03,06,17,13 Cost of Consumer Motion 
Pictures Price Index 1989 +22.9% +4.8% 1990 +18.7 +5.4 1991 -1.6 +4.2 1992

RULES AGAINST LENDING BIAS TOUGHENED BY GOVERNMENT; BANKING: FEDERAL AGENCIES 
ARE EXPANDING BEYOND A RECENT FOCUS ON MORTGAGES AND WILL NOW SCRUTINIZE OTHER 
LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare display of cooperation, 10 federal agencies, led by the Justice 
Department, on Tuesday announced tough new guidelines to fight discrimination 
in loans to consumers and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 All lenders -- from banks and savings and loans to finance companies, credit 
unions and credit card companies -- will now be scrutinized to see if their 
overall lending patterns contain evidence of bias, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the federal agencies are expanding their aggressive approach far 
beyond a recent focus on fighting bias in home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ending discrimination in lending is one of the most important civil rights 
issues facing this country," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The interagency program unveiled Tuesday will focus on the so-called disparate 
treatment of borrowers, in which there may be no overt prejudicial policies and 
no intent to discriminate, but the outcome is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if the rejection rate for blacks applying for credit is much 
higher than for whites in the same general income group, this could be a result 
of disparate treatment, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The differing rejection rates should "raise a red flag" and cause a lending 
institution to re-examine the way it does business, Comptroller of the Currency 
Eugene Ludwig said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy statement adopted by the federal agencies gave two examples of 
lending practices that will not be tolerated and which lead to disparate 
impact: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two minority borrowers asked about mortgage loans. They were given 
applications only for a fixed-rate mortgage and failed to qualify for the loan. 
Two non-minority borrowers with the same general income were told about both 
adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgages and were given help in filling out 
their ultimately successful application. 
</P>
<P>
 * A loan officer rejected a loan application by a woman with "flaws in her 
credit report" but approved applications by men with similar credit problems 
"after working with them to provide satisfactory explanations." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer and advocacy groups generally welcomed the policy. "It's long overdue 
and we're happy to see it," said Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs 
at Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton Administration has shown a strong interest in aggressive 
enforcement of the civil rights laws," she said. "Today's statement was a 
breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
 Acorn, a coalition of neighborhood groups in 37 cities, was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is about sending a message to industry," said Deepak Bhargava, the group's 
legislative director. "But the substance of their statement is not terribly 
radical about efforts to achieve compliance. It's like smoke signals. It's not 
clear about telling the banks what they should and shouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most hidden discrimination occurs in small-business lending because loans are 
not standardized, Bhargava said. Mortgage loans, on the other hand, are 
packaged for resale to investors, and federal laws require public disclosure of 
application and rejection rates among various ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry G. Cisneros, secretary of housing and urban development, who hosted the 
news conference, said the participating agencies formed "the most powerful team 
that can be assembled" for the goal of guaranteeing "fair lending to all 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Just by having the news conference, there will be ripples throughout the 
financial services industry, said Norman E. D'Amours, chairman of the National 
Credit Union Administration, one of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has already met with bankers to discuss their concerns about the newly 
aggressive policies. "We are not asking people to make bad loans, but to be 
fair," she said. Many times, "there is no racism involved," merely lenders' 
ways of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the Justice Department and HUD, the federal agencies involved in the 
effort are the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Office 
of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Trade Commission, Federal Housing Finance 
Board and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.

JAMES FLANIGAN: REASONED GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF DERIVATIVES NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An enormous new financial business that could trouble even the Federal Reserve 
Board and yet defies the understanding of the nation's best financial minds is 
terrifying governments around the world while also earning billions of dollars 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a business -- called derivatives because it deals in new securities and 
agreements derived from underlying stocks, bonds and commodities -- that can be 
said to help finance Medicare and keep your mortgage rate reasonable, while 
offering opportunity for your mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a business that deals in an incredible $15 trillion worth of 
securities, loans and interest rate swaps, putting a total of $600 billion at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers frighten most people, including lawmakers in Washington who 
would regulate derivatives if only they could get a grip on what they are. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Susan M. Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, 
sees the growth of derivatives as part of the evolution of financial risk 
management that began with the deregulation of interest rates in the 1970s and 
moved on to the mortgage-backed securities that helped save home mortgages in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 To Phillips, an economist who has served as a commissioner of the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, interest rate and currency swaps are the latest 
examples of the know-how that keeps U.S. firms on the cutting edge of global 
finance and earns the United States a tidy surplus in international trade in 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In their simplest form, derivatives enable a small business that can borrow 
only short-term at fluctuating interest rates -- which expose it to the risk of 
rates moving up -- to trade its interest payment schedule with a large business 
that has long-term loans at fixed rates but wants the lower, short rates 
because it can withstand the risk of fluctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, through a swap contract drawn up by a commercial bank or investment 
company, the small business pays the big fellow's fixed rate of interest, and 
the large firm, which in effect has refinanced its debt, pays the lower, 
short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks and finance houses, which verify the credit-worthiness of both 
parties and work out the actuarial risks of the swap transaction, make big 
money as intermediaries. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank that is 
a leader in derivatives, has just reported a profit increase of 82% to $2.7 
billion for 1993; Citicorp, the big bank that only two years ago was a 
candidate for Federal Reserve rescue, recently reported a '93 profit of $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are risks. Developing countries, such as Malaysia, Peru, Zimbabwe or 
Vietnam, which never qualified for much long-term credit before, are now able 
to get financing for their industries, because global big companies and 
sophisticated investors are buying their interest rate payments, just as they 
do for small businesses back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting credit is a boon for development and for U.S. and global companies 
that gain new and emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the country that never qualified before should not get so much 
credit now. There are risks of defaults -- which could hurt the emerging 
markets mutual funds now so popular with Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other risks too. Big companies and global investors often "buy more 
interest rate swaps than they have debt," as one banker puts it, meaning they 
borrow money to bet on the direction of interest rates. That's like an investor 
in stocks buying on margin or a real estate investor borrowing against one 
condominium to buy another. 
</P>
<P>
 If rates go against them, the losses are sudden and severe. That's what 
happened last month in Europe. U.S. hedge funds -- private funds that invest 
millions for sophisticated investors -- had bet that German, French and Italian 
interest rates would continue to go down. When markets went against them, the 
hedge funds had to sell in a hurry, unsettling government debt markets and 
causing European governments to call for regulation of hedge funds and 
derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for regulation are being echoed in the United States, where there are 
fears that a big bank or finance house will get in trouble and need a rescue 
from the Federal Reserve, disrupting the economy. Rep. James Leach (R-Iowa) is 
proposing a Federal Derivatives Commission to oversee the business. 
</P>
<P>
 As to what form regulation might take, more disclosure of transactions would 
be very useful, says Paul Isaac, chief economist of New York's Mabon Securities 
and an expert in derivatives. Derivative transactions are now not reported in 
income statements or balance sheets and thus can produce spectacular mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson Greetings last week found it was inadvertently at risk for $24 million 
trying to hedge interest rates on only $70 million of debt. Metallgesellschaft, 
the German mining and metals giant, lost $1 billion trying to hedge interest 
rates and oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But before regulation is written, we should look to the savings and loan 
crisis for perspective, says Mark Grinblatt, professor of finance at UCLA. In 
the inflationary 1970s, the S&Ls were stuck holding long-term mortgages at low 
interest rates just when they had to pay out higher rates to keep deposits. Had 
the thrifts then been able to swap interest rates -- or to sell their mortgages 
to the Government National Mortgage Assn., as they could in the 1980s -- there 
might have been no S&L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 We might also consider that interest rate swaps have come into being with the 
oceans of government debt being issued here and abroad -- reflecting the growth 
of government spending that we see in programs such as Medicare or F-22 jet 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional investors buying that debt want to protect themselves from 
interest rate fluctuation, and from the risk that the government will inflate 
the economy, eroding the value of its bonds, explains economist Albert 
Wojnilower of First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 So markets in derivatives will continue to grow and develop. "There will be 
losses and bankruptcies, but perhaps not as many as without these tools," says 
Patricia Klink, president of Advisers Capital Management, an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Fed Gov. Phillips have a point: The new interest rate devices are not 
really risky in themselves. They're tools that can bring benefit, or they can 
be abused. That's why intelligent regulation is needed -- not to stifle the 
market but to nurture it.

GROWTH IN WORKER OUTPUT FASTEST SINCE '86; ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT ALSO SAYS THE 
COST OF LABOR DECLINED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER AT THE STEEPEST RATE IN A 
DECADE. 
</P>

<P>
 The productivity of American workers was improving at the fastest rate in 
seven years as 1993 came to a close, while the cost of their labor was falling 
at the steepest pace in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts acknowledged the improvement was coming at the expense of jobs, but 
contended it will mean greater employment later. And, they added, the lack of 
inflation means greater buying power now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's unmistakable pain for workers who are not getting employed now," said 
economist Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York. "But as 
companies become more competitive, they will be the big job creators for the 
U.S. economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said non-farm productivity -- output per number of hours 
worked -- shot up a revised 6.1% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from 
October through December. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the best improvement since a 6.9% advance in the first three months of 
1986. Fourth-quarter productivity originally was reported rising at a 4.2% 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased productivity helps keep prices under control and thus is essential 
for improved living standards and to make American products more competitive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unit labor costs shrank at a 3.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the 
largest decline since a 4.8% drop in the second quarter of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 With job creation so slow, workers generally are unable to bid up their wages 
and benefits. And since labor typically represents about two-thirds of the cost 
of a product, the report suggested little inflationary pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 4% productivity gain in the third quarter, productivity for all of 
1993 increased just 1.7%. That was revised up from 1.6% in the government's 
initial estimate but still was little more than half of the 3.1% advance in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity was held back last year by annualized declines of 1.8% in the 
first quarter and 0.4% in the second, when the overall economy slowed from its 
robust pace in the final three months of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the fourth straight increase, including advances of 1.1% in 1991 
and 0.4% in 1990. Productivity had slipped 0.9% in 1989, the first decline 
since a similar 0.9% drop in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach said productivity growth was continuing -- although he doubted the 
fourth-quarter pace could be sustained -- and suggests "we have a uniquely 
powerful productivity-led recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Unit labor costs had dropped at a 0.4% rate in the third quarter and the 
fourth-quarter decline marked the first back-to-back decrease since the last 
half of 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, costs edged up a revised 1.8%, compared to 1.9% in the 
department's initial report and down from 2.0% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Output in 1993 increased 3.8%, up from a 2.7% gain in 1992. It advanced at an 
8.6% rate from October through December and the biggest gain since a 10.3% jump 
in the first quarter of 1984. Output had risen 4.1% from July through 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, total hours worked last year rose 2.1%, compared to a 0.4% 
decline a year earlier. In the final three months, hours worked were up at a 
2.3% rate, compared to a 0.1% advance in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing productivity shot up 5.1% in 1993, up from a 4.3% advance in 
1992. That included a 7.5% jump at factories making long-lasting goods such as 
cars and computers. Productivity

 Rules Established for Airwaves Auction: Federal regulators acted to enhance 
the launching of advanced wireless communications services.Under orders from 
Congress, the Federal Communications Commission will require companies to pay 
for licenses to use the publicly owned radio spectrum. The licenses in the past 
have been given away free, allotted by lottery. The government has estimated 
that the companies bidding for the potentially lucrative licenses could pay as 
much as $10.2 billion. The proceeds would be earmarked for helping to reduce 
the federal government's gaping budget deficit.

ENTERTAINMENT; DISNEY UNSURE HOW IT WILL ORGANIZE NEW THEME PARK; DEVELOPMENT: 
OFFICIALS DEBATE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT OVERSIMPLIFYING U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. is moving away from organizing its proposed park in Prince 
William County, Va., around nine history-themed "territories," such as the 
Civil War and slavery, prompted in part by historians' concern that the 
familiar Disney theme park concept could oversimplify the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being built around topics including the family farm and Ellis 
Island immigrants, for example, the park could instead stress a handful of 
American values or cultural themes, which might include diversity, how 
conflicts have united the country or how Americans have responded to 
technological change, company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift underscores the complexity and risk involved as the company prepares 
to invest at least $650 million in Disney's America, intended to package fun 
with education for families on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, when the project was unveiled, Disney executives, from 
Chairman Michael Eisner down, have stressed that its content remains undecided 
and that they expected debate over their handling of American history.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics attacked the company's plans for portraying slavery after one official 
said the park would allow visitors to feel what it was like to be a slave. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner later called that statement presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Weis, head of the park design team and senior vice president of Walt 
Disney Imagineering, would not give specific examples of potential changes to 
the park concept Tuesday. However, he said Disney is studying how Americans 
face the same issues time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I've started to gravitate to is that no American story has 
a beginning or an end," he said. "They have roots in an early period, they have 
dynamic points and . . . a lot of themes run through our history." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he said he does not believe the company is abandoning its original 
concept of the park, Weis said, "I'm not sure we have a certain direction yet. 
. . . Our thoughts are evolving." 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney consultant said his intent is to avoid letting the company's talent 
for popularizing fantasy stories simplify or compartmentalize the American 
past, which might lead to stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I've been concerned with is that the history they tell is a 
serious history," said James Oliver Horton, a professor of history at George 
Washington University who was hired to advise Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in a fantasy history," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In its first promotional materials last fall, Disney outlined a 185-acre park 
that would bring up to 30,000 visitors a day to "recall the past, live the 
present, dream the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Conceptually, it included nine areas, from "Native America, 1600-1800," which 
would describe earlier American Indian civilizations, to "Victory Field, 
1930-1945," based on the nation's response to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas included "We the People, 1870-1930," an Ellis Island re-creation 
that would tell the tale of immigrants; "Civil War Fort, 1850-1870," which 
would tackle American slavery and the war that ended it, and "Enterprise, 
1870-1930," which would describe industrialization. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives had described possible rides, such as a virtual-reality 
World War II fighter pilot flight and a Lewis and Clark river expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Disney designers are considering exhibits in which visitors can see the 
process of history being made, said Robin Reardon, a show producer for Disney's 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we had graduate students doing research on some aspects of American 
history" who would become part of the display? Reardon asked.

 Safety Agency Looks at 1992-93 Saturns: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration said it is investigating reports of an alleged engine mount 
failure in the General Motors Corp. cars. A spokesman for the agency said the 
preliminary investigation was opened last Wednesday after the NHTSA received 
three reports of failures."If, in fact, the engine mount fails, it might allow 
the engine to shift during braking or acceleration, and that allows the 
possibility that the throttle might be affected," the spokesman said. A 
preliminary investigation, typically the lowest-level probe the NHTSA can 
launch, could lead to a safety recall. Or it could be closed if investigators 
fail to find evidence of a defect. There are about 200,000 of the cars on the 
road.

 Labor, Consumers Join Utilities Against Retail 'Wheeling': Labor unions, 
independent power producers, consumer activists and environmentalists -- 
including San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council -- announced that they also oppose any move to 
deregulate retail electricity sales. Wholesale generation is now largely 
deregulated.But some big industrial power users -- including General Motors -- 
want to shop for electricity outside their local utility service territory, 
with that utility only delivering the power. Consumer activists and the 
utilities say this could let big users "cherry pick" low rates while leaving 
small businesses and residential ratepayers to pay more of the utilities' fixed 
costs. Environmentalists fear that retail deregulation could reduce utilities' 
efforts to conserve energy and cut pollution. Industrial users say that retail 
wheeling would cut rates to homeowners as well as their companies.

Billings were 33.5% higher than a year earlier. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 
means that for every $100 worth of products shipped, manufacturers received 
$115 worth of orders.

U.S. WILL URGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN S. AFRICA; POLICY: $80 MILLION IN DIRECT 
GOVERNMENT AID WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO HELP NATION AFTER ITS UPCOMING MULTIRACIAL 
ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, determined to prevent the failure of South 
Africa's experiment in multiracial democracy, will try to persuade American 
businesses, pension funds and other institutions to pour billions of dollars 
into the country's fragile economy after next month's elections, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House decided to build its South Africa policy around private 
investment because the U.S. foreign aid budget is stretched so thin that there 
is not much money available for the massive aid programs earlier 
administrations might have used to welcome a onetime pariah nation into the 
international family. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some details remain to be worked out, the Administration plans to 
offer South Africa about $80 million a year in direct U.S. aid, one official 
said. In addition, Washington will encourage the World Bank, International 
Monetary Fund and other governments to make generous contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the Administration is also looking for programs that would 
have great impact at relatively modest expense. Those could include U.S. 
government guarantees for private loans to finance housing and U.S.-government 
financed studies of projects where U.S. firms might want to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential governmental programs are dwarfed by possibilities in the 
private sector. In the mid-1980s, before Congress and the public forced a 
reluctant Ronald Reagan Administration to mount an economic boycott of South 
Africa, about 300 American companies maintained investments of $2.7 billion in 
South Africa. By 1990, direct American investment was down to about $700 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective is to reverse that government-driven disinvestment. The stakes 
could hardly be higher. If the government chosen in elections April 26-28 -- 
almost certainly headed by black nationalist icon Nelson Mandela -- is unable 
to satisfy the soaring expectations of the country's black majority, it could 
destroy democracy before it has a chance to take root and could destabilize 
most neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new government could avoid deterioration into ethnic rivalries -- 
prevent fragmentation such as what occurred in the former Yugoslavia -- and 
mount a peaceful transition from white leadership to black majority rule, it 
would give U.S. diplomacy and the entire international community a badly needed 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difficulties are daunting. South Africa's economy is brittle after 
years of sanctions. And the U.S. business community, so important to the 
Administration's plans, is an unknown factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies will go back when they decide it is a good place to invest," said 
John Howard, director of International Policy and Programs at the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "The elections are a major step forward. The investment climate is better," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Under white-minority governments, South Africa maintained the facade of 
capitalism and free enterprise. For that reason, U.S. officials believe it will 
be easier to attract private investment there than it has been in formerly 
communist countries that lack a private infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 But I. William Zartman, director of African Studies at the School of Advanced 
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said severe economic 
problems could obliterate the "political miracle" of a peaceful transition to 
majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new, legitimate government is in danger of losing its legitimacy because 
it cannot live up to the expectations that have been raised," he said. "The 
South African economy is weak and artificial. What looked like good free 
enterprise . . . was heavily supported by the state, by state ownership and 
state subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been dependent upon cheap labor, but the labor will get much more 
expensive," he said. "It is as if you took two-thirds of the society and let 
them out of prison and dumped them on the job market. They have no money, they 
have no housing, and the state is now responsible for them."

 Brazil Legislators Tinker With Economic Plan: Congress has proposed several 
changes to a major part of Economy Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
economic program. Among the proposed changes to the measure that created an 
anti-inflation wage and price index -- known as the Unit of Real Value -- are 
provisions for a sharp increase in the minimum wage, automatic salary hikes 
whenever inflation exceeds 5% and a freeze on basic food prices. The government 
says some proposed changes could kill the plan's chances of success, and 
Cardoso has threatened to step down if the measure is drastically altered.

 European Union's Unemployment Rate Rises: The jobless figure rose to 10.9% in 
January from a revised 10.8% in December and 10.0% a year earlier, the EU's 
statistical office said. Eurostat expects unemployment to keep rising this year 
because economic growth will be too feeble to offset an increase in the number 
of job-seekers and companies further pruning back their work force. The largest 
increases in unemployment during the last year were in Spain (22.9% from 20.3%) 
and the Netherlands (10.0% from 8.0%).

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; AUSTRALIA SKEPTICAL ABOUT TOUGH U.S. TRADE STANCE WITH 
JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even here, seemingly far away from the economic frictions between Washington 
and Tokyo, the Clinton Administration is finding that it cannot avoid listening 
to people worry about the impact of the aggressive American efforts to open up 
Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In two days of talks with Australian officials, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher found himself repeatedly defending the Administration's Japan 
policy and its tough trade stance.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Administration's efforts appear to have made Australians angrier 
at the United States than at Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem paradoxical, because U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized 
that the changes in importing behavior that the Clinton Administration is 
seeking from Japan will benefit all countries, not just the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we're doing God's work in trying to open up Japan's market for 
everybody, including Australia," Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for 
East Asia, quipped Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those words carry special resonance in Asia, a region of the world where the 
memories of missionaries are particularly strong and not always pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these American assurances, some Australians, including high-level 
officials, are nervous that Japan will wind up buying more goods from America 
and less from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the argument goes, whatever American intentions may be, in the 
end Australia will be harmed: Japan won't increase its overall level of imports 
from the world. Rather, Tokyo will seek to satisfy or mollify the United States 
by increasing Japanese imports from America and cutting back on its purchases 
from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said last weekend that the government 
of Prime Minister Paul Keating worries that the United States will open up the 
Japanese market "at our expense." 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand why the U.S., like Australia and the rest of the world, 
supports the opening up of the Japanese market, but we don't support anyone 
doing it in a unilateral or discriminatory way," McMullan said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for Australia's concern: Some of its most important export 
industries compete directly with U.S. companies in the Japanese market. Japan 
could, for example, buy more American beef and cut back on purchases from 
Australia. Australia also exports some auto parts to Japan, which could be 
affected by U.S. pressure to get Tokyo to agree to buy more American auto 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fears are heightened by Australia's recent experience with American grain 
sales.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the United States and Australia are among the world's leading wheat 
exporters. When the United States began subsidizing agricultural exports to 
help American farmers compete with similarly subsidized competitors from 
Europe, Australians found their wheat exports suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that Australian fears are being encouraged by some Japanese. A 
Japanese academic official reportedly said here recently that any increases in 
Japan's imports from the United States will come out of Japan's purchases from 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is now Australia's leading trading partner. The United States ranks No. 
2 on the list, behind Japan, both as a market for Australian exports and as a 
supplier of goods to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said American officials have been explaining to the Australian government 
"that our position has been somewhat distorted. Obviously, Japan is the closed 
market. We are the open market. Obviously, Japan is the one that is managing 
trade, not the United States. . . . We will make sure that any opening we can 
achieve benefits everyone, including Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Australia is such a close ally of the United States and that the two 
days of meetings between American and Australian government officials have been 
so harmonious that "there has to be some change of pace."

 Airline Signs Pacts With 2 Foreign Carriers: Delta Air Lines Inc., making its 
first move into South America's fast-growing air traffic market, signed a 
marketing agreement with Varig Brazilian Airlines that could lead to a 
code-sharing arrangement between the carriers. It also signed a letter of 
intent with Vietnam Airlines to cooperate in marketing and services, as well as 
working to enhance computer reservation systems, facilities and passenger 
handling. The companies said they will also explore closer scheduling and 
code-sharing on direct flights between the United States and Vietnam, which 
could be implemented once a formal air service agreement is reached between the 
two countries.

JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATIONS IN PIROLI TRIAL; COURT: PANEL HEARS DEFENSE SAY 
PRIEST WAS FRAMED. PROSECUTION SAYS HE TOOK MONEY FROM SIMI VALLEY AND SATICOY 
CHURCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After six weeks of often conflicting testimony, jurors began deliberating late 
Tuesday over whether Father David Dean Piroli embezzled $60,000 in collection 
money from two Ventura County churches. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments Tuesday, the jurors heard the prosecution allege 
Piroli was a cocaine-using thief and the defense argue that he was just an 
innocent priest who had been framed by his larcenous pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the jury of 10 women and two men must decide whether Piroli, a 37-year-old 
Roman Catholic priest with eight years in the clergy, took his parishioners' 
money from St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in 
Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli is charged with two counts of embezzlement. He also faces a special 
allegation that could increase his sentence upon conviction if jurors find him 
guilty of taking an amount of money more than $50,000 from St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli testified he never took any church money. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense rests on his lawyer's claim that Father James McKeon took the 
money and may have planted it in Piroli's rooms with help from church secretary 
Eileen Slavin, attorney Richard Beada said Tuesday in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two were dear friends, and maybe at one point became dear 
conspirators," Beada told jurors. Later he said, "Father David was set up." 
</P>
<P>
 Beada alleged that McKeon was skimming thousands of dollars from the parish. 
The lawyer pointed to McKeon's own private ledger, which the elder pastor 
testified he used to keep track of collection money that he spent on church 
expenses and gifts to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada said the book shows McKeon spent $120,000 over a period of about 10 
years, and the lawyer pointed to certain entries in the mid-1980s, before 
Piroli's arrival.  
</P>
<P>
 These pages, Beada told jurors, showed there were several six-week periods in 
which McKeon was spending about $700 on meals and more than $1,000 on weekend 
pay for Dorothy Meyer, the elderly parish maid. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada argued that McKeon actually spent the money on himself. "Quite a nice 
little slush fund," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But these expenses fell sharply in McKeon's ledger after Piroli's arrival in 
July, 1990, which coincided with the start of the recession, Beada told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is evidence that Father Jim was using a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, and 
something terrible went South on him, namely the economy of the United States," 
Beada theorized. "Things got bad economically, there was no more money for 
Father Jim, so he had to change what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified during trial that he always told the church's volunteer money 
counters when he was taking money out of collections for church expenses, and 
that he logged each of the expenses in the ledger, calling it his "little black 
book." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, McKeon has declined to comment on the allegation that he was 
taking church money for himself. But the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles 
has vehemently denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone could have planted money in Piroli's rooms, which were unlocked, and 
his church car, for which employees had an extra set of keys, Beada said, 
telling jurors the case was based on circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that no one would be stupid enough to leave matchboxes 
containing trace amounts of cocaine in his top desk drawer where anyone could 
find it, as Piroli was alleged to have done. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a chance to rebut Beada, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace acknowledged the 
case is indeed circumstantial.  
</P>
<P>
 But she told jurors that the defense's allegations of a frame-up are 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace called the theory preposterous that church employees put money into 
Piroli's Chevrolet Lumina and then phoned the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Hollywood Division and told them to stop the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense attorney has tried Father McKeon and said it was a Ponzi scheme 
and he's been stealing for 20 years," Peace said. "Just suppose that was true. 
Does that have anything to do with the fact that someone saw Father Piroli with 
his hand in the collection basket? That he has all that money down in his car 
in L.A.? That he has cocaine in his car, in his office?" 
</P>
<P>
 The money found in Piroli's bedroom and office is "an essential element of the 
crime," Peace said. She also reminded jurors that church officials who counted 
the cash found many bills still folded into paper airplanes as children do 
before dropping donations into the collection basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli remains free on $100,000 bond posted by some of his former 
parishioners.

CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO SELL PEIRANO BUILDING; DEVELOPMENT: VENTURA REALTY PLANS 
TO DESTROY MOST OF LANDMARK. ARTISTS AND PRESERVATIONISTS PROTEST THE SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite passionate appeals from local artists and historic preservationists, 
the Ventura City Council early Tuesday decided to sell the 117-year-old Peirano 
building to a developer that plans to raze most of it to show off an old 
Spanish laundry beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it would be too expensive to do an estimated $430,000 in seismic 
repairs, council members voted 6 to 1 to let Ventura Realty take the Peirano 
building off their hands for $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle supports demolishing most of the old grocery across 
from San Buenaventura Mission, but voted against the measure because he wanted 
to preserve more of Peirano's west wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of historic preservation, but we can't ignore the imposition on 
the city tax dollars," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said before voting. "When 
we look at nostalgia, we don't like to look at dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty plans to destroy most of the state historical landmark and 
highlight a lavanderia underneath that may have been used by Spanish 
missionaries 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease preservationists, Ventura Realty officials have decided to keep the 
front and west side of the city's oldest brick building, and the lavanderia 
will be the main focus of a courtyard surrounded by a restaurant, shops and 
offices. City officials will also negotiate with Ventura Realty about leasing 
space in the complex for an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 80 artists and preservationists packed the City Council chambers to 
speak in favor of another developer's proposal because it would save the old 
grocery and an adjoining photography studio, which would be converted to a 
municipal art gallery. Preservationists submitted petitions with about 2,000 
signatures to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who destroy their past have nothing to build their future on," said an 
artist known simply as Marushka. "My concern is if that building comes down, 
other buildings will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, told the audience that economic revitalization of 
the city's downtown is more important. Few people came to speak in favor of the 
Ventura Realty proposal, which made the decision harder for council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown has been very shaky economically," Councilman Steve Bennett said. 
"Politically, the wisest thing for me to do is support the (other) proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to win over some artists, council members directed that city officials 
negotiate with Ventura Realty about finding space in the project for a 
municipal art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 To please preservationists, the council also decided to keep the front of 
Peirano's and at least 25 feet of the west wall intact. Tuttle, Bennett and 
Councilman Jack Tingstrom pushed for keeping 46 feet, but were outvoted. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action ends years of debate over the fate of the old grocery. In 
1987, the city purchased the Peirano building for $185,000, intending to 
preserve it and lease the space. 
</P>
<P>
 But few tenants were interested because city officials wanted them to pay for 
most of the $430,000 in needed seismic repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lavanderia was discovered in September, 1991, it further complicated 
the building's future. Last year, in an attempt to lure tenants, the council 
decided to give future renters the option of covering up the lavanderia.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, the council pushed for exposing and showcasing the 
lavanderia as outlined in Ventura Realty's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavanderia , only one of seven discovered in the state, is a tile-lined 
pool that may have been used for the mission's laundry. It is tied into the 
mission's aqueduct system and dates back to the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty officials said the project would be ready in as early as two 
years.

WATER DISTRICT OKS 7% RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's major water supplier has agreed to its fourth annual rate 
hike, a move that could boost most residents' monthly bills starting this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But a local water distributor may offset the increase by cutting an annual 
water charge levied on property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which funnels water 
through regional agencies to nearly 500,000 customers in Ventura County, voted 
on Tuesday to approve the 7% increase beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to pay for improved water quality systems, the increase would affect 
residents and commercial customers in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, 
Camarillo and parts of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rate hike were passed directly to the customer, the monthly bill for a 
typical household could increase by as much as $1.12, said Don Kendall, general 
manager of the Calleguas Municipal Water District.  
</P>
<P>
 Water rates for all five cities are determined by Calleguas, which tonight 
will consider changing its billing format to separate the actual cost of water 
from other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the new format could help insulate customers from future rate 
increases and might allow the district to drop a $9.58-per-acre water charge it 
added to property tax bills last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, an individual household uses about half an acre, or 163,000 
gallons, of water a year. The Calleguas board is expected to vote on water rate 
increases at its March 16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas began pursuing the new rate structure last fall after customers 
complained about the district's rates and Metropolitan's annual price hikes. 
After maintaining flat rates for five years, Metropolitan levied increases of 
13% in 1991, 23% in 1992 and 19% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charged that the MWD increases unfairly saddled Ventura County 
customers with the cost of water projects in other parts of Southern 
California, including a $1.5-billion reservoir in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Calleguas passed on those increases, in addition to price 
hikes for its own projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our objections has been that they do tend to look at the district as 
an indistinguishable entity," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said. "Everybody 
pays the same, but not everybody benefits from the new projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said that itemizing charges for construction and other expenses will 
allow the district to charge customers for specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally they have just thrown the increase on," Kendall said. "We're 
trying to find a way to keep the rates flatter." 
</P>
<P>
 But MWD spokesman Bob Muir said some of the funds from the annual increase are 
being used to build a $320-million, 23-mile pipeline to pump water into Ventura 
County along a route parallel to the Santa Paula Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The line, called the West Valley Project, would serve parts of the San 
Fernando Valley and would act as a backup to the Santa Susana pipeline, MWD's 
only link to the Conejo Valley. That link was severed for several days after 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the earthquake has drawn more attention to the demand and need for 
the West Valley Project," Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings are scheduled for the fall to discuss the environmental impact 
of the project, planned for construction in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little, who said he had not reviewed the MWD plan, 
said he would withhold judgment on the rate increase until Calleguas decides 
how much to pass on to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see what it does to our rates before we start hollering," 
Little said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of the Calleguas Municipal Water District meets today 
at 7:30 p.m. at 2100 Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks.

2 STUDENTS FROM AREA FOUND DEAD; CRIME: AUTHORITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO SAY MAN 
SHOT THE WOMAN IN DORM BEFORE KILLING HIMSELF. VENTURA PAIR HAD DATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two college students from Ventura were found dead in a San Francisco dorm room 
after a 22-year-old man shot a woman he once dated, then turned the gun on 
himself, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Eric Michael Jones and Catherine Anne Copeland, 21, were found 
in her third-floor room at a San Francisco State University dormitory about 
9:15 p.m. Monday after other students heard gunshots and called campus police. 
</P>
<P>
 The university officers, who used a master key to enter Copeland's small room 
after phone calls and knocks on the door went unanswered, found a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol near Jones' body. No notes were left. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and campus officials said Jones' depression over his breakup with 
Copeland in October apparently led to the murder-suicide, though the couple had 
only dated a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody handles their rejection differently," said Inspector 
Michael Byrne of the San Francisco police homicide unit. "I've seen other cases 
where you wouldn't think things should end up this way, but they do when 
somebody can't handle their depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland graduated in 1990 from Ventura High School, where she played in the 
band for four years and excelled as the school's top flutist her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones attended Buena High School for 3 1/2 years before withdrawing to attend 
a school in Maryland. At Buena, he competed on the wrestling team. Outside 
school, he won trophies in table tennis tournaments, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Copeland's family, the pair met at Ventura College last year, 
where she took general courses before transferring to San Francisco State last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 She was majoring in film at the university and hoped to work in television or 
movie production. Jones had declared a major in dietetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland's father, Harry, said the pair's relationship never seemed very 
serious. He said he met Jones only once or twice last summer when Jones stopped 
by to talk with Catherine at the family's east Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any suspicion he had anything on his mind -- any obsession or 
feelings," Harry Copeland said softly, standing in his doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have thought there was any guy stalking her, I would have been on the 
road and calling ahead to the police," he said. "I'm a pretty protective 
father." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Copeland last spoke with her parents Monday afternoon when she 
called to tell them she received an airline ticket to fly home for Easter, her 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said everything's OK," Harry Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my only daughter and she's gone," he added. "I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' friends and roommate told university officials in San Francisco that 
Jones had shown no signs of being unusually depressed over the broken 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the people we've heard from so far, no one knew that Eric had these 
feelings or had a weapon," said Ligeia Polidora, a university spokeswoman. 
"Everyone is very surprised by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' 17-year-old sister also said she was at a loss to explain her brother's 
actions. She said her parents had flown to San Francisco from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said Copeland apparently had agreed to see Jones on Monday night after 
he had tried contacting her several times throughout the day. Copeland had not 
reported any incidents involving Jones to university or city police, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hackett, the band director at Ventura High, said Copeland spent much of 
her spare time in high school practicing for the band and socializing with 
other students in the small music program. 
</P>
<P>
 He described Copeland as a gifted musician who played the piano and guitar in 
addition to the flute and piccolo. She was the only flutist in the marching 
band capable of playing a tricky passage in a parade march during her senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very level-headed. She was sweet, and she was intelligent," he said. 
"This is going to be a great loss for those who were friends with her."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CAUTION URGED FOR NAVY OFFSHORE BLASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council late Monday unanimously passed a resolution asking 
the Navy to use caution while conducting underwater explosives testing because 
of a threat of injury or death to marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution -- believed to be the first of its kind in the county -- asks 
the Navy to use caution during its "ship shock" testing of its new Aegis-class 
warships in waters about 65 miles west of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy is scheduled to begin testing in the area the week of April 4, 
pending discussions with the National Resources Defense Council and other 
prominent environmental groups. Navy officials had wanted to start the program 
this month, but postponed action until they could address concerns about the 
safety of the area's marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmentalists hailed the Ventura resolution, saying it will support 
their efforts to protect seals, sea lions, dolphins, migrating whales and other 
marine mammals living in the test zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Alpers, a Point Mugu Navy official who attended the council meeting, also 
praised the resolution, saying the Navy wants to address the environmental 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's testing procedure will involve detonating underwater explosives, 
some as large as 10,000 pounds. But before each test, extensive aerial surveys 
of the area will be done to check for marine mammals. If any are sighted, the 
tests will be moved or delayed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura action comes several days after Navy officials declined to 
exercise a National Marine Fisheries Service permit, which would allow them to 
begin testing. However, on Tuesday Navy officials said they are looking at the 
week of April 4 to possibly commence the ship-shock program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Navy officials said they will meet Thursday with National 
Resources Defense Counsel lawyers in Los Angeles in an attempt to reach a 
compromise on the danger posed to marine mammals by the tests. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MOTORIST WHO KILLED MAN IS SPARED PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old Oxnard man who admitted last month that he slammed his pickup 
truck into a disabled vehicle and killed a 24-year-old Ventura man has been 
spared prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Alan Steele on Monday instead sentenced 
Manuel Garcia to one year in jail and three years' probation.The sentence had 
been recommended by prosecutors, who said that Garcia displayed genuine remorse 
over his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 7:50 p.m. Jan. 12 on Vineyard Avenue north of Simon 
Way while Amanpreet Singh was pushing his pickup truck in a southbound lane, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was driving south on Vineyard Avenue at a high speed when he struck 
Singh's truck from behind, police said. Singh, who was thrown 120 feet, died 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after the incident, Garcia pleaded guilty at a preliminary 
hearing, sparing the victim's family the trauma of trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donna W. Thonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thonis also said prosecutors did not push for a prison sentence for Garcia 
because he had no previous criminal record and, they said, appears to be 
amenable to rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't time for him to go to prison," Thonis said. She said Garcia had 
been out drinking prior to a crash and registered a .24% blood-alcohol level, 
three times the state's legal limit. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 MEN INDICTED IN BEATING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County grand jury issued an indictment against two Ventura men 
Tuesday, charging them both in connection with the killing of 36-year-old 
Thomas Shoop, who died a day after being beaten and robbed of $15 last month, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury indicted Everado Mondragon, 35, and Jose Sanchez, 24, each on charges 
of murder and robbery. Prosecutors decided to bring the case before the grand 
jury because of fear that witnesses of the Feb. 20 mugging might be reluctant 
to come forward if the case wasn't immediately brought to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it would be in everybody's best interest to get on with this," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride said. "Witnesses become very nervous; we wanted 
to be sure we got them in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon was also indicted for selling cocaine and failing to appear in 
court. Arraignment on the indictment was postponed Tuesday until April 4. The 
men remain in custody at the Ventura County Jail with bail set at $250,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Shoop occurred while he was walking near Harrison Avenue and 
Olive Street in west Ventura. He was approached by two men who offered to sell 
him rock cocaine. When he refused, the men kicked him repeatedly and stole $15. 
Shoop later identified Mondragon and Sanchez as his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop refused medical treatment after the beating because he didn't have 
health insurance, relatives said. He died a day later of a ruptured spleen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he lived on odd jobs and supplemental income; he couldn't afford a 
hospital bill," said John Kenney, Shoop's cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to tough it out and see if he didn't have to go. He suffered a 
fatal mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop attended Buena High School and later worked as an electrician until a 
work-related accident left him partially disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who knew him had a lot of respect for him," Kenney said. "He was 
a very giving person." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SHELTER RESIDENTS SEEK HOUSING FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One week after the Oxnard City Council agreed to seek $76,000 in federal money 
to fund a job training program for the homeless, residents of the Red Cross 
shelter in Oxnard pleaded with the council to spend the money on housing 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Several men from the shelter at the National Guard Armory, which is open only 
in the winter -- said they will again be on the street when the shelter closes 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the armory closes on March 15, there will be (100) people on the 
street," Robert Fratantonio said. "A job training program is nice, but without 
a permanent address first, it's awfully hard to get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem that's not going away," said Clifford Woods, who with 
Fratantonio organized a petition drive in support of providing emergency 
shelter beyond the closing date of the Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The men said they had gathered 1,400 signatures of Oxnard residents who 
support the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what we need to do to get out of this situation," Woods said. "A meal 
won't help; four hours later and we're hungry. We need a decent place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Gonzalez, Oxnard's housing director, said later that the city has helped 
fund the Red Cross shelter, but cannot address the needs of the homeless on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a large population of homeless with a wide variety of needs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need job training, health care and other services in addition to 
housing." PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON DOWNTOWN SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council has delayed voting on whether to stretch the downtown 
boundaries to include the Ventura Avenue area, a plan that would help 
fast-track a development of 330 townhouses in western Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was scheduled to vote on the plan Monday, but officials decided to 
postpone debate for two weeks because many residents signed up to speak on a 
development proposal of the Peirano building, which was scheduled ahead of the 
boundary debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members want to expand the boundaries of downtown more than 20 
blocks north of West Park Row Avenue to Delaware Drive, a move that would allow 
developers in the upper Avenue area to immediately apply for and receive 330 
housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 Other developers outside the downtown and Avenue areas must wait until April 
to apply and compete for more limited allocations. Developers must receive 
housing allocations before being allowed to build. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority of the council members say housing in downtown is more 
important than putting housing in the Avenue and are worried the proposal would 
draw housing allocations away from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development by the Neel and Huntsinger families of Ventura, along 
with the possible expansion of Kinko's copy service's headquarters, would 
change the industrial character of the upper Avenue neighborhood north of 
Stanley Avenue and west of Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio is interested in building business offices and 330 townhouses in the 
city's old industrial sector. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER NEW RECYCLING EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will be asked today to approve spending $161,000 
annually to beef up the city's recycling efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city now meets state recycling codes, officials want to increase 
the amount of paper, plastic and glass collected in case the state raises its 
requirements.The state now requires cities to recycle 23% of its garbage, but 
there have been discussions to raise the level to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city must meet and should exceed 25% diversion (of recyclable materials) 
to provide a cushion against changes in state law or regulations," said John 
Elwell, Camarillo's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Elwell said he is recommending that Camarillo participate in a program offered 
by refuse hauler E. J. Harrison & Sons Inc., which promises to increase the 
percentage of recyclable materials reclaimed to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 E. J. Harrison & Sons officials told the city that it will get the extra 6% 
out of the city's trash by focusing on industrial wastes, which should yield an 
additional 2,630 tons of recyclable materials, Elwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the item at its meeting today at City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive. The meeting will start at 5 p.m. J. E. MITCHELL

<P>
 Hoping to ensure the sturdiness of block walls lining public streets, the Simi 
Valley City Council will consider forcing residents to get permits to rebuild 
walls damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb asked the city's staff to study the feasibility of 
requiring permits, after reviewing a staff report that said in some cases 
residents can disregard city standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to repair crumbled walls lining major streets, such as 
along Los Angeles Avenue, Cochran Street and Yosemite Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city codes, those walls must be built with steel reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 On side streets, however, the city does not require residents rebuilding walls 
to follow city codes or obtain city permits, if the walls are below 6 feet in 
height. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb said the city standards should apply to block walls 
built on side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried that, A, somebody is going to get killed," Webb said, "and, B, 
that the city is going to get sued." 
</P>
<P>
 The matter will be discussed at the March 21 council meeting. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY MOVES ON WITH POLICE STATION PLANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving ahead with plans to build a new police station, the Simi Valley City 
Council on Monday agreed to hire a consultant to scour the city for a suitable 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to fund a $35,000 study on the needs of the Police 
Department and possible locations for a new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton spoke in support of the plan, the first phase of a 
four-year project to build a new station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a good start," Stratton said. "Let's figure out what we need 
and where we're going to put it and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Two sites under consideration are undeveloped land at the city's Civic Center 
at Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street, and the department's current home at the 
corner of Cochran Street and Galena Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake to the department's existing headquarters 
on Cochran Street prompted city officials to accelerate plans for a new 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released by the city in mid-February said replacing the station could 
cost up to $11.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council hopes to hire a consultant to conduct the study at its April 11 
meeting. SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN IN RESCUE CITED AS HERO BY SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ray Gonzales was not comfortable with being called a hero when the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors honored him Tuesday for rescuing Irma Lopez as she 
lay wounded outside an Oxnard unemployment office three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take something like this out of context and say that someone is a 
hero I think people assume they couldn't do the same thing," Gonzales said 
after being given the award. "But I believe I did what anybody else would have 
done in that situation, and we should let people know that they could do the 
same thing really just by reaching out to their neighbors and their community." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 2, unemployed computer engineer Alan Winterbourne shot and killed 
three people inside the Oxnard jobs office. He later killed an Oxnard police 
detective before being shot dead by police outside the Ventura unemployment 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, an insurance salesman for Prudential Insurance Co. in Oxnard, was 
driving by the unemployment office when he heard shots fired. After turning his 
car around and driving by the building again, he could see Winterbourne 
methodically firing at Employment Development Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He also could see Irma Lopez, the wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, wounded 
and struggling to escape out the back door of the building. As glass and 
bullets flew by, Gonzales helped Lopez into his car and drove her to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so modest about what he did," said Lopez, who is still going to daily 
physical therapy sessions for her wounds. "He risked his life for me. It's 
something that I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by his wife Nicole, their young daughter Georgette and his son Ray, 
Gonzales listened as members of the board praised his act of heroism. Nearby 
was Betsy Cosgrove, Gonzales' boss at Prudential Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing he told me after the incident was that he didn't think. He 
was just acting on instinct," Cosgrove said. "I think the whole thing affected 
him though. He's a real sensitive guy." 
</P>
<P>
 While his wife videotaped the supervisors' meeting, Gonzales accepted the 
award handed to him by Supervisor John Flynn and received a congratulatory kiss 
from Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting the board's resolution, Flynn told Gonzales that his actions during 
the rampage were "a bright light in an otherwise dark day." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said his experience has only reinforced his values and his commitment 
to his community. He said he plans on participating in more civic organizations 
such as the Port Hueneme Boys & Girls Club, and encouraging others to reach out 
to their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought my life into focus and gave me a chance to look at what I stand 
for and believe in," he said. "It used to be that everybody knew their 
neighbors and people didn't think twice about helping each other out. I'd like 
to see that again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the praise from the Board of Supervisors, Gonzales was recently 
nominated for an award from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for his heroism.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TO APPLY FOR QUAKE-RECOVERY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the urging of Ron Brown, President Clinton's secretary of commerce, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to apply for nearly $6 
million in federal grants for businesses hurt by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard met with Brown when he visited Fillmore just after the 
Jan. 17 temblor.Brown told Howard that the Administration wanted to help the 
county, which is not only suffering from the earthquake, but is still reeling 
from the lingering effects of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the President wanted to help and asked us how much money we needed, 
and I think we said 'How much do you have?' " Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials were most interested in funneling money into a planned 
Economic Development Corporation for the county, which would encourage 
businesses to stay in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Hurricane Hugo, (Florida) lost almost 30% of their businesses, and 
that's what we all want to avoid," Howard said. "When (the federal officials) 
heard about our plans for the Economic Development Corporation, they said 
that's exactly the kind of thing they were interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said there were no guarantees that the county will receive any of the 
money, but that federal officials indicated that at least a portion of the 
grants would probably be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 If the grants are approved, the county plans to set up a revolving loan 
program for area businesses hurt by the quake. Ultimately the county wants to 
develop a long-term plan for keeping businesses as well as attracting more 
firms to the area. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SPECIALISTS CHECKING INTO VALLEY FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four specialists from the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta are 
in Ventura County to examine the high number of cases of valley fever, health 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has confirmed at least 150 cases of the disease just in the month of 
February, said Dr. Rana Hajjeh, a medical epidemiologist working on the CDC 
team.Over the last few years, Ventura County has averaged 50 cases a year, said 
Hajjeh, who attributed the outbreak to the dust stirred up by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that a valley fever outbreak has been associated with 
an earthquake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus is spread by spores from a fungus that lives in the soils of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms of the virus are much like a serious flu, Hajjeh said, and include 
chest pains, fever and aching muscles. It is rarely fatal, and in only 1% of 
the cases does the disease spread to other areas of the body, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak in Ventura County has garnered attention mostly because it is 
associated with the earthquake, Hajjeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas have been hit much harder by the disease in recent years. Kern 
County has consistently had more than 1,000 cases a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which arrived about two weeks ago, will stay in Ventura County for 
several more weeks looking for further confirmation that the outbreak was 
caused by the earthquake, Hajjeh said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; VIOLATORS OF PARKING CODE GET BRIEF 
REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Moorpark has waived fines for more than 100 residents who received 
traffic tickets for violating a new code prohibiting street parking on 
street-sweeper days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grace period will end March 14, when Moorpark Police Department 
officers will begin citing vehicles left on public streets on posted days, 
Moorpark Patrol Sgt. Keith Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents need to check the signs at the entrance streets to their 
neighborhood to see which day and time period applies to their street," Parks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new parking rules, approved in November by the Moorpark City Council, are 
intended to help the city comply with federal clean water regulations, said Ken 
Gilbert, the city's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ways to clean up pollution is to have more efficient street 
sweeping to prevent dirt from entering the storm drains," Gilbert said. "But 
before the new parking ordinance, there were areas of the city where the street 
sweepers more or less drove down the center of the road because of all the 
parked cars." 
</P>
<P>
 After an initial 60-day moratorium on citations and towing expired in 
mid-February, police began issuing citations to residents who ignored the 
posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police issued 107 tickets, 48 in the downtown area and the rest in the Peach 
Hill area, Parks said. "The signs had been up for a month, but it still caught 
some people by surprise," he said. PATRICK McCARTNEY

CONCERNS TOLD OVER MOORPARK MATH SCORES; KNOWLEDGE: OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE 
HEARTENED BY RESULTS IN READING AND WRITING, BUT NEED TO REFOCUS ON WEAK AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark school officials said Tuesday that they were heartened that test 
results showed the district performing mostly above average in reading and 
writing in all grades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the schools were typical of many throughout the state whose scores dropped 
dramatically when the California Learning Assessment System tests turned to 
mathematical questions, and Moorpark officials expressed dismay that their 
10th-graders posted abysmal scores in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take a real hard look at what we're doing in math in Moorpark," 
said Frank DePasquale, the district's assistant superintendent for instruction. 
"We will continue to do the good job we're doing in reading and writing, and we 
need to refocus now on math." 
</P>
<P>
 While Moorpark's fourth- and eighth-graders scored above and just below 
comparative districts in math, respectively, 10th-graders did far worse than 
students in similar districts. They only narrowly avoided a last-place finish 
among Ventura County districts, edging out schools in Santa Paula and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Dean, chairwoman of the high school math department, attributed the 
low scores to the fact that older students were less accustomed to taking the 
subjective math tests -- which ask students to not only get the right answer, 
but to explain how they arrived at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're talking about basically the student going through the system 
and how long they've been taught traditional methods versus how long they've 
been in this newer form of math," Dean said. "We have probably only had these 
types of questions in our curriculum for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendell Swenson, an 11th-grader who took the CLAS test last year as a 
sophomore, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd never seen questions like this before," she said. "I'd say 95% of my 
class didn't take it seriously at all. We're used to getting a question like, 
'What is 500 times 2,' and computing it and writing it on the paper. This 
forces you to analyze it and explain how you get each answer. We weren't used 
to that and we didn't want to take it seriously, for whatever reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Moorpark school officials say they will take the information generated by 
the test and refocus their attention on mathematics and better preparing 
students for the explanatory questions they will face. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a challenge," DePasquale said. "And we have to rise to that 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways that the district hopes to improve its math performance, he 
said, is through establishment this year of a curricular council that assigns 
certain administrators to specific academic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the test results were released, high school Principal Cary Dritz 
had been asked to work on the math program at both his school and Chaparral 
Middle School. Dritz has already met with teachers at both sites to discuss new 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 DePasquale said the district may also consider other ways to bolster the 
program, including assigning mentor teachers for math classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm seeing here is perhaps the need for some math mentors," he said. "(A 
mentor is) a classroom teacher who we pay an additional $4,000 a year to work 
with other teachers in specific curriculum areas." 
</P>
<P>
 According to test results, only 3% of Moorpark 10th-graders finished with a 
score of 6, 5 or 4 on the math portion of the CLAS test -- the three highest 
possible scores, while 76% were awarded only a 1 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
 A compilation of other districts around the state with similar demographics 
showed that 12% of the students in those schools wound up with one of the top 
three scores and 66% with a 1 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Allen, the district's coordinator of special education, guidance and 
testing, is scheduled to give the school board a full report on the test 
results in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the newness of the test, Allen cautioned against putting too much weight 
on the data. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time the test has been given," she said. "So you look at it 
very cautiously and you weigh the results very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, board member Tom Baldwin said he was concerned by the low math scores 
and would push for more intense instruction in math fundamentals at lower grade 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a former math teacher myself, I've found that the single most important 
thing that an elementary teacher can do to lay the groundwork for middle school 
and high school math is to teach the kids their basic math facts; that has to 
be done," said Baldwin, who taught math in Arkansas and Maryland in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see low math scores, my gut feeling is it's kids who never learned 
their basic math." 
</P>
<P>
 And while some students and teachers attribute the low scores more to the new 
testing styles than shaky fundamentals, DePasquale agreed that the district has 
to put more emphasis on math education in response to the poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to look at the facts and accept them, which is that we have a 
math program that needs to be looked into," he said. "Because compared to the 
county and the state, we did not do as well as we would have liked to have 
done, and I want to find out why that happened."

OAK PARK STUDENTS GET AN 'A' IN READING AND WRITING SKILLS; RESULTS: DISTRICT 
OFFICIALS VOICE DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THEIR STUDENTS' MATH PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oak Park Schools Supt. Marilyn Lippiatt paused with satisfaction to note the 
district's top-ranked scores in reading and writing on new state tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she shifted to the math results -- disappointing but still better than 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not satisfied with the math scores at all," Lippiatt said. "Yes, we did 
better than the state and the county did. But I say, look what we did in 
writing. Why can't we do that in math?" 
</P>
<P>
 The best isn't good enough for the affluent east Ventura County district, 
which probably -- at least in part -- explains consistently high test scores 
among its 2,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the new California Learning Assessment System tests was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a community that expects great things," said Medea Creek Middle 
School Principal Laurel Ann Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oak Park fourth-, eighth- and 10-graders handily outperformed their 
counterparts statewide and in Ventura County, Lippiatt said math scores did not 
meet the district's measure of quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully half of the Oak Park sophomores who took the test landed in the bottom 
two levels of a six-step scoring system, showing little or no understanding of 
basic math concepts. Medea Creek students fared better in math, with only 22% 
scoring in the bottom two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide averages, however, are positively dismal. There, 70% of high school 
students fell into the two lowest categories of math achievement, and 72% of 
eighth-graders slipped into the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the explanation is that the test, requiring students to work out 
problems and show how they arrive at answers, is a radical departure from the 
old multiple-choice exams, said Oak Park High School Principal Jeff Chancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real obvious that what the state is testing for in students, as far as 
the ability to analyze and solve problems, is not happening in classrooms. We 
need to change that," Chancer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were dramatically different in writing scores for Oak Park 
students, with 81% of sophomores scoring in the top three levels, along with 
65% of middle school students and 87% of fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park embarked upon many of the reforms recommended by the state several 
years ago to improve schools at all levels. As a result, the new test measuring 
students' ability to problem-solve and express themselves fell in line with 
what teachers are doing, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We measure ourselves not by what we teach, but by what students are 
learning," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle school has for years incorporated writing into nearly every course, 
even math classes where students had to write how they planned to solve 
problems before doing the computations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the strategy paid off in advanced writing skills, the school's staff 
members will look for ways to similarly expand the teaching of math outside 
math classes, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Medea Creek started a math program aimed at teaching students 
more than memorizing complicated equations and formulas. Instead, teachers find 
practical applications for abstract concepts so students know what they're 
learning, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to make it so they can see it, so it's real tangible," said 
Tracy Neitz, a math teacher who trains other districts in the techniques. "So 
often, we give them these concepts and they have no idea why they do what they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be drawing math lessons into other courses, so the students 
can't escape seeing its everyday use, Ford said. For instance, math and gym 
teachers are working to develop a fun-lesson plan for teaching students about 
percentages by having them throw Frisbees at a target. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park parents who learned of the high Oak Park test scores seemed to 
breathe a sigh of relief. They said the district's teachers deserve credit for 
taking the lead in making creative changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total vindication of restructuring," said Cindy Vinson, whose 
eighth-grade daughter attends Medea Creek. "It's what we've been working toward 
for several years." 
</P>
<P>
 Chancer, at the high school, said restructuring efforts there have moved away 
from testing students and toward requiring them to demonstrate knowledge 
through projects and performances. Such an approach pays off in the state 
learning assessment tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the tests, however, isn't to establish which school is best but 
to show schools where they need to improve, said Mike McDermit, an Oak Park 
High School English teacher who scored some of the middle school tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it can only get better," McDermit said. "If schools are pointing 
toward things they're going to improve, it doesn't matter where they are."

MATH, READING BELOW AVERAGE AS FILLMORE STUDENTS STRUGGLE WITH EXAM; CLASS: 
DISTRICT RESULTS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE OF CALIFORNIA PUPILS AS A WHOLE. 
ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT SEES A CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not only were those crazy tests last spring a waste of time, said Alicia 
Peacock, now a junior at Fillmore High School, but they asked some weird 
questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Like they wanted you to interpret literature. "In reading, they asked for 
things that weren't even there," Alicia said. "It was strange. I'm more used to 
things that are there, that you don't have to think about, where the answers 
are always in the text." 
</P>
<P>
 By her own admission, Alicia does not like to read. But she was not the only 
Fillmore student who struggled with the exams, known as the California Learning 
Assessment Systems tests.  
</P>
<P>
 From elementary through high school, Fillmore's students tested significantly 
below state averages on a rigorous new exam administered to California students 
last spring.  
</P>
<P>
 State administrators deplored how poorly California students did on the CLAS 
exams, and Fillmore students scored even lower in reading, writing and math 
skills than California students as a whole. The test was administered to 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half -- 49% -- of all Fillmore 10th-graders placed at the lowest level 
on the math test, indicating little or no grasp of basic mathematical concepts. 
Less than a third of Fillmore's fourth- and 10th-graders, and just above a 
third of the eighth-graders, demonstrated a solid understanding of texts they 
read and an ability to place what they had read within a wider context.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's assistant superintendent said he sees the district's state test 
scores as more of a challenge than as a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're better able to reach the standards, because we know what they are," 
Mario Contini said. "But of course, we're never satisfied unless all our 
students" get the highest possible scores.  
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore's high school students scored among the lowest in the district, as 
well as testing lower than any other high school students in Ventura County. 
"From what I'm seeing as far as teachers working within the (state education) 
framework, I'm surprised the students scored as low as they did," said Lynn 
Johnson, the principal at Fillmore High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she had yet to show the scores to the school's teachers or to 
really analyze them herself, so she could not say why the students tested so 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Fillmore Junior High School refused to comment on the test 
results. Fillmore eighth-graders scored below state averages on the reading, 
writing and math sections. On the math test, the eighth-graders did 
particularly poorly, with 79% of the students scoring below a basic proficiency 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 One district school where students did perform above the state average was at 
tiny Piru Elementary School, where 35% of all fourth-graders scored a four or a 
five (out of a possible six points) on the reading test. Statewide, 30% of 
fourth graders received a four or higher on the reading portion of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed," said Joanna Michel, a fourth-grade teacher at the school. "We 
must be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel and two other fourth-grade teachers had feared their students would 
fall below statewide averages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A third of all fourth-graders taking the test at Piru Elementary had only 
limited proficiency in English -- many others still spoke so little English 
that they were ineligible to participate in the exam. Furthermore, Piru 
Elementary does not ask students struggling to speak English to learn in 
English until the end of third grade or the beginning of fourth grade, so many 
students taking the test had only been studying in English for six to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of Fillmore Unified -- and state students in general -- Piru 
Elementary's downfall was the math test. Less than a third of the school's 
fourth-graders had even a partial understanding of basic math principles, and 
45% of all fourth-graders showed little or no ability to do mathematical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The three fourth-grade teachers and the school's principal said the troubles 
may be due in part to the test format, which the students were unfamiliar with 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Exam questions asked the children not just to compute problems, but to explain 
how they reached their answers and why their answers were correct. The school's 
teachers have since adopted the test's approach in their instruction of math 
and found to their surprise that it's very effective with the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I balked and said, 'Oh no, it's one more thing to correct,' " 
Michel said. "But now I think it's wonderful. Not only are you teaching 
computation, you are teaching them how to explain what's going on in their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 After some griping, the students reluctantly agree. "I liked it the other way 
better because you didn't have to write all that stuff down and because I had 
less homework," said Adrianna Jimenez, a fifth-grader at the school who said 
she remembers being stumped by the test format last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, however, Adrianna admitted that she's probably learning a lot more in 
math class this year than last. "Now, you have to pay more attention in math 
and that's important, because if you want to do something, you have to pay 
attention," she said. "Like if you want to be an accountant, you have to pay 
attention in math."

OJAI STUDENTS MAKE THE GRADE; EDUCATION: MOST PUT IN GOOD SHOWING, OWING TO 
ENGLISH SKILLS, FAMILY INCOME AND HARD WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ojai Valley students outperformed many of their counterparts across Ventura 
County on the new state assessment test administered last spring, thanks in 
part to comparatively high levels of English proficiency and high family 
incomes, test results released today suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth- and 10th-graders in the Ojai Unified School District generally are 
better readers, writers and mathematicians than most youngsters throughout the 
county and state, according to the California Learning Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 But eighth-grade students at Matilija Junior High School only barely surpassed 
their statewide counterparts in math and writing, and dipped below the state 
median in reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials relished their success so far on the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to compare to other schools so this is not a comparison, but 
we're really pleased," said Pamela Martens, assistant superintendent in charge 
of curriculum for the Ojai Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to indicate that the teachers are concentrating on implementing 
the state framework and motivating the students to enjoy reading and do a lot 
of writing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a scale of 6 to 1, with 6 being best, more than half of the district's 
students who read at elementary and high school level scored 4 or better, 
indicating that the majority of those tested possessed at least "a thoughtful 
understanding" of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have writing across the curriculum," said Michael Maez, principal at 
Nordhoff High School, where 68% of 10th-graders scored 4, 5 or 6 on the writing 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage that students do writing in every discipline -- science, social 
studies, math and, of course, the language arts," Maez said. "So it's paying 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Maez said the Nordhoff teaching staff would continue to challenge students to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had 53% of our kids in the top three areas in reading, so we want to 
bring that up," Maez said. "This is benchmark data. We will go up from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Matilija Principal James Berube was at a loss to explain how his eighth-grade 
students failed to match the progress of their older and younger schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai eighth-graders lagged the state median by 1% in reading, and bested the 
mark by just 3% in writing and 1% in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "These scores are not as high as I would like to see them," Berube said. 
"We're going to sit down and develop strategies to try and improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Berube said school officials will review the results in detail and implement a 
plan to improve test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been able to study them yet, and I don't have the detailed 
information," Berube said. "But we'll do what's necessary to improve them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One school that stood out -- even in the Ojai district -- is Topa Topa 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grade school ranks lower on the socioeconomic scale than others 
in the Ojai Valley, 70% of its students earned 4 or better on the reading test. 
That compares with just 35% of students at similar schools statewide and 54% 
among Ojai fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers worked hard, but the students worked really hard," said Chris 
Smithers, a fifth-grade teacher at Topa Topa, who taught fourth-graders last 
year. "They know it means a lot to us to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading logs and book-report tallies are posted on Smithers' classroom walls, 
with each student's progress in plain sight. However, the scrutiny does not 
seem to bother the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was easy because we learned a lot in fourth grade," said fifth-grader 
Alyson Weeces, recalling last spring's exams. "I just knew a lot of the stuff 
they had on the test." 
</P>
<P>
 Others cite an unusually strong sense of community in explaining the 
above-average scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai definitely is a cloistered community," said Dawn Gorman, a fourth-grade 
teacher at Topa Topa. "We pooled what great resources we have in this town and 
this school, and it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Gorman added, students also are pushed to consider more than the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're reading, we ask students to think about characters like a real 
person, and relate to their problems by asking what's happened in their own 
lives that's similar," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have them edit their own work, and we look for substance in what 
they're saying -- rather than have them repeat what other people are saying," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Alyson and her classmates were busy preparing for next month's 
round of CLAS tests for fifth-graders, which will focus on science and social 
studies.  
</P>
<P>
 Roque Hembree, who will celebrate his 11th birthday today, is not very worried 
about the upcoming exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope I do well," he said, heading for recess. "I did pretty well last 
year."

RAPID SHIFTS SIGNAL MAJOR QUAKE IN REGION IS LIKELY, EXPERT SAYS; SEISMOLOGY: 
SCIENTIST CALLS SANTA CLARA RIVER AND OXNARD PLAIN HOT SPOTS, ADDING THAT AREA 
IS ONE OF THE FASTEST-MOVING PARTS OF THE STATE.

 The geological plates underneath much of Ventura County are buckling and 
shifting rapidly, signaling that a major earthquake will likely hit the region, 
a seismologist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By measuring the rate at which the Earth's crust deforms, seismologists can 
identify which pockets of California are most vulnerable to earthquakes, 
Caltech scientist Kate Hutton told the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County, especially along the Santa Clara River and through the Oxnard 
Plain, qualifies as one of these hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seismologists have had their eyes on the Ventura basin," Hutton said during 
Tuesday's presentation designed to inform residents about the potential for 
future earthquakes. "We can see that it's one of the fastest-moving parts of 
California, shrinking in a north-south direction. That pattern should have 
earthquakes accompanying it in the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 While the imprecision of words such as long term might frustrate shaky 
residents, Hutton said she simply could not offer detailed predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did say seismologists had reached a consensus that "sometime in our 
lifetime we expect to see a magnitude-8 quake on the San Andreas Fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, she noted that "there's still a lot of stress to be relieved" by 
earth movement in a fan-shaped swath of land stretching from the western San 
Fernando Valley up through Simi Valley. Many of the aftershocks following 
January's 6.8-magnitude temblor have been centered in that region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershock sequence is certainly not over," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting wryly on the vague language of seismologists, she added: "One 
hundred years is an important time scale for urban planners, but it's not 
necessarily useful for people planning their vacations." 
</P>
<P>
 Because her specialty is seismology -- measuring and studying earthquakes -- 
Hutton could not answer council members' questions about the geology and soil 
composition in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 She could say only that several active faults lie underneath the Conejo 
Valley. Other fault lines thrusting from the ocean toward Point Mugu and Malibu 
could endanger Thousand Oaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a seismically active area, so it's best to be prepared for an 
earthquake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To start her presentation, Hutton showed dozens of slides detailing 
devastation from the Northridge earthquake that struck before dawn Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the dramatic photos -- of collapsed buildings, ruptured freeways and 
sagging garages -- came from Thousand Oaks. But several illustrated possible 
dangers should a future earthquake hit closer to the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One slide, for example, showed an expensive home with a tiled roof that 
crashed to the ground during the heavy shaking. Many Thousand Oaks homes and 
businesses have red-tile roofs similar to the house in the photo. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, Building and Safety Director Barry Branagan told the council that 
homeowners with tiled roofs should expect some breakage during earthquakes. 
Most roof tiles are designed with an interlocking grid system, where the tiles 
click together but are not nailed down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is no such thing as a house that's earthquake-proof," Branagan 
said. "That would be almost impossible to design. The whole idea is that the 
house will not collapse and, after the initial shaking stops, the residents can 
exit safely if need be." 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness of interlocking roof tiles was especially apparent in the 
northern end of Thousand Oaks, which suffered the most damage in January's 
quake, Branagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, city building inspectors declared 10 homes unsafe, slapping them with 
red tags warning residents not to enter until the damage is repaired. An 
additional 174 homes received yellow tags, indicating limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Branagan said his inspectors have looked at 1,300 homes in the past 2 1/2 
months. Requests for inspections are still coming in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to schedule an open forum in the next few weeks for 
quake-shaken residents to voice concerns and frustrations. Branagan and City 
Atty. Mark Sellers will be on hand to answer questions about building codes, 
inspection practices and legal recourse in the case of faulty construction.

SOBBING VICTIM DESCRIBES ROBBERY, RAPE IN SATTIEWHITE MURDER TRIAL; CRIME: SHE 
APPEARS AS A WITNESS IN PENALTY PHASE FOLLOWING THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTION OF A 
1992 SLAYING. DEFENSE ATTORNEY CONTENDS HIS CLIENT'S PROBLEMS STEM FROM BRAIN 
DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sobbing, shaken 21-year-old woman told a jury in graphic detail on Tuesday 
how she was robbed and raped at gunpoint by a death-penalty defendant and two 
accomplices in September, 1992 -- a night she and her boyfriend were trying to 
relax on an Oxnard beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point the woman, now a Thousand Oaks resident, described how the men 
forced a blanket over her head and raped her at gunpoint in the presence of her 
boyfriend. A gun was also pointed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying to God," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was the first witness in the penalty phase of Christopher J. 
Sattiewhite's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the jury convicted Sattiewhite, 24, of first-degree murder in the 
1992 shooting death of Genoveva Gonzalez, a mother of four. It now has the 
option of sending him to the gas chamber or sentencing him to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 During opening statements, defense attorneys acknowledged that Sattiewhite was 
present during the rape and robbery of the Thousand Oaks woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyer Willard P. Wiksell contended that his client did not 
actively participate in the beach rape and that the defendant's criminal 
problems stem from two factors that are out of his control. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Wiksell said, Sattiewhite had a domineering father who abandoned the 
family when his mother delivered her 10th baby. And second, his mother was in a 
car wreck just days before giving birth to him, leaving Sattiewhite with 
permanent brain damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake that hit him was worse than the earthquake that hit 
Northridge, ladies and gentlemen," Wiksell told jurors. He said the panel 
should decide on the lesser penalty for Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Glynn said that Sattiewhite should be given a 
date with California's gas chamber. He also said the beach rape and the 
Gonzalez murder illustrate that Sattiewhite is a violent criminal, an element 
that would allow the jury to send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people will ask you to make the finding that the appropriate penalty and 
punishment for Christopher Sattiewhite is death," Glynn said during his opening 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic moments of the trial by far came Tuesday when the Thousand 
Oaks woman was ushered into the courtroom to face one of her attackers in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite was convicted of two counts each of rape and robbery in December, 
1992, in the beach case and is serving a 28-year sentence, prosecutors said. 
His two accomplices, Bobby Rollins and Frederick Jackson, were convicted of the 
same offenses and are also in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men pleaded guilty and never went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After the men's arrest, Ventura County sheriff's investigators linked them to 
the Gonzalez rape and murder, which had gone unsolved for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim of the Oxnard beach rape sobbed as she entered the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She wiped tears away with a tissue and told the jury her story from the time 
she and her boyfriend arrived at the beach that night. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her boyfriend, now her husband, were approached by the 
suspects and were forced to give them their car keys, money and jewelry. She 
was too nervous to take off all her jewelry, she said, because she saw that one 
of the attackers had a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect raided the couple's car, which was parked at the beach. The 
suspects threatened to kill the couple, even though all their demands were 
being met. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the men asked the others to leave, she said, another announced that 
he was going to rape her. She was raped by two of the men, she said, as her 
boyfriend was trying to shield the top part of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the couple were ordered to run as fast as they could to their car. "I 
thought they were going to shoot us from behind," she said under questioning 
from Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia M. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said that a DNA analysis proved that Rollins -- who testified against 
Sattiewhite in the Gonzalez case -- and Jackson raped the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said he plans to put Gonzalez's 69-year-old mother and 12-year-old son 
on the witness stand. The relatives will testify about the impact of Gonzalez's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a previous drug conviction, Gonzalez, Glynn said, "was a kind and 
loving mother" who often baked cookies for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell accused the prosecution of giving a partial portrayal of Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before Sattiewhite was born, Wiksell said, his mother was involved in a 
car accident that left her son with brain damage. And Wiksell said Sattiewhite 
was abused as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wiksell, Sattiewhite still has a difficult time understanding 
complicated thoughts, and that is what allowed accomplice Rollins to manipulate 
him in the beach rape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to learn that the defendant is a follower. That he is easily 
manipulated," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said that Sattiewhite readily admitted his involvement in the 
beach-rape case, although he didn't sexually assault the woman, and received a 
20-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 "He 'fessed up to it," Wiksell said. "He didn't fight the system. He's not a 
hardened criminal."

 He said several psychologists will testify that Sattiewhite has "borderline 
mental retardation due to chronic brain syndrome." The cause, he said, was the 
car crash 24 years ago.

 Testimony continues today at 10 a.m. in Judge Lawrence Storch's courtroom in 
the Ventura County Courthouse.

OXNARD COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS TO CSU AVERAGE BETTER GRADES, STUDY SAYS; 
EDUCATION: BUT THEY TEND TO DROP OUT MORE THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM MOORPARK 
AND VENTURA COLLEGES, A DISTRICT REPORT CONCLUDES. OFFICIALS DISPUTE THE 
FINDINGS.

 Oxnard College students who transfer to a California State University tend to 
get better grades than their counterparts from Moorpark and Ventura colleges, a 
new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 However, overall, more Oxnard College students drop out of a CSU school during 
their first year than do transfers from the other two Ventura County colleges, 
according to the study released last month by the Ventura County Community 
College District.  
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by a district researcher from data released by the Cal State system, 
the study shows that 21% of Oxnard College students who entered a CSU school in 
the fall semester of 1991 dropped out by the end of the 1992 spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to 12% of Moorpark College transfers, 10% of Ventura College 
transfers, and 11% of community college transfers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 But those Oxnard College students who remained through the end of the 1992 
spring semester had a combined grade-point average of 2.97 -- or nearly a B 
average. In contrast, Ventura College transfers averaged a 2.93 GPA and 
Moorpark College transfers and community college students statewide averaged a 
2.85 GPA.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College administrators and teachers -- despite the college's good 
showing in the GPA category -- quickly criticized the study as superficial, 
incomplete and statistically skewed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The faculty at Oxnard College aren't very pleased about it," said Gary 
Morgan, head of the college's Academic Senate. "Things are better at Oxnard 
College than the report shows, and certainly miles better than the report's 
suggestion that our . . . retention rate is poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Ramirez, an Oxnard College counselor and the college's transfer center 
coordinator, faulted the report for presenting statistics in a sociological 
vacuum. "There are so many reasons (for the college's transfer retention rate), 
and the report doesn't say any of them," he said. "It's incomplete."  
</P>
<P>
 Some former Oxnard College students, however, say that while they personally 
don't know any transfer students who dropped out of a CSU school, entering a 
Cal State University after two or more years at the more intimate Oxnard 
College campus proved quite a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "My major problem is the classes are harder here," said Danny Daft, 23, an 
Oxnard College transfer student now studying biology at San Diego State 
University. "Here, you really have to put in hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Daft said he and his roommate, who transferred from a Northern California 
community college, initially found San Diego State intimidating because of its 
size and academic demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier at community colleges than it is at the Cal States," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mylene Amaba, 22, who transferred to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last fall from 
Oxnard College, said she felt Oxnard College did not prepare her for a Cal 
State University as well as another Ventura County college might have. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaba took some classes at Ventura College before she transferred to Cal Poly, 
though most of her transcript was from Oxnard College. "Ventura College seemed 
a lot more challenging to me," she said. "The classes were harder. Oxnard 
College felt almost like high school, and I know high school didn't prepare me 
that well for college." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Inouye, the district researcher who prepared the district's transfer 
report, said the study was never meant to be a final statement on transfer 
students, but rather a jumping-off point for district staff.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look at the entire transfer picture," she said. She noted that the 
study, for instance, lacks data on transfers to other universities. "But at 
least it's one more piece of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College officials said they were pleased with the report and said it 
reflected their hard work and that of other community college staff statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College officials said the study only had value in a general sense, 
dismissing yearly data swings as statistical vagaries of limited importance.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really worry too much about it," said Steven Pollack, president of 
the Moorpark College Academic Senate. "The state community college system is 
clearly preparing students for a transfer, and that's what I take away from 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Cal State University system regularly releases transfer data, this 
is the first time in recent years the district has had a researcher available 
to crunch the numbers and present local data in a readable form.  
</P>
<P>
 Inouye, the coordinator of institutional research at Ventura College, is on 
loan to the district office for the academic year to work on this and other 
projects. Inouye said she used figures from the 1991-92 school year because 
they were the most recent available when she began to analyze the data in early 
fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other findings, the study shows that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark College students make up 47% of the district's transfer population, 
although they account for only 38% of the approximately 27,000 students 
enrolled in the district. Oxnard College students make up 11% of transfers and 
21% of district enrollment, while Ventura College students represent 42% of the 
transfers and 41% of the district enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ventura County district sent 736 students to CSU campuses in 1991-92. Of 
those, 306 were from Ventura College, 84 were from Oxnard College, and 346 were 
from Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 * The majority of local community college students transferring to the CSU 
system chose Cal State Northridge: 48% of Moorpark College transfers, 66% of 
Oxnard College transfers, and 43% of Ventura College transfers.  
</P>
<P>
 But despite the myriad of statistics and charts the report contains, the 
controversy, at least at Oxnard College, has revolved around retention and 
transfer rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1975, Oxnard College is the newest and has by far the smallest 
enrollment of all three colleges in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty and administrators at the college until recently complained that the 
5,900-student campus received too little district funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A new funding formula adopted by the district in recent years allocates more 
funding to Oxnard College than it had previously received. 
</P>
<P>
 Old complaints, however, still flare up occasionally. Oxnard College faculty 
members this month argued that the transfer study was another example of the 
district's anti-Oxnard bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of faculty have that feeling, and something like this further justifies 
their position," said Alan Hayashi, a math instructor. "We look at this study 
and we think, 'We're not bad, but the district has to do something to make us 
look bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye said she was surprised at the Oxnard College reaction, though she knows 
that research results can often make people upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really very much aware of people's apprehension to research information, 
so I tried to be particularly careful to present the facts and not editorialize 
at all," she said. "I really didn't think this was negative to Oxnard College."

OXNARD POLICE TAKE BEAT TO THE AIRWAVES; TELEVISION: WEEKLY CABLE PROGRAM ON 
CRIME PREVENTION HAS ATTRACTED NATIONAL ACCLAIM. SOME CREDIT THE SHOW AS A 
FACTOR IN THE CITY'S CRIME DROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's two minutes to air time, and Oxnard Police Officer Peter Freiberg has a 
shiny face. A young woman appears from behind the set and hurriedly powders his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to ruin your reputation as a tough guy," she teases. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime Prevention Analyst David Keith adjusts his wireless microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good evening, and welcome to 'Street Beat,' " he practices in a smooth 
baritone. 
</P>
<P>
 "One minute!" a voice yells from the control room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if you start to perspire, use this," the makeup woman instructs 
Freiberg, handing him a tissue. "Blot, don't wipe." 
</P>
<P>
 The rock-inspired promo music plays and the camera zooms in on Keith, who 
smiles and welcomes viewers to 90 minutes of discussion about crime in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Monday night at 8, Keith and members of the Oxnard Police Department 
take to the airwaves with their weekly televised talk show, "Street Beat." The 
glossy program is part of an effort to curb offenses in Ventura County's most 
crime-plagued city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say the 9-year-old program is teaching Oxnard residents how 
not to be victims and has contributed to the city's drop in crime in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely important tool," said Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt. 
"After we highlight a community, history has shown crime has gone down 
tremendously in that neighborhood because people are more alert." 
</P>
<P>
 While several community leaders praise the program, some say it cannot take 
the place of putting more officers on the street and increasing citizen 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith and Hurtt are regulars on "Street Beat," which is televised live in 
English every Monday night and in Spanish every other Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The format is simple: Keith tells his television audience about current crime 
trends in the Oxnard area and facilitates discussion among law enforcement 
officials on crime-prevention techniques. Then, Keith, Hurtt, Cmdr. Tom Cady 
and a guest police officer field calls from viewers. Twice a month the 
English-language show focuses on a specific neighborhood in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The program costs the department nothing, Keith said, because it is produced 
by Jones Intercable as a community service. Occasionally, the department spends 
small amounts on advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, for example, the department distributed 900 flyers in the Bartolo 
neighborhood, hoping to lure a larger audience for a program focusing on that 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say this was a pretty well-advertised program," said Mike Coz, chairman 
of the Bartolo Neighborhood Council. Coz, who attended the show's filming, said 
police blanketed the community with flyers, but he was unsure whether many 
residents tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope so, but I feel that everything that was said had been said 
before," he said. "The program is kind of a fluffy presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Coz said, the show helps to ease people's concerns. "Mostly, it gives 
us a good feeling that the Police Department and city are making a sincere 
effort to help the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Trent, chairwoman for the Southwinds Neighborhood Council, said she 
agreed the program is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the community a chance to hear exactly what is going on in their 
neighborhood," said Trent, a frequent viewer of the show. "I think it gives 
people a faith in David Keith -- this is a real person that they get to know 
through television. I think that anything that helps the community have a 
better relationship with the Police Department is real important." 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents said the show is only part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never watched the program, I've heard about it," said Charles Olson, 
patrol leader for the Lemonwood Neighborhood Watch. "I say the watch patrols 
are what's making the crime go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Stewart Mimm said he likes the show, but believes more needs 
to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of a hard-nosed old-timer. I want our Police Department to enforce 
the law in a more forceful way," Mimm said. "I think our city still has too 
much crime."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said he'd like to see the police take a more personal approach to crime 
prevention, such as going to schools and getting more involved in the 
community. "The police have to go into the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt said he would love to visit every Oxnard resident personally and hear 
his or her concerns. But since that is physically impossible, he said, 
communication through television is the next best option. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt that if I could sit down with you for 90 minutes and tell 
you how to stay personally safe, . . . I know that I could make you a safer 
person," he said. "What we do in essence every Monday night is go one-on-one 
for 90 minutes with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Gallardo, who has been directing the show since 1986, said the program 
averages 15 to 20 calls a night. Typically, callers are homeowners, and most 
are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's older women ages 40 to 80. We get a lot of concerns from elderly 
ladies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for "Street Beat," came to Keith nine years ago, when he was teaching 
crime prevention techniques to various Oxnard service groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then I was doing 200 public presentations a year," Keith said. "Whatever 
(organization) there is out there, I'd spoken to it. One morning back in 1985 I 
thought: It's too bad I can't figure out how to give this speech to everyone at 
one time. Well, television is the best way to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith approached Jones Intercable, which agreed to carry the show as a public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood up back then. My knees were knocking and I had a map behind me on an 
easel," Keith said. Since then, he added, "things have evolved into a slightly 
more sophisticated form." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Keith and the officers sit around a green faux-marble table with matching 
faux-marble pillars looming behind them. A colorful graphic map of the 
neighborhood being discussed has replaced Keith's crude paper and easel. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other Ventura County city -- Thousand Oaks, which is patrolled by 
sheriff's deputies -- has had a program similar to "Street Beat." But Thousand 
Oaks' "Crime Scene," which began in 1991, was put on hold recently while the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department works on a new format modeled after the 
commercial TV show "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 "Street Beat" recently became a source of fame for the Oxnard department, 
which has been recognized across the nation for high-tech crime prevention 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The National League of Cities presented Oxnard with an Innovation Award for 
"Street Beat" in December. It was one of seven U. S. communities honored for 
local government criminal justice programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we won this thing we've had 150 police departments from around the 
country calling us," Keith said. "It's been unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Lancaster to Manitoba, Canada, have called Keith inquiring 
about the show, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," Keith said. "Maybe there is a little pride involved, but I'm very 
proud of what we've done here."

DISPUTED LOW-INCOME APARTMENT COMPLEX DEBATED; OXNARD: DEVELOPER OF PROPOSED 
32-UNIT PROJECT SEEKS TO DISPEL CONCERNS RAISED BY NEIGHBORS BY TAKING STEPS TO 
MINIMIZE NOISE AND PROVIDE FOR RESIDENTS' SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday discussed building a 32-unit, low-income 
apartment house in the city's downtown district, a project that provoked 
neighbors' complaints about potential increases in noise, traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million development, proposed by the Cabrillo Economic Development 
Corp., is designed to replace housing demolished by the city as part of its 
downtown redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 supporters and critics of the project squared off Tuesday in a 
heated debate over whether the complex should be allowed in downtown Oxnard. 
The council had not reached a decision by press time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have designed what we believe to be a high-quality development with open 
space, recreation facilities and built with quality materials," Cabrillo's 
executive director, Rodney Fernandez, told council members. "We believe this 
project will be something the city will be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of a nearby mobile-home park and owners of a neighboring motel 
opposed the project, saying it was incompatible with their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in the 32 units will be stacked on top of each other like 
sardines," nearby resident Consuelo Gersten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo representatives have met with nearby residents and business owners in 
recent weeks to try to show the positive aspects of their project. But Cabrillo 
has had little success. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a letter to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
from the owners of the Regal Lodge motel prompted the federal agency to 
temporarily withhold $263,000 that the city had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners questioned the safety of the proposed apartment site, saying 
children would be forced to cross busy Oxnard Boulevard on their way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Cabrillo officials said children living at Villa Solimar 
would instead attend Cesar E. Chavez School, so they would not be required to 
cross Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Manager Karen Flock said she was confident that HUD officials would 
eventually approve the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials met with project critics twice since the Feb. 1 meeting and 
agreed to change certain elements of the complex to address concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize noise from the apartments, Cabrillo agreed to reduce the number of 
windows facing the Royal Palms Mobile Home Park, use double-glazed windows and 
replace railings with solid walls on the apartment balconies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials disputed fears that the high-density housing project would 
boost crime in the downtown area, but agreed to install three security gates to 
control access to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flock said the presence of an on-site manager, together with the addition of 
32 families to the neighborhood, would actually serve to reduce crime by 
increasing the number of residents participating in a Neighborhood Watch 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Others spoke in support of the project. Sister Carmen Rodriguez of St. John's 
Community Outreach Project said the affordable housing was sorely needed in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the alternative?" she asked. "I see families living in run-down, 
substandard conditions. Families living in garages with no electricity and no 
running water. I think we need to take a risk sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 But those sentiments failed to sway mobile-home residents and owners of the 
Regal Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planning a residential complex in an industrial and commercial area is not 
good planning," said Clifford Brown, a resident of Royal Palms. "It will be an 
island." 
</P>
<P>
 The project would replace 77 units of housing that the city has removed from 
the downtown redevelopment area. State law requires cities to replace such 
housing within four years, and Oxnard is approaching the deadline with no other 
replacement housing on the horizon, city officials said.

VENTURA OKS HIRING OF ECONOMIC CONSULTANT; BUSINESS: THE SEVEN COUNCIL MEMBERS 
DIFFER OVER THE JOB DESCRIPTION, BUT DIRECT STAFF TO SEEK PROPOSALS. THEY AGREE 
TO TRY OUT THE POSITION FOR A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Ventura City Council early Tuesday agreed to hire an economic consultant 
to act as a business booster, but council members can't agree on what exactly 
the new employee's duties should be. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, council members have debated whether to hire an economic 
development consultant, but all seven council members have differing ideas on 
the job description. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who pushed hardest for hiring a consultant, 
persuaded most of her colleagues early Tuesday to agree on a yearlong trial for 
the position. Ventura is the only large city in the county that does not have 
an economic development consultant or staff person on the city payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders voted 6 to 1 to direct the city manager to solicit proposals from 
prospective consultants and come back to the council in a month with a 
recommendation on whom to hire for the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be able to design a job description," Measures said, based on the 
proposals that are submitted by people interested in the position. Measures, 
who advocated hiring a consultant during her campaign, said she has not even 
decided precisely what the consultant will do. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the council is also undecided. Some say the consultant should 
concentrate on recruiting companies. A few say the economic coordinator should 
worry about keeping businesses from moving out of Ventura. Others say the 
consultant could act as an ombudsman and help businesses get the necessary 
licenses and permits they need from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who cast the dissenting vote, said other groups in the 
community -- such as the Ventura Chamber of Commerce, the Ventura Visitors and 
Convention Bureau and the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. -- already 
perform many of the functions that a consultant would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a fad," said Tuttle, owner of a small business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford also expressed doubts before voting to approve the pilot 
program. A year may be too short a time for any big changes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to say, 'By golly, we did something for economic 
development,' but I don't think it's going to be significant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council did not discuss how much money the consultant would be paid, and 
Baker said the amount would probably be suggested by the consultant. The 
council has received one unsolicited proposal that asks for $6,000 for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders said they are happy that Ventura is getting more aggressive 
about wooing business, but criticized the council's action Tuesday as too 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
 "The position is needed. They talk about hiring someone, but they still seem 
to be wallowing in what this someone will do," said Bob Alviani, president of 
the Ventura Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Alviani said the consultant should focus on persuading companies to move to 
the area. Chamber officials are drafting a job description for the position and 
will submit it to city officials next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at someone who is going to go outside of the county and bring 
something back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council allocated money in the 1993-94 budget for such a 
position, but never filled it, partly because of a hiring freeze. The annual 
salary ranged from $46,876 to $62,814. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Everett Millais said the position was not 
filled because the council couldn't decide on the job description last year 
either.

CHILDREN PROTEST AT DISNEY STUDIO; LAND: TOPANGA CANYON GROUP OPPOSES PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT. BUT COMPANY'S LINK TO PLAN IS CALLED REMOTE AT BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dozens of Topanga Canyon schoolchildren and their parents took up placards 
Tuesday and marched outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank to protest a luxury 
housing project and golf course proposed for their rural community. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, they were in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has nothing to do with the project," said Bob Wilson, president of the 
partnership proposing the project called Canyon Oaks Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 A more accurate target for the 50 or so placard-waving junior activists would 
have been a nondescript office building in North Hollywood -- not under the 
ersatz palm trees and gargantuan statuary dwarfs that grace the Walt Disney 
Co.'s Burbank headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the adult protesters acknowledged that the Disney connection to the 
project was remote at best and the picketing largely symbolic. "But it would 
have taken a lot more explaining to the kids," said Jennifer Strom, a parent 
who helped organize the protest against a plan to develop 97 luxury home sites 
and a golf course on 257 acres at the top of Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks Estates is at the center of the longest-running land-use dispute 
in Los Angeles County history. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take a 
final vote on the project Thursday, ending a divisive 15-year battle of 
personal smears and innuendo between opponents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the campaign to kill the project included the children's march and 
their signs depicting Disney cartoon characters with fangs and slogans such as 
"Don't Mickey Mouse With Our Mountains." How they ended up in front of Disney's 
headquarters is a story almost as complicated as the saga of the project's 
tortuous history. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is owned by the Lund Family Trust, which was set up by the late 
Sharon Disney Lund to provide income for her family. Lund was a daughter of the 
late Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, in turn, had set up an investment company to support his heirs called 
Retlaw Enterprises Inc. (Retlaw is Walter spelled backward.) A vice president 
of the North Hollywood-based Retlaw is also president of the Canyon Oaks 
Estates limited partnership, although the two are distinct corporations, both 
from each other and from the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the children and their parents said they wanted to send a message to 
Disney heirs that they have greater public obligations than the average 
entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children of Walt Disney have inherited tremendous wealth from this 
company," project opponent Susan Nissman said outside the Disney compound on 
Alameda Street. "They have a social responsibility to the right thing with that 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Charlie McLaughlin argued that he was under direct orders from 
Lund to develop plans that were sensitive both to the environment and the 
surrounding community. He said he has fulfilled that obligation, even though 
some residents continue to oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the critics is 10-year-old Morley Strom. "I think they shouldn't do 
this," she said. "They're being grouches. I would like it to be a state park, 
definitely. I've taken hikes there and it's like a jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she thought the children understood the issues at play, Nissman 
responded: "Topanga 8- and 9-year-olds are pretty hip."

MISSING FEMA INSPECTOR SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What has become of FEMA Inspector Robert Francis Fisher? 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old construction worker and building inspector left his Oakland 
home for Los Angeles several weeks ago to help inspect houses damaged in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. He even "met a girl" on one inspection tour, whom he later 
took out to dinner, and bought a fishing pole at a neighborhood yard sale, his 
brother said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Fisher has gone, disappeared without a trace, and his brother and the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons Unit are looking for him. 
Fisher was last seen by colleagues on Tuesday evening of last week when he was 
heading for his room at the Comfort Inn at 8647 Sepulveda Blvd. in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As the days turned into a week Tuesday, his brother and police said they were 
beginning to fear the worst. Fisher's rental car is gone too, and so is his 
cellular phone and government-issued portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or four days ago, I was hoping he was having fun. But that would come 
to an end," said Fisher's brother, Rodney, 31, who also left Oakland on Feb. 12 
to make some money as a contract inspector for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. "It's been seven days. I just don't know. I'm worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher had just joined a company known as Suncoast Associates Inc. of Edmonds, 
Wash., when he was sent to Los Angeles on Feb. 5 for quake duty. His brother 
was sent to Los Angeles a week later, and said the two kept in touch every day. 
When Rodney Fisher returned to Los Angeles on Wednesday after several days back 
home in Oakland, he said no one had seen his brother for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more troubling, he said, was that the daily calls and messages had 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he would have called me," Rodney Fisher said. "He left all his 
clothes. I don't think he has anything except the clothes on his back." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his brother's disappearance, Rodney Fisher has spent hours working the 
phones and knocking on doors in search of him. Over the weekend, he and his two 
brothers-in-law, both of whom were sharing Fisher's motel room and working for 
FEMA too, scoured the areas where Fisher had last inspected houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all remember him," Rodney Fisher said of the people he visited, "but 
they haven't heard from him since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the neighborhoods were in South-Central Los Angeles, areas where 
Rodney Fisher said danger appeared to lurk on every street corner. He described 
his brother as somewhat naive, a loquacious and friendly man who wouldn't 
hesitate to talk to anybody he met during his work or travels, no matter the 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area he's (working) in, he didn't have a problem with the violence there. 
It was nothing to him. He'd just go over there and do his job and come back," 
Rodney Fisher said. "I went there over the weekend and some guys looked at me 
like they wanted to take my head off. I wouldn't work there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fisher fears someone may have taken advantage of his brother's 
friendliness, and that perhaps foul play was involved. He said his brother did 
not drink, do drugs or have a gambling problem. Even if Robert Fisher were the 
type to buy drugs, his brother said, he would never put himself in jeopardy by 
buying them from strangers in a dangerous neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher had already cashed his paycheck when he was last seen at 9 p.m. March 
1. He was staying in his brother's motel room for a few days while Rodney was 
up north, because there were three other people in his own room. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the last time anyone talked to him," Rodney Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Raynette Sincosky of the LAPD's Missing Persons Unit said nothing in 
Fisher's past gives authorities any reason to think he's the type to disappear 
on his own accord. But she said police also have checked the morgue, as many of 
the 250 or so local hospitals that they could, and even that vast repository of 
the wounded and the dead -- County-USC Medical Center -- to see if Fisher has 
shown up as an unidentified John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 They found nothing, she said.

PAROLEE'S LAWYER ARGUES CASE OF WRONG IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguing mistaken identity, the lawyer for a prison parolee accused of 
murdering an armored-car guard asked a jury to reject the testimony of an 
eyewitness and acquit his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hill, who is defending Sean Darnell Slade, compared his case to that of 
a sensational 1989 slaying in which an innocent man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, accused in the 1992 slaying of a security guard in a robbery of a Home 
Depot store in San Fernando, was "fingered" by the mother of a man who Slade 
killed in 1987, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of manslaughter in the killing of Howard Baker, Slade, now 27, was 
paroled from prison only 25 days before guard Edwin Maldonado was killed. He 
faces the death penalty if convicted in the guard's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade was arrested after investigators developed a composite drawing, and 
Elizabeth Floyd, Baker's mother, called police to report that Slade was the man 
wanted in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill used the slaying of an affluent Boston attorney and her unborn baby as an 
example of the injustice he says his client suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Stuart initially told police that a black male had shot his wife, 
Carol, an attorney, in the head and him in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bennett was arrested after a massive manhunt. Bennett had a criminal 
record, but he maintained that he was framed. Bennett was never formally 
charged in the killing and was vindicated when Stuart's brother gave 
information to police indicating Stuart was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade and Bennett both have criminal records, and in each case, police were 
under intense pressure from a "public clamoring for justice," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill emphasized Slade's claim that he was running errands at the time of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also attacked the sole eyewitness to the crime, an 
employee of the hardware store. The clerk told police the gunman was 5-foot-9, 
5 inches shorter than Slade, Hill told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas called Slade and his alibi witnesses a group of 
liars. "Don't let yourself be haunted by the ghost of a man wrongly convicted," 
Jonas said. "In this case, it's an unreal dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury will begin deliberations today.

SCENE STEALERS; IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER THE FILM AND 
TELEVISION INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing come-hither smiles and rose-colored sunglasses, representatives from 
Thailand to Pittsburgh descended on Santa Monica last week, hoping to snatch a 
piece of L.A.'s signature film and television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They had their work cut out for them. Anyone venturing outside the annual 
location expo quickly encountered the sparkling Pacific Ocean, temperatures 
approaching 80 degrees and maybe even a celebrity or two. Southern California, 
for all its recent misfortunes, still looked every bit the glamour capital of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful -- I rented a convertible," a partially thawed convention 
official from New York marveled. But none of that was enough to keep boosters 
of frozen flatlands, crime-plagued cities and developing countries from making 
a grab for Tinseltown's tarnished crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed into the Santa Monica Convention Center, nearly 200 exhibitors spent 
three days at Location Expo '94, which ended Monday, pitching their locales as 
ideal for movie and TV production. 
</P>
<P>
 They insisted they came not to steal jobs from the Los Angeles area, as some 
local officials claimed, but to attract so-called "location" work that would be 
done outside of Southern California anyway. Whatever their motives, the 
delegates hawked their respective homes with a fervor that, despite the slick 
brochures and sweet financial inducements, sometimes seemed strained. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the sales job confronting North Dakota, which hopes to capitalize on 
its status as the nation's leading sunflower and rapeseed producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just huge fields of the stuff," enthused Kip Stolberg of the North 
Dakota Film Office, pointing to the potential for "panoramic crop shots" near 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 He also zealously promoted a defunct missile bunker as an ideal sci-fi movie 
set. But as the convention wound down, it became clear that North Dakota had a 
visibility problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walk by here and say, 'Oh, North Dakota,' " Stolberg grumbled. "It's 
like an afterthought. Some of these areas are just screaming to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, representatives from almost every corner of the planet showed up in 
Santa Monica screaming to be used, which helps explain why the exposition -- 
sponsored by the Assn. of Film Commissioners International -- is the largest 
event of its kind anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show attracted 6,000 people, many of them producer-types based on the 
Westside. It was one of the major events associated with the American Film 
Market, a nine-day spree of movie marketing that attracts 10,000 visitors 
annually, injecting millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For Santa Monica, still recovering from the Jan. 17 earthquake, the timing 
couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 "February was a rough month," said Kathleen Rawson of the city's Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. "With the AFM coming into town, it filled our hotels 
again, and they needed it. For them it was the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 For television and movie producers, meanwhile, the convention provides a way 
to scour the world for film locales without leaving the confines of the 
Convention Center. For localities, it's a chance to compete for a slice of a 
$4-billion industry that tends to be clean, prestigious and increasingly 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah alone, for example, the industry now pumps $88 million a year into the 
state, up from $38 million just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials estimate that such location shooting represents a $1 
billion drain on the local economy, but that is of little concern to far-flung 
convention delegates who have their own interests to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure on Missouri described the Show Me State as "Your 69,674-Square-Mile 
Back Lot," while Louisiana officials peppered their PR with complimentary grab 
bags of Cajun spices and other indigenous goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're one of the few states that has really good swamps," boasted David 
Jones, director of the Louisiana Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still reeling from its much-publicized string of calamities, and from a 
lingering perception that it isn't business-friendly, Los Angeles was fair 
game. It was denied exhibit space after failing to register for the expo in 
time, forcing angry and chagrined city officials to pitch a promotional tent on 
the grounds of the adjacent county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Convention Center, rival delegations smelled blood. "After 
California's disasters (fires, earthquakes, mudslides, etc.), we're getting a 
lot of calls," said Karen Runtel of the Oregon Film Office.

DANA PARSONS: THE VERDICT IS STILL OUT ON WOULD-BE JUROR'S ABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early morning sky was steely gray, just like my attitude. After 25 years 
as an adult, finally, a summons to serve as a potential juror. Seldom have 
citizen and civic responsibility been better matched. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving toward the courthouse in Westminster, wave after wave of heightened 
discernment and reasoning power coursed through my body. Or, possibly, it was 
that feeling you get when you haven't had breakfast. Either way, my stomach was 
churning. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking from the parking lot toward the courthouse and mingling with the other 
potential jurors streaming in, I tried to conceal my exhilaration. It felt much 
like the first day of school with new classmates. We would all start off as 
equals, and yet I could only chuckle as I surmised that few if any of them 
could use the phrase ipse dixit in a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the looks on my fellow jurors when I spring that on them during 
deliberations! 
</P>
<P>
 We went into an assembly room for general instructions. There appeared to be 
about 125 of us and I began sizing up the competition, looking both for 
potential foremen and those who could be swayed. I started with the row in 
front of me: sheep, control freak, sheep, control freak, sheep, sheep, sheep . 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 We watched a film on the jury system. When it was over, a court officer asked 
if anyone had any questions. A man raised his hand and said the coffee machine 
in the back of the room was out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9:30, my group was dispatched to Courtroom 16. Judge Thomas Borris 
introduced us to to the attorneys and to the defendant, charged with drug 
possession. The defendant stood, turned to face us and waved. I made a mental 
note not to let that affect my judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some potential jurors were excused for medical or financial hardships. From 
the remaining group of about 50 or so, 12 were picked by lot to sit in the jury 
box as the first potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 I spotted at least four that I might replace, if fate would only be so kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge spent the rest of the morning quizzing the 12 about their attitudes 
on drugs, law enforcement and the American judicial system. That did nothing 
but reinforce in my mind that I belonged on that jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, a juror was dismissed -- a young woman who admitted she would have 
difficulty being impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk read a replacement name: mine. 
</P>
<P>
 We had just a few minutes before lunch. I leveled with the judge, telling him 
I had written one column about drug legalization, that special-interest drug 
groups had subsequently sent me information and that, oh yeah, a colleague told 
me recently that at least two deputy district attorneys said they hated me. 
Fearing that might lead the prosecutor to excuse me from the jury, I mentioned 
that my brother is a deputy district attorney in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought I had all the bases covered. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked if any of what I had just told him would make it impossible 
for me to be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 I assured him it would not. I did my best Oliver North earnestness impression. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch the prosecutor asked me my position on drug legalization. I said I 
was on the fence. She asked several questions, and I thought I answered every 
one in the most fair-minded manner. In short, I considered it a stunning 
defense of my fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was finished, she asked the judge to excuse "Juror No. 6." 
</P>
<P>
 I counted from the end of the jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 What? I'm Juror 6!  
</P>
<P>
 The judge thanked me for my time and off I trudged, past all the other jurors 
and potential jurors who now knew me as nothing more than another reject. Now 
they would never find out how cogent my thought processes were, not to mention 
my mastery of obscure Latin legal phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them had predicted to me over the lunch break that I would be canned. 
I feared the same; I didn't dare let on how much I wanted to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 For one brief moment while exiting the courtroom, I pictured the other jurors 
rising up and demanding that I stay. " If he goes, we all go!" they cried out 
to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, nothing. A friendly goodby from the prosecutor as I passed the 
attorney's table. A word of condolence from a potential juror in the back of 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 If only they knew how close I came to stopping at the door and screaming, "You 
people just lost a damn fine juror!"  
</P>
<P>
 Aw, it wouldn't have helped. So I merely slunk back down to the assembly room, 
where instead of weighing evidence and dispensing wisdom, a bunch of us watched 
"General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 By 4:30, we were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 I see now what they mean about jurors bonding. I'd like to have them all over 
for dinner. And the judge. And the attorneys. And the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, bring the bailiff, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone said I might get summoned again in a year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope so. I just need a chance to show what I can do. 
</P>

POOR SCORES MYSTIFY SCHOOL; EDUCATION: EIGHTH-GRADERS AT HIGH-ACHIEVING CORONA 
DEL MAR HIGH POSTED LOWEST SCORES IN ORANGE COUNTY ON STATE MATH TEST. 
PRINCIPAL SAYS THE RESULTS 'MUST BE A MISTAKE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona del Mar High School has long been synonymous with success. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place where 99% of the students graduate each year, and 98% of those go 
on to college -- some to Harvard, Princeton and Stanford. It is a school that 
is near the top of the charts on Scholastic Aptitude Tests, last year posting 
scores on the math portion that were nearly 100 points higher than state and 
national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to results of the new California Learning Assessment System 
released today by the state Department of Education, Corona del Mar High 
students posted the lowest scores in Orange County on the eighth-grade math 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a mistake. I find it hard to believe," said Corona del Mar 
Principal Tom Jacobson, who promised to ask the state for a recount. "It's very 
tough to believe that kids at this school would score that low. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's accurate, obviously there's something wrong," Jacobson added. "We'll 
have to go back to the drawing board and look again. If that's what the scores 
are, we've obviously got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said it would take several weeks to determine whether there 
had been any errors in processing the tests taken last spring by more than 1 
million students statewide, including 193 eighth-graders at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 More likely, they said, the students simply did poorly on the revolutionary 
CLAS math assessment, which judged them on their explanations of how they 
solved problems, not just on whether they got the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Math scores were surprisingly low across California, but the scores at Corona 
del Mar were among the lowest in the state and particularly alarming because of 
the school's past performance on other standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite sure that the people at Corona del Mar would be the first to admit 
that those scores are not what they're capable of," said Cloyde McKinley (Mac) 
Bernd, superintendent of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. "It could be 
that the skills that are being tested in math were not taught." 
</P>
<P>
 On the new tests, student scores were not recorded individually. Rather, 
results were listed by school, district or county. Scoring was done on a 
six-point scale of objective achievement standards, with paragraph-long 
criteria in each category.  
</P>
<P>
 At Corona del Mar, 71% of the eighth-graders who were tested posted the lowest 
possible score, a 1, meaning they demonstrated "little or no mathematical 
thinking and understanding of mathematical ideas," according to the state 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 26% of the students did slightly better, scoring a 2, which 
demonstrated "limited mathematical thinking and understanding." One percent of 
the students earned a 3, and no statistically relevant segment scored a 4, 5 or 
6. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Orange County schools scored almost as poorly on the eighth-grade 
math test. At Fred Newhart Elementary (K-8) in Mission Viejo, 97% of the 
students scored 1 and 2, and 2% scored 3. At Travis Ranch (K-8) in Yorba Linda, 
96% scored 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a complete lack of consistency between what these math tests tell us 
and what other data is telling us," said Barbara Smith, assistant 
superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District, which includes 
Newhart Elementary. "I think there's a lot of trouble with the scoring. I would 
question its validity, its reliability, its repeatability . . . a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 To help parents and school officials analyze the results, the state Department 
of Education provided each school with test results from 100 schools with 
similar socioeconomic and demographic descriptions. Average scores for schools 
comparable to Corona del Mar were far better: only 16% scored 1, while 24% 
scored 3, 22% scored 4 and 5% scored 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the school was outscored by its peers in the Newport-Mesa district, 
where the overall average eighth-grade math scores included 40% scoring 1, 32% 
scoring 2 and 2% scoring 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar eighth-graders' math results were somewhat of an anomaly for 
the school: The same students scored far better in reading and math, and the 
10th-graders there scored higher on all three subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably going to take us a few years to get everything in synch with 
the new tests, but even if we hadn't taught our students anything" about the 
new testing methods, "I know enough about our students to know that 90% should 
not have scored 1's and 2's," Jacobson said. County Rankings Here is how 
schools in selected Southern California counties rank among the state's 58

BOARD WON'T BACK GROUP'S EL TORO PLAN; CONVERSION: SUPERVISORS' STAND MEANS 
LINCOLN CLUB WOULD HAVE TO WORK TO GET BASE-USE INITIATIVE ON NOVEMBER BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of Orange County supervisors said Tuesday they will not support a 
proposal by leaders of the influential Lincoln Club that would allow voters to 
decide whether El Toro Marine Corps Air Station should be converted to a 
commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors' position means that if Lincoln Club leaders want an 
initiative placed on the November ballot, they will have to do it themselves by 
funding a petition-gathering campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to Lincoln Club members, Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said 
the initiative should not be put to voters until all the facts are in on 
whether an airport is a good use of the 4,700-acre base, which is scheduled for 
closure by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor's letter was addressed to businessmen George Argyros, Buck 
Johns and Lincoln Club President Doy Henley, whose conservative political 
organization includes some the county's most powerful business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter effectively kills the prospect of supervisors placing the issue on 
the Nov. 8 ballot as the club leaders had preferred, since Stanton's support 
was considered pivotal on the split five-member Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder had earlier indicated her support for placing 
the issue on the ballot and Supervisor William G. Steiner was willing to 
consider it. But Steiner said Tuesday he now favors Stanton's position, which 
urges that officials continue to work on base conversion proposals through the 
El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that we could continue our fact-finding and place this on the 
ballot at the same time," Steiner said. "I don't think the two approaches could 
work side by side. I think we already have a process in place and it needs to 
be played out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, vice chairman of the El Toro planning authority, 
said he had never favored an airport referendum but preferred to work through 
the existing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I arrived at my decision independent of the letter," Vasquez said. "I'm 
content to stay on the course we are following." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who also is chairman of the El 
Toro planning authority, was recovering from recent surgery and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder also could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, Johns and Henley said Stanton's letter was "not a surprise," adding 
that meetings with key backers of the initiative would continue to determine 
how the process should move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of solid facts to make the (airport) decision now," Argyros 
said. "What happened, frankly, is that the Board of Supervisors did not have 
the guts to make the decision now." 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, head of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. and a member of Gov. 
Pete Wilson's now-defunct base closure commission, criticized supervisors as 
being traditionally slow to resolve major issues such as the decade-old problem 
of where to place a new county jail. The El Toro issue, he said, is another 
example of a leadership vacuum in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have any statesman-like actions that come out of that board," 
Argyros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johns: "We are all trying to do what's right for the county. Those of us 
who are pushing this have very strong feelings that Orange County is in need of 
this infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Several public opinion surveys -- including a Lincoln Club-funded poll -- have 
shown voters almost equally divided on whether there should be an airport at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the ballot measure calls for an amendment to the county's General 
Plan that would require a civilian airport on about 2,000 acres of the base. If 
approved, it would also allow for the interim use of the base by commercial air 
cargo carriers while the Marine Corps mission is phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 If club leaders go ahead with the petition-gathering campaign, organizers 
expect to spend up to $100,000 to collect the 66,703 needed signatures. The 
petitions must be submitted by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some concern about our timing and we are reviewing that," Henley 
said, adding that the group has also received much encouragement. "But it's 
such an important issue that we are going to have it in front of us sooner or 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Those opposed to an airport at El Toro have speculated that the Lincoln Club 
leaders are attempting to force the issue to a vote because they have personal 
financial stakes in property near El Toro. But all three businessmen said 
Tuesday that they had no land holdings or financial interest in the El Toro 
area. Most of the property surrounding the base is owned by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'Why is somebody doing this' " initiative? Johns said. "I 
have been working on this airport thing for 15 years. Everybody can look at the 
motives and stuff. My guess is that there is no chance for us to be involved in 
anything that happens there." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the ballot measure, Stanton said in his letter that the club's 
intention to seek a new airport at El Toro using a ballot measure might somehow 
be "subverted" by those who have long sought to shut down John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "While you view a commercial El Toro airport as a positive economic asset that 
can benefit the citizens of Orange County," Stanton wrote, "it is very likely 
that others see a new airport at El Toro as the key with which they can lock 
the gates of John Wayne Airport." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, Stanton said, anti-John Wayne Airport activists concerned 
with increased noise and traffic in the area were somewhat successful in 
blocking expansion and improvements at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be curious if some of these veteran activists are now able to 
convince those who are concerned about Orange County's economy that sufficient 
common interest now exists to justify an alliance," Stanton stated in his 
letter.  
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he was disappointed in Stanton's concern for such an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lincoln Club exists to be involved in good government issues, and that's 
the only reason we are interested," Henley said. "We think it's an important 
decision for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, whose city like other South County municipalities 
have been opposed to a commercial airport at El Toro, was encouraged by 
Stanton's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that with El Toro, you just start flying commercial planes in 
and out of there," Ward said. "I really think (the Lincoln Club) needs to stop 
and think about it because, like Supervisor Stanton says, what happens if they 
lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the business community, who are generally considered in favor of an 
airport, have been privately considering the political consequences if voters 
reject a ballot measure calling for a commercial airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it loses, you will set back an airport at El Toro for many years," said 
one influential member of the business community who asked not to be 
identified. He added that members of the business community fear an initiative 
on land use would set a bad precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, leaders of some of Orange County's major business groups met 
privately to discuss the El Toro initiative but took no position in favor or 
against. The groups represented included the Building Industry Assn., the 
Industrial League of Orange County, the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, and 
Partnership 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, said the groups would 
be urging that the county planning agency speed up its studies, so that if 
there is a ballot initiative in November, residents can cast votes based on 
solid information rather than emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concern that the initiative would fail if pushed too soon, Johns 
said defeat of the ballot measure would not be a permanent setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ideas never die," he said. "They just get voted down and we bring them 
up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns noted that it took two tries for the Measure M transportation 
improvements tax increase to be approved by voters. He also pointed to 
politicians who suffered tough losses in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon was never defeated," Johns said. "He was temporarily slowed 
down."

MOTHERING NATURE; 3 LAKES IN LAGUNA CANYON WOULD BE CLEANED, WEEDED UNDER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A new plan to rescue the only natural lakes in Orange County -- three 
ecologically battered basins destined to be the crown jewels of what may become 
the county's largest wilderness park -- calls for cleaning up dirty water and 
restoring natural vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan by a San Rafael consulting firm will be unveiled tonight before the 
Coastal Greenbelt Authority, a panel formed to manage the Laguna Coast 
Wilderness Park at the edge of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of at a critical stage with these lakes, so the sooner the 
better," biologist Elisabeth Brown, an authority member, said Tuesday. "When it 
comes back, it's going to be a wonderful spot for wildlife viewing." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph said the small lakes, which encompass about 
21 acres, are an important asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about these (being) natural lakes, I think these mean a lot to 
people," she said. "I guess people in Minnesota would probably scoff at those 
lakes, but in this context, I think they're pretty unique and special." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake restoration is part of a broader $2.5-million project to allow greater 
public access to the wilderness park, which is now open only one weekend a 
month for guided tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviving the fresh-water ponds, which are rare in Southern California, has 
been broken into two phases under the plan by Wetlands Research Assn. Inc. of 
San Rafael. The plan was funded by a $82,500 grant from the state Coastal 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The first includes cleaning the bacteria-laden waters and removing burdensome 
vegetation while re-establishing native plants that attract migrating 
waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A second phase, which depends partly on realigning Laguna Canyon Road -- a 
touchy subject but one that environmentalists increasingly favor as a way to 
revive the lakes -- includes uprooting the existing roadway, reconnecting two 
of the three lakes and constructing a foot bridge for park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The two phases are expected to cost more than $900,000. Besides lake 
restoration, other objectives for the area call for installing trails, 
restrooms and parking spaces. They carry an estimated price tag of $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop on the park's General Development Plan will follow Brown's 
presentation of the lake restoration project tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Coast Wilderness Park is about 2,500 acres, but is expected to 
eventually be enlarged to 10,000 acres as neighboring parcels of open space are 
turned over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakes, which for a century were a part of the Irvine Ranch, are owned by 
the City of Laguna Beach, which is in the process of buying 2,150 acres from 
the Irvine Co. that had been scheduled for development. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the lakes have taken a battering, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a low point in Laguna Canyon, the basins catch the runoff from the 
canyon's 600-acre watershed. In addition, the surrounding land has been eroded 
by decades of cattle grazing in the area, causing the lakes to fill with mud 
and sediment. 
</P>
<P>
 An early phase of the lake cleanup will involve removing the sediment, along 
with dead eucalyptus trees and other plants that now spring from the ponds. 
Those plants would eventually be replaced with natural vegetation such as 
sycamores, willows and perhaps cottonwoods, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the panel endorses the plan tonight, the county would solicit state funding 
and work could begin in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the park's future design will depend upon how and whether Laguna 
Canyon Road is realigned, a possibility that was the focus of a series of 
workshops in Laguna Beach last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what happens with the curvy roadway, however, Brown said there 
is much that can be done to restore the neglected lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a single basin, two of the lakes now function individually because a 
pipeline that links them beneath Laguna Canyon Road has long been clogged with 
debris. One of the initial moves in revitalizing the lakes will be to clean the 
sludge from that culvert so the two lakes can mingle once again. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for nearby hillsides to be stabilized, partly by 
replanting coastal sage scrub, to help keep dirt from sloughing into the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest lake, which has caught much of the fertilizer runoff from nearby 
Leisure World, must be cleaned to allow more diverse life to thrive in its 
water, which is a thick yellowish-green. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoff feeds the algae that covers the surface of the lake and inhales the 
oxygen needed for underwater plants. As a result, a number of fish kills have 
been reported at the lakes in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Fisher, director of the county's Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
division, said the Oct. 27 firestorm in Laguna Beach added a new wrinkle for 
those trying to plan for public access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire is a new factor to be considered because it did leave so much bare 
land exposed and vulnerable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said the General Development Plan likely will be completed by 
July, signaling how soon and under what conditions residents may gain 
additional access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities such as the restrooms and parking spaces may not be built for five 
years, he said. Except for such support structures at the edge of the parkland, 
the wilderness park is likely to largely remain in its natural state, Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My prediction is the plan will provide for resource protection but virtually 
nothing else in the heart of the park," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Greenbelt Authority will meet at 6:30 p.m. in the large conference 
room at Fred Lang Park Community Center at 21540 Wesley Drive in Laguna Beach. 
For more information, call (714) 834-6791. Restoring Laguna Lakes A 
$900,000-plus plan unveiled Tuesday outlined ways to restore Orange County's 
threenatural lakes, including freshening the waters and re-establishing native 
plants.

JURY GIVES WOMAN $200,000 AWARD IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury has ordered a Santa Ana building contractor to pay 
$200,000 to a former neighbor who accused him of molesting her for seven years 
when they lived across the street from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for two days, jurors agreed that the contractor, Larry 
Wall, had molested Shirley Wellema beginning when she was 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellema's attorney, Paul Wallin of Santa Ana, said his client reported the 
sexual abuse to police a few years ago but was told that the statute of 
limitations for any criminal prosecution had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellema then filed a civil lawsuit, and on Monday, jurors voted 10 to 2 to 
order Wall to pay her $200,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy that the jurors believed in me," Wellema, now 27, said Tuesday. 
"It's every victim's wish that persons who abuse them would admit it."  
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Wall denied molesting his neighbor on Rene Drive in Santa 
Ana, saying instead that he had an affair with her after she turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall's lawyer, Eric Lampel, called the verdict "a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was another case of a clever network of psychotherapists and attorneys 
who put these cases together to make money," Lampel said. "My client had an 
affair, and he's an idiot for doing that. But she hit the jackpot -- $200,000 
is enough to wreck my client's life." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil trial lasted 18 days, during which jurors heard lurid testimony from 
Wellema and others that Wall pierced her body parts, forced her to wear rubber 
clothing during sex acts, and once removed all her hair with Nair.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fry, a 43-year-old Anaheim resident who was the presiding juror, said 
the "bizarre" testimony upset several jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was despicable,' said Fry, who works as a vice president for a chain of 
vocational schools. "It was some of the most deviant things I've ever heard of, 
and I've been around for some time. It was a sick thing to do. . . . No one at 
such a young, impressionable age should be subjected to these kinds of acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Wellema testified that she told at least six school friends that Wall was 
molesting her but did not report him to authorities because she was embarrassed 
and felt she was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 21, she fled to Canada, where she lived with relatives, Wellema 
said. She later joined a support group of molestation victims and decided that 
she should confront her abuser, Wellema said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being told by Santa Ana police investigators that the statutes of 
limitations had run its course, Wellema said, she decided to seek a civil 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted this to go this far," Wellema said Tuesday, "but I lost my 
complete adolescence, and so far it's been hard to get past what he has done to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wellema testified that as a result of her abuse she has suffered eating 
disorders, is distrustful of all men, and is unable to concentrate and 
therefore unable keep a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives in Orange and works part time as a secretary at a bookkeeping firm, 
but she still needs to see a therapist twice weekly, Wellema said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lampel, the defendant's attorney, described his client as a hard-working man 
and father of four who was active in the Parent-Teacher Assn. at Saddleback 
High School, which Wellema attended.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer denied that his client committed the "bizarre" sex acts alleged by 
Wellema. Instead, he claimed, Wall had fabricated her stories by watching soap 
operas on television and reading numerous romance novels. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fry and two other jurors said they didn't find Wall's argument credible.

AREA SCHOOL SCORES HIT HIGHS, LOWS; DISTRICTS: AFFLUENT SYSTEMS GENERALLY FARE

<P>
 A new generation of California test scores released today throws into high 
relief the dramatic contrast in student work in Los Angeles County's 81 school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tidy, well-appointed San Marino schools to the awesome diversity of 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, the county's 1.4 million public school 
students scored at the highest and lowest levels of achievement, with even 
students from the best districts showing many weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's toniest communities still compare well under the new scores, but 
the test results contain plenty of image-busting numbers that show highly 
regarded districts can fall short when measured against rigorous standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Beverly Hills fourth-graders, for example, were found to have limited 
or no math skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County results also display another point consistently 
repeated by educators: Students who live in poor communities, those who speak 
little English and whose parents have limited educations commonly score in the 
bottom rungs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who your mother and father are still dictates how well you do on any kind of 
assessment," said Los Angeles County Supt. of Schools Stuart E. Gothold. "The 
poorer communities tend to have high transiency and students are not in a 
stable school situation. When they speak a language other than English, they 
are starting with a great disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Not one fourth-grader in the Lennox School District -- where 82% of the 
students speak little or no English -- scored in the top levels of math 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Overall, Los Angeles County scored well below the state's students as a whole 
in reading, writing and math. When compared against new statewide math 
standards, more than two-thirds of Los Angeles County fourth-graders scored at 
the lowest levels. Math scores scores improved only slightly among eighth- and 
10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone is too surprised," Gothold said of the results, the 
first under the new California Learning Assessment System. "The bottom line is 
that we are establishing a base line, which is unfortunately low, but 
represents where kids are in a new kind of assessment system." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in some of the most affluent areas -- including Beverly 
Hills, San Marino, Palos Verdes Peninsula, South Pasadena and La Canada -- 
consistently are among the highest achievers in all three academic areas, far 
outpacing the statewide scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In reading and writing, the vast majority of students from these communities 
tested at the highest levels, showing clear abilities to understand what they 
read and to write forcefully and creatively. Only a fraction, about 10%, scored 
in the lowest ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In both math and writing, the tiny Hermosa Beach City School District topped 
the list of high achievers with 34% of its fourth-grade class reaching the top 
standards in math and 83% scoring in the top levels in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Gwen Gross credited the high math scores to the intense teacher 
preparation for the test, which is designed in part to measure how well 
students are learning a new statewide curriculum. "For the past three to five 
years we have been gearing up for this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators in even these elite districts, long accustomed to being on the 
top of the achievement scale, have been hit with some sobering statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Assistant Supt. Bert Pearlman said he is uncomfortable with the 
state standards that describe 50% of his fourth-graders as "limited" 
mathematical thinkers or as students with "little or no" mathematical 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brand new test that is looking for expression of math competency 
that is new to us and our teachers," he said. "I think the goal is admirable 
but the students have not had sufficient opportunity to prepare for being 
tested in this way."  
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, Assistant Supt. Jack Rose, whose eighth- and 10th-graders 
topped the county list in math, was also rankled by low fourth-grade scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those fourth-grade questions were tough, very conceptual. It's expecting an 
awful lot out of them," Rose said. "The state maybe has overstepped their reach 
in terms of what a fourth-grader can do conceptually." 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the rankings, the test results show that a number of 
school districts -- all home to many poor students who do are still learning 
English -- repeatedly received the lowest achievement scores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 27,500-student Compton Unified School District, which was taken over by 
the state last year after becoming insolvent, scores were at or near the county 
bottom at every grade level and in every category. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's new state-appointed administrator offered no excuses. "If the 
students are on the bottom, it means many of our teaching procedures are on the 
bottom," said J. Jerome Harris. "It's not the students who have to change; it's 
the adults who have to change." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lennox School District is only one notch above last-place Compton in 
fourth-grade writing and is last in that grade level in math. An overwhelming 
majority of the youngsters there are not fluent in English. For them, simply 
understanding the test was a challenge, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of the stuff that is here on this new test is language-based," said 
Assistant Supt. Dan Jurenka. "Even (for) the mathematical stuff you had to read 
first, then respond with a drawing of x number of coins -- it's all verbal, 
which isn't easy for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 90% of Lennox pupils entering kindergarten speak no English, more 
than 90% of eighth-graders graduate fully bilingual and ready for high school. 
Citing that accomplishment and others, the American Assn. of School 
Administrators named Lennox Supt. Kenneth L. Moffett the 1994 national 
superintendent of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 645-campus Los Angeles Unified School District, scores fell below the 
statewide norm in nearly every grade and subject level tested. The giant 
district hovered in the bottom third when ranked with county school districts 
in all subjects and grade levels, except 10th-grade math. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable snapshots of student scores in Los Angeles Unified show: 
</P>
<P>
 * In math, the vast majority of students scored in the bottom two levels on 
the six-point scale used by the state. Results showed that 83% of 
fourth-graders, 86% of eighth-graders and 82% of 10th-graders have limited, or 
little, or no mathematical thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reading scores were better, but not by much. Two-thirds of fourth-graders 
placed in the bottom levels, as did 74% of eighth-graders and 82% of 10th-grade 
students. Writing scores were also alarming, with a majority scoring in the 
bottom levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 41% of all students taking the test were not fluent in English, more 
than double the statewide percentage. District officials say the lack of 
English skills hurts the scores and is not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 From school to school, the mammoth Los Angeles district also includes many 
bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
 At Porter Middle School in Granada Hills, two-thirds of eighth-graders scored 
high on the reading test. Principal Sherry Breskin credited an experienced and 
well-trained teaching force led by a highly motivated English department 
chairwoman. The school also has a large number of students rated gifted, and "a 
stable school environment," she said. Only a small percentage are not fluent in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Carver Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles, 91% of students 
scored near the bottom in reading. Acting Principal Jose Rodriguez said 70% of 
his students speak little or no English and a third of his teachers have less 
than five years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacoima Elementary, Principal Larry Gonzales was jolted by "pitiful" 
numbers showing 61% of his students struggling in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it deplorable and I'm not willing to sit back and look for excuses," 
Gonzales said. All his teachers will soon become test experts, he said. Highs 
and Lows Los Angeles County school districts with the highest and lowest 
percentage of students who scored at the three highest test levels: FOURTH

AREA SCHOOL SCORES HIT HIGHS, LOWS; EDUCATION: PORTFOLIOS OF WORK ARE BEING 
TESTED AS A WAY OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO STUDENTS' LEARNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting this year, the California Learning Assessment System tests will begin 
including the most basic evaluation of students' abilities: classroom work. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine elementary schools and six middle schools in the state are field-testing 
a portfolio project in which students submit up to 10 pieces of regular 
schoolwork in math and language arts. Those portfolios will be submitted at the 
end of the school year. The program eventually is expected to include all 
schools, adding portfolios in history and science. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you measure a mind?" asked Joy Jones, a fifth-grade teacher at Van 
Gogh Street Elementary School and a member of the Los Angeles team that is 
developing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portfolios allow you to value a child, not a test. They show us different 
kinds of thought processes and the complexity of children's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of teachers from Van Gogh in Granada Hills and Ivanhoe Elementary in Los 
Angeles are among 60 instructors statewide who are wading through the problems 
of trying to develop a program that rewards student individuality and yet is 
standard enough to be reliable and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, said Bill Thomas, the director of the portfolio assessment project, 
is as much to drive changes in curriculum as it is to showcase student 
development and depth of skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multiple choice testing leads to multiple choice teaching," Thomas said. "It 
leads kids and teachers to value isolated facts for their own sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't develop this type of (portfolio) without thinking, and therefore 
teachers need to work with kids in a way that values the processes of thinking 
as well as the product of it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Ivanhoe, Principal Don Brath said both kinds of assessments can give 
parents and teachers telling examples.  
</P>
<P>
 In multiple choice tests, he said, students' knowledge of the rules of 
capitalization was gauged by giving students a sentence and asking them to 
choose which rule, such as capitalization, was not followed.  
</P>
<P>
 But with portfolios, by looking at classwork that shows a student's depth of 
thought, a grader can see how a student uses capitalization and integrates 
those rules into a larger writing assignment, Brath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Aschbacher, an expert in student assessments at UCLA's Center for the 
Study of Evaluation, said a well-planned portfolio program can offer insight 
into more than just a child's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portfolios can give us a window on what kids are doing," Aschbacher said. "It 
can also give us a window on what kids are being asked to do. We can find out, 
for example, that they may not be being asked to do the things we really think 
they should be learning how to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Field-testers still are working out several details. 
</P>
<P>
 Although non-English-speaking students will be allowed to submit work in their 
primary language, teams are grappling with a system for evaluating the progress 
of limited-English speakers, Jones said. There is a question of uniformity, as 
well, both in how students will be instructed to select their portfolio 
materials and how they will be judged. 
</P>
<P>
 Field-testers are also trying out cover sheets that students will attach to 
each piece in their portfolios. The sheets ask students to fill out what they 
learned from an assignment and why they chose to include a particular sample.  
</P>
<P>
 A student's answers, Jones said, can offer even more clues into thought 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly value the thinking of children and I really think the portfolios show 
that these are thinking little people," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps one day we can do away with the state's other kind of testing and 
take a look at what children are really doing." County Rankings Here is how 
schools in selected counties rank among the state's 58 counties, based on

OFFICER TELLS COURT SHE WAS RAPED BY SUPERIOR; COURTS: LAWSUIT AGAINST 
COMMANDER AND THE CITY ALLEGES VIOLATION OF 12-YEAR VETERAN'S CIVIL RIGHTS. THE 
DEFENDANT SAYS SEX WAS CONSENSUAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer broke down on the witness stand Tuesday as she testified that 
she had been raped by a commander in the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year veteran is suing the commander and the city for alleged violation 
of her civil rights. She said the high-ranking officer lured her into his 
apartment March 31, 1992, under the pretext of giving her advice, and then 
raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living a horrible nightmare," the tearful officer said. "It's like 
something that doesn't go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incident, she said, she has been hospitalized four times for 
depression -- accumulating medical bills of more than $90,000. She has been on 
disability since reporting the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening arguments in federal court, the commander took the witness stand 
first and briefly told the jury that he had sexual intercourse with the 
officer, but said it was consensual. In an internal Police Department hearing, 
the commander was cleared of any wrongdoing and remains on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times is not publishing the names of the officer or the commander she has 
accused. It is the newspaper's policy generally not to identify alleged victims 
of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified that the commander invited her to his apartment after she 
had called his supervisor on several occasions to talk about marital and career 
problems. She said she was invited to the commander's Westchester apartment to 
get the name of a therapist he had recommended, but she said she quickly found 
that he had other things in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry," she said. "I'm very disappointed that someone in a position of 
such high trust and power in the Los Angeles Police Department could have done 
that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the commander asked her to sit on the couch, then took her hand in 
his and told her she was pretty. She said she removed her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He invited her to his bedroom to look out of the window. But once inside the 
bedroom, she said, he blocked the doorway and took off his shirt. When she 
tried to move around him, she said, he grabbed her arms and pushed her onto the 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling him that this was not what I wanted," she said. "He kept 
saying that he was an old man and that it wouldn't take long." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, struggling to maintain composure, went on to describe the alleged 
rape in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she tried to struggle with the commander but found she could not get 
out from under him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to move him off me but he was dead weight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rape, she said, she ran from the room, grabbed her purse and left 
the apartment. She drove to the beach, where she broke down in tears, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a fool," she said. "I felt like it was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not immediately report the rape, and she threw away the 
clothes she was wearing. A week after the incident, she said, she told the 
commander's supervisor, but no action was taken.  
</P>
<P>
 She said the supervisor told her that these things happen between "men and 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then that nothing was going to happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander's lawyer, Barry Levin, asked the officer why she did not follow 
police procedures when handling evidence or reporting a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my training as a police officer," she said, "nobody trains you for 
what to do when you are the victim. I've never been a victim. I never expected 
a commander of the LAPD would do this to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday authorized an additional 
$40,000 for Levin to represent the commander. The appropriation brings the 
amount the city has agreed to pay Levin in the case to $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin was selected last year when the city attorney's office concluded that it 
could not represent the commander because his alleged actions were outside the 
scope of his employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to increase the authorization for Levin after he noted that 
the work involved in the case would grow because its scope had been expanded to 
include allegations the LAPD has a history of discrimination against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, The Times -- citing court records, internal police documents and 
interviews with police officers and others -- reported that sexual harassment 
has until recently received little attention from department management. Among 
other things, The Times reported that in the past five years there have been at 
least eight cases of female LAPD employees alleging sexual assaults by 
co-workers. The Times also reported that the LAPD only began last year to 
compile records of sexual harassment cases, logging 43 complaints, five of them 
for alleged assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed Tuesday to audit every city department to assess the 
scope of the problem in municipal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits were requested by Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who heads the 
council's Personnel Committee. In recent days, Goldberg has said her office's 
review of sexual harassment claims just within the LAPD has persuaded her that 
the city could face a significant amount of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several years, an estimated $400,000 has been paid out to settle 
sexual harassment cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this motion is for us to begin to get some assessment of the 
outstanding pending cases that might be actionable against the city," Goldberg 
told colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits, she said, would not only help city officials determine "what kinds 
of issues and problems exist" but enable attorneys and personnel staff to 
develop a policy that might reduce the number of sexual harassment claims in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the information may include specific personnel, Goldberg said, some 
reports will remain confidential and will be shared only with lawmakers behind 
closed doors. But an overall account of cases will be open to the public, she 
said, and could help the city adopt policies to limit litigation and provide a 
workplace "free of harassment and discrimination."

COUNTY STUDENTS SURPASS STATE AVERAGE; TEST SCORES: LOCAL YOUTHS ALSO TOP PEERS 
IN L.A. COUNTY. THEY DO FAR BETTER IN READING AND WRITING THAN IN MATH. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County students surpassed the statewide average and far outranked 
their peers in neighboring Los Angeles County in new statewide assessment test 
results released today. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as in school districts across the state, Ventura County students 
performed far better in reading and writing than in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders in the county who took the California 
Learning Assessment System tests last spring, eighth-grade students scored the 
highest when compared with other California pupils at the same grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's eighth-grade students had the ninth-highest scores overall 
among the state's 58 counties, while fourth- and 10th-grade results each ranked 
15th. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Los Angeles County ranked 29th on its fourth-grade results, 
20th in eighth-grade scores and 31st in the performance of its 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ventura County's 20 school districts, the small but affluent Oak Park 
Unified School District near Thousand Oaks had the highest overall scores. 
</P>
<P>
 But several other districts also performed notably well, including Conejo 
Valley Unified, Ojai Unified, the tiny Mesa Union district outside Camarillo 
and -- in most areas except 10th-grade math -- Moorpark Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts had scores that were conspicuously low. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Unified School District ranked last in the county in both 
10th-grade math and 10th-grade writing. Also, the Santa Paula and Oxnard 
elementary school districts and the high school districts in both cities all 
performed below the state average in most areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The low scores might at least in part reflect that each of these districts has 
a high number of students with limited English, school officials said. The 
learning assessment tests put more emphasis on writing ability than any 
previous statewide assessment exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike multiple-choice exams used in previous assessments, the state 
assessment tests ask students to explain in writing how they solved particular 
math problems or what they thought of a particular piece of literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "For second-language learners, this kind of test is extremely difficult 
because you have to explain your answers in writing," said Gary Davis, 
assistant superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School District, where 40% of 
the district's 10th-grade students have limited English proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, Ventura County students were strongest in writing and weakest in 
math, a trend that held statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 On the writing test, 52% of the county's fourth-graders and 50% of 
eighth-graders demonstrated an ability to write coherently, making only 
occasional errors in grammar, punctuation and spelling. Statewide, only 44% of 
fourth-grade students and 40% of eighth-graders demonstrated these skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing scores declined, however, for older students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-quarter of 10th-graders in the county showed serious limitations in 
their ability to communicate in writing, making frequent errors in punctuation, 
spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower results for 10th-grade students may reflect that schools across the 
county began only six years ago to focus on teaching the critical thinking 
skills tested by the learning assessment system, said Diana Rigby, a curriculum 
coordinator for the Ventura County superintendent of schools office. 
Previously, schools focused on teaching students only to get the right answers, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourth- and eighth-graders have benefited from this through most of their 
school careers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with its writing scores, the county surpassed the state average in reading. 
But these results also showed much room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although 46% of the county's eighth-graders demonstrated "a thoughtful 
understanding" of what they read, nearly one-fifth of students at the 
eighth-grade level showed only a superficial understanding of texts. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were worse in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of Ventura County students at all three grade levels had the 
lowest possible scores on the tests -- a 1 on a scale of 1 to 6 -- showing 
little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike standardized exams, the learning assessment tests place less emphasis 
on mathematical computations than on how well students understand the concepts 
behind them. Students must not only give a correct answer but they must also 
explain how they arrived at that solution. 
</P>
<P>
 And only 10% of the county's fourth-graders, 12% of eighth-graders and 10% of 
10th-graders demonstrated an ability to interpret diagrams, graphs and word 
problems and an understanding of essential mathematical concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Those averages were better than statewide figures, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 7% of fourth-graders, 11% of eighth-graders and 9% of 10th-graders 
showed an essential understanding of mathematical ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In some school districts, students who performed very well in reading and 
writing stumbled in math. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark Unified School District's 10th-graders performed well above the 
state average in both reading and writing, but they were near the bottom in the 
county in their math scores: only 3% of Moorpark 10th-grade students 
demonstrated an essential understanding of mathematical ideas and an ability to 
interpret diagrams, graphs and word charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Assistant Supt. Frank DePasquale said a district curriculum committee 
will take a hard look at what is being taught in math classes at Moorpark High 
School and Chaparral Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at the middle school and high school math programs jointly," 
he said. "What they're learning at middle school may not be preparing them for 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools around the county are only beginning to use the new state math 
curriculum, which emphasizes critical thinking skills over the ability to do 
simple computations. 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers in Oak Park have been focusing for years on teaching mathematical 
concepts rather than just problem-solving, Oak Park Supt. Marilyn Lippiatt 
said. And that might account for Oak Park having the highest math scores in the 
county in the eighth and 10th grades, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified had the highest math scores at the fourth-grade level. 
The Thousand Oaks district was also at or near the top in every other subject 
area at each grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conejo Valley Director of Pupil Services Sylvia Michael said she was most 
pleased by results showing Conejo's performance in comparison with other school 
districts with similar socioeconomic levels. 
</P>
<P>
 For every school in California, state education officials have calculated how 
their scores compared with other schools with similar socioeconomic levels and 
comparable numbers of students who are limited in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts such as Conejo Valley had outstanding results not only in 
comparison with others in their counties but also when viewed against similar 
districts across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth-grade reading tests, for instance, 55% of Conejo Valley students 
showed a thoughtful understanding of texts, compared with only 44% in 
comparable California districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I'm excited about," Michael said. "It's nice to have comparisons 
to schools and districts that are similar to yours." 
</P>
<P>
 By this measure, one of the best-performing school districts in the county is 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 10th-grade reading tests, for instance, 53% of Ojai students 
demonstrated the ability to understand a whole text, compared with only 26% of 
students in districts of comparable socioeconomic levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's largest district, Simi Valley Unified, turned in a mixed 
performance when compared with districts of similar socioeconomic status. Simi 
Valley eighth-graders turned in lower results than their peers in comparable 
districts in all three subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fillmore students performed worse than peers in similar districts around 
the state in most subject areas at the three grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Assistant Supt. Mario Contini said school officials are less 
concerned about how they compare with other districts in the county and around 
the state than about just improving their scores on future learning assessment 
tests and meeting the high performance standards set by the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to compete with anybody," Contini said. "We're going to 
compete with ourselves to do our best. We're going to reach for those 
standards. That's what we're after." Ventura County Test Scores 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System is a state-mandated series of tests 
given last last spring to students in grade 4,8 and 10. Students' reading, 
writing and math skills were measured against statewide performance standards. 
The standards, which are numerical from 1 to 6, range from little or no ability 
(1) in the subject area to skillful and creative (6). 
</P>
<P>
 The following are school districts that scored among the highest and the 
lowest in Ventura County when the three subject areas are combined:

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS

<P>
 Seeing little besides clear water and black sand inside the plastic bowl she 
held, Shimona Wolf, 9, sighed and began to swirl the water around once again. 
</P>
<P>
 As she rocked the bowl, the sand pulled away from the bottom edge and 
something shiny began to poke out. After a few more seconds, flecks of gleaming 
yellow metal appeared within the sand and Shimona gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 She had struck gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimona was one of 30 students at John Murdy Elementary School in Garden Grove 
who learned how to pan for gold as part of their lessons on California history. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 80-minute presentation, members of the Orange County 49ers, a local 
mining hobbyists group, answered questions and showed the third- and 
fourth-grade students how to work a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is gold in all 50 states, but California is one of the leading 
gold-producing states," Fred Serradell, 38, of Fountain Valley, told the 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Serradell, a mortgage broker who pans for gold on weekends, pointed 
out that looking for the precious metal "is one the fastest ways to make you 
poor. Only one out of every 1,000 miners in the old times struck it rich." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your odds today are probably even less. But as a hobby, it's a fun thing to 
do," he added. To make a profit, a person would have to get about half an ounce 
of gold a day. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing that a single ounce of unprocessed gold could be worth as much 
as $1,000 to a jeweler, one boy shouted out, "Give me some nuggets!" 
</P>
<P>
 The children watched a video showing how to use shovels, pans, screens and 
other equipment to coax gold flakes and nuggets from the ground. Then they left 
the classroom to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering around a metal wash tub that had been filled with water and dirt 
from a local claim, the students took turns sifting for gold. The scooped up 
water and mud and carefully shook their pans to let the lighter material wash 
back into the tub. 
</P>
<P>
 After removing all the rocks and keeping only a fine black sand, they swirled 
the pan to separate sand from the heavier material. Invariably, tiny flecks of 
gold remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said it was exciting to relive some of the same experiences and use 
the same kinds of techniques that miners had more than 140 years ago. Getting 
to pan for, and actually find, real gold was especially thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Heredia, 9, said: "I think it's a real good way to teach us. When you're 
reading in a book, you don't know what it's really like. But when you get to do 
it, you have a better idea."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; EGGERS SAYS HE WON'T BE SEEKING REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prospects for a wide-open City Council race in June were boosted Tuesday when 
Councilman Mike Eggers announced he will not be seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers, an aide to U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and a member of the 
city's first council, became the second of two incumbents to decide not to run. 
Last week, Councilwoman Eileen Krause announced she would not enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to move on, to move over, to elect new people with new ideas and 
new perspectives," Eggers said. "I believe there is much more that can and 
should be done. However, those challenges and accomplishments belong to future 
City Council members, not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers, who has long championed term limits for local elected officials, said 
it would be inconsistent for him to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sincerely do believe in local term limits, and . . . I sincerely do want to 
get my life back," Eggers said, adding that he has spent six years on the 
council and another two years working toward cityhood. "As the old saying goes, 
eight is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers was first elected to the council in June, 1988, when Dana Point 
residents voted to incorporate as a city. He, along with Krause and Mayor Judy 
Curreri, were among five members of the charter council. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers predicted a wide-open race in June because three council seats will be 
up for grabs, with two incumbents dropping out. He urged new faces to enter the 
race from among this city of 34,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Karen Lloreda is also up for reelection and is expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nine prospective candidates have requested the paperwork for the June 
7 election, no one has yet filed to run, City Clerk Sharon L. Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing deadline is 5 p.m. Friday. The deadline will be extended to 5 p.m. 
March 16, if either or both Eggers and Krause indeed do not file papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could still change their minds and run," Waits said. "If on (Friday) 
they have not filed, the deadline is then extended." LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY SEEKS TO HALT 'SALARY SPIKING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have directed City Atty. Gail C. Hutton to begin a legal 
search for a way to halt a new round of "salary spiking" by city employees 
before a new state law prohibiting that practice goes into effect on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year about 100 employees exercised their "benefit conversion rights," 
which allow them to artificially inflate their salaries to get higher pension 
checks. But not all are actually expected to retire within a year, an official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan warned Tuesday that the expected surge in retirement 
costs is "a fiscal time bomb," though no estimates were available on the cost 
to the city and its taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he hopes the city can find a way to legally avoid processing and 
sending to the California Public Employees' Retirement System the inflated part 
of the employee salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said before the vote that she couldn't 
"emphasize (her) disgust enough" about spiking. "This kind of practice makes 
people mistrust government," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was billed in November and February by the Public Employees' 
Retirement System for more than $900,000 to cover spiking costs for 10 retirees 
beginning July 1, 1992. However, the total cost of spiking in the city has been 
put at $2.7 million for a total of 34 employees. Most of the cost was paid in 
the form of higher retirement rates charged by PERS, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had there been no spiking," Sullivan said, "there would be money for a youth 
sports complex in the park or for more police officers. The reason we don't 
have the money is this damned practice of spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Bob Franz said that salary spiking, in which 
vacation time, car allowance and sick pay are added to base salary to increase 
it for retirement purposes, initially had the blessing of PERS officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Employee representatives made spiking a bargaining goal, and the practice was 
accepted in their labor contracts, Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the city's 1,100 employees, including policemen, firefighters, 
marine safety officers and management officials, have given up spiking 
privileges in a current round of negotiations, Franz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Franz said he believes that the PERS historically overcharges cities, and the 
recent bills it submitted to the city may be too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will look into estimated costs for future retirees on March 21. 
Officials are also expected to consider whether to pay the current bill in a 
lump sum, in yearly payments or an increase in retirement rates. ROBERT BARKER

<P>
 A counselor at Los Amigos High School has been honored as the Southern 
California 1993-94 Counselor of the Year, district officials announced 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Counselors Assn. named Judy Sadler as recipient of the 
Anne Upton Counselor of the Year Award, which recognizes outstanding 
performance in counseling.Sadler was one of six recipients statewide, district 
spokesman Alan Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care very much for the students. I try to be a part of their lives in a 
positive way," Sadler said after receiving the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help them make the decisions they need to make in their lives, to 
make them productive citizens, to give them the support they need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadler has served the district for eight years, and learned Spanish on her own 
time to communicate better with students. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying that she appreciated the recognition, she added: "I feel like I'm 
accepting this on behalf of all the counselors in the Garden Grove Unified 
School District. They're all doing a really wonderful job."JON NALICK

 The county registrar of voters certified this week that organizers of the 
petition drive to recall Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other City Council 
members have gathered sufficient signatures to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Mary Lou Morey said the registrar finished verifying signatures 
Monday. Each petition had more than the 6,938 signatures required to put the 
measure on the ballot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey said there were 7,030 valid signatures on the petition to recall Smith, 
7,020 to recall Craig Schweisinger, 7,052 to recall Tony Lam and 6,993 to 
recall Charmayne S. Bohman.

 The council was scheduled to meet at 8 this morning to consider two 
resolutions -- one asking the county Board of Supervisors to consolidate the 
municipal election with the state's June 7 primary, and the other to officially 
give notice of the recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey, who has been city clerk since 1979, said it marks the first time in 
memory that a recall petition has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will be asked if the four city officials should be removed from office, 
and whether vacancies will be filled by election or by appointment, Morey said. 
</P>
<P>
 If three or all four council members are recalled, Morey said, a special 
election would be held. The special election, however, could be consolidated 
with the November general election, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If just one or two council members are recalled, the seats may be filled by 
appointment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Smith, Lam and Schweisinger will expire in November. Bohman was 
elected to a four-year term in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their side has been heard. Our side has been heard. Now, let the people 
decide," said Mike Garrison, a director of Westminster Firefighters Local 2425, 
which is leading the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who signed the (recall) petitions were hoodwinked," said Lam. 
"We'll just have to work harder to convince the people that we've tried the 
best we could to balance the budget and reorganize the Fire Department to save 
taxpayers money." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort was launched in October, three months after the council 
eliminated the positions of five firefighters and took one firetruck out of 
service to reduce Fire Department spending by $1 million during the current 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters said the reductions jeopardized public safety. But city 
officials said the cuts were necessary to balance the city's 1994-95 budget and 
reduce overtime expense in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Schweisinger were also targeted for recall in 1991 over an increase 
in water rates, but recall proponents were unable to gather sufficient 
signatures. Councilman Frank Fry Jr. was also a target of the 1991 recall 
effort. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; NOT-GUILTY PLEA GIVEN IN DEATH OF MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Clemente man accused of killing his 76-year-old mother 18 months ago 
pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a murder charge in Municipal Court in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Burgess, 45, who has a history of mental illness, was arrested a 
second time earlier this month in connection with the suffocation death of his 
mother, Mary Burgess, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was first arrested a few hours after his mother was found dead in her 
San Clemente home on Sept. 6, 1992, but was released the next day because of a 
lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence collected at the scene and re-evaluated since the slaying links 
Burgess to the crime, authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing March 22 will determine if there is enough evidence to 
send the case to trial in Superior Court.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CLASSES HELP KIDS LEARN POOL SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a pair of swim goggles strapped to his head, 6-year-old Kenneth Chambers 
clung to the swimming pool's edge, then kicked his feet and practiced his 
free-style stroke and side-breathing technique in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first lesson recently at a Buena Park swim school, Kenneth said he 
wanted to keep learning, "maybe to save myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to swim can be a matter of life and death, local swim instructors 
say. But it also can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth's mother, Annie Chambers, enrolled both her son and herself in lessons 
at Australian Swim School. 
</P>
<P>
 "My No. 1 concern is that he learn pool safety. No. 2 is to have fun," said 
Chambers of Garden Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 As summer nears, swimming lessons are offered through private schools, 
community organizations such as the YMCA and city-sponsored recreation 
programs, which typically begin in June. Swimming lesson prices vary depending 
on the private or public program, and private and group lessons are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA of Orange County offers swimming programs through its six branches in 
Fullerton, Newport Beach, Laguna Niguel, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and Yorba 
Linda, said Cathy Paugh, YMCA executive assistant. Prices for lessons vary 
depending on the branch and whether a participant is a YMCA member, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim YMCA, an independent organization, also offers year-round swimming 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fountain Valley will offer swimming classes beginning in late 
June. Two-week sessions will cost $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Bainbridge -- who helps operate the Australian Swim Schools founded by 
her husband, John Bainbridge -- said, "We found that the value of working with 
children in a group was that the kids enjoyed their lessons by working with 
their peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Mitchell, who operates Aliso Hills Swim Ranch in Mission Viejo with her 
husband, Robert, said that for younger children, learning to swim "enhances 
their motor and intellectual development because they get so much stimulus. . . 
. They learn to love the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Corinda Vasquez, owner of Corinda's Swim School, offers year-round private 
lessons -- $12 for a 15-minute class -- for infants, children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, who offers lessons at Underwater Scuba Adventures in Anaheim, said 
she teaches "survival floating" skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a child falls into a pond, lake, pool, spa or any large body of water, I 
teach (the child) to roll over and float," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swim instructors said that swimming should be practiced periodically after 
it's learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a child isn't experiencing the water once a week, they don't remain safe 
in the water and they don't progress," John Bainbridge said. Swimming Safety 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips to help prevent drownings or near-drownings of children in 
swimming pools: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave children alone -- not for a second -- near a pool; keep constant 
eye contact when they are around a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get trained in CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enclose pool with fence; install self-closing gates with latches out of the 
reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place a telephone at the pool so calls can be answered there and post 
emergency numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep toys out of pool, as they can attract children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enroll children in a year-round swim program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never consider children "pool-safe" or "drown-proof," even if they have had 
swim lessons. Source: Orange County Trauma Society and Australian Swim School

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY MAY DECLARE END TO PROCLAMATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis, recently criticized when she used her office to 
dedicate a week to the concept of sexual abstinence, may hold a study session 
to consider an end to city proclamations and declarations. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of banning proclamations was raised by speakers at Monday's City 
Council meeting, which came two days after the controversial week came to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wondering if these proclamations just have to go, period," said resident 
John Feeney. "Maybe it's time to get back to arresting the criminals, fixing 
the potholes." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people attended Monday's City Council meeting to show their 
support for the mayor. "I want to congratulate the mayor on her Abstinence 
Week," said Jim Meehan, who urged people to stand in support of the mayor. 
About 45 did. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis declared Abstinence Week at the request of resident Barbara Whitacre, 
who said she is concerned that people do not realize that abstinence is the 
best protection against pregnancy, and against AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 County health educators have lauded the idea of Abstinence Week, but some 
simultaneously criticized the mayor because supporters of the proclamation 
distributed a statement that some people believe was offensive to people with 
AIDS, their families and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement began, "The red 'AIDS' ribbon is a lie," and said the red ribbon 
is stained with deadly blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism prompted Orange resident Clark Emerson to change the statement 
he wrote. The statement was distributed along with a white ribbon. Genis said 
she had endorsed the concept of sexual abstinence, but not any statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Denise Heinrichs said she came to Monday's council meeting to show 
her support when she heard "that the gay community was going to protest 
Abstinence Week." 
</P>
<P>
 John Feeney's wife, Ernie,, who frequently attends council meetings, asked the 
council to consider eliminating all declarations and proclamations. "If you 
keep proclamations, they must be approved by the whole council," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's something that the city shouldn't do," Genis agreed after the 
meeting. "People who are determined to find something wrong with the way the 
city does stuff will use that as an excuse to pick on the city. Or pick on the 
mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Genis was also criticized in November by members of the arts community, who 
argued that she did not adequately proclaim A Day Without Art. Genis verbally 
declared that event, rather than issue a written proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said she may ask next week for other council members to discuss the 
process of awarding declarations and proclamations at an upcoming study 
session. But she said she is proud that she declared Abstinence Week. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, abstinence is an apple-pie issue," Genis said. "It's probably what 
most people want for their kids." WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; OPENING OF TOPLESS BAR INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are investigating whether a topless bar near Anaheim Stadium 
opened illegally or whether it beat the deadline imposed by the city's recently 
enacted adult entertainment ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials contend that "Fritz That's Too," which features topless female 
dancers, opened after July 21, the latest it could have opened legally. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the business -- on Katella Avenue about half a mile west of the 
stadium -- was still "Cactus Jack's," a nightclub, on that date. They say Fritz 
should be closed because it violates the city's ordinance against new adult 
businesses in the stadium area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the club only opened recently," code enforcement manager John 
Poole said. His department first learned the club had gone topless in November, 
several months after the owners say it opened. "We may not be the best 
department at checking these things out, but I find it hard to believe it 
operated that long and we didn't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Yourstone, a senior code enforcement officer, said he and the Police 
Department make frequent spot inspections of bars "and we saw no evidence of 
topless dancing until around November." 
</P>
<P>
 The club's owners did not return several calls for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White said his office is investigating when the club 
started featuring topless dancing and he will make a determination soon on 
whether to order it closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were open, they'll get to stay open for almost two more years" under 
the new adult business ordinance, White said. "If not, they'll have two options 
-- move to another location or cover up the girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz is now one of at least three topless or nude dance halls to open in the 
city after it had gone at least 15 years without one. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's old adult entertainment ordinance had allowed the City Council to 
deny a permit to a topless or a nude dance hall if it found the business to be 
"detrimental to the peace, health, safety and general welfare" of the 
surrounding neighborhood or would "adversely affect" a church, school or park. 
It was the early 1970s when the council last approved such a business and all 
were gone by the end of that decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But in early July, a federal judge struck down the ordinance as "too vague" 
and said it violated a U.S. Supreme Court ruling protecting nude dancing as a 
form of expression protected by the First Amendment. The federal judge said 
that under that ruling, Anaheim could regulate such businesses, but could not 
ban them entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 By July 21, a topless bar and also a nude dance hall opened in the city. The 
council then placed a temporary ban on any new adult businesses pending 
adoption of a new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 28, the council adopted an ordinance that allows adult businesses in 
some areas of the city but specifically bans them near the stadium. The 
ordinance does allow adult businesses operating before July 21 to remain in 
their location until mid-1995. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY REZONES SITE FOR TOYOTA DEALERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council approved changing the zoning of a 1.18-acre site, now 
occupied by two historic homes and a park, which will allow the development of 
a Toyota dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership will be within the Buena Park Auto Center expansion area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Warsinski, assistant director of development services, said that changing 
the use of the property will "promote the highest and best use of the site and 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Warsinski said the property, which had an "open space" designation, is better 
suited for commercial use since it will link the Buena Park Auto Center with 
the Beach Boulevard corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Toyota, now on Orangethorpe Avenue, plans to move to the auto 
center site, on the south side of Manchester Boulevard between Beach Boulevard 
and Stanton Avenue, by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker-Jaynes estate and the Bacon House, both landmark homes built 
before the turn of the century, will be moved this summer to a newly created 
historical district on Beach Boulevard, across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency plans to buy property on the west side of 
Beach Boulevard, between 9th and 10th streets, for the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other landmark buildings in the area include the First Congregational Church 
and the Stage Stop Hotel, now a residence, both of which will be part of the 
historical district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Dixon, a board member of the Buena Park Historical Society, told the 
council that the organization remains supportive of the city's plan to move the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Boulevard site is a more visible area that will promote public 
awareness about the city's past as well as permanently preserve the houses, 
Dixon said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DAMAGED STADIUM TO BE FIXED BY AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake damage at Anaheim Stadium should be repaired by mid-August, 
including the installation of a new scoreboard that will be the second largest 
in North America, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Smith, general manager of the stadium, said repairs will begin within six 
weeks and cost in excess of $5 million. The job will include replacing the Sony 
Jumbotron scoreboard that fell during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake with a 
board that has a screen 30% larger yet weighs half as much. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also include repairing the roof, replacing or reinstalling 2,000 
seats, repairing some concrete that was damaged and restoring two restrooms and 
a concession stand that were damaged when the 17 1/2-ton scoreboard and its 23 
tons of supporting structures fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have the repairs completed by Aug. 12 and have the stadium up to 
full speed when we have our first Rams game on Aug. 13," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, a temporary scoreboard will be installed in the lower deck in 
left field for the first few months of the California Angels' season. Because 
of the earthquake damage and the temporary scoreboard, the Angels' seating 
capacity has been reduced from 64,500 to about 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The new scoreboard -- also a Sony Jumbotron -- will have an area of 1,092 
square feet, compared with the old board's 768 square feet, Smith said. Only 
the scoreboard at Toronto's Skydome is larger. Plans call for it to still offer 
color replays of the games. The board may also be capable of doing a light 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also looking at adding lights (to the scoreboard) . . . that would 
illuminate when a touchdown or a home run occurs," said Earl E. Santee, the 
architect who is designing the repairs. "In recent years, scoreboards have 
become more of a dynamic part of the event rather than just giving replays of 
the event." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have considered applying for federal and state assistance to 
help pay for the repair costs. The $125-million stadium's earthquake insurance 
has a $6-million deductible. The city also is considering legal action against 
the board's installers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard was erected in 1988 in a part of the stadium built during a 
1979 expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are still trying to determine what caused the collapse, but an 
engineer for the scoreboard company has charged that a portion of the support 
beams installed during the expansion were thinner than designed. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOLS OUTLAW DISCRIMINATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to curtail a rise in racial and ethnic discrimination among 
students in Brea Olinda Unified School District, trustees this week implemented 
a policy outlawing such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, any student who displays or distributes flyers or any kind 
of hate material, including stickers and buttons, will face suspension or 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, students will be prohibited from name-calling and from 
discriminating, harassing, teasing, abusing or assaulting other students 
because of handicap or a difference in background, ability, religion, culture, 
race, ethnicity, language, tradition or gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Edgar Z. Seal said the administration made the recommendation following 
parents' pleas, which were sparked by a recent incident at Brea Junior High 
School. A student at the school found a swastika in a book she checked out of 
the campus library, then displayed the swastika, while making derogatory 
remarks to other students. As a result of the incident, the student was 
suspended for four days, Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was reminiscent of one last June, when three students were 
suspended for making "racial slurs." Two of the students, who went to Brea 
Junior High, were suspended for four days, while a Brea Olinda High School 
student was suspended for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial discrimination among students is not new but the suspensions were the 
first in the district's history, Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, principals would call parents and counsel students who 
discriminated against their classmates. Now, principals report such problems to 
the district, Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed the incidents were taking place and we felt (the policy) was 
needed because our student population is becoming more and more diverse," he 
said. "We need to celebrate our cultures, not denigrate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 68% of the district's students are Anglo, 18% are Latino, 8% are 
Asian and 2% are black. By the year 2020, officials expect Caucasian students 
to be in the minority.MIMI KO

FAMILIES TERRORIZED AS GUNMEN INVADE 2 HOMES; CRIME: POLICE ARRIVE DURING 
ROBBERY AND ARREST 3 MEN AT A HOUSE IN SANTA ANA. IN WESTMINSTER, ROBBERS DRIVE 
OFF WITH MONEY IN A VAN BELONGING TO THE VICTIM.

<P>
 Two families were terrorized by armed robbers who burst into their homes in 
Santa Ana and Westminster in incidents occurring within two hours of each other 
late Monday and early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived during the Santa Ana robbery and arrested three men, but the 
gunmen in the Westminster robbery remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in either incident. But members of the Westminster family, 
whose names were not released by police, were bound as the robbers ransacked 
their home in the 14000 block of Janice Street just after midnight Monday, 
Police Lt. Mike Schliskey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the family arrived home from work during the robbery. The gunmen 
took him hostage and forced him to drive back to the market he owns in 
Westminster's Little Saigon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made him open the safe, took money, then drove off in his van," 
Schliskey said. "We assume they must have known he owned the market and they 
waited for him to get home." 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers were last seen driving away in the victim's white 1993 Dodge 
Caravan with license plate number 3DIB934. They were described as Vietnamese in 
their late teens or early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the robbery as a typical "home invasion" crime, in which 
Asian gangs target Asian families, believing that cash, gold and jewelry may be 
kept at the residences. Merchants in Little Saigon have been targets in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours before the Westminster robbery, three men confronted a family as 
they drove up to a Santa Ana house in the 2000 block of Artesia Street, Police 
Sgt. Don Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A daughter who witnessed the attack said: "They put a gun to my dad's head and 
my mom ran into the house and said to call the police. My dad said to them, 'I 
don't have any money. Take my car and leave my family alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The men then forced Luis Lepe, 30, into the house at gunpoint while six other 
family members hid in the bathroom. Police officers arrived at the home within 
five minutes of being called, the daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 21-year-old relative who lives at the house said: "I was thinking they were 
going to hurt us. I didn't know if the police were going to come because (the 
caller) didn't get to talk to them too much on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said that when officers arrived, they heard shots fired in the rear 
of the house and two of the gunmen came running toward the front of the house. 
They were confronted by police and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A third suspect barricaded himself inside of the house but came out 
voluntarily when he was informed that a canine unit would be released on him," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested were identified as Ricardo Cruz Lopez, 22, Bernardo Rodriguez, 
34, and Armando Colon Mozo, 28, all of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The three, who police said were found carrying weapons, were being held in 
Orange County Jail on suspicion of armed robbery.

POLICE SEEK HELP IN SEARCH FOR 3 SUSPECTS; CRIME: PUBLIC IS ASKED FOR 
INFORMATION ON ALLEGED GANG MEMBERS WANTED IN A 1992 SHOOTING IN ORANGE.

<P>
 Police are asking the public for help in the search for three alleged gang 
members believed to have been involved in an October, 1992, shooting that left 
a 19-year-old Orange man paralyzed from the neck down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have few leads to the whereabouts of Anibal Geovany 
Hernandez, Juan Molinero Zaldivar or the third suspect, a juvenile whose name 
was not released.However, police believe the suspects may still be in Orange 
County, Detective Jack Nanigian said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are suspects in the shooting of Robert James Thomson, who was 
wounded during an apparent gang skirmish behind a gas station at 883 N. Tustin 
Ave. Witnesses identified the men as the assailants, Nanigian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 18, known by the street name Camel, is Latino, about 5 feet 5 and 
110 pounds, with short black hair and brown eyes. Zaldivar, 20, known by the 
street name Igor, is Latino, about 5 feet 3 and 125 pounds, with black hair and 
brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile suspect, known on the street as Tiny, was described as a 
16-year-old Latino, about 4 feet 11 and 90 pounds, with short black hair and 
brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting, which occurred at a busy gas station, was thought to be in 
reprisal for a bike theft that prompted a confrontation between two rival 
gangs, Nanigian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are believed to be with fellow gang members in Santa Ana, 
although it is possible they have fled the country. Any person with information 
about the crime or the whereabouts of the suspects is asked to call Nanigian at 
(714) 744-7309. All tips are confidential.

BIGGER GRADUATING CLASS AT CSUF CREATES MORE ROOM IN FALL 
</P>

 More students are expected to graduate this year than last from Cal State 
Fullerton, allowing spaces for slightly higher enrollment in the fall, 
according to campus census figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, in adjusting to state budget cuts, accepted fewer 
students last fall, which resulted in availability of more classes and students 
taking on heavier course loads.This contributed to more students graduating 
this semester, opening up spaces for enrollment in the fall, said James 
Blackburn, director of admission and records. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is that we can keep the overall enrollment the same size and 
yet still provide more opportunities for new students next fall," Blackburn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To absorb cuts in state aid, university officials had to cut enrollment last 
year. This semester, 21,787 people registered, compared to 22,875 last spring, 
Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have fewer students contending for some of the class spaces, so the 
chances of individual students securing more units increased," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average load taken by students this spring is 10.4 units, up from last 
spring's 10.26 and the previous spring's 10.29, Blackburn said.

EXECUTIVE FOUND DEAD AT AIRPORT

<P>
 An executive of an Anaheim demolition company was found dead of a head injury 
Tuesday near a parking structure at John Wayne Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people watching flights take off from an upper level of parking structure 
A noticed the body in a drainage ditch on the runway side at about 2 p.m., Lt. 
Dan Martini said.The man, in his 50s, appeared to have been dead for at least a 
few hours, Martini said, but probably not overnight. His name had not been 
released late Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death is pending an autopsy this morning, but Martini said the 
man appeared to have died as a result of blunt trauma to the head. He could 
have fallen from the multistory structure or could have been assaulted, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parked on an off-ramp of the southbound San Diego Freeway, about 50 yards from 
where the body was found, was a 1988 Jeep Cherokee registered to the Penhall 
Co. Inside the Jeep was a hard hat, orange highway vest, car phone and an open 
pack of cigarettes.  
</P>
<P>
 A company executive, who asked not to be named, said the man was "well-known" 
at Penhall, and had worked in management at the Anaheim headquarters "for a 
number of years."

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN SUIT OVER AIRCRAFT PROPELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after a jury awarded $5.4 million to two men who claimed that Cessna 
Aircraft Co. took their idea for a new propeller and made millions from it, 
both sides agreed Tuesday to a settlement that will end further jury 
deliberations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury had returned to court Tuesday to consider possible 
punitive damages against Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very big difference of opinion as to who was right and who was 
wrong. It was obvious that the jury sided with the plaintiff," said Cessna's 
attorney, Lee Horton of Los Angeles, in explaining why his client agreed to a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not disclose the terms of the settlement, which ends the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert F. Scoular, who represents John L. Rich and Robert A. Craner, 
the men who sued Cessna, also declined to the discuss the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Mary Stewart of Los Alamitos said she and other jurors "might have hit 
them (Cessna) with a pretty good amount" for punitive damages had they been 
given the chance to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty clear that Rich and Craner had a contract and had been cheated 
out," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month trial, jurors had found that Cessna was liable for damages 
and should pay Rich and Craner for lost profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich and Craner said they were satisfied with the settlement and relieved that 
the trial was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely ecstatic right now," Rich said, grinning as he stood outside 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, 61, a retired Cypress lawyer, and Craner, 56, a Long Beach auto 
mechanic, worked as a team in 1986 to develop the first three-bladed propeller 
for a four-cylinder, single-engine airplane. At the time, most smaller planes 
used a two-bladed propeller, which is lighter but less powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rich's financial backing and Craner's ability to design propellers, they 
built a prototype, licensed it and approached Cessna with their product in 
1986. The men said Cessna expressed interest, promising to make the propellers 
and allow the men to have exclusive selling rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1988, according to the lawsuit, the two men thought that Cessna had 
lost interest in the deal, and they gave up their venture. Later, Rich said, he 
saw an advertisement for the propeller he helped create, made by Cessna but 
offered for sale by another company. He then filed the civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Craner, a mechanic who fixes Cadillacs at a Long Beach dealership, said 
Tuesday he doesn't know what to do with the money from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For now, I'm gonna keep working at my job," Craner said, looking at his 
watch. "I better get going. I'm supposed to be there in an hour."

TEACHER ADMITS BILKING STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES 
</P>

 A high school teacher has pleaded guilty to swindling students and colleagues 
out of more than $250,000 as part of a gold-commodities scheme and faces up to 
five years in prison when he is sentenced, authorities said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Gordon, 54, was a popular, jewelry-making teacher at Santa Ana High 
School who persuaded at least 25 people to invest in a bogus gold-refining 
process that he claimed would make them money, investigators said.He told 
investors he could buy used or scrap gold at low prices, refine it, and sell it 
for high profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon pleaded guilty Friday to 46 felony counts of defrauding investors. He 
faces a maximum of 12 years in prison, but Orange County Superior Court Judge 
William R. Froeberg has indicated he will not sentence Gordon to more than five 
years, Deputy Dist. Atty. William L. Overtoom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors described Gordon as a heartless thief who cared little for his 
victims. Defense attorney Robert D. Coviello, however, has stressed that 
Gordon's investors made money from the ventures. Coviello, who could not be 
reached Tuesday, has said Gordon was himself victimized by a gold dealer who 
made off with money belonging to Gordon and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they suspect that Gordon bilked unwitting victims of the 
money he used to bankroll a lavish lifestyle: He allegedly bought cars for 
girlfriends, traveled to Paris and Madrid, and even stayed in $4,000-a-night 
rooms in Las Vegas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon remains in custody pending sentencing April 15.

TWO KILLED, ONE HURT IN EXECUTION-STYLE ATTACK AT BUSY INTERSECTION; VIOLENCE: 
TWO GUNMEN STEP FROM CAR IN BURBANK AND FIRE INTO ANOTHER AUTO BEFORE FLEEING. 
POLICE SEE NO GANG LINKS BUT SAY SHOOTING APPARENTLY WAS PLANNED.

 Two gunmen stepped from a car at a busy Burbank intersection Tuesday and 
pumped gunshots into another auto carrying three men, killing two of them and 
wounding a third in an attack that had all the markings of a planned execution, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Police Chief Dave Newsham said it appeared the killers used 
semiautomatic weapons in the attack at the intersection of San Fernando Road 
and Hollywood Way shortly after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings did not appear to be gang-related but did appear planned, said 
Lt. Jack Valento. "It was something that was not spontaneous," Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims, all described as adult Latinos in their mid- to late-20s, 
had been identified by late Tuesday, Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen approached the victims' white Chevrolet Impala from behind on the 
southbound side of San Fernando Road and opened fire on the occupants, 
authorities said. The car had been stopped at a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how many shots were fired, but one witness said he heard at 
least three or four. The car's rear window was shattered by gunfire, and there 
was at least one bullet hole in the right rear passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Larry Koch said there were "several witnesses who saw all of this or a 
portion of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded driver continued about a mile to a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant in 
the 2600 block of San Fernando Road. By the time police arrived, the bodies of 
his two passengers were in the parking lot of the restaurant and were 
pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was treated at St. Joseph Medical Center for a minor gunshot wound 
in the back and released, Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin C. Perez, who works at Industrial Metal Supply Co. across the street 
from the shooting scene, had just emerged from his car when he heard the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said two men in dark clothing fired "three, maybe four shots" into the 
car. Immediately after the shooting, the men stepped back into their car and 
fled the wrong way down a one-way section of Hollywood Way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting surprised many of Perez's co-workers, who described the 
neighborhood as a safe and usually quiet place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably unusual for any area, but particularly for Burbank, said 
Collen Canavin. "This area is really safe, and Burbank (police) keep a tight 
rein," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were five murders in Burbank in 1993, Valento said.

8 PRIVATE HMOS JOIN TO VIE FOR MEDI-CAL CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, private health maintenance organizations have formed an 
alliance to compete with public and nonprofit agencies for state Medi-Cal 
patients, sources confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Los Angeles Health Advantage, the business alliance is made up of 
eight longtime players in private managed care, including Kaiser Permanente, 
Cigna Healthplan and FHP Inc. It also includes some HMOs that have 
traditionally refused Medi-Cal patients -- such as the "blues," Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield -- on the grounds that state reimbursements were so low and 
treatment requirements so broad that they could not afford to treat them 
profitably. The other HMOs in the alliance are United Health Plan, Maxicare and 
PruCare. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMOs will compete for up to 39% of the Medi-Cal recipients under a plan 
pushed for years by the Wilson Administration and the state Department of 
Health Services to get Medi-Cal patients into mainstream managed-care plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The state government on Monday released its tentative plan for soliciting the 
contracts, the first legal step that will result in actual contracts being 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMOs would offer welfare recipients and other poor Californians who 
receive taxpayer-financed Medi-Cal benefits the same benefits as those received 
by private clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medi-Cal patients would be free to choose from the eight plans, and then 
would receive full rights under whichever HMO they choose. There would be 
absolutely no discrimination based on financial status," said Jonathan C. 
Lewis, who is heading up the alliance of HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 But others expressed concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are bringing into the market commercial HMOs with limited or in some cases 
no experience in treating Medi-Cal clients," said Toni Saenz Yaffee, chief of 
staff to the Managed Care Planning Council of Los Angeles County. "We are 
worried that they will cherry-pick the healthiest clients, leaving us with the 
responsibility for caring for the indigent without the money to pay for it."

REPORTS OF GAY BASHING ON THE INCREASE IN L.A. COUNTY; HATE CRIMES: SERVICE 
CENTER OFFICIALS CALL THE TOTAL OF 217 INCIDENTS IN 1993 ALARMING. NUMBERS IN 
OTHER CITIES DROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of gay-bashing incidents reported to a Los Angeles agency in 1993 
doubled the previous year's total, while the number of such incidents 
chronicled in other cities around the country declined for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbians and gay men reported 217 Los Angeles County incidents, ranging from 
threats to beatings and murders, to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community 
Services Center, compared to 107 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase appears more dramatic because the 1992 figures were unusually 
low. No money was spent that year publicizing the center's anti-gay violence 
project or hot line, so fewer calls came in. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to 1991, when the center chronicled 192 anti-gay incidents, the 1993 
figures reflect a much smaller increase of 13%. Still, center officials called 
last year's numbers alarming, particularly when contrasted with a 14% decline 
in gay-bashing incidents recorded elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, in Los Angeles we have not been following that trend," said 
Lorri L. Jean, the center's executive director. Jean attributed the local rise 
to the increased visibility of the gay community last year -- when gay issues 
were frequently in the news -- as well as the poor economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People take their frustration out on groups deemed to be the most 
vulnerable," Jean said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a government grant, the center last year stepped up efforts to track 
violence against gay men and lesbians. A coordinator was hired to take calls, 
counsel victims and help them in their dealings with law enforcement. 
Typically, advocates say, many incidents are never reported to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Shafer, the hate crimes coordinator for the district attorney's office, 
says she is following the cases of five gay men murdered last year, but motives 
for the killings remain unclear and none of the slayings have been classified 
as hate crimes. Two of those killings were reported to the center, and were 
thus included in the violence report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force released its annual 
report on anti-gay violence, citing a total of 1,813 incidents recorded by gay 
service agencies last year in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, 
New York and San Francisco. The most incidents -- 597 -- were recorded in New 
York. San Francisco followed with 366 gay-bashing episodes, a 16% drop from 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) met Tuesday with Brenda and Wanda Henson, a 
lesbian couple whose plans to establish a feminist retreat in Ovett, Miss., 
have made them the target of threats and gunfire. Frank said he would conduct a 
House judiciary subcommittee hearing in Ovett next month to explore what the 
federal role should be in such cases where there is a breakdown of local law 
enforcement. 
</P>

FIXATIONS: NO MORE SUFFERING IN SILENCE

 Remember this optimistic bit of peace-march jargon from way back when: 
"Suppose they gave a war and nobody came"? 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time in Joe Cangelosi's life when he might certainly have wished 
folks had lived up to that slogan: when he was a young man in Sicily and World 
War II overran his family's ranch, not to mention his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he gave a little war of his own -- in the form of a musical about 
sundered wartime love, titled "Ghibli" -- he would rather a few more people had 
showed up. Like an audience , perhaps, and several of the cast members. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people ever get around to writing their own musical, but retired 
medical doctor Cangelosi did: the music, the lyrics and the book. The things he 
couldn't do himself, such as orchestrations, he paid a hefty amount to have 
done. Then he produced and directed the thing, twice, in local halls he'd 
rented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I spent around $30,000 on it," Cangelosi said of his musical's 
1989 debut in a 914-seat auditorium at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. "I'd 
had arrangements done for the 31-piece orchestra, hired professional singers. 
And I couldn't get people to come. From an Italian club I belong to I was 
expecting 300 of them to show up in the audience. 'Oh, we'll come, we'll come, 
we'll come!' Only 25 of them did, of the maybe 400 people total who came. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with a lot of unbelievable mistakes happening, I had the same problem 
onstage. When I had 'Ghibli' performed again in 1993, I had to cut or shorten 
some scenes because so many performers didn't show up. Instead of having 20 
people onstage, there would be three or four because the others didn't show up 
at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to get the epic sweep and tragedy of war across with three 
actors, even if they do wave their arms a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Cangelosi over pasta and panini last Thursday, introduced to him by 
Issay restaurant chef Paulo Pestarino, who, it might bear mentioning, could 
probably cook a laptop computer and make it delicious. Cangelosi looks wickedly 
good for his 74 years, with thick wavy hair, sparkling eyes and a face that 
nimbly bears that curious Italian mixture of mirth and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangelosi was born in 1920 in Madison, Wis., and lived there until age 4, when 
his father, having done well in the grocery business, moved the family back to 
the old country to fulfill his dream of owning a ranch. Cangelosi grew up on a 
rolling spread near Palermo. And it was there, with the onset of World War II, 
that his troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a medical student when the war broke out. Studying was difficult 
because "the Americans were trying to kill me, the British were trying to kill 
me," he said, referring to the indiscriminate bombing, which, like food 
shortages, became a part of daily life. Meanwhile, the Fascists had 
appropriated a chunk of the family ranch for use as a POW camp. Cangelosi said 
he and his family befriended and did their best to help the American prisoners 
kept there. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Ghibli" (a North African term for "Sandstorm"), the lead character, Emile, 
is a French prisoner of war held in Germany, pining for his fiancee back home. 
When he's finally released, he returns home only to find that his Anne, 
believing him dead, has married another. He, naturally, enlists in the French 
Foreign Legion, where he volunteers for a suicide mission traveling alone 
through a sandstorm to bring help to his beleaguered outpost. In the storm he 
has visions of his Anne guiding him on, and when he arrives, nearly spent, at 
the fort, he finds she has dumped her hubby and come there looking for him. It 
is a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangelosi was inspired to write his musical by his wartime experiences, though 
they were significantly different from his protagonist's. For starts, he was 
never a prisoner of war, nor even in the military. He says he did once try to 
enlist in the Italian air force, but only with the intent of deserting and 
aiming the first plane they put him in for an Allied airstrip. His U.S. 
birthplace kept the military from accepting him, though. 
</P>
<P>
 On the home front, however, he became involved with a woman named Anna. Even 
after five decades, his sense of discretion asked that the details of this 
romance be kept off the record. Suffice to say that, in the finest Italian 
tradition, the love affair was heated, audacious, altogether complicated and 
fated to have no future. 
</P>
<P>
 In his musical, Cangelosi made his characters French, so the hero would have a 
foreign legion to enlist in. "That's what I felt like doing," he said. "I just 
wanted to disappear, to forget her." Instead, he moved away to another city, 
and then to America, to distance himself from the hopeless romance. Though he 
once married (and divorced) here, and led a full life, he says his Anna was the 
only true love of his life. Most of the songs in "Ghibli" initially came to him 
in his time of turmoil and separation in the 1940s. "It was a heartbroken 
situation, and I started writing songs. I doubt I would have written these 
songs without this experience. At that time the music was coming in my mind 
without help of any instruments, one after another. Then, after the music came 
to me, I had to try to play them on the piano so I could remember them." 
</P>
<P>
 Once back in the United States, "I tried everything I could not to know 
anything about Anna. Because I knew the way I was feeling the first year or 
two, I was pretty close to going back. Then I decided to let it go for good. 
But you can't forget these things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw himself into his job and his life in his rediscovered country, 
eventually settling in Orange County and opening offices in Fullerton and 
Irvine. In the '80s he limited his practice to acne cases, since in that field 
doctors are less apt to get emergency calls at 11 p.m. When he retired in 1988, 
he returned to his music.  
</P>
<P>
 He'd composed a few other songs over the years, but it was his 1940s melodies 
that called out to him, and within six months he'd formed his musical around 
them. He had them orchestrated, assembled a cast and crew, rented a hall and in 
May of 1989 debuted "Ghibli" at OCC's Moore Theater. He was so upset by flaws 
in the staging then, he said, that he didn't want to go onstage to receive 
applause at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 He was even more disappointed by the two scaled-down performances he staged 
last year in the auditorium of Huntington Beach High School. Even though he 
pans the performances, he wished critics would have come to review them.  
</P>
<P>
 "All the problems onstage aren't important because they can be corrected. What 
is important is for me to have an idea if the story is good, if the music is 
good. It's nice to have something written so that I know if I should continue 
or if I should just forget about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how is this doctor's musical?  
</P>
<P>
 I think I can say without reservation that it was altogether more enjoyable 
than the prospect of having Andrew Lloyd Webber try to remove my appendix. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangelosi loaned me a video tape of one of the 1993 shows. I can't claim 
expertise in the realm of musical theater -- unless you count playing 
fuzz-guitar in a high school adaptation of "Jesus Christ Superstar" -- but I'll 
venture a few opinions anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I liked most of the songs, which were solidly constructed and forthrightly 
emotional in the manner of Elvis' "It's Now or Never." The staging, as 
Cangelosi maintained, is fraught with problems. One dance scene, he noted, goes 
on interminably because Emile was offstage having trouble with a costume 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Cangelosi's book, though, that is the most problematic element. Between 
songs his characters fall into stilted, formulaic speech that makes it 
difficult, at best, to view them as real flesh and blood. Emile's first words 
to Anne are "Where have you been all my life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Emile's final words in the work: He has been separated from his 
love by four years of internment, then heartbreak, then near-death in the 
desert sands. Yet within seconds of being remarkably reunited with Anne, 
Cangelosi has him close with this speech: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . .Thanks to the United States of America we are again a free nation. We 
have learned our lesson: Only military strength can keep us free. Maybe all 
nations, in the future, will become civilized in the true sense of the word. 
Then all nations will guarantee the right to freedom for all. All problems will 
then be solved by common sense, by logical reasoning and by . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "And by LOVE!" Cangelosi has Anne chime in, though any woman I've ever met 
would by this point have chucked Emile back into the sandstorm and gone off 
looking for a romantic man who didn't mistake her for the UN General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't feel just in making light of Cangelosi's effort if I couldn't admit 
to having written far, far worse stuff in my life. Nobody ever sets out to 
write anything that's less than world-changing. You think you have the 
strongest, purest emotions in the world, and a glowing, hazy vision in your 
head of those feelings' ideal artistic expression, which you suppose the magic 
and mystery of the theater (or whatever chosen art form) will only make more 
profound.  
</P>
<P>
 It's never guaranteed that such visions will translate to the world outside 
your head, though. You might imagine your years of all-too human longing 
represented by a lone figure struggling against a scouring, howling sandstorm. 
And you wind up instead seeing that representation reduced to being 15 seconds 
of some guy on all fours scampering across the stage of a high school 
auditorium. Even compared to Samuel Beckett, that's bleak . 
</P>
<P>
 "With this musical I meant to show how powerful love is," Cangelosi says. 
Regardless of the opinions he receives, he says he'll keep writing songs, 
trying to express that power. He has been hoping to hear some encouraging words 
on his musical, though, saying he's at a loss to know if he should try to stage 
it again. As much as I hope he rewrites the thing a few times first, let's 
cheer him on and wish him well.

PEOPLE ONCE KNOWN AS LEPERS STILL FACE STIGMAS THAT HAVE LINGERED SINCE 
BIBLICAL TIMES. BUT A COUNTY-USC CLINIC PROVIDES A PLACE FOR THEM TO SHOW THAT 
THEIR ILLNESS IS . . .; ONLY SKIN DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was a time when Abraham Almorade would have been quarantined by the U.S. 
government, exiled to a life that excluded all except those who shared his 
mysterious and feared condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he need only visit a clinic for medication and kinship, but his burden 
is by no means slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Almorade, 65, of Los Angeles, has Hansen's disease -- known since biblical 
times as leprosy -- a difficult-to-transmit bacterial ailment that attacks body 
tissue and is controlled by medication. It has slowly eroded his body since he 
was diagnosed in the 1950s, covering his skin with sores and leaving his nose 
deformed as the cartilage collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in an examination room recently at Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center, where a clinic has served Hansen's patients since 1973, Almorade 
discussed his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's disease has robbed his hands of sensation, making it difficult to 
feel routine cuts, burns and scrapes. Without feeling, such accidents have 
become major health risks and over the years have reduced Almorade's fingers to 
stumps. As a precaution, he no longer performs tasks that might injure him, 
such as cooking or cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to protect my hands," said Almorade, a retired soldier from the 
Philippines. "They were always numb with no sense at all and I didn't want to 
hurt them. I don't cook anymore. I just eat." 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of about 500 Hansen's disease patients who visit the Los Angeles 
clinic regularly. Roughly 500 additional patients are served by clinics in San 
Diego and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leprosy is still very common around the world," said Dr. John Leedon, head of 
infectious diseases at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization estimated that in 1991 there were more than 5.5 
million cases worldwide, down from more than 10 million in the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 article in the journal Clinical Dermatology, however, said there were 
between 10 million and 15 million patients worldwide, most in Africa and India, 
and about 6,000 in the United States, primarily in Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The figures differ depending on how you count them," said Dr. John Trautman 
of the National Hansen's Disease Center in Carville, La. "The World Health 
Organization doesn't count patients who have completed drug treatment. In the 
U.S., we (do)." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe the disease is transmitted only by prolonged, close contact 
with someone who is infected, although its precise route into the body is not 
known. It causes a "significant disability" in about 30% of those infected, 
said Dr. Thomas Rea, a dermatologist who heads the clinic at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of the clinic's patients function normally day to day, often 
wearing long sleeves and explaining away their sores as bug bites and other 
minor maladies. They are all ages, although most are adults. Some have jobs, 
spouses and children. And all visit the clinic periodically to work with 
doctors at controlling their symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little to distinguish the Hansen's disease clinic from others at 
County-USC. A chair-lined hallway serves as a waiting room outside a large 
check-in desk. Patients wait quietly before being escorted to small, plain 
treatment rooms. Despite the chaos often found at a large public hospital, 
patients are treated individually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complex, because there's a whole spectrum of problems," said Dr. Jim 
Kunkel. "This clinic has been built into something that can take care of all 
types of people. (The disease) affects different people in different ways, so 
you have to take people individually." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic has become an important part of life for patients like Jesus Villa, 
52, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a haven," he said. "The doctors work with me to find out what is 
best. It's good, because I'll be taking medicine the rest of my life. I am also 
able to talk about the disease with other patients. I'm not embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rea said the disease and its treatment have changed quite a bit over the 
years, but that the image of Hansen's disease patients has changed little. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite a stigma associated with the disease," he said. "The idea of 
the patient being outcast, unclean and the lowest of the low, those things are 
reinforced in the Bible. Despite the efforts of the informed, cultural values 
seem to change very, very slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bible, which mentions leprosy more than two dozen times -- usually 
as a punishment or other negative reference -- the 1959 epic film "Ben-Hur" may 
be the most famous cultural reference to the disease. The biblical stigma 
remains so great that the emotionally loaded terms leper and leprosy are no 
longer used. In 13th-Century France, more than 2,000 facilities were built to 
house sufferers rounded up by the government during an epidemic. As late as the 
1930s, those with the disease in China were sometimes burned. And in the United 
States, laws existed in the early 1900s that allowed authorities to arrest 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were sent to so-called "leper colonies," the most famous of which was 
established on the Hawaiian island of Molokai in the 19th Century. Most of the 
colonies have been closed. The National Hansen's Disease Center, located for 
almost a century in Carville, is believed to be the only residential treatment 
center in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disease carries with it quite an emotional charge," he said. "It varies a 
lot from culture to culture. There is a difference between ethnic groups and 
within ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Though many of the clinic's patients emigrated from countries that still 
discriminate against Hansen's disease patients, many who visit the clinic say 
life in the United States is not perfect, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa, an unemployed immigrant from Mexico, said the disease not only impaired 
his ability to work -- he is arthritic and losing feeling in his legs -- but 
also affected his marriage. He and his wife recently separated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the disease," he said through a translator. "There are other 
problems, of course, but I couldn't say (the breakup) wasn't related to my 
disease. I felt embarrassed with my family and friends because, in the past, it 
was a disease that people have feared. I tended to keep to myself and away from 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa now lives alone, collecting a small Social Security pension. He must 
cook and clean for himself, endangering the limbs that lack sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sometimes feel like I'm deteriorating," he said. "I feel like my skin is 
thin and I'm constantly burning myself. When I pick up something hot, it 
doesn't feel hot. When I take a shower, it doesn't feel hot or cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wear loose clothing so it doesn't bother my skin. Now I have to focus on 
wearing comfortable shoes because it's important. I cannot drive, so I don't 
socialize." 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly a factory worker, Villa said he is embarrassed because he can no 
longer work. He anticipates having to employ someone to take care of him soon. 
</P>
<P>
 While Villa is uncertain about his future, other patients have had an easier 
time. Many report little or no trouble with the disease beyond the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go to the beach and swim," said Frederico Amador, 43, of Los 
Angeles. "That's something I can't do anymore. I'm embarrassed. I'm not able to 
wear clothes that reveal my arms, so I'm not as comfortable. Initially, I felt 
depressed. But as time goes on, it gets better."

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / PARIS; HIGH DRAMA, YES, BUT NOT ON RUNWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Expect high drama at a Karl Lagerfeld show. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, though, it had nothing to do with clothes. Well before the lights 
went up on the designer's fall '94 line Monday, a fire door slammed shut and 
water began flooding the showroom lobby. People were trapped for several long 
minutes and rumors circulated about a bomb threat by a women's group protesting 
exploitation of women via fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," protested Jacques Mouclier, president of the French Chambre 
Syndicale, organizer of the shows. Car-exhaust fumes in the underground parking 
lot set off the alarm, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another protest brewed on the other side of the fire door. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fairchild, publisher of the fashion trade newspaper Women's Wear Daily, 
let it be known that he wants no part of the Robert Altman film 
"Pret-a-Porter," on location here. People here fear it will be a fashion 
version of "The Player," the director's cutting commentary on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for Lagerfeld's show to begin, Fairchild stepped in front of the seats 
occupied by the U.S. fashion press. "It's not fair to us," he announced, 
pointing to a notice enclosed in invitations to the Christian Dior show later 
that day. The insert read: You may be featured in some of the shots. Therefore 
your presence during the event tacitly implies your consent to being in this 
film.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what they're going to do," Fairchild continued. "(This) reads 
like a legal thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour agreed. "They're setting us up," she said, 
referring to Altman and company. "Going to the Dior show is to consent to be in 
the movie. So we're not going to Dior." 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, she sent a fax to Dior saying she would attend only if the 
movie lenses were turned in other directions. Fairchild also showed up. Both, 
presumably, were out of camera range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altman is a genius -- I just hope he's doing something positive," said Andre 
Leon Tally, artistic director for Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 To those with little at stake, such as newspaper journalists, the Altman crew 
has seemed surprisingly unobtrusive. Some have wondered out loud whether this 
tempest in a cafe au lait cup isn't the fashion industry's way of getting more 
attention. The shows do seem in danger of being overpowered this season. Still, 
Lagerfeld and Dior left an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld's purple, orange and yellow stretch jersey dresses, piled on top of 
each other and over pink tights and stiletto-heeled clear plastic boots, were 
an eyeful. Look for low-priced versions soon in stores such as the Limited and 
Contempo Casuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits and jackets were the best of this show. After several seasons of 
unmatched looks, this was a collection of monochromes. Deep green, wine, navy 
and black short jackets and short skirts, both wide at the hem, gave suits the 
vigor of a double flying trapeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantsuits, rarely seen in this line, were a strong theme. Longer black 
gabardine jackets topped skinny pants that crumpled over thick-heeled shoes. 
Black stretch pants worn with long jackets in gray tweed or solid black had a 
chic, energetic quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dior, designer Gianfranco Ferre, really put on the dog, inspired by 
Altman's cameras no doubt. This collection hasn't looked so young and with-it 
in several years. Black leather minis had silver hardware that resembled 
corsets. Dior showed them with crisp white shirts. Black body wear seemed 
downright ladylike tucked under long, swashbuckling coats. 
</P>
<P>
 A furry pink Angora sweater set trimmed with pearls topped a long black 
chiffon skirt for a sweetly romantic evening look. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, "Pret-a-Porter" cast members Lauren Bacall, Kim Basinger and 
Stephen Rea made like fashion regulars, climbing onto their chairs and hopping 
up on the runway to get backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the stars have been wearing Valentino, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix 
and Calvin Klein. But at Nino Cerruti's show, the press director handed out a 
list of who is wearing his label. Basinger, Tim Robbins, Marcello Mastroianni 
and Forest Whitaker, who plays fashion designer Simone Lowenthal in the movie, 
were on it. And this season's collections will appear in the movie, too, posing 
as Lowenthal originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Costume designer Catherine Leterrier, sitting in the front row, took notes 
when the runway filled up with ankle-length man-tailored coats of pale gray 
worn over deeper gray pin-striped pants and off-white suede Oxfords. Other good 
looks included a beige suede shirt dress with a flared hem, topped by a deep 
gray rib-knit coat, both short. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie bus arrived at Jean Paul Gaultier's show, held in an abandoned train 
depot, and out stepped Sophia Loren in an enormous black hat and dark suit that 
have been her uniform this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her outfit didn't look much like the clothes on the runway. Gaultier's 
trans-Siberian fashion trip led past a folkloric montage of sheepskin jackets 
with fake-fur hoods, silk pajama pants, quilted kimonos, Chinese silk parkas 
and a few of his favorite tartan plaid kilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld crammed his Chloe collection with baby-doll clothes in candy colors. 
Furry sweaters over taffeta apron-skirts, furry sweaters over little lace 
dresses and furry dresses with pink puffy sleeves and bubble skirts were 
clothes to wear to a gooey game of Candyland. 
</P>
<P>
 To get things rolling at her show on Sunday, Vivienne Westwood put a shot of 
cognac on every chair. By the time the event started 1 1/2 hours late, a lot of 
people were ready for another round. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was one show worth waiting for. British-based Westwood is on a 
mission to preserve such English fashion traditions as hand-knit sweaters, 
tartan kilts, tweed suits and aristocratic velvet evening wear. Preserve, but 
not protect. She spins them all on their ear. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, tweed suits had cushions underneath, to give those svelte super 
models fat-lady hips. From gold damask curtain fabric worthy of Windsor Castle 
windows, Westwood cut a long evening skirt with tulip hem, and a matching vest. 
They went over a dress of gingham checks, the sort of fabric once saved for 
kitchen tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-toned plaid suits with velvet collars, pale tartan kilts with huge 
paisley stoles, crocheted roses for trim, and an assortment of royal velvet 
evening dresses fit for a queen all paid tipsy tribute to Westwood's beloved 
old England. 
</P>

CITY FOLK MOURN COUNTRY DOCTOR

 When Marcie Duthoy arrived at the hospital to have her third child, labor was 
advancing quickly and her obstetrician had yet to arrive. When the nurses urged 
her to push, Duthoy told them, "I'll wait." 
</P>
<P>
 And wait she did until her doctor, John Joseph Molitor, strolled in soon 
after. "He just said, 'OK, push,' and out she came . . ." Duthoy recalled with 
a smile eight years after the birth of her daughter, Christina. "You just saw 
those eyes over the mask and you knew everything was going to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Duthoy was one of about 200 people -- family, friends, colleagues, patients -- 
who jammed a banquet room at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton last week to 
share memories of Molitor at a reception following his funeral Mass. Molitor, 
67, died abruptly of cardiac arrest Feb. 27, just months after retiring from 
his 36-year medical practice to teach full time. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many of those on hand, Duthoy's connection with Molitor was a family 
affair in more ways than one. Her mother, Bertha Cianteo, took Molitor as a 
doctor when she moved to Orange County from Ohio in 1960, and he delivered the 
last of her children -- Mary Cianteo, now 30, who also attended the memorial 
with her mother and sister, Marcie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very patient with all us new moms," Marcie Duthoy said. "He'll be a 
tough act to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor -- Jack to his friends -- counted among his numerous professional 
accomplishments: past president of the Orange County Obstetrical and 
Gynecological Society and past chairman of the OB/GYN section of the California 
Medical Assn. He held volunteer faculty positions with USC and UC Irvine before 
joining the UCI staff full time just last July as a clinical professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who came to remember him dwelt less on his resume and more on his 
bedside manner. The picture that emerged was of a physician who knew and 
listened to his patients, a man who held onto his old-fashioned country doctor 
demeanor even as times grew more hectic and less personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would sit there and listen as if he had no other appointments," said Marie 
Keron, who was Molitor's patient from 1959 until his retirement. "He was a 
serious doctor, yet he had a wonderful sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor, who had eight children with his wife, Cynthia, delivered the last 
four of Keron's seven children. "It was a delight to have a doctor with as many 
kids as I had," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation for gentleness and for giving his full attention extended to 
co-workers. "He was as kind to the nurses as he was to the patients," said 
Eleanor Barr, who worked as a nurse at his private practice for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with hundreds of doctors over the years, and no one had anything 
bad to say about him," added Peachee Imlay, a nurse in labor and delivery at 
St. Jude since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Stehly's first memory of Molitor was of their days at Los Angeles County 
General Hospital. It was back in 1953. Stehly was a resident and Molitor was 
one of his interns, fresh out of medical school at Loyola University in 
Chicago. Stehly told Molitor of a new hospital planned for the sleepy but 
growing bedroom community of Fullerton, and of his own plans to start a private 
practice there in obstetrics and gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw in him a fantastic man," Stehly said. "I was the one who talked him 
into going into OB." Molitor went back to Chicago to do his residency, then 
took Stehly's invitation to join his "rural" Fullerton practice in 1958, one 
year after the opening of St. Jude. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, the two doctors carried out 75 deliveries a month, split 
between three area hospitals. "We dared each other to take a vacation," Stehly 
said. Molitor delivered the last three of Stehly's children and Stehly 
reciprocated by delivering the last four of Molitor's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they worked only at St. Jude, and in 1964 they added a third 
partner, Edwin B. Whiting. The partnership held together until the doctors 
began retiring in the late '80s. "Many, many practices broke up along the way. 
Ours just hung in there," Whiting recalled last week. Molitor, he said, "was 
the glue that held it together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Molitor came to Fullerton in the midst of a population boom that would 
take it from an isolated outpost of less than 14,000 in 1950 to a booming 
suburb of more than 56,000 in 1960. That growth continued, leading to today's 
sprawling university town of nearly 120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor was at the front lines of the baby boom that helped populate north 
Orange County, and his memorial was well-attended by former patients as well as 
a scattering of those he helped bring into the world. Several patients said 
they attended out of a need to talk with others who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just admired him," said Diana Golden, a patient for 32 years. "He listened. 
He was always interested in more than my physical condition." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was pregnant for the fourth time after giving birth to three sons, 
Molitor assured Golden, "This one's going to be a girl, Diana, I know it," 
Golden recalled, pausing for comic effect. "So when Larry was born, I looked at 
him and said, 'You promised me a girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Lawton, chief of staff at St. Jude, remembered Molitor as "a doctor's 
doctor" and as the "most well-read" doctor he knew -- one who took a particular 
interest in bioethics. Molitor served as chairman of the hospital's bioethics 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "His way of doing it was to make sure everyone could do their part well," said 
Ken Schemmer, a general surgeon at St. Jude who served on the committee with 
Molitor. "After the first time you were there, he knew you by name." Molitor's 
faith as a Catholic also came into play, Schemmer said. "He had a definite 
sense of God, and God's presence in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Molitor's sons went on to become doctors. Christopher, an orthopedic 
surgeon who practices in Northern California, remembers going into surgery with 
him to watch, when he was still a student. 
</P>
<P>
 What he learned from his father, however, went beyond technical matters. "I 
think it's always important to remember that you're there working for the 
patient," Christopher Molitor said. "That sounds obvious, but believe me, it's 
not always done."

FAMILY; CO-PARENTS HELP KIDS OF DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Co-parenting -- through which both parents attempt to stay involved in their 
children's lives after divorce -- is an increasingly common strategy against 
shattered-family syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 80% of divorced parents say they are co-parents, meaning that 
they have put aside their anger for the sake of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But in researching her new study, "Families Apart" (Putnam's), Melinda Blau 
found that there were no ground rules for co-parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these mothers and fathers were muddling through, she discovered, 
learning not to obliterate the differences that separated them but to put them 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 For divorced parents trying to cooperate, the message turns out to be positive 
-- even with no real guidelines -- Blau says. The key elements are time and 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, most of the co-parents she surveyed characterized themselves as 
"extremely hostile" or "moderately angry" in the first year after divorce. When 
asked later to identify factors that improved co-parenting, 83% cited the 
passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as many answered positively to Blau's question: "If I don't agree with 
my ex's standards or approach to child-rearing, I can accept that we're 
different." ELIZABETH MEHREN

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: ENOUGH LAUGHTER TO FILL A HARD HAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Scene: Sunday's eighth annual American Comedy Awards at the Shrine 
Exposition Hall. The two-hour special will be broadcast on ABC in early May. 
"It's one of the great award shows," said John Larroquette. "Right up there 
with 'The Jackson Family Honors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The show was emceed by Chevy Chase, produced by George 
Schlatter and written by Bruce Vilanch. Among the 1,000 guests, presenters and 
nominees were Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Rosie Perez, Lily Tomlin, Sid 
Ganis, Jack Klugman, Bea Arthur, Rita Rudner, Richard Belzer, Jonathan Winters, 
Mary Tyler Moore, Jack Carter, Ant, Larry "Bud" Melman, Tim Allen, Imogene 
Coca, and Diane Sawyer and her husband, Mike Nichols, who received the Creative 
Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The Layout: Toward the front of the almost football-field-size room were the 
celebrity tables. The back had the bookers, agents and junior varsity comics. 
To walk from one end of the hall to the other was like going from a Beverly 
Hills schmoozefest to a raucous happy hour in a Midwest comedy club. Tim Allen 
said in the room's rear he saw "every guy I worked with on the road for the 
past 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Black tie. Many tuxedos had seen hard service in Las Vegas 
lounges. The room abounded in comedians' girlfriends in tight black dresses and 
important mascara. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statement: A number of women commented on voluptuous comic Rhonda 
Shear appearing in an apparently shrink-wrap mini-skirt. "Flipper would wear 
something with more give," noted one woman. "I hope it doesn't explode." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "We take the awards very seriously," said producer Schlatter. "The 
night we have fun with. That's the reason people come -- it's about comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Sign It's Time to Stop With the Ribbons: Heaping platters of red AIDS 
ribbons were brought around by staffers during the cocktail hour like waiters 
serving hors d'oeuvres. "Have you been offered your ribbon?" they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Favors: Each seat had a hard hat, presumably given for earthquake readiness, 
not for food fights. (Candice Bergen said she already had two in her bedroom; 
according to Schlatter, Jack Nicholson took four with him.) One guest said the 
hats were there to see how many creme brulees could be stuffed into one.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moment: Publicists rearranging the place settings so their clients 
would get better camera time by being seated next to someone more famous.

LONG TRAIL OF A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN JUSTICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though Hansen's disease has existed since ancient times, it wasn't until the 
early part of this century that treatment other than quarantine was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the Norwegian physician who pinpointed the bacteria in 1873, 
Hansen's disease attacks body tissue slowly, and symptoms can take several 
years to appear. Left untreated, it can cause skin sores and discoloration, 
pain, blindness and accidental mutilation caused by loss of feeling in the 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still not completely understood by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its reputation as highly contagious, scientists now believe it can be 
transmitted only by repeated, long-term, human-to-human contact with a carrier. 
But evidence that Hansen's also can afflict armadillos may suggest unknown 
transmission routes, according to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment is still developing, said Dr. Thomas Rea, a dermatologist who heads 
the Hansen's disease clinic at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, the drug dapsone stopped the spread of the disease by halting 
the bacteria's ability to multiply. But it did not kill the bacteria that 
already existed, and scientists soon found patients who were resistant to 
dapsone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, multi-drug therapy was recommended by the World Health 
Organization. This worked so well that the organization declared a goal to cure 
Hansen's disease worldwide by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rea doubts the goal will be reached. Belgian scientist S.R. Pattyn 
released a study recently showing a 20% relapse rate after 10 years of 
multi-drug therapy, Rea said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the most die-hard optimist would admit that's not acceptable," he said. 
More effective drugs were discovered in 1990, but Rea said they are expensive 
and have not yet been proven safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most cases are imported into the United States -- Rea said he has never 
seen a case originate in California -- stopping the inflow has proven 
difficult. Patients are supposed to receive treatment before entering the 
United States, said Dr. John Trautman of the National Hansen's Disease Center, 
but the long incubation period and lack of a simple detection method makes the 
disease hard to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trautman: "The best way to control it in the U.S. is to control it 
worldwide." GLEN JUSTICE

STIRRING RECOLLECTIONS FROM A NATIVE DAUGHTER; THEATER: PROTESTS IN ROMANIA ARE 
THE BACKDROP FOR OANA-MARIA HOCK'S 'THE ALMOND SELLER,' WHICH OPENS THURSDAY AT 
UCI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early summer of 1990, playwright Oana-Maria Hock visited her native 
Romania. What she found was a country struggling to find itself after a 
revolution that abolished Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's reviled dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, had been executed a few 
months before, and Romania's new leader, Ion Iliescu, faced a crisis as 
hundreds of students fought with thousands of miners in Bucharest over the 
direction the new government was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hock witnessed the protests and riots in the streets. Fearing the violence, 
she eventually retreated to her hotel room, wondering if Romania would ever 
recover. In the wake of that experience, the 40-year-old dramatist wrote "The 
Almond Seller," which has its West Coast premiere Thursday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, one of seven by Hock that have been produced in theaters from New 
York to San Diego since she immigrated to the United States in 1980, uses the 
bloody battle between the miners and students as a backdrop. Thrown into this 
real-life event are Hock's central creations: three young Romanians and the 
title character, who is an almond seller and gravedigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Romanians are men, once close and now fighting on opposite sides. 
The third is a female journalist, now living in the United States, who returns 
to naively "do a photographic essay of free Romania." 
</P>
<P>
 As described in a 1991 New York Times review of the play's U.S. premiere, 
she's the heroine "caught up by the siege of events . . . clear that she has 
returned too late. As the playwright indicates, to know a revolution one must 
live through it -- or die in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "The Almond Seller" is a political play. But Hock, who now lives in 
Montreal, was quick to dismiss any notions that her work has an overriding 
political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it that way. I see it more as a theatrical meditation about the 
meaning of being a Romanian," she said in a recent telephone interview. "It's 
about a country that has been mutilated by Communism . . . it's about Romania's 
struggle for a collective identity in the middle of this new social order." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hock noted that "The Almond Seller" is highly symbolic, despite the use of 
recent history as an anchor. The almond seller, for instance, roots for relics 
in a mass grave, finding "a holy mess" of bones, spoons and wild radishes that 
Hock said are metaphors for Romania's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is certainly a mythical character," she explained. "He knows that the 
people are in crisis and must dig into their past to find truth. You have to 
dig very deep, be very passionate about it, to find yourself, your cultural 
self. Without that, you can't move on to your future." 
</P>
<P>
 As for that future, Hock is optimistic. She said the Romanian people are in 
the midst of a rocky rebirth that will take a long time; shifting from 
socialism to democracy is a hard transition. But Hock believes that Romania 
eventually will "advance politically, artistically and economically." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when Hock doubted that could happen. Before coming to the 
United States, she was a drama critic for the state-run National Theater in 
Bucharest. Her experiences provided a microcosm for the repression that 
affected the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
 All plays were censored, as well as her reviews and essays. The Ceausescu 
government banned certain writers, including Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco, 
for their nihilistic views; other dramatists were outlawed for their political 
bents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she said, this oppression created a theater of subtle defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living under Ceausescu was such a nightmare, and the theater was one . . . 
escape," Hock said. "Paradoxically, it was a very good theater (both 
underground and in mainstream arenas) because metaphor was used at the highest 
level. We couldn't express anything in a direct way, so allegory had to be 
clever enough to fool them." 
</P>
<P>
 In her visits following Ceausescu's overthrow, Hock has been buoyed by the 
regeneration in the stage that has come with new freedoms. It will take a while 
before the events are placed in perspective ("artists are too close to it now," 
she said), but Hock feels it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also hopeful that there won't be a repeat of the violence she observed 
in 1990. Hock said she was horrified when 7,000 miners attacked students -- 
many who protested that Communists had been retained in the new government, 
which they claimed was dictatorial -- after Iliescu publicly denounced the 
students on television. The miners, it was alleged, had been operating under 
orders from Iliescu or his subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible; you felt it was coming out of the legacy of Ceausescu," Hock 
said. "The miners were acting out of the repressed anger of that regime. It was 
the effect of living under violence for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 As for her own future, Hock plans to return to Romania again, maybe in the 
fall, to produce one of her plays there for the first time. She isn't sure but 
thinks it may be "Waiting for Godot to Leave," a still-unfinished piece that 
picks up where Beckett's famous absurdist comedy, "Waiting for Godot," leaves 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hock also would like to visit Orange County to see UCI's production of "The 
Almond Seller," which is being directed by her longtime friend, drama professor 
Annie Loui. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Annie understands what I'm trying to do with my writing. She has a 
wonderful way of visualizing it," Hock said. "I'm not sure I'll be able to 
come, but I'd love to see it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * UC Irvine's production of Oana-Maria Hock's "The Almond Seller" opens 
Thursday at 8 p.m. in the Fine Arts Studio Theatre, UC Irvine. Performances 
continue Friday and Saturday and Wednesday through March 19 at 8 p.m. $6 to $8. 
(714) 856-6616 or (714) 856-5000.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEW ABC SHOW, OLD TV PLOY; TELEVISION: 'TURNING POINT' 
PREMIERES TONIGHT BY EVOKING THE SPECTER OF CHARLES MANSON. THAT'S ONE WAY FOR 
THE NETWORK TO ENSURE NOTICE FOR ITS NEWSMAGAZINE.

 Travels with Charlie. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The grin, so twisted and sinister. The eyes, shiny black currants under a tiny 
swastika branded into his forehead. The rambling rages, right on cue. 
</P>
<P>
 The great thing about Charlie Manson is that he's always there for you. He's 
steady, he's reliable. Like a coat on a hook, he's accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been there for Geraldo Rivera. He's been there for "Hard Copy." He's been 
there for "A Current Affair." And if you've a new series that you want to 
launch with a bankable sociopath who knows from years of experience how to put 
on a good show for the camera, he'll be there for you, too. Take tonight, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Sawyer to Charlie: "Is Charlie Manson crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie to Diane: "Sure he's crazy, mad as a hatter, what difference does it 
make? You know, a long time ago, being crazy meant something. Nowadays 
everybody's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At last, sane words from the 59-year-old wild man. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays everybody is crazy. At least you can get that impression from 
watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be too hard on the ABC News program "Turning Point" for starting life as 
a weekly series tonight with an hour titled "The Manson Women: Inside the 
Murders." The producers may have had no choice. Jeffrey Dahmer probably wasn't 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dateline NBC" had him Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, long-imprisoned, middle-aged "Manson girls" Leslie Van Houten and 
Patricia Krenwinkel get the bulk of camera time with Sawyer on "Turning Point." 
But Manson haunts the entire hour, and the manacled life-termer is occasionally 
trotted in from the wings to provide just the right touch of deranged frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are interesting studies, and you have to hand it to "Turning Point" 
for knowing how to suspensefully restage grisly homicide. But why a program 
that recounts the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders for the umpteenth time without 
adding any real insight? Why put this foot forward? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not open the series with a fresher topic instead of exhuming America's 
preeminent bogyman and his former disciples? 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is the age of screaming tabloid sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC apparently felt that its zillion-dollar co-anchor Sawyer alone could not 
be counted on to hold the expected big audience from the preceding "Home 
Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire." Not when the furor over the scheduled 
parole of an Oregon murderer is the theme of competing "48 Hours" on CBS and 
five homicides are the grist of NBC's "Law & Order." No, evoking the specter of 
the creepy Manson was the only way for ABC to ensure that its new program gets 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 And listen, if it works, and "Turning Point" survives, hand out the party 
favors and bring these kids back for the anniversary show. It's what happens 
when everybody is crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet Thunder: In a curious way, TV is constantly in transition -- a 
succession of turning points, shifting from one familiarity to another. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's new comedy series "Thunder Alley," for example, perpetuates the 
impression of prime time being a sprawling day-care center. The premiere 
tonight introduces Ed Asner as Gil Jones, a former race car driver whose 
routine is disrupted when his divorced daughter (Diane Venora) and her three 
children come to live with him in the apartment above the garage he operates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-year-old Gil's biggest fear is that the grandkids will damage his 
classic record collection, and he and his daughter clash over child rearing. 
For awhile, his general surliness and lack of affection make him refreshingly 
unlikable, but ultimately he sheds this disguise and reveals himself to be one 
of TV's stock characters, the grouch with a heart of cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asner is a very good actor whose track record is proof that all he needs to 
make audiences laugh is a funny script. But his opening is much less humorous 
than humdrum, and the comic lightning implicit in the title fails to strike. 
</P>

 Deadly Games: What do "Beavis and Butt-head" and the Oscar-winning "The Deer 
Hunter" have in common? Perhaps nothing, perhaps everything. 
</P>
<P>
 When MTV's mentally challenged cartoon stars were accused of being an evil 
influence on the younger set, MTV yanked these primitives from their 
early-evening time slot and redeployed them later in the evening. A reasonable 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet was KTLA-TV Channel 5 acting reasonably in airing "The Deer Hunter" as a 
two-parter in its 8-10 p.m. movie slot Monday and Tuesday? Wasn't this the same 
"The Deer Hunter" whose extended, incredibly violent Russian roulette sequences 
were blamed for a string of Russian roulette fatalities that occurred after the 
Vietnam movie was widely shown on TV in the early 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
 You hate even to consider restricting work as memorable as "The Deer Hunter." 
Despite charges when it was released that the Russian roulette sequences 
distorted reality, they were brilliantly executed and anything but gratuitous. 
Moreover, it's impossible for TV to guard against all negative influences, 
given that a deranged viewer conceivably could imagine getting a violent 
message from something as benign as ABC's "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when a violent movie seems to have inspired gun-shooting copycats in the 
past -- when there appears to be a demonstrable record of it -- isn't it 
irresponsible to return it to TV? 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, "The Deer Hunter" seems to have a destructive impact on a 
handful of viewers. Removing the Russian roulette sequences would be creative 
butchery and would render much of the movie incomprehensible. Yet showing them 
may result in real-life butchery.

REMAPPING THE LOCAL ART SCENE; GALLERIES: DEALERS ARE RETRENCHING AND 
DOWNSIZING TO COPE WITH FINANCIAL REALITIES, BUT THEY ARE ALSO FORMING NEW 
ALLIANCES AND MOVING TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. 
</P>

 "Musical chairs is part of the creative energy in the art community," says 
veteran photography dealer G. Ray Hawkins. If so, Southern California's 
ever-changing art gallery scene is not as depressed as it may appear -- it may 
be in the process of rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 From West Hollywood to Santa Monica, art dealers are on the move -- 
retrenching and downsizing to cope with financial realities of the 1990s, but 
also forming new alliances and hanging their shingles on different spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the current upheaval -- including plans for a major new gallery 
complex in Santa Monica, the addition of New York powerhouse Pace/Wildenstein 
and the loss of the venerable James Corcoran Gallery -- will require a new map 
of the region's commercial artistic showcases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery complex is pending final approval of the Santa Monica City 
Council, which is expected in about 10 days, according to Howard Robinson, 
Santa Monica's real estate manager. It will be called Bergamot Station, after a 
Red Car trolley station that once occupied the property at 26th Street and 
Olympic Boulevard, just south of the Water Garden complex. The development will 
occupy a 5.5-acre, city-owned site. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne and Shoshana Blank, owners of the Shoshana Wayne Gallery, plan to turn 
five industrial buildings on the site into a cultural complex, including art 
galleries, architects' offices, nonprofit enterprises and a cafe. The couple 
are closing their downtown Santa Monica gallery at the end of the month in 
preparation for their move to Bergamot Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other well-established art and photography dealers have confirmed 
plans to join the project, including Burnett Miller, Patricia Faure and Craig 
Krull of West Hollywood, Peter Fetterman of Santa Monica and Dorothy Goldeen, 
who recently moved from Santa Monica to temporary quarters in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 (Miller closed his La Brea Avenue gallery after suffering earthquake damage. 
Rent increases have forced Faure to close Asher/Faure on Almont Avenue. Krull 
is striking out on his own after a six-year association with dealer Jan Turner 
at Turner/Krull Gallery on Melrose Avenue.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among other dealers planning to join the project are Ernie Wolfe, who 
specializes in African art, and collector Tom Patchett, who will launch a 
showcase for glass art. Hawkins says he will stay on Colorado Avenue, where he 
has a lease, but he is considering opening a smaller space in the new 
development. Blank is having discussions about relocating with dance and 
theater groups as well. Bob Barkume, who operates Cafe Bene at Fred Segal in 
Santa Monica, will own and operate Gallery Cafe at Bergamot Station, Blank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The site -- which in recent years has been used for the manufacture of water 
heaters -- offers a collegial community, security, easy freeway access, 
proximity to Westside collectors and plenty of parking. "What's good about it 
is that it doesn't have the look of a mall," Faure said. "It's industrial and 
more serious." 
</P>
<P>
 The major draw is low rent, however. At 75 cents a square foot, the rent is 
about half the price many dealers are paying at other locations. "I'd rather 
spend money on people than rent," said Faure, who has reduced her staff as her 
rent has risen and the art market has languished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling art at 1983 prices and paying 1989 rent. We just can't do it," 
Wayne Blank said of Southern California dealers. "Lower rents will give us a 
big boost, but that isn't the only issue. We want to put some energy back into 
the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project comes with risks, however, including a lack of leases. The city of 
Santa Monica purchased the property in 1984 for rail-related use that has not 
developed. Bergamot Station will be rented on a month-to-month basis because 
city officials want to retain "flexibility" in their use of the site, Robinson 
said. But the arts complex could only be displaced by a transportation-related 
project, he said, and no such project is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank said he wouldn't be pouring his own resources into the development if he 
didn't believe it has a future. Pointing to the city's active arts commission 
and his own relationship with the city -- established earlier when he 
transformed a vacant hangar at the Santa Monica Airport into artists' studios 
-- he said the development reaffirms Santa Monica's commitment to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project proceeds as expected, construction will begin on April 1, some 
galleries will open in the summer and inaugural festivities will be held in the 
fall, Blank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important new destination for the art crowd will likely be a West 
Coast branch of Pace/Wildenstein. The gallery was formed last October when 
Wildenstein & Co., one of the world's largest dealers of Impressionist and Old 
Master paintings, acquired a 49% interest in Pace Gallery, a leading dealer in 
contemporary art. A gallery spokeswoman confirmed Pace/Wildenstein's intention 
to launch a gallery in Los Angeles but declined to comment on the probable 
location or opening date. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Southern California has lost the James Corcoran Gallery, which 
represented major artists who emerged in Los Angeles during the 1960s. The 
gallery closed at the end of February, more than a year after its demise was 
first rumored. Corcoran had been dividing his time between the Santa Monica 
showcase and C&M Arts, a New York gallery that he launched in 1992 with 
investment banker and contemporary art collector Robert Mnuchin. Now he will 
concentrate on the New York operation. Sandra Starr, Corcoran's longtime 
gallery director, will pursue independent curatorial projects in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other Santa Monica moves, the John Thomas Gallery is temporarily 
residing at 1831 Colorado Ave. while seeking a new home. Remba Gallery has 
closed its Santa Monica space, but plans to reopen in April at 464 N. Robertson 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Hollywood -- still a gallery stronghold -- dealer Michael Kohn has 
terminated an association with Jan Abrams and moved next door to join Turner in 
a new venture, Kohn Turner Gallery. The partnership will be launched on April 
14 with an exhibition of Mark Innerst's paintings. Abrams has changed the name 
of the former Kohn Abrams Gallery to the Jan Abrams Gallery, which she will 
operate alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A change is also in the works at the Jan Kesner Gallery. The second floor of 
the La Brea Avenue storefront will become the Annex, a showcase for emerging 
artists operated by Charles LaBelle, an independent curator who has worked for 
Kesner. The Annex will open on Friday with a show of Kymber Holt's work.

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; MAD FOR TRADITION; RUTH ANN SWENSON TAKES ON THE LEAD IN 
'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' AS DONIZETTI MIGHT HAVE ENVISIONED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles saw a production of "Lucia di Lammermoor" last year in which the 
walls of the castle tilted and tumbled to reflect the titular heroine's 
increasingly distressed mental state . . . A year earlier, the Metropolitan 
Opera gave New York a "Lucia" in which the characters picked their way through 
open coffins and chapel ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County will have no such luck when Opera Pacific presents a thoroughly 
traditional staging of Donizetti's popular 50th opera today through March 19 in 
Costa Mesa. And that's fine with Ruth Ann Swenson, who sings the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for creating new ideas and, I guess, finding new ways to interpret 
opera," Swenson, 33, said in a recent phone interview. "But I must say, I tend 
to lean toward the traditional type of staging. 
</P>
<P>
 "These operas -- the Donizettis, the Verdis -- were written in such a way that 
they were meant to be done in traditional form and tell the story in the time 
that it was meant to be, with the scenery the way it was meant to be and with 
the costumes it was meant to be in," she said. "I think the composer had that 
in mind when he was writing. He didn't know what was going to be going on in 
1993-94. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like it when it's traditional." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the rising stars of opera, Swenson sang "Lucia" in Washington, Detroit, 
Dallas and in the Metropolitan Opera's summer parks concerts. She will sing it 
again in the fall in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Bronxville, in Westchester County, New York, Swenson grew up on Long 
Island. Both her parents were high-school teachers, who also sang but not in 
opera. She described them as "professionals, but not on a grand scale." She was 
the eldest of three children, and the only girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a musical family," she said. "I was surrounded by music growing up, 
but it was nothing we were pushed into. We liked it. But I can remember sitting 
in the car one day when my mom had the Saturday matinee broadcast from the Met 
on, saying, 'Do we have to listen to this? I don't like it.' Now look at me. 
I'm on the broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
 She had found her niche in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played oboe; I was in band, chorus and orchestra, I did it all," she said. 
"I started taking singing lessons in high school. Then I just decided I just 
wanted to sing, to be an opera singer." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to study at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia for three 
years and then went into the Merola Opera Program at the San Francisco Opera, 
touring with the Western Opera Theater affiliated with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the tours, she met Mark Rucker, who sings Lucia's brother Enrico in 
Costa Mesa; on another, she met her husband, baritone David Burnakus, who still 
sings in the San Francisco Opera Chorus. The two were married in 1986 and have 
a home in Napa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it about six weeks out of the year," Swenson said. "This is not a 
glamorous life, like people think. It's not all fun and games. It's hard. You 
live out of suitcases, staying in hotel rooms. It's lonely. You have to learn 
to cope with all the traveling." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband is only able to travel with her "at times, when he's not working," 
she said. "But he'll be coming down for this, though."  
</P>
<P>
 Swenson described her voice as a "lyric-coloratura. I have a good range. I was 
blessed with a good middle, and I also developed it. I can sing from a high 
E-natural to a low G. I can sing a high F in a bathtub on a good day. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not a high, high flutey coloratura, who can hang upon the Fs. I'm not 
a Queen of the Night. But I think I have broader range than most in my fach, 
whatever that is . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, people sang what they could sing. If they could sing the 
role, they sang it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sing the things that are comfortable for me -- most of the bel canto 
things. Yet I can also sing what they call the soubrette repertoire, which 
doesn't call for the high extension." 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Lucia," which she called "a very demanding role," she said, "I love 
singing all the cadenzas and the roulades and the coloratura passages. It's all 
great for me. I enjoy it. I would love to sing Puccini, but when I can do this, 
why sing that? I could sing Mimi. I could. But there are so many other things 
I'd rather perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson is not haunted by such famous Lucias as Callas and Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly have always admired their artistry and what they brought to the 
role and the legends of their performance," she said. "Of course, the thing 
they brought to the role was special. Hopefully, I can bring what Ruth Ann can 
bring. I won't copy them. I try to bring and sing what I can bring to the 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruth Ann Swenson will sing the title role of Donizetti's "Lucia di 
Lammermoor" for Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $15 to $75 (student and senior rush: $15 for 
unsold seats one hour prior to curtain). Performances today, Friday, March 17 
and 19 at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. (714) 556-2787.

OPERA PACIFIC GOES WITH SURE BETS; MUSIC: GENERAL DIRECTOR DAVID DICHIERA SAYS 
THE COMPANY IS 'AIMING AT 90%-PLUS ATTENDANCE' IN '94-95 WITH SUCH RELIABLES AS 
'TRAVIATA' AND 'BUTTERFLY.' 
</P>

 In an express effort to maximize box office, Opera Pacific has picked four 
warhorses for its 1994-95 season -- Verdi's "Aida" and "La Traviata," Puccini's 
"Madama Butterfly" and Mozart's "The Magic Flute." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are clearly aiming at 90%-plus attendance," general director David 
DiChiera said Tuesday. "This season -- 'Die Walkure,' 'Faust' and 'Lucia' -- 
the percentage of house was not among our highest. It's going to be around 80% 
-- but that 10% difference between 80% and 90% is very critical in terms of our 
earned income." 
</P>
<P>
 DiChiera estimated the 1994-95 budget to be $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casting is my focus next year," DiChiera said. "It's with artists who are 
particularly interesting and controversial and intriguing and will make singing 
even very well-known operas interesting and exciting. (Soprano) Tiziana 
Fabbricini, for instance, is going to create a great deal of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabbricini, one of two Violettas scheduled for "Traviata," generated huge 
controversy in the role when she sang it at La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera in 
New York, the Vienna Staatsoper and the Berlin Opera. Critics and audiences 
were divided over her intense acting and, some said, erratic vocal production. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific has presented all three of the Italian operas before, but the 
productions next season will be different. "Aida" was created for the San 
Francisco Opera in 1981 by Douglas Schmidt and Lawrence Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The production of "La Traviata" is new and was created for the Lyric Opera of 
Chicago by Desmond Heeley; it will be seen for the first time on the West 
Coast. "Butterfly" will be a new production by Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Butterfly' continues to come at the top of our request list," DiChiera 
said. "It amazes me the public response that 'Butterfly' gets." 
</P>
<P>
 The sets and costumes for "The Magic Flute" were created by David Hockney for 
the Glydebourne Festival in England and presented by the San Francisco Opera in 
1987. They will be seen for the first time in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced that its 1995-96 season will include Verdi's 
"Otello" with Vladimir Atlantov and Bizet's "Carmen." OPERA PACIFIC

RULING ALLOWING PARODIES SHOCKS MANY MUSIC EXECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top music industry executives were stunned by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on 
Monday that allows musicians to parody artistic works for profit with little 
fear of copyright infringement suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm astonished," said Martin Bandier, chairman of EMI Music Publishing, which 
controls copyrights for hundreds of thousands of songs including the music of 
John Lennon and Paul McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling strips musical authors, composers and songwriters of valuable 
property rights, elevating free speech to an absurd level." 
</P>
<P>
 Les Bider, chairman of Warner Chappell, the giant music publishing arm of Time 
Warner, which controls copyrights for such artists as Elton John and Prince, 
also expressed disappointment over the ruling involving the rap group 2 Live 
Crew's parody of the Roy Orbison hit "Oh, Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should be allowed to make money by copying another artist's hard 
work," he said. "It's just not what the concept of fair use is about. When a 
song is copied for commercial use, publishers and composers should be 
compensated for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Monday's ruling sends a signal to parodists that fair use 
no longer applies merely to spoofs performed live one-time only, but to comedic 
tunes recorded on best-selling albums that generate huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although artists may still be liable to pay royalties if too much of the 
original is used, composers can no longer hope to stop a legitimate parody, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling stems from a 1990 lawsuit filed by Nashville publishers Acuff-Rose 
against the 2 Live Crew for recording a raunchy take-off of "Oh, Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Acuff-Rose refused the Miami rap group permission to record the song and 
initiated legal action when the group recorded it anyway, charging the group's 
"vulgar" treatment of the composition tarnished the value of the 1964 
composition. The publishing firm won a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's reversal marked the first time the court has spoken directly on how a 
parody is to be treated under the Copyright Act of 1976 -- which exempts "fair 
use" of material for purposes such as criticism and comment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the court acknowledged that there is no simple formula to determine when 
a parody has infringed a copyright, the justices ruled that a parody done for 
profit -- even if it is not done in "good taste" and could damage the value of 
original work -- does not violate the copyright law. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Baumgarten, an attorney whose firm represents the heirs of such 
songwriters as Cole Porter and George Gershwin, was one of the few industry 
figures contacted who downplayed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
 "While the ruling opens the door some, the court did not declare open season 
on copyright owners," said Baumgarten, whose firm filed a brief supporting 
Acuff-Rose. "The proof of the pudding is the justices sent the case back to the 
district court to examine specific factual issues on infringement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court referred the case to a lower court to re-evaluate how much 
of the song was used by 2 Live Crew and how sales of its version may have 
damaged Acuff-Rose's market for the original composition. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts interviewed Tuesday speculated that the lower court will again 
side with 2 Live Crew -- echoing a 1991, ruling by a federal judge in Nashville 
who determined the song did not infringe on the 1964 song's copyright.

SERENDIPITY TO LEAVE MID-SIZE CORONET IN JULY; THEATER: FINANCIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS FORCE THE GROUP, WHICH PUTS ON CHILDREN'S PLAYS, TO DOWNSIZE. 
THE COMPANY HOPES TO TOUR SMALL SITES.

 After four years and 30 shows, the Serendipity Theatre Co., which took over 
the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles in the summer of 1990 as a resident 
professional children's theater, is leaving the mid-size Equity house on La 
Cienega Boulevard at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director Scott Davidson said that although "we're very pleased with 
what we've been able to accomplish," financial considerations are forcing the 
company to downsize. Davidson blames "a lack of press," natural and man-made 
disasters, a subscriber base that has shrunk from 3,000 to 2,500 because "a lot 
of our subscribers have moved away" and the belief that in the current economy 
"most people consider theater a frill or an extravagance." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were contemplating this in December because we had not had strong walk-up, 
strong houses," said Davidson. "We began to realize we needed to reconsider 
before we launched into a fifth year there." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's goal is to "stay together as a production company and tour to 
small sites, with smaller seasons. All of that is predicated on securing 
locations and finding a facility. Even though we won't be producing full time, 
we still have to have a space where we can store costumes and properties, 
rehearse and construct. It would be nice if we could eventually find a 
subsidized home." 
</P>
<P>
 Serendipity is "potentially" set to do several shows at the Norris Theatre in 
Rolling Hills Estates as part of the theater's children's series in 1994-95, 
according to Davidson and the Norris' Michelle Roberge. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson and executive director Jody Davidson, his wife, are "considering a 
move to the East Coast," however, and in that event, Scott said that he was 
"sure" that managing director Katy Henk would take over the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the run of the comedy "Amelia Bedelia," which ends on April 10, 
Serendipity will close its residency at the Coronet with "Anne of Green Gables" 
(April-May) and "The True Story of the Three Little Pigs" (June-July).

 Director Adisa and writer Avery O. Williams' 24-minute "Notes in a Minor Key," 
took the first prize of $3,000 in the Black American Cinema Society's 12th 
annual African American independent filmmakers' competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an evocative and powerful vignette in which a grandfather (Keith David), 
once a jazz musician on the cusp of fame, reveals a terrible secret to his 
grandson.Judging was held last Saturday at Eastman Kodak in Hollywood. Previous 
winners include "Daughters of the Dust" director Julie Dash, actress-filmmaker 
Saundra Sharp and the Hudlin Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,000 second prize went to Angela de Joseph's poignant 20-minute "It's in 
the Bag," an ironic fable in which a near-mute homeless woman ( Iona Morris) 
presents a valid coupon for a free make-over at a posh Beverly Hills beauty 
salon. The third prize, worth $1,000, was awarded to Cal Ward Jr.'s audacious 
20-minute "The Rally," a contemporary satire skewering racism and expressed in 
a homage to Mack Sennett comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three honorable mentions of $250 were awarded to VernAnthony Pringle's 
15-minute "Men, Myths and Dogs," Craig Ross Jr.'s "The 22nd Floor" and Damon 
Lee's "Ballad of Sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Awards will be presented April 7 at 8 p.m. at the Wilshire Ebell Theater, 4401 
W. 8th St.

WHY 'TURNING POINT' FOCUSES ON MANSON; TELEVISION: ABC NEWS PRESIDENT ROONE 
ARLEDGE SAYS THE TOPIC OF THE PREMIERE IS A 'PRAGMATIC AND DELIBERATE' EFFORT 
TO SNAG VIEWERS EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 ABC News President Roone Arledge acknowledged Tuesday that the network is 
kicking off its documentary-style series "Turning Point" with an hour about 
Charles Manson and his followers in hopes of bringing viewers into the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the Manson show first, Arledge told a news conference here, "was a 
pragmatic and deliberate act on our part. It is not necessarily representative 
of all the areas we want to cover. But we do want people to know the show is on 
the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "Turning Point" -- which will focus on a single subject each week, unlike 
ABC's three other prime-time news programs, "20/20," "Day One" and "PrimeTime 
Live" -- is the first new series that will be co-anchored by Diane Sawyer under 
her new, $6-million-a-year contract with ABC. She and Barbara Walters will be 
the main anchors for "Turning Point," with Peter Jennings contributing several 
programs each season. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Sawyer said she believes the story of Manson 
followers Leslie Van Houton and Patricia Krenwinkel has journalistic merit. She 
interviewed them and Manson in prison, where they are serving life sentences 
for the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a story about what it's like for these women to face 
themselves," Sawyer said. "These were middle-class homecoming queens in the 
culture of the 1960s; how did they end up going off with Charlie Manson?" 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with Manson is an illustration of the role that sensational crime 
stories are playing in a crowded field that, with "Turning Point," is occupied 
by 10 prime-time network news programs. ABC's newsmagazine "Day One" has gone 
on to do many kinds of stories since its premiere one year ago, but the series 
debuted with a story about a man who'd been tried for using the AIDS virus as a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do a mix of stories," Arledge said of "Turning Point," "not 
simply the ones that we know will get a rating." Future programs will include 
investigative pieces on "slave labor" in the United States and the murder of 
Amy Biehl, an American student in South Africa. Among Jennings' programs will 
be historical pieces on the uprising in Tian An Men Square and on D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who also has reported a "Turning Point" program on a young couple with 
sextuplets, will continue as co-anchor of "PrimeTime Live" and is expected to 
be named co-anchor with Forrest Sawyer of "Day One." She said the details of 
her schedule have not been worked out yet.

WILSON OPENS BID FOR 2ND TERM ON OPTIMISTIC NOTE; POLITICS: GOVERNOR SAYS HE 
WANTS TO LEAD STATE 'IN GOOD TIMES.' HE STICKS TO ANTI-CRIME ISSUES AT 
WESTMINSTER STOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pledging "strong and unflinching leadership" to fight crime and create jobs, 
Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday formally opened his bid for a second term as 
California's chief executive and said it would be the last campaign of his long 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
 With stops in Fontana, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego, Wilson began 
a two-day campaign tour with an upbeat message of optimism for a state that 
throughout his first term has suffered from economic recession, natural and 
man-made disasters and a rising fear of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this state has a magnificent future," Wilson said. "I came to this 
office at a time when it was particularly challenging. Having been through the 
hard times, I would like to have the opportunity to lead California in good 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 To get that chance, Wilson, who has only token opposition in the Republican 
primary, will have to defeat one of three Democrats who are vying for the right 
to face him in the fall: Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson begins the campaign behind in the polls. A year ago, public opinion 
surveys gave him the lowest ratings of any governor in 30 years and showed him 
losing badly to his major Democratic challengers. He has rebounded in recent 
months with vigorous attacks on illegal immigration and street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Wilson has established himself as one of the most durable politicians 
in the state's history. He was elected three times to the Legislature, served 
three terms as mayor of San Diego and won two elections to the U.S. Senate. He 
left the Senate in the middle of his second term when he won the election for 
governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine, Wilson has forged a career as a tenacious legislator and 
government executive as well as a relentless campaigner. The touchstones of his 
past campaigns have been support for business and advocacy of stricter 
treatment of violent criminals, elements that were on display Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Praising Westminster's pioneering anti-gang program and flanked by Orange 
County's leading law enforcers, Wilson, 60, kicked off his reelection campaign 
here after stops in Fontana and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding high on his Monday signing of the "three strikes" sentencing law, 
Wilson recited a litany of his anti-crime measures and commitments over the 
years in front a crowd of about 100 supporters outside the Westminster police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Sheriff Brad Gates and five 
police chiefs were among those who crowded next to Wilson on the small outdoor 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm grateful and deeply flattered to have your support and endorsement. You 
in Orange County are especially well-served by your sheriff and your D.A.," 
said Wilson, adding that the county has always been key to his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always looked to Orange County as a bastion of sound thinking and good 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson chose Westminster as his Orange County kick-off site in order to laud 
the city's TARGET program, a multi-agency gang unit funded in part by state 
seed money that has reduced gang-related crime by 60% over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should spread TARGET throughout the state. It clearly works," 
Wilson said. Capizzi praised Wilson for supporting TARGET and other programs 
modeled on it that are now being implemented throughout Orange County, 
including in Santa Ana and Garden Grove. The programs unite probation officers 
with city police investigators and a deputy district attorney in a team charged 
with getting the most dangerous gang leaders off city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not surprising. (Wilson) can spot something that's good and protect 
public safety and this is no exception," Capizzi said of Wilson's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Also present in a show of support was Ky Ngo, chairman of the Vietnamese 
American Political Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern now is that he's very anti-crime. I feel the governor's been 
with this issue for a very long time," Ngo said. "Besides that, he cares about 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson kicked off the campaign with a low-key rally inside a cavernous 
warehouse at California Steel Industries, a foreign-owned company on the site 
of the former Kaiser Steel plant. Wilson said he helped cut through red tape to 
speed a recent expansion at the factory, which employs about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana is in the heart of the Inland Empire, home to the kind of swing 
Democrats once credited with electing Ronald Reagan but who sided with 
President Clinton in 1992. Wilson strategists say the governor must win back 
those voters if he hopes to be reelected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before an early morning audience of about 300 supporters, Wilson 
offered a job description of the post he has held for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor of California must be many things -- a crisis manager when the 
earth shakes or the forests burn, the chief salesman for California jobs all 
across the country . . . and a leader of conviction who stands up for what's 
right no matter who's opposed or what the consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrasting himself with his opponents, he said that he was proposing no 
flashy new programs. His only pledge was to stay a course he is convinced is 
the best for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Fontana speech was interrupted by protests from a handful of Corona 
residents who are upset about his decision to order their town sprayed with the 
pesticide malathion to fight the Mediterranean fruit fly. The demonstrators 
were ushered out by company security officers, and Wilson used the incident to 
stress his commitment to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying, he said, is necessary to prevent a quarantine of California 
agriculture that he said could cost as many as 130,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are a little confused," Wilson said. "There is no evidence it is 
harmful to human beings. . . . It's just not tolerable to allow baseless fears, 
no matter how real they may be to them, to destroy people's livelihoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was the only glitch in Wilson's day, which for the most part 
focused on the crime issue. Even when he mentioned the economy, Wilson tied it 
to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in need of jobs for a growing population," Wilson said. "Employers 
don't bring jobs and they don't keep jobs in a neighborhood that is no longer 
safe. If it's not safe for their customers, if it's not safe for their 
employees, they're going to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that in three years he has not been able to make 
Californians any safer. But he blamed the Legislature for resisting his calls 
for tougher criminal justice laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that I could say California were less dangerous than when I had come 
to office," Wilson said. "But I don't have any assurance that that's the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brown, Garamendi nor Hayden have any consistent record of supporting 
stricter sentencing laws, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled his work on behalf of the "victims' bill of rights" initiative in 
1982, the campaign to oust Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird in 1986 and the 
speedy-trial ballot measure in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "California doesn't need a governor who started talking tough about crime just 
12 weeks ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Wilson picked up endorsements from the county probation 
officers association and the deputy sheriffs association. The deputies group 
supported Democrat Dianne Feinstein when she opposed Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of another law enforcement group, the California Organization of 
Police and Sheriffs, attended the press conference at the county jail and 
handed out leaflets criticizing Wilson for approving a parole policy that 
allows ex-convicts to remain on the streets even after they are caught using 
drugs or committing other offenses. Administration officials say the policy is 
intended to reduce prison overcrowding by offering drug treatment and 
counseling to wayward but nonviolent parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made only passing references to issues other than crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He downplayed the state's budget problems, contending that he had averted a 
"fiscal train wreck" by cutting state spending. He did not mention that he also 
supported a huge tax increase in 1991 or that neither the spending cuts nor the 
tax hikes have balanced the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with a group of reporters between appearances, Wilson rejected 
the idea of running for President in 1996, even if he wins a second term as 
governor.

ANAHEIM FLOATS NEW GRAND PLAN TO KEEP RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by the threat of losing the Los Angeles Rams, city officials confirmed 
Tuesday that they are working on plans to create a sports and entertainment 
mecca around the Anaheim Stadium area, possibly linked to Disneyland and the 
Convention Center by monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans are meant to entice the Rams to stay or lessen the blow to the 
city's economy by revitalizing the area should they leave, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The package under consideration would create a "sports complex atmosphere," 
capitalizing on the value of the city's other professional sports franchises 
and tourist attractions, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concept being explored, city officials said, is building a large 
retail center near the stadium and along the Santa Ana River trail, much like 
CityWalk in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth declined to discuss details of the plan, but said 
city officials want to examine the economic potential of the stadium area, 
whether the Rams stay or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 While the "focal point" of the effort is to keep the team, he said, the city 
would go ahead with the plans even without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense to look at the potential around the stadium," Ruth said. The 
idea is to "revitalize the area and bring together all the economic benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials have told the city they are investigating the possibility of 
moving the team somewhere with greater financial opportunities. They said they 
plan to exercise a 15-month escape clause in their stadium lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Football League team has been courted by ownership groups in 
other cities, including Baltimore, St. Louis and Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about a Rams departure has forced city officials to re-examine the 
financial and social benefits of the team and its stadium. They have come to 
the conclusion that while they may not be able to prevent the Rams from 
leaving, they might be able to increase the profitability of the stadium area. 
</P>
<P>
 High-rise offices have been scheduled for development around the stadium, but 
because of the glut of office space in Orange County, city officials are 
examining other potential land uses such as retail. 
</P>
<P>
 A large retail district near the stadium, for example, could be used to lure 
sports fans to shop and dine before and after events at the stadium and arena. 
One possible model would be MCA's CityWalk, which is open to the public but 
thrives on business from people going to Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the city is considering using the stadium and arena as the 
foundation for a sports complex, much like a proposed development project in 
Florida announced by H. Wayne Huizenga, the multimillionaire sports mogul and 
Blockbuster Video president. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga, who owns the baseball Florida Marlins, football Miami Dolphins and 
hockey Florida Panthers professional franchises, plans to build a large sports 
and entertainment complex in south Florida, complete with major league 
stadiums, a movie studio, an amusement park and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be taking steps to improve and enhance the area and make it a major 
sports and entertainment destination," Daly said. "Over the past 25 years the 
city has made substantial investments in the area, first with the stadium and 
then with the arena. Now it is time to move forward and capture all the 
potential benefits from these very valuable assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly added that Anaheim already has a head start on Huizenga with Disneyland, 
the Convention Center, an arena and a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at how to bring all this together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nicoletti, spokesman for the Anaheim Arena, has not been approached by 
the city about any of the concepts, but he said they "seem to make a lot of 
sense for the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the package being discussed is preliminary and probably would 
require support from other businesses, county government and private 
entrepreneurs. It may be months or longer before city staff can draft a master 
plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crucial question about the proposal that remains unanswered is funding. 
</P>
<P>
 One option being explored is designating the stadium area as a redevelopment 
district to take advantage of a funding process that allows a certain portion 
of property tax revenue from that area to be funneled back into it. Although 
the area is not blighted, it might be able to qualify as a redevelopment area 
because of damage caused by the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who already hold development rights to a portion of the Anaheim 
Stadium parking lot, would profit from, and would be asked to participate in, 
several of the proposed projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials, however, have not yet been approached by the city with these 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly has a meeting scheduled with Rams Executive Vice President John Shaw on 
Thursday to discuss issues regarding the stadium, the team's departure and a 
dispute over renewing the lease on the team's practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 At the City Council meeting Tuesday, the Rams were given a one-week reprieve 
from the Friday eviction threat issued by the owners of the practice site. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnolia School District, which owns the former school where the football 
team practices, agreed to give the Rams have until March 18 to agree to a new 
lease for the facility, City Atty. Jack L. White said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city rents the school from the district and sublets it to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the obstacle to a new agreement continues to be the Rams' refusal 
to restore the school to its original condition if they move out of the city 
after the upcoming season. Rams officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday.

EX-CARTER AIDE NAMED WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL; PRESIDENCY: CLINTON ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES 
FURTHER STAFF CONTACTS WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS ON WHITEWATER AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Tuesday enlisted eminent Washington lawyer Lloyd N. 
Cutler in the effort to safeguard the reputation of the White House, even as he 
acknowledged that his staff had several previously undisclosed contacts with 
federal regulators about the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing that Cutler would serve as special counsel to the President for 
130 days, Clinton said that the additional contacts were incidental, involving 
mostly follow-up phone calls and informal, hallway conversations about earlier 
meetings. They had "nothing to do with the substance" of the regulators' case, 
Clinton asserted in a press conference that served as a forum for his second 
lengthy discussion of Whitewater in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides declined to provide further elaboration about the contacts, 
which came to light as Administration officials searched their files, trash 
baskets and phone logs to comply with a request from Whitewater special counsel 
Robert B. Fiske Jr. for any documents related to the Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the selection of Cutler, who 15 years ago served in the same role in the 
White House of President Jimmy Carter, Clinton is turning again to a consummate 
Washington insider. 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing Cutler in the White House briefing room, Clinton said the 
76-year-old lawyer-lobbyist is a man of "seasoned judgment, impeccable 
professional credentials and the highest ethical standards. . . . I wanted a 
Lloyd Cutler type of lawyer, so I just decided I would go to the original first 
and see how I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater special counsel was appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to 
investigate the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's partnership 
with the owner of a failed savings and loan in an Arkansas real estate company 
known as the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among central questions that Fiske will try to answer is whether funds of the 
S&L were used to pay off campaign debts of then-Gov. Clinton and whether its 
funds were diverted to Whitewater. Aides left open the possibility that a 
review of the documents will unearth still more contacts between White House 
aides and regulatory officials, although they insisted that those too would be 
incidental. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of contacts between White House aides and regulators has given rise 
to new and troubling questions about Whitewater, suggesting that White House 
officials were meddling in an official inquiry or at least improperly 
benefiting from information gleaned from it. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of improper contacts with investigators, along with other 
political missteps, forced the resignation Saturday of White House counsel 
Bernard Nussbaum. Cutler's temporary appointment will give the White House time 
to find a permanent replacement as the President's counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, describing himself as a senior citizen, said he had to "negotiate 
hard" to ensure that he would not have to remain in the intensely demanding job 
for more than a few months. He said that, although he would fulfill all the 
duties of the position, he would concentrate on "the procedures and actions 
necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity and the openness of 
the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust is the coin of the realm," he said, adding that he thought Nussbaum 
"had a lot of bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler said he had "put a limit on how long I would stay, in part because I 
know how tough a job this is and I know how old I am, in part because I'm 
married fairly recently (three years) to a very young and peppy wife and I want 
to spend some more time with her." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute press conference -- carried live by four networks -- was another 
effort by Clinton to demonstrate his willingness to tackle difficult questions. 
Smiling and even joking as he fielded dozens of queries, Clinton insisted: "I'm 
very relaxed about this. I didn't do anything wrong. There's nothing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Without making a firm commitment, Clinton suggested that he has no intention 
of invoking "executive privilege" to prevent release of any White House 
documents. The protection is designed to guard the presidency from undue 
scrutiny by other branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what will come up but it is hard for me to imagine a case in 
which I would invoke it," Clinton said. "My interest here is to get the facts 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, met 
with White House staff members in an East Room session designed to bolster 
spirits and to encourage the staff to rise above the Whitewater turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference, Clinton shed more light on how he may have learned of 
an Oct. 8 meeting in which White House officials were notified that the 
Resolution Trust Corp., which is overseeing the liquidation of failed savings 
and loans, would seek a Justice Department investigation of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions have been raised about whether Clinton learned of the request before 
it became public and thus gained the knowledge improperly. On Monday Clinton 
said he "probably" learned of the request from Bruce Lindsey, his aide and 
longtime confidant, although he added: "I literally don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Republicans kept up their pressure for special 
Whitewater hearings, rejecting Democratic arguments that a congressional 
inquiry would only compromise Fiske's investigation. Republicans on the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee released a list of 40 witnesses 
that they hope to call to testify at a March 24 hearing on the performance of 
the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 The list resembled a Who's Who of the Whitewater controversy, from senior 
White House aides to RTC officials and members of the Rose Law Firm in Little 
Rock, Ark., where Mrs. Clinton was a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses the Republicans hoped to call are White House Chief of 
Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty; Deputy Treasury Secretary and RTC head Roger 
Altman; Nussbaum; James B. McDougal, owner of the failed Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan; his ex-wife, Susan McDougal, and Hillary Clinton aides Margaret 
Williams and Lisa Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he would try to cooperate if Congress decides to conduct hearings 
on Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress ignores Fiske's request that it convene no hearings because of the 
danger to future prosecutions, "then I think that's something we would have to 
take very seriously," he said. "My inclination would be to obviously 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that, although other names of candidates were discussed as 
Nussbaum's replacement, Cutler was the most serious contender from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and top aides discussed the choice over the weekend. On Sunday 
night, McLarty visited Cutler at his home, then returned with him to the White 
House about 8 p.m. for a two-hour conversation with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after sleeping on the issue, Clinton told McLarty to offer Cutler 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, wealthy from a long and distinguished legal career, said he had 
offered to serve without compensation. He said he is considering suggestions 
that he accept a salary and donate it to the U.S. Treasury to help reduce the 
deficit, or take a $1-a-year salary. But he asserted that, although he would 
not leave his law firm -- Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering of Washington -- he would 
observe all federal ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler has long been associated with liberal causes but has represented so 
many interests over his long career that his ideological identity is not always 
easy to discern. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been retained by the leading lights of American industry, from IBM to 
the Big Three auto makers, whom he helped to avoid threatened car-safety rules 
that they opposed. His work on behalf of corporations has prompted angry 
denunciations from consumer advocates, such as Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 He startled Democrats by unsuccessfully pushing for the Supreme Court 
nomination of conservative appeals court Judge Robert H. Bork during the Ronald 
Reagan presidency and he championed the unsuccessful attorney general 
nomination by Clinton of Zoe Baird, a Democrat who worked for him at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 His long and varied career has also given rise to certain ironies. 
</P>
<P>
 In their health care reform efforts, the Clintons have made drug companies one 
of their favorite targets. But their new lawyer was hired in 1962 by the 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. to head off efforts in Congress to control 
drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, a Rose Law Firm courier in Little Rock, who has told 
a grand jury that he helped shred documents from the files of the late White 
House deputy counsel Vincent Foster, said Tuesday that the order to do so came 
after Fiske had announced that his investigation would include the 
circumstances of Foster's apparent suicide, the New York Times reported in 
today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Hedges, a part-time employee of the firm, told the newspaper that he 
shared the chore with another courier, Clayton Lindsey. Both couriers have said 
that they told grand jurors that they knew the papers belonged to Foster 
because the box and the file folders inside bore Foster's initials. Both 
couriers said they saw many of the papers they shredded and none mentioned 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Clark, a Rose partner and its chief operating officer, confirmed in an 
interview with the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that documents were destroyed 
after Fiske's appointment but said they had nothing to do with Foster or the 
Whitewater case. Clark said four Rose firm witnesses -- two clerks and two 
lawyers -- are willing to verify as much under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 The account of the shredding provides no strong evidence of wrongdoing but 
does fuel speculation about a possible cover-up. The documents apparently were 
destroyed before Fiske issued a subpoena for documents in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster had worked on Whitewater matters, as a member of the Rose firm and 
later at the White House.

PRESIDENT'S NEW STRATEGY OF PUBLIC DIALOGUE POSES RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to convey the clearest possible contrast with the hunkered-down, 
closed-in White Houses of scandals past, President Clinton has embarked on a 
potentially risky strategy of public exposure -- clearly demonstrated Tuesday 
in one of the longest press conferences of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 With his new White House counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, standing by his side, 
Clinton responded to questions in the White House briefing room for about 45 
minutes, remaining relaxed and smiling and avoiding the sort of testy 
defensiveness that has often marked his public question-and-answer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The display marked a sharp contrast with the approach the White House has 
taken on the Whitewater controversy in the past, which generally has been to 
try to keep Clinton from answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the back-to-back press conferences of the last two days stemmed from 
a change in strategy, one senior aide said: "Yes, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President today stayed and answered every single question," the aide 
said. "This is the President's strong feeling, that we have nothing to hide and 
should show that. That's what happened today and I hope you'll see more of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the White House agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials originally scheduled Clinton to appear in the White House briefing 
room, where he would meet with the roughly 200 members of the White House press 
corps. They then changed plans to have the President make the announcement 
before a small number of reporters in the more controlled environment of the 
Roosevelt Room. In the end, however, they reverted to the earlier schedule and 
put Clinton before the larger group. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have doubts about the new approach could point to one clear 
potential downside -- someone answering dozens of questions on a complicated 
matter is almost certain to provide new information that leads to new 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, for example, Clinton revealed that in October, before the matter 
became public, he was informed that the Resolution Trust Corp., a subsidiary of 
the Treasury Department, had made a criminal referral to the Justice Department 
in a matter related to Whitewater. Contacts between the White House and 
Treasury have been the center of the renewed controversy in the last two weeks 
and Clinton's words quickly were treated as a new revelation that triggered 
headlines Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that risk, a majority of White House aides and advisers hope for a 
more important payoff -- a public perception that Clinton wants to clear the 
air. As he said repeatedly: "I'm cooperating. I'm not doing what some people 
have done in the past. I am cooperating. I'm being open." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in case people were not getting the message, Clinton repeated words to 
that effect six times during the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're open, not closed; there's no bunker mentality," he said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand, I am very relaxed about this," he said at another. "I 
did not do anything wrong. There is nothing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, in a White House staff meeting, Clinton repeated his message, 
telling aides that -- if they had made any mistakes -- they should "own up." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton entertained the staff with a children's story he said he had once read 
to Chelsea, the point of which was that sometimes bystanders can 
unintentionally become participants. Aides quickly retold the story to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of all those moves was to try to distinguish this White House from 
the one so many Americans remember -- the grim memory of Richard Nixon avoiding 
reporters and hunkering down in a White House that by all accounts was very 
much besieged during the Watergate scandal. With polls showing that the vast 
majority of Americans are still quite unsure of what to make of Whitewater, 
Clinton's advisers believe that the image they convey is important to what 
Americans come to believe about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of images Clinton's advisers would like to avoid are those from 
Clinton's own presidential campaign, when he often appeared beleaguered, 
surrounded by mobs of reporters and often ill-at-ease in responding to 
questions. The campaign appearances gave many Americans an unfavorable image of 
Clinton that his advisers would like to avoid now. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, by contrast, Clinton's demeanor backed up his words about openness. 
Clinton maintained a relaxed smile throughout, guaranteeing that Americans 
tuning in their nightly television news programs would see him as the very 
picture of calm.

CITING '3 STRIKES,' LAWYERS TO SHUN PLEA BARGAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after "three strikes" became law, lawyers advised adult and juvenile 
defendants to go to trial, raising the prospect that courts will quickly become 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alameda County, Dist. Atty. John Meehan said he will not enforce one key 
provision of the tough new criminal sentencing law. Meehan said he will not 
count crimes committed by juveniles as "strikes" because he thinks the 
provision is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the full impact of the law targeting repeat felons will not be felt 
for years, the earliest ripples of change were being felt Tuesday as many 
judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers studied the law for the first time. 
Prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers set up task forces and met with judges 
in an effort to sort out how they would handle what they assume will be an 
onslaught of trials and heavy sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been studying it all day," Stanislaus County Dist. Atty. Donald Stahl 
said. By day's end, he had concluded that "it's the toughest thing I've seen in 
28 years. This is farther reaching certainly than the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law says criminals who have committed two prior violent or serious 
felonies -- there are 29 of them, ranging from murder to residential burglary 
-- and commit any felony on a third offense will face a minimum sentence of 25 
years to life. The law also doubles sentences for second convictions on serious 
or violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first defendants to face life sentences under "three strikes" are almost 
certainly in jail by now, but their identities may not be known until later in 
the week. After making an arrest, police must obtain rap sheets detailing a 
suspect's previous crimes, process the case and send it to prosecutors, all of 
which takes a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County public defenders began telling adult defendants that there 
was little reason to accept plea bargains now if it means that in later life 
they could be subject to additional time in prison if convicted of a new 
felony. Better to test prosecutors' evidence by taking more cases to trial, the 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain that there are people who have opted against accepting plea 
bargains," said Jabe Kahnke, a deputy public defender in Long Beach. "It's 
certainly something we discussed this morning before (the staff members) went 
to court." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Public Defender Jeff Brown said: "People are really putting 
on the brakes in terms of pleas. People are being hauled aside and given time 
to reflect on this. The ramifications are a hell of a lot more serious today 
than it was (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he is directing his deputies "to ask for a jury trial" in juvenile 
proceedings, rather than a less formal proceeding before a judge -- "and we're 
going to challenge any prior (conviction) based on a juvenile adjudication if 
the conviction was not secured by a jury trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles public defenders also were considering making such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to count as a conviction, it has to be contested," said Los 
Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Nina Law, who handles juvenile cases in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile court system is far less formal and is designed to rehabilitate 
rather than punish. Juvenile convictions are known as "adjudications" and are 
made without juries and without many of the rules of evidence in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury had testified in Sacramento 
against the new law. But he predicted Tuesday that the criminal justice system 
would adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doomsday prophets have always said the system will grind to a halt and 
devastate us financially," Bradbury said. "But the system is flexible. It 
adapts well, and it will be able to process any additional trials." 
</P>
<P>
 When the law was moving through the Legislature, many county prosecutors 
echoed Bradbury's position, saying that some of its provisions may be 
unconstitutional. The California District Attorneys Assn. lobbied against it 
and tried to persuade Wilson not to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an electorate weary and angry over crime, the concept of imprisoning 
repeat felons for life has gathered huge support. Legislators in Sacramento 
cast aside concerns about the measure's cost, questions about constitutionality 
and ambiguity of some of its provisions, and approved the bill by Assemblymen 
Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Fresno) without amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 As it went into effect this week, most prosecutors said they intended to fully 
carry out the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, who objected to the provision regarding juvenile offenders, is a 
veteran of 34 years as a prosecutor and is stepping down this year. He is a 
past president of the district attorneys association and often has taken stands 
that run counter to strict law and order prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think there is a cloud over the juvenile cases (clause)," Meehan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prosecutors interviewed Tuesday say they will attempt to count juvenile 
crimes as strikes. But Meehan said, "Good luck trying to prove them." He noted 
that records of juvenile proceedings are sealed unless defendants are tried as 
adults, and most juvenile cases are disposed of in informal hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state attorney general's office, a task force of experts on sentencing 
and criminal law embarked on a full analysis of the new law, formulating the 
state's position on key questions, and how to defend expected legal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there were going to be some big, big problems," said George 
Williamson, chief assistant to Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and a major proponent of 
the "three strikes" law. "We were aware that there were some drafting concerns 
which were significant. We were also advised by line prosecutors that they 
perceived some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said he is anticipating charges by defense lawyers that all three 
crimes must be committed after Monday, the day the law went into effect. But he 
predicted that the state would prevail on its position: A felon could have been 
convicted of two serious or violent felonies before Monday, be convicted of a 
third felony after Monday, and be subject to a sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other challenges, including objections to the provision that 
serious or violent felonies committed by a juvenile age 16 or 17 can be counted 
as strikes, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels was among county prosecutors who 
set up a committee of deputies to study its implications. His prosecutors 
quickly found a potential problem not previously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County has three state prisons. A prisoner who commits virtually any 
transgression, from assault on another inmate to possession of drugs or drug 
paraphernalia or a weapon, can be charged with a felony. That felony would 
count as a third strike for those with two strikes behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have to be hundreds of these. Anything you do in the prison is a 
felony," Jagels said. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the repercussions be? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not certain yet," Jagels said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one thing of which Jagels is sure. The cost must be born by 
the state of California. Under state law, costs incurred by local law 
enforcement to handle state prison-related crime must be paid for by the state.

STUDENTS FALL SHORT IN NEW STATE TESTS; EDUCATION: MEASUREMENT OF SKILLS 
AGAINST RIGOROUS STANDARDS PRODUCES A HIGHLY UNFLATTERING PICTURE OF PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS. RESULTS ARE POOREST IN MATH, BEST IN WRITING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State education leaders today released the first results of a revolutionary 
new system for assessing how well California students are learning that gives a 
highly unflattering snapshot of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not pretty," acting state schools chief William D. Dawson 
acknowledged in summing up the performance of 1 million students who took the 
pioneering California Learning Assessment System tests in reading, writing and 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, California students were measured not against each other 
but according to rigorous performance standards set by a task force that 
included educators, school board members, business leaders, parents and testing 
experts. The tests were given last spring in grades four, eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Math results were especially grim. Statewide, at least one-third of tested 
students in each grade demonstrated little or no understanding of basic math 
concepts. Only 7% of fourth-graders showed a substantial grasp of mathematical 
concepts; eighth- and 10th-graders fared only slightly better. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of students in each grade in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District showed only "limited mathematical thinking. . . . While responses are 
sometimes correct, student work often falls short of providing workable 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading performance across California was closer to the highest standard but 
nothing for school officials to brag about. About 20% of the middle school 
students, 23% of the elementary pupils and 30% of the high school sophomores 
demonstrated only a "superficial understanding" of what they read. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing scores were somewhat better. Although very few students attained the 
highest standard, at least 40% in each grade tested were able to communicate in 
a clear, adequately organized way. But the majority wrote incoherently and made 
frequent errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have chosen to set a very high standard . . . so I was not particularly 
surprised" by the results, Dawson said. "But I was certainly reminded . . . of 
how far we have to go to yield student progress that we are going to be 
satisfied with." 
</P>
<P>
 The standards were written last summer by a 57-member task force and are based 
on state-mandated curriculum guidelines that tell every public school what 
California students should be studying. The standards, which were approved by 
the State Board of Education, aim to measure how much of the curriculum is 
absorbed by students. 
</P>
<P>
 For each subject, the standards describe on a scale of 1 to 6 the types of 
skills students should pick up. In writing, for example, a student meeting the 
sixth, or highest, standard can write in a "confident, purposeful, coherent and 
clearly focused" way. The writing of a student at level 1 is "brief, 
incoherent, disorganized and undeveloped." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the standards that compare students in Los Angeles and Santa 
Ana on the same scale as students in Fresno and Eureka, CLAS represents a new 
approach to testing that is growing in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are multiple-choice exams that force students to pick a single correct 
answer -- and let them guess with a fair chance of success. The new tests 
require students to write at least some of their answers, respond to open-ended 
questions about their reactions to literature or explain how they arrived at 
solutions to math problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are not scored solely on whether they arrive at a single correct 
answer. Understanding basic principles and displaying the ability to solve 
problems also count. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals of the new system, which is often called "performance-based" testing 
or "authentic assessment," are to improve teaching and raise the achievement of 
the 5.2 million students in California's increasingly diverse public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "By setting high standards, we learn that nobody is doing very well, and that 
is painful," said Lauren Resnick, a director of the Washington-based New 
Standards Project, which is helping 19 states develop criteria for student 
achievement. "It's also the necessary first step to improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 The results, released earlier to school district officials, have already begun 
to cause consternation. School districts, primarily in affluent suburbs, that 
have traditionally scored at the top of standardized tests may still compare 
well to poorer districts, but the tests find that even they can stand much 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we look carefully at the data and what it actually says, we don't think it 
really means anything," said Barbara Smith, assistant superintendent of the 
Capistrano Unified School District in southern Orange County. The district 
fared well compared to other districts in the state, but Smith argued that the 
paucity of high-end scores says more about the test than it does about 
students' achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a mistake," said Tom Jacobson, principal at Corona del Mar High 
School in Newport Beach, where 97% of eighth-graders scored in the lowest two 
levels in math. He said 98% of the students go to college and the school's past 
test scores typically were in the 95th percentile statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kirst, a Stanford University education professor and a director of 
Policy Analysis for California Education, a Northern California think tank, 
said the new system's "main impact is not on low-scoring schools that knew they 
were in trouble but on those districts that were used to being on the top, and 
now suddenly they have a lot of kids (in the lower and middle range)." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will raise a lot of questions with parents and with school boards," 
Kirst said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactions are similar to those in the handful of other states that have 
tested students against high standards, especially Kentucky. Outcry from 
parents in usually high-scoring Louisville schools slowed acceptance of the 
system, according to Monty Neill of the Massachusetts-based FairTest, which 
lobbies for better assessment methods. But within a year, "the message got 
across," and Kentucky is continuing to use statewide standards of achievement, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On California's new tests, traditionally low-scoring districts continued to 
fare poorly. The Compton Unified School District, which the state took over 
last year because of looming budget deficits and poor academic performance, 
finished in the bottom five of Los Angeles County school districts in all three 
subjects and all three grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other tests, the new assessment system showed a strong correlation 
between family background -- especially in regard to wealth and parents' 
education -- and students' academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 To nobody's surprise, students in affluent Marin County public schools did 
better than just about any others in the state, while those in Imperial County, 
with large numbers of poor and recent immigrants, came out near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even most Marin County students fell short of reaching the highest levels 
of the test's standards in all three subjects. In math, 57% of Marin County 
fourth-graders scored in the lowest two levels, showing little grasp of basic 
concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores also varied widely by ethnicity. On the 10th-grade writing test, for 
example, 21% of Asian-heritage students and 16% of white students met the 
highest performance standards. That compared to 6% of black students and 5% of 
Latino students who achieved at the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Within ethnic groups, the test scores reflected the educational achievement of 
the students' parents. Among black 10th-graders, 38% of those whose parents 
hold graduate school degrees scored at the high end of the writing test, 
compared to 22% when parents were just high school graduates. For white 
10th-graders, 61% whose parents have graduate school degrees scored high in 
writing compared to 30% whose parents did not graduate high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, the new testing system has already stirred controversy among 
some conservatives over the style and content of the tests. Others have 
criticized the scoring system, snags in getting started and the comparatively 
high cost of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were scored by 2,000 specially trained teachers at 35 sites around 
the state. To save money, only a sampling of tests were scored. Delays in 
getting test materials and directions to teachers and in releasing results have 
set off complaints that schools had little time to prepare last year and little 
opportunity to change course before this spring's exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glitches and budget limitations, assessment experts consider the 
new generation of tests far superior to anything that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have very high expectations for the (new) system, but they need to 
recognize that it is going through a development process that will take time" 
to perfect, said Eva Baker, a director of the U.S. Center for Research on 
Evaluation, Standards and Testing at UCLA. "Our alternative is to go back to 
what we were doing, and that was not working." 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, California used standardized achievement tests to measure the 
progress of its students. Under former state schools chief Bill Honig, who used 
the tests to spur public schools to do better, the annual results were widely 
publicized during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But except for a writing segment, the tests relied heavily on easily scored 
multiple-choice questions. They were designed to help gauge academic progress 
by the state's public school students as a whole; they also could be used to 
assess a given district or individual school, but they were never intended to 
provide reliable measures of individual students. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the old tests given under the California Assessment Program (CAP) 
were graded on a curve and ranked schools by percentile. 
</P>
<P>
 The old system was dropped when then-Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed funding in 
1990. His successor, Gov. Pete Wilson, a year later authorized money for the 
development of a new system, but insisted that it yield results for individual 
students as well as averages for the state, districts and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With a second round of testing scheduled for this spring, individual results 
will be reported for students in grades four and eight but not for 10th- or 
fifth-graders, who will take the first history and science exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cost, individual scoring and tests in additional subjects will 
be phased in. By the 1997-98 school year, plans call for individual scores to 
be available on all tests -- reading, writing and math in grade four, history 
and science in grade four, and in all five subjects for grade 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing will eventually also be conducted in Spanish, the language of the 
state's largest group of students who are not fluent in English. Currently, 
students who have attended school in this country for less than 30 months and 
those who are enrolled in classes taught primarily in their native languages 
are not required to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of pupils in the tested grades, including some special-education 
students, were not required to take the test last spring, education officials 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when fully in place, the assessment process will include the 
evaluation of a portfolio of classroom work by each student. The portfolio will 
help pinpoint areas of progress and weakness. Parents will be able to go over 
portfolio work with teachers and get their child's results on the statewide 
test, but will not be able to see the actual test materials, which are kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 State fiscal analysts expect the full system to cost at least $55 million a 
year; the old testing system cost $12 million a year. As with other state 
programs, the assessment system must rely year to year on funding from the 
governor and Legislature, injecting an element of uncertainty and sensitizing 
test advocates to political pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before publication of the first results, education officials yielded to 
pressure from conservatives and deleted two test items based on writings by 
award-winning author Alice Walker. Civil rights groups protested and threatened 
to sue, and hearings on the issue are scheduled in Sacramento for Friday and 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative analyst's office also cautioned recently that the new 
testing system may be "trying to accomplish too many diverse goals with the 
amount of available funding" and may not produce reliable individual scores 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cost, the state's business establishment is "advocating very 
strongly for this," said Jere Jacobs, a Pacific Telesis Group executive and a 
member of the California Business Roundtable. "This gives us the standards we 
have been talking about for a long time. . . . It's the cornerstone of a very 
rational accountability system." 
</P>
<P>
 By setting high, clearly defined standards closely tied to the state's new 
curriculum guides and textbooks, educators expect to be able to more clearly 
assess what improvements are needed. They expect the standards to improve 
teacher training and to spur schools to more closely follow the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 After this benchmark-setting year, schools will judged not by where they 
started but by the progress they show, schools chief Dawson promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can either face the reality of what our kids can and cannot do . . . or we 
can stick our heads back in the sand," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Kirst said many schools, after several years of lean budgets, 
cannot afford to buy the needed textbooks and equipment or train staff members 
in the new methods and materials the updated curricula reflect. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been enthusiastic, but they don't have the resources. The 
question to the state is, 'What are you going to do to help the schools?' " 
Kirst said.

O.C. SCORES ARE AMONG HIGHEST IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County students posted some of the highest scores in the state on the 
new California Learning Assessment System, but the results released today show 
that even students in the county's strongest districts have far to go to reach 
achievement standards set by state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the county, districts that have traditionally done well on standardized 
tests continued to post the highest scores, with larger, more urban districts 
ranking near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 But when schools are analyzed individually, campuses from throughout the 
county are sprinkled at both high and low ends of the spectrum, prompting some 
educators to praise the new tests as a better evaluation tool while others 
attacked the entire concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we look carefully at the data and what it actually says, we don't think it 
really means anything," said Barbara Smith, assistant superintendent of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. "Until CLAS can create a test that is 
verifiable and valid, we're going to continue to look more closely at other 
measures we have of student achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 The new assessment program -- a three-part test in reading, writing and math 
that fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade students took last spring -- is scored on 
a complex six-level scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Student scores were not recorded individually. Rather, only about a third of 
the tests statewide were scored, and results show the percentage of students in 
each school, district or county who scored at each of the six levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The state did not rank schools or districts, but officials suggested that the 
best way to compare scores is to combine the percentages of students who scored 
in the top three levels. In all three grades, Orange County was among the 
counties showing the strongest scores in the three subject areas, ranking third 
or fourth at each grade level statewide when scores of 4, 5 and 6 in all exams 
are combined. Marin County, a suburban county north of San Francisco, ranked 
first in each grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 Every local district matched or beat the state average for eighth-graders, 
while three-quarters of the districts bested the statewide scores at the 
fourth-grade level. Among 10th-graders, only Santa Ana Unified, the county's 
largest district, and Anaheim Union High School District scored below the state 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here, the scores are not exactly flattering: Nearly a third of Orange 
County students at each grade level demonstrated little or no mathematical 
thinking, posting the lowest possible score, and about half the local students 
scored in the bottom half of the scale in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as good, of course, as we would like to be," said John F. Dean, 
superintendent of the Orange County Department of Education. "Everything new 
has a shakedown cruise. Now that everybody knows what we're looking for, I 
think we'll do a heck of a lot better next time, I really do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, nearly 69,000 fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders took the 
tests. Not tested were those whose native language is not English and students 
in separate special-education classes or juvenile court schools and 
independent-study programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Orange County, the unified districts of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Brea 
Olinda and Saddleback top the list at all grade levels when scores of 4, 5 and 
6 were combined across subject matter. Irvine Unified stands out for overall 
excellence, with individual schools and districtwide averages that rank near 
the top in every measure and large percentages of students posting scores of 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Other districts with high-ranking scores in certain areas include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington Beach City and Ocean View Elementary, fourth-grade reading; 
</P>
<P>
 * Fountain Valley Elementary, eighth-grade reading and fourth-grade writing 
and math; 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Alamitos Unified, 10th-grade reading and eighth-grade writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of 6 were rare locally and across the state. The tests are not scored 
on a curve, and a score of 6 was reserved for exemplary work. Statewide, many 
schools and districts posted no scores of 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the highest percentage of 6's among districts came in Brea 
Olinda, where 6% of the 10th-graders scored a 6 with writing that "is 
confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly focused, conveying the writer's 
knowledge, values, insights and clarity of thought," according to the state 
scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach had the greatest percentage of top scores in reading among 
eighth-graders, with 4% earning a 6, which means these students "consider texts 
as a whole," explore it in depth and "relate it to their own experiences and 
the world at large." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the revolutionary CLAS tests brought surprisingly good results. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Unified, a huge district where more than one-third of the 
students have limited English proficiency, ranks higher on these assessments 
than it has on previous standardized tests. Garden Grove did especially well at 
the 10th-grade level, ranking eighth among county districts -- above 
Placentia-Yorba Linda, Tustin and Newport-Mesa, which are typically top 
scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just spent a lot more time in preparing kids to do critical-thinking 
types of approaches and to learn to solve problems, and to think through 
problems," said Al Sims of the Garden Grove district. "We feel real strongly 
that this is a move in the right direction for the state. The kids we graduate 
now . . . are going to be more prepared for the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis of individual schools' performance showed no district monopolizing 
the top or the bottom of the rankings. Combining the top three scoring levels 
in all subjects, at least six districts had schools among the top 10. The same 
was true for the bottom of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the fourth grade, Newport-Mesa has three schools among the top 10. 
In the eighth grade, Irvine has four of the top 10 schools. And in the 10th 
grade, Huntington Beach Union has four of the top 10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 University High in Irvine, long regarded as among the best high schools in the 
state, stood out, its 10th-graders ranking first overall, first in reading and 
math and third in writing when scores of 4, 5 and 6 are totaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual schools with large percentages of level-6 scores include: 
</P>
<P>
 * University High in Irvine, with 12% of 10th-graders earning 6 in writing; 
</P>
<P>
 * Troy High in Fullerton, with 10% of 10th-graders earning 6 in writing; 
</P>
<P>
 * Vista Verde Elementary (K-8) in Irvine, with 14% of eighth-graders earning 6 
in reading and 9% in writing; 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor View Elementary in Newport Beach, with 13% of fourth-graders earning 
6 in writing; and 
</P>
<P>
 * Brywood Elementary in Irvine, with 11% of fourth-graders earning 6 in 
writing; 
</P>
<P>
 "We have kids whose parents are well-educated -- the expectation is that they 
are well-prepared and come to us with an ability to excel, so we would expect 
that they would perform well on these kinds of assessments," said Irvine 
Unified Supt. David E. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our only basis of knowing that we're doing well is that we're doing better 
than everyone else, that's not good enough," Brown said. "We need to know that 
we're doing better than the standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the standards set by the CLAS scoring system, the results 
countywide show much room for improvement. Especially disappointing are the 
math scores, where even the top districts have two-thirds of their students 
scoring in the three lowest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, 89% of fourth-graders, 84% of eighth-graders and 83% of 
10th-graders scored 1, 2 or 3. Statewide, the numbers are similar, with 91% of 
fourth-graders, 87% of eighth-graders and 88% of 10th-graders scoring 1, 2 or 
3. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case across the state, scores of 6 are especially scarce in math: No 
district posted a 6 in the fourth-grade math portion. Only Los Alamitos and 
Brea Olinda unified posted 6's in eighth-grade math, and only Los Alamitos 
Unified had 6's in 10th-grade math; in each case, only 1% of the students have 
the highest scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if we are too hard on ourselves," Dean said. ". . . I mean, we all 
want perfection, but my gut-level response is we're being very rigid. Our kids 
didn't do as well as I know they can do. I know their education is better than 
this. To me, one possible explanation is that we're a little tough on ourselves 
in terms of scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools that have traditionally fared well on standardized tests 
floundered on the new math assessment. The test included multiple-choice 
questions involving several computations, and students were asked to solve a 
word problem showing their work with charts, pictures and essays. 
</P>
<P>
 At the eighth-grade level, the three schools at the bottom of the math ranking 
are, surprisingly, Travis Ranch (K-8) in Yorba Linda; Corona del Mar High 
(7-12) in Newport Beach; and Fred Newhart (K-8) in Mission Viejo. Those schools 
posted no scores of 6, 5 or 4 in the math test; each had about 70% of their 
students score a 1, which means "student work demonstrates little or no 
mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical ideas," and at least 
25% scored a 2. 
</P>
<P>
 By means of comparison, in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 86% of the 
eighth-graders scored a 1 or 2 on math. 
</P>
<P>
 At Corona del Mar, a school that sends 98% of its students to college and is 
well-regarded around the state, Principal Tom Jacobson simply could not believe 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an earth-shaking drop, it just doesn't seem possible. I'm going to 
ask for a recheck," he said, incredulous. "If that's what the scores are, we've 
obviously got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As on other standardized tests, the county's largest district did poorly on 
CLAS when compared to its neighbors: Santa Ana Unified, which has the county's 
highest level of limited-English speakers and the lowest socioeconomic index 
according to the state, ranks last among local districts at every grade level. 
The district's four high schools were among the six lowest ranked (excluding 
continuation schools) when 10th-graders' reading, writing and math scores of 4, 
5 and 6 were combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified spokeswoman Diane Thomas said the new assessment was 
especially difficult for her district, where nearly 70% of the students have 
limited-English proficiency, because even the math questions required 
sophisticated language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking standardized tests is difficult" for a district like Santa Ana. "It's 
a challenge," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play by the rules the state gives us to play by," Thomas said. "We do the 
best we can to prepare our students for the kind of tests we need to give them. 
The test serves as a guidepost. We can use this as a road map to help us go on 
down that road."

WILSON OPENS BID FOR 2ND TERM ON OPTIMISTIC NOTE; POLITICS: GOVERNOR SAYS HE 
WANTS TO LEAD STATE 'IN GOOD TIMES.' HE VOWS THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE HIS 
LAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pledging "strong and unflinching leadership" to fight crime and create jobs, 
Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday formally opened his bid for a second term as 
California's chief executive and said it would be the last campaign of his long 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
 With stops in Fontana, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego, Wilson began 
a two-day campaign tour with an upbeat message of optimism for a state that 
throughout his first term has suffered from economic recession, natural and 
man-made disasters and a rising fear of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this state has a magnificent future," Wilson said. "I came to this 
office at a time when it was particularly challenging. Having been through the 
hard times, I would like to have the opportunity to lead California in good 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 To get that chance, Wilson, who has only token opposition in the Republican 
primary, will have to defeat one of three Democrats who are vying for the right 
to face him in the fall: Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson begins the campaign behind in the polls. A year ago, public opinion 
surveys gave him the lowest ratings of any governor in 30 years and showed him 
losing badly to his major Democratic challengers. He has rebounded in recent 
months with vigorous attacks on illegal immigration and street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Wilson has established himself as one of the most durable politicians 
in the state's history. He was elected three times to the Legislature, served 
three terms as mayor of San Diego and won two elections to the U.S. Senate. He 
left the Senate in the middle of his second term when he won the election for 
governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine, Wilson has forged a career as a tenacious legislator and 
government executive as well as a relentless campaigner. The touchstones of his 
past campaigns have been support for business and advocacy of stricter 
treatment of violent criminals, elements that were on display Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 60, kicked off the campaign with a low-key rally inside a cavernous 
warehouse at California Steel Industries, a foreign-owned company on the site 
of the former Kaiser Steel plant. Wilson said he helped cut through red tape to 
speed a recent expansion at the factory, which employs about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana is in the heart of the Inland Empire, home to the kind of swing 
Democrats once credited with electing Ronald Reagan but who sided with 
President Clinton in 1992. Wilson strategists say the governor must win back 
those voters if he hopes to be reelected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before an early morning audience of about 300 supporters, Wilson 
offered a job description of the post he has held for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor of California must be many things -- a crisis manager when the 
earth shakes or the forests burn, the chief salesman for California jobs all 
across the country . . . and a leader of conviction who stands up for what's 
right no matter who's opposed or what the consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrasting himself with his opponents, he said that he was proposing no 
flashy new programs. His only pledge was to stay a course he is convinced is 
the best for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians still face tough times, and to get through these tough times, we 
need more than 10-point plans and catchy slogans," he said. "What California 
needs today is strong and unflinching leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Fontana speech was interrupted by protests from a handful of Corona 
residents who are upset about his decision to order their town sprayed with the 
pesticide malathion to fight the Mediterranean fruit fly. The demonstrators 
were ushered out by company security officers, and Wilson used the incident to 
stress his commitment to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying, he said, is necessary to prevent a quarantine of California 
agriculture that he said could cost as many as 130,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are a little confused," Wilson said. "There is no evidence it is 
harmful to human beings. . . . It's just not tolerable to allow baseless fears, 
no matter how real they may be to them, to destroy people's livelihoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was the only glitch in Wilson's day, which for the most part 
focused on the crime issue. Even when he mentioned the economy, Wilson tied it 
to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in need of jobs for a growing population," Wilson said. "Employers 
don't bring jobs and they don't keep jobs in a neighborhood that is no longer 
safe. If it's not safe for their customers, if it's not safe for their 
employees, they're going to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that in three years he has not been able to make 
Californians any safer. But he blamed the Legislature for resisting his calls 
for tougher criminal justice laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that I could say California were less dangerous than when I had come 
to office," Wilson said. "But I don't have any assurance that that's the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brown, Garamendi nor Hayden have any consistent record of supporting 
stricter sentencing laws, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled his work on behalf of the "victims' bill of rights" initiative in 
1982, the campaign to oust Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird in 1986 and the 
speedy-trial ballot measure in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "California doesn't need a governor who started talking tough about crime just 
12 weeks ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also reminded his supporters that he turned down a clemency 
request and sent murderer Robert Alton Harris to the gas chamber two years ago. 
Although Garamendi and Hayden support the death penalty, Wilson hopes to 
exploit his differences with Brown, who says she opposes capital punishment in 
principle but would enforce it if elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, Wilson said, needs a governor who will "invoke the death penalty 
and do it in good conscience because in fact he believes in it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Wilson picked up endorsements from the county probation 
officers association and the deputy sheriffs association. The deputies group 
supported Democrat Dianne Feinstein when she opposed Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of another law enforcement group, the California Organization of 
Police and Sheriffs, attended the press conference at the county jail and 
handed out leaflets criticizing Wilson for approving a parole policy that 
allows ex-convicts to remain on the streets even after they are caught using 
drugs or committing other offenses. Administration officials say the policy is 
intended to reduce prison overcrowding by offering drug treatment and 
counseling to wayward but nonviolent parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made only passing references to issues other than crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He downplayed the state's budget problems, contending that he had averted a 
"fiscal train wreck" by cutting state spending. He did not mention that he also 
supported a huge tax increase in 1991 or that neither the spending cuts nor the 
tax hikes have balanced the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And in keeping with the theme that the state needs tough leadership, Wilson 
said he was willing to demand that Washington reimburse the state for the cost 
of serving illegal immigrants, even if he is "vilified for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with a group of reporters between appearances, Wilson flatly 
rejected the idea of running for President in 1996, even if he wins a second 
term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll rule it out," he said. Being governor, he added, is a "career capper." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said he would turn down any offer to run as vice president on the 
Republican ticket. He said the governor's job would be more interesting and 
challenging than the second spot in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not interested in the first spot, why the hell would you be 
interested in the second?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Wilson's adopted home town, the governor's entourage was greeted 
by a boisterous demonstration outside the bayside restaurant where Wilson held 
a reception. Protesters held signs mocking Wilson's record on a number of 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you rather have your kids in school or in jail?" read one sign. "No 
Re-Pete," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for governor is expected to be fierce and expensive, with total 
spending likely to top $50 million. The national Democratic and Republican 
party organizations probably will send surrogate campaigners and cash to 
California in an effort to control the governor's office in the nation's 
largest state going into the 1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign progresses, Wilson will have a delicate balancing act as he 
wages a partisan battle for reelection yet seeks to maintain his effectiveness 
as a Republican chief executive working with a Democratic Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state budget at least $5 billion out of balance, the governor will 
need help from lawmakers to avoid another crisis that would undercut the 
voters' distrust in him as a manager of the state's fiscal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's leverage in the Legislature, never great, may be waning as 
lawmakers decide to wait and see if he will survive to serve a second term. 
Last week, the state Senate blocked a Wilson nominee to the University of 
California Board of Regents -- the first regent ever rejected -- and voted to 
overturn a Wilson veto, the first time a governor has been overridden in either 
house since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's plan to sell bonds to finance the state's share of the Northridge 
earthquake recovery program also is having trouble in the Legislature. Profile:

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson formally declared his candidacy for a second term Tuesday. He 
faces only token opposition in the Republican primary. State Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, Insurance Commissioner John Garmendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden are 
running for the Democratic nomination to oppose Wilson.

HOUSE-HUNTING WOES HAUNT THOSE DISPLACED BY QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evicting residents by the tens of thousands, the Jan. 17 earthquake created a 
corps of newly homeless exceeding the populations of some mid-size cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks later, the encampments that dotted the landscape have vanished and 
the last of the shelters have closed. Their lives have been uprooted and their 
nerves frayed, but these quake victims -- mostly poor renters but some 
middle-class and wealthy homeowners as well -- are slowly, quietly finding new 
places to live. Along the way, they are confronting an array of obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 A disabled woman struggled for three weeks to find a wheelchair-accessible 
apartment. An African American couple have been met with suspicious stares and 
prompt rejections from wary white landlords. A mother and her seven children 
spent a month in a friend's living room while she searched for a landlord who 
would accept her large family. 
</P>
<P>
 "This disaster is really hundreds and hundreds of individual disasters," said 
Peggy Hinz, a Red Cross spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many people have found new homes -- sometimes better than the ones 
they left -- the hunt continues for thousands more who remain in motels or with 
friends and relatives. "There's still a big gap and a lot of people who need 
help in getting housing," said Marshall Kandell of the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Many rentals are still available in Los Angeles, a reflection of the pre-quake 
vacancy rate of 12%, one of the highest among the nation's urban areas. To lure 
quake victims, many apartment complexes are advertising special earthquake 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But rents remain prohibitive for many prospective tenants, highlighting a 
shortage of affordable housing that worsened when the quake damaged many 
low-cost apartments. And a significant number of landlords -- fearing 
government red tape and problem tenants -- are hesitant to accept low-income 
families who have been given emergency housing vouchers, one of the principal 
sources of post-earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18,000 households who have received these Section 8 vouchers from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development -- which pay most of the 
tenants' rent for 18 months -- fewer than one-third have moved into new 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 It's uncertain how the housing market will absorb the flood of victims shaken 
out of their homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has given out more 
than 51,000 checks for two or three months of rental assistance. City officials 
estimate that the vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley has already shrunk to 
2.5%, although apartment industry officials dispute that estimate as too low. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the displaced, there will be little respite. The 18-month rent 
subsidies will end sometime next year, forcing many recipients into the market 
anew. Then, the numbing routine begins again -- scanning the "For Rent" signs, 
filling out applications, packing boxes, and, ultimately, moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of half a dozen homeowners and renters over recent weeks shows 
that house-hunting can be a frustrating and painful experience, but one made 
easier by the massive influx of government aid and by the help of family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Singer was one of the last to leave her 88-unit condominium complex in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The water and gas had been turned off, but unable to find a new place 
accessible to her wheelchair, she stayed on for three weeks after the quake. 
Using water from the pool to flush her toilet made the condo take on the air of 
a campsite. The unsanitary conditions made her sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to find a place I could get into, a place that had a ramp," said 
Singer, 41, noting that the shelters lacked special access facilities. "I had 
to stay in the condo, even though everyone else had left." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after combing classified ads and enlisting the aid of relatives, 
friends and members of her church, Singer discovered a Mission Hills apartment 
designed for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 She is paying $750 a month for a two-bedroom flat, more than the mortgage for 
her damaged three-bedroom condo. She received a deferment in her mortgage 
payments but wonders how long she can afford the rent while she waits for FEMA 
to provide her with emergency housing assistance while her condo is being 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty, Singer enjoys her new place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what I'll do?" she asked. "I like this new apartment so much, maybe 
I'll try to sell my condo and stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Loree Smith and Mark Harris, the search for new housing brought them face 
to face with an old adversary: discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Few landlords seemed enthusiastic about renting to the black couple, whose 
studio apartment near Lafayette Park was declared unlivable a month after the 
quake, when their ceiling belatedly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 With her 18-month housing voucher, Smith said she was determined to move to a 
safe neighborhood for the sake of her 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we could go to Watts, or Compton or someplace like that and find an 
apartment right away," said Smith, who is unemployed. "But I don't want to live 
out there. Too many gangs, too much violence. I'm not going there. I'll build 
me a cardboard hut first. I just want to live in a place for once that's in a 
safe neighborhood and is up to code." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Brett Smith, agrees. "Whatever you do, mom," the mother said the 
eighth-grader had told her, "don't move to South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 With the federal voucher, Smith and Harris will pay about $200 a month for a 
two-bedroom apartment -- a third of what they were previously paying for a 
studio in the high-crime Westlake district. A Hollywood landlord was interested 
when a Red Cross worker telephoned on the couple's behalf. But their arrival 
dimmed his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was stunned when he opened the door," Smith said. "He told us: 'When you 
get a job, come back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She doubts that money was a factor: The two collect $776 in monthly welfare 
payments, more than enough to cover their $200 share of the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got to keep looking," said Harris, hardly despondent about this and 
other similar rejections. "We have to be out there. It's not going to come to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, federal authorities say they have received more than 300 complaints 
alleging housing discrimination against earthquake victims, usually tied to 
their race, or because they are single mothers with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the typical problems we see on a daily basis concerning racial 
discrimination and, for the earthquake, you multiply them," said Michelle 
White, who heads the Fair Housing Congress, which monitors housing issues. 
"Landlords are restricting who they are letting in the door to even look at the 
unit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government told Tracy and Melvin Green that their Mid-City house 
was inhabitable and that they were not entitled to aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple knew better. 
</P>
<P>
 Their foundation had shifted almost a foot. The chimney had crumbled. Big 
cracks had appeared in the master bedroom's walls and ceilings. The city had 
even posted a red tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which issues short-term emergency 
housing grants for renters and homeowners, later acknowledged that a computer 
glitch had caused the error. Disaster housing aid would be forthcoming after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 While the couple waited for their check, it was Tracy Green's employer who 
helped the family back onto their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Centinela Hospital Medical Center, where Green works as an executive 
secretary, put the family up at the Airport Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Inglewood hospital, which was criticized after the 1992 riots for 
firing two employees who were afraid to report to work, paid the family's 
moving expenses and a security deposit for an apartment in Westchester, several 
miles away from their old home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens' home remains unrepaired while the family awaits insurance claims 
and federal aid. Their children, Gary, 14, and Frances, 2, who previously had 
their own rooms, now share a small loft. Their mother misses her washer and 
dryer. The family dog spends its days on a small patio -- not the spacious yard 
where it once roamed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Greens consider themselves lucky. Their search for a new place took a 
single day. Soon, the family hopes to start repair work on their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cramped in this apartment but we know things could have been a lot 
worse," Tracy Green said. "It would have been disastrous without the hospital. 
We would have had to parcel out the children to relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like Christmas," said a stunned Pamela Price, her eyes welling with 
tears, as she toured the Warner Center Apartments complex in Woodland Hills 
that is her new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amenities: four swimming pools (one heated), four spas, six tennis 
courts, two air-conditioned racquetball courts, a volleyball court, a fitness 
room and picnic areas. The setting is far removed from the cramped and badly 
damaged rented house in Winnetka where the family had been residing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a dream come true," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, she and her two sons pitched a tent on their lawn for two 
weeks. Apart from the emotional duress and the daunting prospect of finding a 
new home, the disaster had further strained the family's tenuous finances. 
Price's eldest son lost his sales job when the hard-hit Northridge Fashion 
Center shut down. Price is an unemployed secretary still recovering from 
injuries suffered in an auto accident more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Price was nervous about approaching the crowded assistance center 
in Winnetka, where thousands of people were seeking help. With some 
trepidation, Price finally ventured inside. 
</P>
<P>
 She got lucky: A worker with Beyond Shelter, one of a handful of nonprofit 
agencies assisting quake victims in finding housing, helped shepherd her 
through the baffling housing thicket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people are overwhelmed by the system," said Del Richardson, housing 
resource director for Beyond Shelter, which has provided transportation, 
housing referrals and other help, including hooking up willing landlords with 
needy tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, housing voucher in hand, Price found her "dream home" -- a 
two-bedroom apartment in Warner Center. Ironically, she had fantasized about 
moving into the complex years earlier, but had dismissed the notion as 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the voucher, Price is paying $243 a month for a spacious 
two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. That is almost $200 a month less than her 
rent at the cramped house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like night and day," Price said after signing the contract, credit check 
and other potential hurdles behind her. "This whole thing is a complete 
miracle. I just can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake crunched Adela Rodriguez's building in the Mid-City area, 
the single mother faced a particular quandary: Where would she find an 
apartment whose owner would welcome her seven children, ages 6 months to 13 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 Like many parents, she was determined to remain near her old home, thus 
sparing her already traumatized offspring the upset of changing schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids are well-behaved, not wild like some others," said Rodriguez, who 
emigrated from Mexico 15 years ago. "But the landlords don't know this." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless, her household moved into the family car and later to an emergency 
shelter. Looters, meanwhile, broke into their abandoned apartment, stealing the 
children's clothing and most of their Christmas gifts -- including three new 
bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 From the shelter, the family moved to a friend's living room, sharing sleeping 
space on a sofa and floor. The search continued. 
</P>
<P>
 She finally found a suitable three-bedroom place in the Palms area, but she 
wondered about the future. The family may have to move again in 18 months, she 
said, as the $740 rent would be too much without the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 But her problems turned out to be more immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Her prospective new home had structural problems of its own, sending her back 
in search of "For Rent" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we're better off than those who have nothing," Rodriguez concluded. 
"With God's help, we'll be all right."

 Bahrudin Hrvic cleared a path Tuesday through his friend's second-story 
apartment, righting toppled chairs and picking broken picture frames and 
shelving from a tumble of drapes, lamps and sofa cushions thrown to the floor 
by 10 months of shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first day since last July that the 70-year-old Muslim had braved 
daylight in the ruins of East Mostar, where not a single building has escaped 
the punctures of tank shells and mortars, where not a window retains its glass, 
where not a family has been left untouched by death or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy-artillery bombardment by Croatian nationalists stopped only a few 
days ago, and the whine of an occasional sniper bullet can still be heard 
piercing the silence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hrvic has more reason to trust this first hint of a lasting cease-fire 
than most of the 55,000 Muslims who have lived trapped in basements of blasted 
east bank apartment buildings while weathering the siege: His wife has been 
hidden by Croatian friends on the west side of this divided city since Hrvic 
was rousted from an afternoon nap by armed Croatian extremists and deported 
across the Neretva River wearing nothing but his underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the heavy artillery has been withdrawn from around Mostar, Hrvic has 
been helping those who gave him shelter and solace to put their homes in order. 
</P>
<P>
 He dreams of the day he can cross the river to rejoin his wife, rebuild his 
own home and summon his refugee children from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after all that has happened, I'd rather live together with them than 
divided," Hrvic says of the Croats and Serbs with whom he has shared his life. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the Muslims who have suffered the brunt of loss and casualties 
remain skeptical that their ties with Roman Catholic Croats can be repaired, 
some, like Hrvic, are encouraged by the sudden outbreak of peace to believe 
they are nearing the end of a bloodletting that both sides now say should never 
have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout battered Bosnia, there is a new atmosphere of cautious hope and a 
willingness to believe in miracles as some semblance of a normal life is 
resumed amid the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, trolleys ran Tuesday for the first time 
since the war began nearly two years ago. U.N. soldiers from Ukraine rode 
shotgun on two trial runs along Sarajevo's main thoroughfare, known as "Sniper 
Alley" because of sharpshooters targeting pedestrians from the Serb-held 
southern side. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development heralding relief for hungry civilians, Swedish and 
Danish U.N. troops took control of Tuzla's airport and began clearing mines and 
repairing the runway in preparation for its reopening later this month for a 
humanitarian airlift like the one that has long fed Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some violent incidents disturbed a 4-week-old truce in Sarajevo, where three 
government soldiers were wounded by Serbian gunfire overnight and at least one 
rocket-propelled grenade detonated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, Italy, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said a Spanish plane, 
part of an alliance task force enforcing a "no-fly" zone over Bosnia, had been 
hit by ground fire over Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO said the twin-engine Aviocar logistics aircraft -- which was taking 
personnel from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, to Split -- had to make an 
emergency landing at Rijeka airport on Croatia's northern Adriatic coast. The 
Croatian government blamed rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mostar cease-fire, called by U.N. officials between Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims, has been respected beyond anyone's wildest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of shelling brought the pale residents of East Mostar out of their 
cellars and spurred the most optimistic to begin the long work of housing 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrvic helped his friends Enes and Djamila Muratovic comb through the rubble of 
their three-room apartment, which they had forsaken for life in the building's 
cellar to escape the daily barrage of shells and rifle fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Hrvic was expelled by Croatian nationalists from the West Mostar home he 
had built and furnished with his life's savings, he had been holing up with the 
Muratovices and as many as 70 other Muslims in the subterranean shelters that 
reek of excrement and unwashed bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to have peace here now," said Muratovic, a 63-year-old 
retired soldier. "Look, I wouldn't be here fixing this place up if I didn't 
think so. We'll have to wait for March 15 (when Bosnian-Croatian peace talks 
are to be concluded) to know for sure, but the heavy weaponry has been pulled 
back, and that means they can't so easily kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 There is not yet free movement between the Croat-held west bank and the 
devastated east to which Mostar Muslims were expelled last spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hrvic says he is confident he will soon be able to return. He suspects his 
wife is waiting for him to come back to the west side and begin rebuilding 
their dynamited home, rather than planning to join him as a refugee in the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute I can go back to the other side, I will. I'd swim the Neretva if I 
had to, to get there," the elderly carpenter vowed with spirit, speaking of the 
swift, rock-strewn waters of the river that bisects Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hrvic and his emaciated friends from the cellar seem to assume Mostar's 
integrated lifestyle will be restored, others who have suffered through first a 
Serbian siege and then betrayal by former Croatian allies warn that their scars 
will not so easily heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no more life here. Everything is destroyed. I have no hope in 
anything anymore," moaned Fahim Hadzajlic-Prolic, a 73-year-old refugee from 
nearby Capljina. "I've lost everything, including my wife, who died of a heart 
attack because of her suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 As Amira Serdakovic tended the makeshift grave of her 13-year-old nephew in a 
small park strewn with broken brick from surrounding bomb-blasted buildings, 
she expressed profound doubt that Muslims and Croats will ever again trust each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are honest Croats. A Croat neighbor saved my life last year when 
we were being expelled," said the 41-year-old, laying early spring daffodils on 
the mounded earth over her nephew, who was killed by a sniper last May. "But we 
aren't ever going to forget what they did to us. We may find a way to overcome 
it, but we will never forget."

 AND THE WINNER IS: Pete Wilson will take the Valley in November. Or that's how 
it looks to political consultant Paul Clark, based in Northridge. Wilson, who 
announced his reelection bid Tuesday (A1), has turned things around from a year 
ago, Clark said. . . . "He has redeemed himself," he said. "His performance 
after the quake was good and he shows he's anti-crime." 
</P>
<P>
 HE'S A ROCK: It wasn't even Eddie Van Halen's promise, but he kept it anyway 
Tuesday. . . . The rock legend showed up at New Start Homes in Chatsworth and 
spent time with patients there after a sweet-talking scam artist passed himself 
off as Van Halen's agent last week, vowed that the star would visit, then stole 
a nurse's car. Van Halen was a hit; "he was so warm and caring," said nurse 
Carol Balta, the one whose car was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 OPPORTUNITY: Andrew Young has done it all: mayor, diplomat, civil rights 
advocate. Now add philosopher to the list. Young, above, told a gathering at 
Cal State Northridge on Tuesday that the earthquake is an opportunity: "Crisis 
is really that which produces change and progress." And, for Young, a living. 
He's vice president of a company overseeing much of the cleanup work on campus 
(B2).

<P>
 STRANGE SCENERY: What do Magic Mountain, Temple Beth Shalom and the Santa 
Clarita YMCA have in common? Absolutely nothing, except they are temporary 
classrooms for displaced students from quake-damaged CalArts in Valencia. . . . 
Said one student: "It's not refreshing, exactly, but a change is kind of a good 
ground for generating new ideas" (F11).

 RESERVE HEROINE: Reserve forward Kathy Reith scored seven points in the fourth 
quarter to boost unbeaten Alemany High to a 63-53 comeback victory over 
Escondido in the first round of the girls' Division II state basketball 
playoffs (C6). . . . Alemany in Mission Hills, now 29-0, trailed by 10 points 
in the third quarter. Michael Arkush

COLUMN ONE; STOKING THE FIRES OF DISSENT; THE TRADITION OF BURNING WOOD FOR 
HEAT HAS CAST A PALL OVER MANY SIERRA TOWNS. SOME NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN OF WINTER 
SMOG AND HEALTH RISKS. OTHERS SAY THE INEXPENSIVE STOVES ARE A MATTER OF 
SURVIVAL.

<P>
 On cold winter days, the blue-gray haze that hangs over this mountain town is 
sometimes so thick you can taste it. It wafts up from the chimneys of residents 
who, in the best pioneer tradition, heat their homes with wood they cut 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 This is smog season in the Sierra Nevada, a time when the romantic ideal of a 
blazing hearth gives way to the reality of burning eyes, respiratory illness 
and even premature death from wood smoke pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood fires -- long a cheap source of heat -- are increasingly under challenge 
in Northern California as government agencies begin to regulate when people can 
light fires and what kind of wood stoves they can use. 
</P>
<P>
 In this working-class hamlet 75 miles northwest of Lake Tahoe, the issue of 
smoke pollution has split the community, pitting residents who fear for their 
health against neighbors who insist on their God-given right to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning barbecue lighter fluid in Los Angeles is one thing. But prohibiting 
wood fires in the mountains is another. "It would be like taking a person's gun 
away," said Quincy air pollution control specialist George Ozanich. 
</P>
<P>
 For some mountain inhabitants, wood stove heaters are a matter of survival. 
Many depend on wood as their sole source of warmth in regions where natural gas 
is unavailable, conversion to propane is costly and electric heating would be 
more expensive than the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, wood smoke is a source of discomfort and disease that can 
force them to stay indoors for days. "I don't go out of my house unless I have 
to," said Janet Glover, a 52-year-old Quincy native who blames her emphysema 
and asthma in part on a lifetime of breathing wood smoke. "If I open the door, 
it hits me. I feel like I'm imprisoned in my own home." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood smoke pollution, largely a winter phenomenon in Western states, has 
plagued mountain dwellers for decades, mirroring the summer smog of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In small mountain valleys on cold, calm days, smoke from wood fires is trapped 
by inversion layers that are sometimes just 50 to 100 feet above ground level. 
Without wind or stormy weather, the smoke can hang like a thick fog for days at 
a time between October and March. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the problem is greatest in such mountain communities as Quincy, 
Mammoth Lakes and Truckee, which are nestled in valleys in the Sierra Nevada. 
But wood burning is also a major source of airborne particles in larger air 
basins such as the San Francisco Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley, northern 
Sonoma County and the lower Salinas Valley. In downtown San Jose, as much as 
40% of particle pollution on a winter day can come from wood smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say they are only now beginning to understand the dangers of 
inhaling the tiny particles in wood smoke, which can become lodged deep in the 
lungs. Some say it is an underrated health threat that could be as dangerous as 
breathing secondhand tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies show that children regularly exposed to wood smoke suffer 
diminished lung function. And some research suggests that even at levels deemed 
safe by the federal government, prolonged exposure to wood smoke particles can 
be fatal, especially for elderly people who already have respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can say for sure how many people die each year from breathing wood 
smoke. But some researchers are coming to the conclusion that particle 
pollution is more hazardous than ozone pollution, which is one of the major 
components of smog in Los Angeles. One study estimated that 60,000 people die 
annually from inhaling airborne particles that come from wood smoke and other 
sources, including road dust, diesel exhaust and emissions from manufacturing, 
mining and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studies that have been done suggest to me that what we have is a very 
much underappreciated health hazard," said Dr. Michael J. Lipsett, a public 
health physician with Cal-EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Rozenberg, a onetime concert cellist who suffers from lupus, lives in Los 
Altos, about 10 miles northwest of San Jose. She said she is forced to flee her 
home each winter for the cleaner air of the North Coast because wood smoke 
pollution in her neighborhood makes her so sick. 
</P>
<P>
 With $20,000 of her own money, she has formed an advocacy group called Burning 
Issues to fight the use of wood as fuel, which she believes should be outlawed 
everywhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is really nasty and people are treating it as if it is not," 
Rozenberg said. "The victims are elderly, they are not mobile, they don't have 
enough money to move, and these dangerous levels of pollutants are entering 
their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 But mountain dwellers are as attached to their wood stoves as Southland 
residents are to their cars. And few are able to afford the new generation of 
fancy stoves that come with catalytic converters as standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Quincy, going into the forest to collect firewood is a time-honored ritual, 
usually involving a pickup, a chain saw and a six-pack of beer. A permit to cut 
wood in the National Forest costs only $5, and some people store as much as two 
years' worth of wood so they can weather any cold spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Quincy, winter temperatures can dip well below freezing. Virginia 
Bresciani, who moved here 70 years ago at the age of 3, has kept warm with wood 
all her life. She is a staunch defender of burning wood because it is the only 
economical way to heat the house in winter -- and she thinks people who don't 
like it should try breathing smog in Los Angeles 12 months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 She blames the smoke problem on people who don't know how to burn properly -- 
they use wood that is not dry enough and damp the fire down so low it does not 
get sufficient air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've used wood stoves since I was a toddler and we never had a problem," she 
said. "If the smoke bothers them this much, they shouldn't live up here." 
</P>
<P>
 A cattle rancher and insurance agent, she opposes any restrictions on burning, 
saying: "We've got too much government intervention right now. If you had to 
listen to the government every day you'd never get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 She dismissed those who worry about the health hazards of wood smoke, saying, 
"People look for something to holler about." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood smoke opponents began focusing on the problem in the late 1980s, when 
pollution was heightened by the same climatic conditions that produced 
California's six-year drought. But federal, state and local agencies have been 
slow to regulate the Stone Age technology of wood fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Environmental Protection Agency requires that all new wood stove 
heaters meet specific emission standards, which can cut particle pollution by 
90%. But the agency does not require replacement of the older stoves, which can 
keep on polluting for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is also more than three years behind schedule in evaluating whether 
its safety threshold is adequate for airborne particles 10 microns or smaller 
-- specks so small that more than 10,000 of them could fit on the dot over this 
i . 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the American Lung Assn. sued the EPA in a bid to force the agency 
to update its standard of 150 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24-hour period. 
"The evidence is growing that particulate pollution can kill," said association 
President Alfred Munzer. 
</P>
<P>
 California, meanwhile, has set a safety standard for particle pollution three 
times as strict as the EPA threshold, but it has been left up to local agencies 
to decide how to reduce wood smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," said George Erdman, an air pollution specialist with the 
Northern Sonoma County Air Pollution Control District. "Air pollution control 
issues really come down to the individual: The way you heat your home, the way 
you commute, the way you use cosmetics, the way you light your barbecue." 
</P>
<P>
 Places such as Quincy, Truckee, Mammoth Lakes, Cloverdale and Petaluma have 
moved to curb pollution by requiring that any new wood-burning stove meet EPA 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Lakes, the most aggressive California town in tackling wood smoke, 
goes even further, prohibiting burning on winter days when conditions are 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Francisco Bay Area and the San Joaquin Valley, air quality 
districts have adopted voluntary programs asking citizens not to burn when the 
air quality is bad. 
</P>
<P>
 But these measures fall short of what some cities outside California are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, for example, not only prohibits burning on bad days but also has banned 
the installation of any wood-burning appliance -- including EPA-approved stoves 
-- in the most polluted parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over wood smoke pollution arose in Quincy when school district employee 
Joyce Scroggs made it an issue in her successful 1989 campaign for Plumas 
County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 People from the flatlands were moving to Quincy for its clean mountain air and 
found instead that they were choking on smoke. With the steadily growing 
population, even some longtime residents were annoyed by the thick blanket of 
smoke hanging over their valley on some winter days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of living in these rural areas is that everyone loves the smell 
of wood smoke and it's part of the ambience," Scroggs said. "But it became 
clear it was a real pollution problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Local air monitoring showed that at its worst, Quincy's particle pollution was 
more than double the federal standard and seven times higher than the state 
standard, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without scientific studies, it was obvious to health experts in Quincy 
that some residents were suffering a variety of illnesses from wood smoke, 
including bronchitis, asthma and sinusitis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the options were limited. At least two-thirds of Quincy's 5,000 
inhabitants depend on wood stoves for their heat. "You can't tell people you 
can't burn a wood stove," Scroggs said. And requiring them to spend $2,000 or 
so to install new stoves also was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Quincy decided to require installation of clean-burning stoves 
when homes are sold -- a policy that will have little direct effect on most 
residents and could take decades to clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The town also has tried to limit open burning of leaves and debris to certain 
times of year, but with mixed results. Many old-timers resent the idea of 
government telling them when they can burn. 
</P>
<P>
 For Scroggs, even such modest steps proved too controversial. She lost her bid 
for reelection last year, she said, in part because of her efforts to reduce 
wood smoke pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the new rules, nurse practitioner Kathleen Price said patients with 
respiratory problems start filling her office as soon as the weather turns cold 
and the fires start up. "You can set your clock by it," she said. "We see a lot 
of people who are just miserable all winter." 
</P>
<P>
 John Crouch, a Sacramento spokesman for wood stove manufacturers, encourages 
towns to adopt regulations requiring cleaner-burning stoves. Tougher rules 
would mean more sales for the companies he represents -- and could stave off 
burning bans sought by activists such as Mary Rozenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue has come up in some communities, Crouch has been known to set 
up an EPA-certified stove outside the town hall to demonstrate how little 
visible pollution it produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke is merely unburned fuel, he notes, and with the new stoves, most of it 
is trapped and burned, increasing fuel efficiency as well as reducing 
pollution. "There are thousands of tons of wood smoke emitted in this state 
every day that don't need to be," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rozenberg argues that even the cleanest-burning stoves are far more 
polluting than natural gas or propane. 
</P>
<P>
 She points out that after the London smog of 1952 killed 4,000 people, Great 
Britain banned the burning of solid fuels in metropolitan areas and subsidized 
conversion to cleaner energy. This, she said, is something the United States 
could do too. 
</P>
<P>
 She cites the case of Rosemary Fox, a Bay Area widow in her mid-60s and 
Burning Issues member whose ill health was made worse by her neighbor's wood 
fires. Her doctor concluded that her exposure to smoke particles was life 
threatening, and Fox desperately sought intervention from lawmakers and 
government officials without success. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before her death from heart disease last year, Fox pleaded for help in 
a letter to then-EPA Administrator William Reilly: "All those long hours of 
gasping for oxygen with increasing chest pains, coughing and wheezing from 
particulate matter, and persistent bleeding from the nose . . . have taken a 
toll on my health and ruined my ability to enjoy my retirement years." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozenberg said wood smoke particles are so fine that they can remain in the 
air for three weeks and travel 700 miles. Scientists have found that many 
constituents of tobacco smoke are also produced by burning wood; some are known 
to cause cancer, such as formaldehyde and benzopyrene. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you knew how dangerous wood smoke is, would you want to expose yourself or 
your children?" she asked. "In this state, this Wild West attitude is insane." 
Stove Standards 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to requiring that newly installed wood stoves meet EPA standards, 
these communities have adopted other measures to curb their wood-smoke 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mammoth Lakes: Fires prohibited on days when high levels of wood-smoke 
pollution are expected. Any wood stove or fireplace that does not meet EPA 
standards must be removed or replaced when a home is sold. New homes limited to 
one EPA-approved wood-burning appliance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quincy: Wood stoves that do not meet EPA standards must be removed when a 
home is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lake Tahoe: Wood stoves that fail EPA standards must be removed when a home 
is sold. New multiunit projects are restricted to one wood-burning appliance 
per building. 
</P>
<P>
 * Truckee: Housing developers can be required to pay a fee or remove 
high-polluting wood stoves elsewhere in town to offset the effect of wood 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cloverdale: Construction of any wood-burning masonry fireplace is 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Stoves certified by the EPA as clean burning emit no more than 7.5 grams 
of particulate matter an hour. This can reduce emissions as much as 90% over 
wood stoves and fireplaces manufactured before 1988.

'3 STRIKES' LAW RAISES THE PROSPECT OF MANY ADDITIONAL TRIALS; COURTS: DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS ARE ADVISING CLIENTS AGAINST PLEA BARGAINS. JUVENILE PROVISIONS DRAW 
CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after "three strikes" became law, lawyers advised adult and juvenile 
defendants to go to trial, raising the prospect that courts will quickly become 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alameda County, Dist. Atty. John Meehan said he will not enforce one key 
provision of the tough new criminal sentencing law. Meehan said he will not 
count crimes committed by juveniles as "strikes" because he thinks the 
provision is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the full impact of the law targeting repeat felons will not be felt 
for years, the earliest ripples of change were being felt Tuesday as many 
judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers studied the law for the first time. 
Prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers set up task forces and met with judges 
in an effort to sort out how they would handle what they assume will be an 
onslaught of trials and heavy sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been studying it all day," Stanislaus County Dist. Atty. Donald Stahl 
said. By day's end, he had concluded that "it's the toughest thing I've seen in 
28 years. This is farther reaching certainly than the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law says criminals who have committed two prior violent or serious 
felonies -- there are 29 of them, ranging from murder to residential burglary 
-- and commit any felony on a third offense will face a minimum sentence of 25 
years to life. The law also doubles sentences for second convictions on serious 
or violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first defendants to face life sentences under "three strikes" are almost 
certainly in jail by now, but their identities may not be known until later in 
the week. After making an arrest, police must obtain rap sheets detailing a 
suspect's previous crimes, process the case and send it to prosecutors, all of 
which takes a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County public defenders began telling adult defendants that there 
was little reason to accept plea bargains now if it means that in later life 
they could be subject to additional time in prison if convicted of a new 
felony. Better to test prosecutors' evidence by taking more cases to trial, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain that there are people who have opted against accepting plea 
bargains," said Jabe Kahnke, a deputy public defender in Long Beach. "It's 
certainly something we discussed this morning before (the staff members) went 
to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement officials said they spent Tuesday analyzing the 
full text of the new state law to prepare for a criminal case that will test 
the "three strikes you're out" guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're geared up but nothing's in the works," said Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. 
Conley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer L. Keller, a former public defender now in private practice in 
Irvine, predicted that the court system will overflow with defendants going to 
trial instead of pleading guilty because they don't want to spend 25 years in 
jail for relatively minor felony offenses such as forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a nightmare," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Public Defender Jeff Brown said: "People are really putting 
on the brakes in terms of pleas. People are being hauled aside and given time 
to reflect on this. The ramifications are a hell of a lot more serious today 
than it was (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he is directing his deputies "to ask for a jury trial" in juvenile 
proceedings, rather than a less formal proceeding before a judge -- "and we're 
going to challenge any prior (conviction) based on a juvenile adjudication if 
the conviction was not secured by a jury trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles public defenders also were considering making such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to count as a conviction, it has to be contested," said Los 
Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Nina Law, who handles juvenile cases in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile court system is far less formal and is designed to rehabilitate 
rather than punish. Juvenile convictions are known as "adjudications" and are 
made without juries and without many of the rules of evidence of adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 When the law was moving through the Legislature, many county prosecutors said 
that some of its provisions may be unconstitutional. The California District 
Attorneys Assn. lobbied against it and tried to persuade Wilson not to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an electorate weary and angry over crime, the concept of imprisoning 
repeat felons for life has gathered huge support. Legislators in Sacramento 
cast aside concerns about the measure's cost, questions about constitutionality 
and ambiguity of some of its provisions, and approved the bill by Assemblymen 
Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Fresno) without amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 As it went into effect this week, most prosecutors said they intended to fully 
carry out the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, who objected to the provision regarding juvenile offenders, is a 
veteran of 34 years as a prosecutor and is stepping down this year. He is a 
past president of the district attorneys association and has often taken stands 
that run counter to those of strict law-and-order prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think there is a cloud over the juvenile cases (clause)," Meehan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prosecutors interviewed Tuesday say they will attempt to count juvenile 
crimes as strikes. But Meehan said, "Good luck trying to prove them." He noted 
that records of juvenile proceedings are sealed unless defendants are tried as 
adults, and most juvenile cases are disposed of in informal hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state attorney general's office, a task force of experts on sentencing 
and criminal law embarked on a full analysis of the new law, formulating the 
state's position on key questions, and how to defend expected legal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there were going to be some big, big problems," said George 
Williamson, chief assistant to Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and a major proponent of 
the "three strikes" law. "We were aware that there were some drafting concerns 
which were significant. We were also advised by line prosecutors that they 
perceived some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said he is anticipating charges by defense lawyers that all three 
crimes must be committed after Monday, the day the law went into effect. But he 
predicted that the state would prevail on its position: A felon could have been 
convicted of two serious or violent felonies before Monday, be convicted of a 
third felony after Monday, and be subject to a sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other challenges, including objections to the provision that 
serious or violent felonies committed by a juvenile age 16 or 17 can be counted 
as strikes, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels was among county prosecutors who 
set up a committee of deputies to study its implications. His prosecutors 
quickly found a potential problem not previously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County has three state prisons. A prisoner who commits virtually any 
transgression, from assault on another inmate to possession of drugs or drug 
paraphernalia or a weapon, can be charged with a felony. That felony would 
count as a third strike for those with two strikes behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have to be hundreds of these. Anything you do in the prison is a 
felony," Jagels said.

FBI SUBPOENAS KIM'S RECORDS; ETHICS: FORMER MANAGER SAYS MATERIAL ALLEGEDLY 
SHOWS THAT THE CONGRESSMAN IGNORED WARNINGS TO OBEY U.S. CAMPAIGN LAWS. KIM HAS 
BLAMED PROBLEMS ON STAFF MEMBERS.

 As Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) launched his drive for reelection this month, 
the manager of his 1992 campaign said the FBI has subpoenaed campaign records 
allegedly showing that Kim ignored warnings from his staff to obey federal 
campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
 William Silva, who was interviewed Feb. 18 by the FBI and IRS for two hours, 
said he told agents that he discovered early in 1992 that some campaign 
expenses had been paid with funds from Kim's engineering corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he warned Kim of the problem in a written report and gave Kim an 
informational video explaining that federal law prohibits corporations from 
contributing to federal campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the FBI subpoenaed hundreds of pages of campaign material, 
memoranda, promotional literature, videos, computer diskettes and reports from 
Silva, who is suing Kim for allegedly failing to pay him a $40,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal probe of possible election, tax and labor law violations was 
launched in July after The Times reported that Kim used about $480,000 from 
JayKim Engineers Inc. to finance his federal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the first Korean-born American to serve in Congress, did not return phone 
calls Tuesday. But Kim, whose 41st Congressional District includes portions of 
Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, earlier said his staff was to 
blame for any campaign irregularities. He said he discovered during the 1992 
campaign that his corporation had paid a few small campaign expenses, but that 
he always intended that the campaign would repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, records show, the campaign has not repaid any money to the 
corporation. And the corporation, which Kim sold last year to relatives, has 
forgiven the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 27, Kim's son-in-law, David Kim, who now runs JayKim Engineers, 
directed company officials to write off $485,075 that was identified in company 
records as Kim's 1992 campaign costs, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kim did not return phone calls Tuesday. President Rodney Allen said the 
costs were written off, not as campaign costs, but as "normal business 
expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 During Kim's 1992 congressional campaign, records and interviews show, JayKim 
Engineers provided Kim's campaign with free rent, staff and office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kim signing the checks, records show, the company paid campaign bills 
ranging from airline tickets to telephone service. The expenditures were not 
disclosed on campaign reports that Kim filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's former chief financial officer, Fred Schultz, said he provided Kim with 
a monthly tally of campaign expenses paid by the corporation. In a slander suit 
against Kim, Schultz said the congressman told him not to bill the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents who interviewed Schultz last summer and seized documents from 
JayKim Engineers had no comment, and neither did Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen 
Mansfield, who is in charge of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said Kim brushed off warnings by him and other campaign staff members 
about use of corporate funds. Silva said he was upset and called the Federal 
Elections Commission hot line to inquire about his personal liability. "I saw 
this was bad business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said Kim assured him that he would handle the matter. "After that, I 
just bundled up the invoices and gave them to him to pay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the invoices, Silva said, was for rent owed to the corporation for 
office space under terms of a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim earlier said it did not occur to him that the campaign should pay rent for 
space, which totaled $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Kim hired a Washington election attorney and a prominent Republican 
accounting firm to review his books and determine what, if any, money was owed 
by the campaign to the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim initially said he would use his personal funds to pay their fees. He has 
reported spending $23,000 in campaign funds to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firm's report has not been released, but Kim has said it 
concluded that his corporation should not have paid the rent or other 
incidental campaign expenses of $30,000 to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has said that he was entitled to his full-time salary during the campaign 
because he worked an estimated 40 hours a week on corporate business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Silva said he told FBI agents that Kim did not work enough on corporate 
business to justify collecting his full salary. "There is no way he was working 
on the business in the months of April and May, Monday through Saturday," Silva 
said, adding that he kept a log of Kim's political appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Kim collected about $300,000 in salary, benefits and 
expenses during the campaign and after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he first met Kim at the dinner where Kim announced his candidacy to 
about 30 close supporters. Records show that the catering bill of $946 was paid 
with a check from Jaykim Engineers, signed by Kim, even though the invoice 
carried a notation that it was a campaign expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he left Kim's campaign after the June primary victory, when Kim 
allegedly broke a promise to pay him a $40,000 bonus. He sued the congressman 
last June. His attorney, Barry Besser, said he has rejected an offer from Kim's 
attorney to settle the case for $7,000. Kim is scheduled to be deposed in the 
case April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim founded JayKim Engineers about 16 years ago. With the help of government 
loans and contracts, the company flourished, at one point employing as many as 
170 people in five offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Several relatively unknown Republicans so far have notified the secretary of 
state of their intention to run against Kim for the congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James V. Lacy, who ran against Kim in the last election and lost to 
him by 1,200 votes in the primary, is considering running again. And 
Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) said he is considering entering the 
race.

LUNGREN ASSAILED FOR TYING MAILER TO 'THREE STRIKES' MEASURE; POLITICS: CRITICS 
SAY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FUND-RAISING BID IS DECEPTIVE. BUT CAMPAIGN AIDES DEFEND 
IT AS A 'WIN-WIN' SITUATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren was assailed Tuesday by political watchdogs and 
Democratic opponents for a campaign mailer that solicits support for the "three 
strikes" anti-crime initiative, but asks that checks be made payable to his 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend the mailer is an opportunistic effort by Lungren to tap broad 
public backing for "three strikes" in an effort to raise campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing illegal with what he's done, but it's troublesome," said Ruth 
Holton, executive director of California Common Cause, a political watchdog 
group. "I think it's deceptive. The average voter may not be tuned into the 
fact that the attorney general can use this money for his own purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's recent campaign mailer included an initiative petition and a 
two-page letter outlining his support for the "three strikes" effort. The 
letter tells voters that they can help "by signing and returning the enclosed 
petition along with your most generous contribution." The mailer asks in small 
italics that all checks be made payable to Lungren for Attorney General. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Lungren campaign said the mailer, which was distributed to 
19,000 households around the state, was a straightforward pitch asking for 
contributions to the attorney general and signatures to qualify the "three 
strikes" initiative for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Stabler, Lungren's campaign manager, said the mailer was "absolutely 
clear" that contributions were going to the attorney general's campaign for 
reelection. She said it was effectively a joint effort between the attorney 
general's reelection team and "three strikes" initiative proponent Mike 
Reynolds, the Fresno photographer whose daughter was killed by a repeat felon 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is kind of a non-story," Stabler said, adding that the mailer 
"went to Dan Lungren's donors, his friends. It was educating them, telling them 
that he was trying to help the 'three strikes' people." Stabler had no estimate 
how much money the mailer raised but called it a "win-win situation" for both 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the governor signed a "three strikes" bill into law earlier this 
week, Reynolds and his backers have pushed ahead with efforts to qualify their 
initiative for the state ballot in November. They turned in their signatures 
Monday, saying that the statewide vote is needed to prevent the Legislature 
from tampering with the measure, which puts three-time felons behind bars for a 
minimum of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Cavalier, campaign manager for the initiative drive, said Lungren was 
an early and ardent supporter of the proposal and has helped immensely with 
efforts to get signatures to qualify it for the ballot. He said backers of the 
initiative had no expectation that money generated by the mailer would be 
handed over to the "three strikes" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the petitions that came in as a result of that mailer, we were very 
pleased that he did it," Cavalier said. "As far as we were concerned, it was 
nice to get the petitions printed by somebody else and get those signatures in 
to help us qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 But spokesmen for the two Democrats vying to run against Lungren in November 
suggested that the mailer is at best misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty deceiving," said George Urch, campaign manager for 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who hopes to challenge Lungren in 
November. "He's obviously using the measure to raise money for his own 
political purposes. It's definitely unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 A campaign spokesman for Arlo Smith, the San Francisco district attorney who 
lost to Lungren by a scant margin in 1990, said they plan to file a complaint 
about the mailer with the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just stinks," said Dennis Collins, Smith's campaign manager. "Dan Lungren 
is the top cop in the state, the guy who is supposed to be in charge of ethics, 
and here he's doing something that reeks of duplicity, of not being 
straightforward."

ON CALIFORNIA: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE

<P>
 Maybe this new "three strikes" law will work. Maybe the critics are all wrong. 
Maybe prosecutors and cops and judges and criminal lawyers and RAND consultants 
know less about the nuances of our finicky judicial system than Sacramento 
politicians and the enraged survivors of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a law that puts away three-time felons, violent or otherwise, for life 
won't bankrupt the state budget. Maybe the governors and legislators and 
taxpayers of tomorrow -- who, because of the mechanics of bond financing, must 
pay for this effort -- will know how to service the debt and still make ends 
meet. Maybe they can raise taxes, cut corners, sell campuses -- something. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe felons will heed Gov. Pete Wilson's advice and "start finding a new 
line of work." Maybe people who murder and rape and commit other crazy acts 
still can make rational, pragmatic decisions. And maybe they will decide to go 
straight now, or at least go to Nevada or some other state. If so, maybe those 
projections of 80,000 new prisoners and $20 billion in new prisons will prove 
to be bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe the anecdotal experience of states like Ohio and Washington, which 
traveled this road and found it mined with unexpected consequences, are not 
applicable. Maybe concern about the cost of running homes for geriatric 
convicts long past their criminal prime misses the point. Maybe the law won't 
snare nonviolent, two-bit crooks along with the murderers. Maybe it doesn't 
matter if it does. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe those who fret about societal implications are misguided. Maybe a state 
has no "soul," and thus cannot lose it. Maybe the governor was correct Monday 
when he compared the bill to other great California moments. Maybe it doesn't 
matter that a state that once made deserts bloom and quality education a 
birthright now stands to become a world model for warehousing criminals, second 
to none. Aqueducts, colleges, prisons -- maybe they're all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's true: Brutal times require brutal measures. Maybe there is no place 
anymore for compassion or redemption; like they say, were the victims shown 
forgiveness? Maybe the New Testament needs to be rethought. Maybe an eye for an 
eye is still the ticket. Maybe next we should consider amputating the offensive 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Gov. Wilson will admit now that his earlier vision of "preventive 
government" was but a pipe dream. Maybe government cannot lead, but only react, 
a captive of trends and events. Maybe criminal behavior cannot be prevented, 
only punished. Maybe any attempt to understand and root out whatever it is that 
creates gangbangers and child molesters and bank robbers is just wasted motion. 
And it wouldn't help to invest $20 billion on schools or jobs programs or beat 
cops, instead of prisons -- maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 By all means, the slaughter must stop, but maybe someone can explain the 
timing of this "three strikes" stampede. Maybe the hundreds who fell, year 
after year, on the streets of Los Angeles weren't the right kind of victims to 
capture Sacramento's attention, to galvanize the state for a round of rough 
retribution. Maybe they weren't "poster child" material. Maybe their parents 
didn't give good quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe this won't prove to be one more case of politics as usual, more 
meaningless huffing and puffing on the reelection railroad. Maybe Assemblyman 
Phil Isenberg was wrong when he told his colleagues: "I've been here 12 years, 
and I've watched us pass a whole lot of criminal law stuff, and I've voted for 
almost all of it. And let me tell you my impression. We don't have a plan. We 
don't have a theory. We don't have an approach. We don't have a program. We 
pile bill on bill, sentence on sentence. It is simply reacting. . . . Those of 
you who plan to make a longer tenure in public office than I will have to deal 
with the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the fact that a decade of anti-crime legislation has swollen the prison 
population by a hundred thousand or so, while failing to make the streets seem 
a bit safer, is irrelevant. Maybe this is one reform attempt that won't 
boomerang. Maybe the convicts let out the back door to make room for the 
strikeout cases won't come back to haunt us. Yes, maybe we'd better forget that 
part of the Polly Klaas tragedy -- that, but for the unintended consequences of 
previous get-tough reforms, her killer might never have been unloosed from 
prison in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 No, maybe this one will work. It's a shot in the dark, motivated by fear and 
anger and manipulated by politicians who feed on such emotions, just as crooks 
feed on unlocked doors. Shots in the dark can yield messy results. But maybe 
we'll get lucky. And maybe not.

SINGAPORE BLASTS BACK AT CLINTON IN CANING CASE; ASIA: GOVERNMENT STANDS BY 
SENTENCING U.S. TEEN TO FLOGGING AFTER HE ADMITTED VANDALISM. PRESIDENT CALLED 
PUNISHMENT EXTREME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A war of words between the United States and Singapore over the sentencing of 
an American teen-ager to a flogging for vandalism heightened Tuesday with the 
government here disputing President Clinton's comments on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, Michael P. Fay of Dayton, Ohio, was sentenced last week to six 
strokes of a rattan cane and four months in prison after pleading guilty to two 
charges of spray-painting cars, two counts of mischief and possessing stolen 
property. He was also fined $2,230. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, 18, who is free on $48,000 bail while his lawyers draft an appeal, has 
been checked into a local hospital because of depression, a court was told 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is believed to be the first American sentenced by a Singapore court to a 
caning, a form of flogging administered by a prison official trained in martial 
arts wielding a half-inch-thick cane. The punishment usually leaves scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters in Washington on Monday that the U.S. government has 
filed a strong protest with the Singapore authorities over the sentence. "We 
recognize that they have a certain right to enforce their own criminal laws, 
but we believe that, based on the facts and the treatment of other cases, 
similar cases, that this punishment is extreme, and we hope very much that 
somehow it will be reconsidered," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were not reported in the controlled Singapore press Tuesday. But 
in a statement, the Singapore Foreign Ministry replied to Clinton, saying, "The 
Singapore judicial process cannot apply different standards to persons 
subjected to the same law." Without mentioning Clinton by name, the statement 
said the President's remarks about the unequal application of the law were "not 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 The government here maintains that in the past five years, 14 men, ages 18 to 
21, have received similar jail and caning sentences for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Caning became a punishment in the vandalism statutes in the 1960s as the 
authoritarian government sought to restrict graffiti as a political weapon in 
the hands of opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also denied allegations contained in a letter released in 
Dayton by the youth's father, George Fay, that the confession young Fay gave to 
police last fall was coerced. The teen-ager lives in Singapore with his mother 
and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, young Fay wrote to his father that he had been slapped in the 
face, denied sleep and threatened with a "whipping" if he didn't sign a 
confession. Singapore law does not guarantee a right to silence, nor does it 
allow suspects to request a lawyer to be present during questioning. "I don't 
know truly who did it, and everything that I admitted was a lie," Michael 
reportedly said in the letter released by his father. Fay was read the charges 
in open court and admitted vandalizing the cars.

JAPAN PARLIAMENT ASKED TO OK BRIBERY ARREST OF MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on prosecutors' request, the Tokyo District Court asked Parliament on 
Tuesday to approve the arrest of a former construction minister and Liberal 
Democratic Party member on bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
 This was another blow to the corruption-riddled former ruling party and 
represented the first move against a member of Parliament since prosecutors 
started arresting mayors, governors and construction company executives last 
June. More than 30 people have been indicted on charges of bribery and 
bid-rigging. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also cast suspicion on the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which 
the United States repeatedly has urged to act against collusion that keeps U.S. 
companies from winning a fair share of Japan's construction market. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Cabinet immediately approved the court 
request and sent it to the lower house, which is expected to approve the matter 
in a few days. Parliament members cannot be arrested without the legislature's 
permission while a session is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishiro Nakamura, 44, was charged with accepting a bribe of 10 million yen 
($95,238) from Shinji Kiyoyama, a vice president of construction giant Kajima 
Corp., in January, 1992. In return, he allegedly was to persuade the Fair Trade 
Commission not to file criminal charges of collusion against 66 construction 
companies in Saitama prefecture. Four months later, the agency announced it 
would not file the charges and issued only an administrative warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajima executives headed a "Saturday Assn.," through which 66 construction 
firms allegedly colluded to distribute Saitama contracts for public works 
projects worth 82 billion yen ($781 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Tuesday rearrested Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on a charge of 
bribing an Ibaraki prefectural governor to win a construction contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura was accused of repeatedly asking the commission chairman not to bring 
criminal charges against Saitama firms. Agency officials denied that Nakamura's 
entreaties influenced their decision and claimed they were unable to gather 
sufficient evidence in a year of investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Asahi newspaper reported Tuesday that the agency may have agreed to go 
easy on Saitama companies in exchange for Nakamura's support for an increase in 
fines against anti-monopoly law violators; the United States was demanding the 
increased fines at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura, deputy chairman of the then-ruling party's committee in charge of 
the Fair Trade Commission's affairs, initially opposed the U.S. demand. But he 
switched and supported it after the agency announced its Saitama decision. 
Ultimately, the commission raised the limit on anti-monopoly fines by 20 times 
-- to 100 million yen ($952,380). 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 38 years of Liberal Democrat rule that ended last August, bills 
approved in a party committee inevitably became law by virtue of the party's 
majority in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura, who served as construction minister from December, 1992, to August, 
1993, has denied that Kajima asked him to intervene with the Fair Trade 
Commission but has acknowledged that he received political contributions from 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin Kanemaru, 79, a former Liberal Democrat kingpin and construction industry 
"fixer" now standing trial on charges of tax evasion, reportedly entrusted 
Nakamura with handling the Saitama case. Kanemaru's arrest in March, 1993, 
spurred the construction industry probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, press reports speculated that charges might be filed against as many 
as six Parliament members. Yohei Kono, the Liberal Democrats' president, 
described the action against a member of his party as "extremely regrettable." 
But he said his party will not judge the case on "partisan interests."

OBSERVERS CRITICIZE KAZAKH ELECTION; CENTRAL ASIA: A LIST OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
HANDPICKED CANDIDATES IS CITED. CENSURE IS A SETBACK TO HIS IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 International observers declared Tuesday that the first post-Communist 
parliamentary elections in this vast Central Asian republic, one of the most 
likely economic success stories in the former Soviet Union, were not 
sufficiently "free and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Kazakhstan held national elections Monday to form a new Parliament, as well as 
regional and city councils. The new Parliament of 177 full-time members will 
replace the former Supreme Soviet of 360 part-timers, which President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev dissolved three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-member delegation from the Council for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe announced at a news conference in the Kazakh capital that the elections 
"did not meet internationally accepted standards for free and fair elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the CSCE delegation, Dutch lawmaker Jan van Houwelingen, listed 10 
shortcomings -- in particular, a special list of 65 candidates handpicked by 
Nazarbayev from which 42 were to be elected, nearly a quarter of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 This presidential list was ostensibly to ensure a balance of candidates from 
political and ethnic groups. In fact, it ensured Nazarbayev's control over the 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most countries," said Van Houwelingen, "you don't have a system where one 
person declares his own list (of candidates)." Another criticism was that the 
system for registering candidates was "severely flawed," with one-sixth of the 
900 potential candidates blocked from running because of their anti-Nazarbayev 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, CSCE observers said, candidates were disqualified "in an arbitrary 
and capricious manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism came as a setback for Nazarbayev, a Communist Party leader 
turned reformer who has tried hard to show that he is a man with whom America 
can do business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazakhstan, which covers more than 1 million square miles of steppe, desert 
and mountains between Russia and China, has attracted considerable American and 
European interest because of its potentially vast reserves of oil, gas and 
other raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 It is strategically important not only because of its geographical location 
but as one of the four former republics -- along with Russia, Ukraine and 
Belarus -- that inherited a share of the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. 
Kazakhstan has agreed to deactivate its 104 long-range SS-18 missiles, each of 
which carries 10 nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazakhstan's Central Election Commission said Monday that it had found no 
serious violations in the voting. But the more than 100 international observers 
expressed reservations about shortcomings in the electoral law and the need for 
further refinements to ensure more democratic elections in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Many problems resulted from inexperience, rather than from deliberate attempts 
to rig results, monitors said. "Many electors did not understand the system of 
voting and voted simultaneously for several candidates," Elizabeth Winship, 
another member of the CSCE delegation, said in Almaty, the capital formerly 
known as Alma Ata. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the election's shortcomings, the Parliament will represent a wider 
variety of political views than before in this ethnically diverse land. "The 
fact that elections were held, that opposition parties and candidates 
campaigned and expressed their views and that international observers were 
invited indicates a desire on the part of the government of Kazakhstan to move 
toward democracy," Van Houwelingen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to Nazarbayev lies chiefly among Kazakhstan's ethnic Russians, who 
total almost 40% of the population. The Russians are concentrated in the 
industrial north, where an oil shortage has left residents with little heat and 
hot water and where a government cash shortage has left many Russian coal and 
industrial workers broke. A political divide is widening between the Russians 
and ethnic Kazakhs, who also make up slightly more than 40% of the population. 
If one ethnic group wins a majority of seats, this election could widen the 
ethnic rift. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazarbayev's special list of candidates, 75% Kazakh, may add fuel to the 
political fire. Among the CSCE's recommendations for fairer elections is that 
the president's list be eliminated in future elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Final election results are not due until Thursday, and they are not expected 
to change the republic's political complexion radically.

YELTSIN'S FOES NOT LEANING TOWARD VIOLENCE, NIXON SAYS; RUSSIA: EX-PRESIDENT 
SEES NO STRUGGLE FOR A RETURN TO COMMUNISM. BUT HE HAS YET TO MEET RADICAL 
ZHIRINOVSKY.

<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon, on a weeklong visit to Russia that includes 
extensive meetings with opposition leaders, said Tuesday that he is heartened 
that none of them appear to seek violence or a return to the old Soviet 
Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that they're unanimous in believing that the country is on the wrong 
course," Nixon said of anti-government critics ranging from the ousted vice 
president to the head of the Communist Party. "But what encouraged me is that I 
have not found any of the opposition leaders today . . . who want to change the 
situation by force or any of them who want to go back to what the situation was 
before the new Russian Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, a strong advocate of U.S. support for the Kremlin's reforms, has yet to 
meet with the most intimidating leader of the Russian opposition -- 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who emerged the favorite of fed-up 
voters in December elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting may occur today, Zhirinovsky's spokesmen and Nixon's chief of 
staff said. But Nixon also may decide that it is more politically correct to 
meet with Zhirinovsky only after he meets with President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have pointedly spurned 
Zhirinovsky on recent visits to Moscow, refusing to add to his legitimacy by 
meeting him. He was the only opposition leader not to be invited to a special 
reception for Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's luxurious residence, Spaso 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon's visit appears to provide Clinton with an unofficial channel to 
Zhirinovsky. Nixon told reporters that he talked to Clinton by phone before his 
departure and will deliver an assessment of what he found here upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
 What he has found so far, Nixon told reporters, is that "there is no question 
that the country is in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, he took it as a sign of Yeltsin's strength that the Russian 
government made no attempt to keep him from meeting with its opponents. "The 
fact that they did not resist that, I think, is a positive indication," Nixon 
said after a meeting with Gennady A. Zyuganov, head of Russia's Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, 81, is also to meet today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, 
and he is tentatively scheduled to meet with Yeltsin next Monday in the resort 
town of Sochi if the Russian president goes ahead with plans for a brief 
vacation there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon has visited Moscow nine times. But this trip comes at an unusually 
sensitive time, in the wake of a noticeable cooling in U.S.-Russian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 This cooling stems partly from Moscow's determination to reassert itself 
internationally and to play up to rising nationalism at home. The new Russian 
line, combined with the recent scandal surrounding the CIA counterintelligence 
chief who was caught spying for Moscow, has caused Washington to re-evaluate 
its Russia policy amid mounting questions about whether the United States 
should continue to supply Russia with aid. Clinton said Monday that he is 
concerned about Russia and the wave of nationalist extremism that "would make 
more difficult our future relationships with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon appears to be trying to counteract the negative cycle in the making. He 
has used his status of senior statesman over the last two years to push for an 
array of U.S. aid for Russia, from food to a corps of managers to debt 
rescheduling. If America fails to cough up, he has warned, its leaders soon 
will face the embarrassing question "Who lost Russia?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has argued that Russia's fate will determine the next 50 years of world 
history and that the world must prevent "a new, more dangerous despotism based 
on extremist Russian nationalism" from replacing communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Zyuganov, after meeting with Nixon, said the message he sent to Clinton was 
that Yeltsin's economic reforms, if not modified, will "not only totally 
destabilize the situation in Russia but will also bring about a cataclysm of 
world dimensions." 
</P>
<P>
 Zyuganov also emphasized that Yeltsin's strongest backers, the Russia's Choice 
bloc, got only about 15% of the vote in the December elections and that the 
United States should not orient its policy toward politicians with such weak 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon is an ardent Yeltsin backer, but his agenda this trip shows that he 
shares the Administration's strategy of seeking wide-ranging contacts across 
the Russian political spectrum.

GERMAN JOBLESS RATE HITS 10.5%; DAMAGE TO KOHL LIKELY; EUROPE: PUBLIC SAYS 
EMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE RUN-UP TO FALL ELECTIONS. MANY ECONOMISTS 
DEPLORE HIGH LABOR COSTS, LOW PRODUCTIVITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German unemployment rose to a postwar record of 4.04 million in February, 
climbing toward the jobless levels that helped bring Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler 
to power in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Labor Office announcement Tuesday of a 10.5% jobless rate bodes 
poorly for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his center-right Christian Democratic 
Union in this year of 19 state and federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The country will vote for a new Parliament and chancellor in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans have identified unemployment as the top election issue in recent polls 
that also show Kohl fighting for political survival. His party, which rules in 
a coalition with the Free Democratic Party, is losing ground to the 
left-of-center Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl spokesman Dieter Vogel downplayed the figures as "no surprise" after 
unemployment topped 4 million in January. Finance Minister Theo Waigel added 
that the recession-plagued economy shows signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the basic indicators in Germany are pointing upward. The economic 
situation will generally improve in 1994, despite high unemployment," Waigel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists agree, although the Economics Ministry released data Tuesday 
showing that western Germany's economy actually shrank in the last quarter of 
1993. Previously, the government had said it was flat. The ministry said the 
region's gross domestic product fell 0.5% from the previous quarter and 0.9% 
from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Volger-Ludwig, head of labor and social politics at the IFO Institute for 
Economic Research in Munich, noted that joblessness is always higher in winter 
and said unemployment is not likely to worsen in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But many economists emphasize that Germany's unemployment problem is 
structural, and they warn that more companies will send more jobs abroad if 
labor costs do not come down and industry does not become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 German wages have been rising faster than those of other major industrial 
nations and nearly twice as fast as Germany's own industrial output. From 1985 
through October, 1993, unionized workers' real hourly wages grew 23%, compared 
to a 12% growth in industrial output, according to the Federal Statistics 
Office. By contrast, real wages in the United States declined 8.5% in the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 German industry has been resisting unions' wage demands in the last year, 
setting off a wave of warning strikes and a vote to strike by IG Metall, the 
union of engineering workers, in Lower Saxony last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike -- which would have been the first major walkout in western German 
industry in 10 years -- was averted at the last minute when the union 
effectively agreed to a pay freeze for 3.6 million engineering workers. IG 
Metall leader Klaus Zwickel said the union had traded "job security against 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was seen as a signal to the country's 3.5 million public sector 
workers, who have launched a series of warning strikes for wage negotiations 
scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
 Unionized bank employees, printers and construction workers are also seeking 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Tuesday showed that unemployment rose in western Germany 
to 8.9% of the work force in February from 8.8% in January. In eastern Germany, 
the rate was 17.1% compared to 17% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern German voters naturally express the most concern about unemployment in 
election polls. And eastern Germany, which Kohl helped to reunite with the 
west, could be the decisive factor in ousting the western chancellor after 12 
years in office.

CHRISTOPHER WARNS CHINA ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher issued a new warning Tuesday to China 
that its human rights policies, and particularly its detention of several 
dissidents over the past week, are spoiling the atmosphere for the visit to 
Beijing he will make on Friday and are jeopardizing China's future trade 
privileges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be hard to overstate the strong distaste we all feel" for China's 
recent behavior, he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher went out of his way to emphasize that he had talked Tuesday with 
congressional leaders about the need for a "stern" position on human rights in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the same news conference, Christopher confirmed that Frank G. Wisner, 
undersecretary of defense for policy, will accompany him to Beijing, thus 
becoming the highest-level Pentagon official to visit China since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner said that in his meetings with senior Chinese defense officials, he 
will "reinforce" Christopher's message for China. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, police picked up a leader of the 1989 Tian An Men Square movement 
Tuesday for the second time in a week and threatened to imprison him again if 
he continues pro-democracy activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang Dan, 25, who served 43 months in prison for his role in the 1989 
democracy movement, said later that police read him a statement warning he 
could face serious penalties if he continues his political activities.

63 DIE IN S. AFRICA TRAIN CRASH; POSSIBILITY OF BOMB IS PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A speeding train filled with black commuters derailed near here Tuesday, and 
63 people died when the cars smashed into a wooded hill. A railway investigator 
was trying to determine if a bomb sent the train off the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 A thunderstorm burst as workers using cranes completed the grisly 12-hour task 
of lifting the eight derailed coaches. Bodies had been found throughout the 
sweltering day, but officials said they did not expect to find any more dead. 
</P>
<P>
 About 370 people were injured in the crash, the worst train accident in South 
Africa since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was approaching a station outside this eastern port city, about 350 
miles southeast of Johannesburg, at about 5:20 a.m. when all but two of its 10 
cars derailed. Rail officials said there were about 800 commuters on board, 
most of them black, traveling from the Kato Ridge suburb into Durban. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors and witnesses said the train seemed to have been traveling too fast, 
but sabotage was considered a possibility, given the pervasive violence in the 
run-up to April's all-race elections -- a vote that will end white-minority 
rule and probably put the African National Congress in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have blamed pro-apartheid whites for bombings this year of ANC and 
government targets, including railway tracks. Blacks also have been blamed for 
some terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, rescue workers struggled to carry victims yards across 
steep terrain to ambulances. Helicopters and a military plane were called in to 
help transport people to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Police hauled bloody handbags, shoes, food and severed limbs from the wreckage 
as shocked survivors and spectators watched from the surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of onlookers became angry. One man berated a policeman who stuffed 
four bodies into a police van. Others began chanting "Viva!" -- a cry heard at 
ANC rallies -- and singing protest songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers and witnesses said the train appeared to be traveling far too 
quickly before it derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver was going like hell on all the bends," one survivor told the South 
African Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-ranking ANC official, Sithunywa Dube, demanded an independent inquiry 
into the accident, saying he was convinced it was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some survivors claimed that the train's white engineer threatened passengers 
before the crash that they would never reach their destination, said Dube, who 
was translating for Zulu-speaking survivors.

KEY HEALTH REFORM COMMITTEE FIRES UP; LEGISLATION: PRESIDENT DELIVERS A 
SPIRITED SALES PITCH FOR HIS PROPOSALS AS BILL-DRAFTING PROCESS BEGINS. SPECIAL 
INTERESTS ESCALATE LOBBYING EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 More than five months after President Clinton unveiled his controversial 
health reform agenda, the legislative machinery ground into action Tuesday as a 
key congressional panel began considering an approach that preserves Clinton's 
goal of universal coverage but rejects some of the means he had proposed for 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 As the House Ways and Means health subcommittee went to work, the President 
delivered a spirited sales pitch for his proposals, urging "naysayers and 
pessimists" not to be "quite so fast" in dismissing the chances of 
comprehensive health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen a lot of endeavors in which I was involved over the last 15 years 
given up for dead, including my own political endeavor," Clinton told a group 
of executives. 
</P>
<P>
 With the drafting of health reform legislation finally under way, a dizzying 
array of special interests have escalated their lobbying efforts on Capitol 
Hill, jockeying for attention. Among them are doctors, dentists, hospitals, 
women, tobacco workers and consumer advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Assn. Executives, described 
how the many key elements of his plan mesh to form a comprehensive agenda that 
he said would lower aggregate medical spending, increase consumer choice, 
enhance the quality of care, relieve providers of burdensome paperwork and 
ensure universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also defended several specific pillars of his plan that many in 
Congress say have little or no chance of passage: a cap on insurance premiums, 
a requirement that employers pay at least 80% of a worker's premiums and the 
creation of mandatory health insurance-purchasing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the employer mandate builds on the current system "because 
that's where nine of 10 Americans who have insurance already get it." 
</P>
<P>
 And by pooling consumers into large purchasing cooperatives, members will be 
able to buy less expensive insurance and have a choice of plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless every American is covered, Clinton added, providers will continue to 
shift the uncompensated cost of treating the uninsured onto those who have 
insurance -- through higher, hidden charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is why I have said that I cannot sign -- and indeed would have to veto 
-- a bill that pretended to reform the health care system without providing a 
system by which everyone is covered. Because -- unless everyone is covered -- 
there is no cost control, there is no end to cost shifting, there is no real 
security and there is no balance in the system," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although at least three separate committees will be considering health reform 
legislation, it is the Ways and Means Committee that House Democratic leaders 
regard as the critical bellwether of how health care reform will fare in the 
House at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Health subcommittee chairman Pete Stark (D-Oakland) wants to achieve Clinton's 
primary goal -- health coverage for all Americans -- through different means. 
Rather than requiring most Americans to get their insurance through 
government-organized purchasing cooperatives, Stark would achieve universal 
coverage by expanding the Medicare program to cover the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clinton, Stark would require employers to contribute toward their 
workers' coverage. But Stark's plan offers a less comprehensive package of 
benefits. While precise cost estimates are not yet available, he said that the 
annual cost of insuring an individual would be about $1,800 -- or $300 less 
than Clinton's plan is projected to cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said that his proposal "builds upon the best features of the President's 
plan, as well as the current system." But he conceded that his plan, like 
Clinton's, lacks the votes it needs to pass his subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel could take up to two weeks to draft the legislation. And actual 
voting may not begin until next week. In the meantime, health care lobbying is 
quickly picking up steam. The American Hospital Assn. has launched an ambitious 
grass-roots advocacy campaign, designed to mobilize 5,000 member hospitals -- 
and their 4 million employees -- to promote the association's health care 
reform principles at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 The group generally supports the employer mandate but opposes mandatory health 
alliances, premium caps and Medicare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 dentists and physicians also are here this week. Members of 
the American Dental Assn. are specifically pushing for federal funding to cover 
dental treatment for low-income residents and for elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The most noticeable presence are the 800 doctors attending the annual American 
Medical Assn. lobbying conference. Among the AMA's health reform goals are 
antitrust relief and malpractice reform, namely a $250,000 cap on non-economic 
damages in malpractice suits. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the doctors were convening, consumer advocate Ralph Nader called a 
press conference to denounce such a cap, calling it "a hidden time bomb that 
will drastically restrict the legal rights of health care consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA, the nation's largest doctors organization, also supports universal 
coverage, consumer choice of providers and a lessening of government 
regulations, particularly in the physician-patient relationship, said James S. 
Todd, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of the AMA's clout, a steady stream of key members of Congress spoke 
at its session. They included Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), an influential GOP 
figure on the issue; Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), sponsor of the 
Canadian-styled, single-payer plan; Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), sponsor of a 
leading rival plan to Clinton's; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker after speaker said that Clinton's plan needs major revisions. Among 
them was Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the designated White House 
representative to the doctors. "The legislation submitted by the President is 
going to be rewritten" because of its "many flaws," declared Dingell, chairman 
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was invited, as were many Administration 
officials, but none accepted, AMA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Congressional Women's Caucus said that coverage for mammograms 
must be broader than currently proposed in most of the pending plans.

DEAD INMATE'S ACCOUNT OF 21 KILLINGS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected serial killer who died of complications of AIDS while on Death Row 
confessed to killing 21 young men in a methodical murder rampage in which he 
lured victims with drugs, alcohol and money, his attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure provided some answers to a decade of haunting questions about 
the convicted killer, Larry Eyler, who died Sunday. Authorities had considered 
him the prime suspect in a string of murders across Illinois and Indiana in the 
early 1980s. However, he was convicted in only two killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I'm here is so that the families know -- he did confess to the 
murders of your sons," attorney Kathleen Zellner said at a news conference 
attended by families of Eyler's alleged victims. "He told me that, and I hope 
that can bring you some peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellner, who had handled Eyler's appeals, said he described the killings to 
her over the last three years and that she convinced him to let her release his 
confession after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 She released a list of 21 killings to which she said Eyler confessed, along 
with the places and dates where the victims were found between 1982 and 1984. 
It gave no name for seven of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Zellner said an accomplice helped Eyler commit four of the killings. She did 
not name the alleged accomplice but said she knew the person's identity and 
urged others who may have been targeted as victims to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyler lured his victims with offers of liquor, drugs and money, Zellner said, 
then drove them to remote areas where they were handcuffed, gagged and 
blindfolded and had their feet bound. Not all of Eyler's victims were 
homosexuals, Zellner said, and he never had sex during the abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyler was sentenced to death for the 1984 slaying of a 15-year-old male 
prostitute whose dismembered body was found near Eyler's Chicago home.

 Police on Tuesday wounded a 25-year-old man they believe was connected to the 
kidnaping of three people in Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland police spotted the suspect driving a car in East Oakland on Tuesday 
afternoon, about 45 minutes after he apparently freed one of the victims, 
identified as Wendy Brown, 30, of Sacramento.The other two victims had escaped 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers pursued the suspect over the Bay Bridge and were joined in the chase 
by San Francisco police, Oakland Police Lt. Peter Dunbar said. The shooting 
occurred about 3:30 p.m. near the 5th Street exit of Interstate 80 in downtown 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the shooting were not released. The suspect was in 
critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa Police Sgt. Jim Carlson said authorities believe the man is David 
Charles Wesley. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the suspect allegedly confronted Brown, Michael Kizorec, 22, of 
Santa Rosa; Patti Dailey, 22, and her twin sister, Penny Dailey, of Petaluma. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, armed with a gun, apparently fired a shot and forced the victims 
into Kizorec's car. Patti Dailey escaped in the confusion, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kizorec and Penny Dailey escaped later in San Francisco when the kidnaper 
tried to force one of them to withdraw money from an automated teller machine, 
police said. Brown apparently was held until Tuesday afternoon.

DESPITE OPPOSITION, ANTIGUA DYNASTY KEEPS ITS GRIP ON POWER

<P>
 Voters Tuesday extended the corruption-tainted Bird family's half-century hold 
on Antigua, sending a new generation into power despite a last-minute surge by 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Official election returns late Tuesday showed clear triumphs for retiring 
Prime Minister V. C. Bird's Antigua Labor Party in eight of 17 parliamentary 
races and a commanding lead in a ninth race, which would give the party a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing parties had united in hopes of frustrating Bird's attempt to transfer 
power to his son Lester, his chief aide for most of the past 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts on both sides detected a shift of support toward the opposition in 
recent weeks, spurred by new charges of government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, which won only one seat in the last election in 1989, won or 
was leading in seven races, according to official election returns. The 
remaining race was too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the governing party to victory were Lester Bird and his brother, Vere 
Bird Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 84-year-old father rose to run Antigua's labor movement in 1943, steered 
his Caribbean homeland to independence and, with U.S. backing, swapped 
Antigua's dependence on sugar farming for upscale tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 While becoming one of the eastern Caribbean's most prosperous nations, Antigua 
in the past two decades emerged as a magnet for money laundering and a conduit 
for arms to whites in South Africa and to the Medellin cocaine cartel in 
Colombia. The country is made up of two islands, Antigua and Barbuda. 
</P>
<P>
 To a calypso beat titled "Never Again," at least 3,000 people marched through 
the capital Monday night, many chanting "No more Birds!" and portraying the 
governing party as dominated by criminals and drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocks away, a sound system boomed "(Everybody Must) Work," a theme of the 
governing Antigua Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Claxton Brown, 63, said he was voting for Bird because he didn't want to lose 
his security job in the government, the nation's No. 1 employer. Governing 
party workers wheeled elderly and infirm voters into another center outside St. 
John's, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie John Drew, characterized in daughter Jamaica Kincaid's book "Annie 
John," waited patiently in the hot sun to vote for the opposition United 
Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the 74-year-old Drew beamed and displayed her ink-stained 
forefinger -- a precaution against electoral fraud -- declaring, "I felt good 
because I voted for who I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The integrity of the election was suspect because of a 5-year-old voting list 
that counts 43,000 eligible voters -- a statistical improbability in a 
youth-driven nation of 59,000 people. Both opposition and governing party 
members have challenged the list.

GOP WELFARE PROPOSALS BECOMING MORE CONSERVATIVE; PUBLIC AID: THE MOVE COULD 
COMPLICATE CLINTON'S EFFORT TO ACHIEVE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT. GOP TURNS THE 
FOCUS TO OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS INSTEAD OF WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under fire from conservative intellectuals, Republicans are toughening their 
welfare reform proposals -- a move that could complicate President Clinton's 
hopes of building a bipartisan legislative coalition on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has asked a GOP task force that 
drafted the House Republican welfare proposal last fall to study the 
possibility of incorporating sterner measures into the bill to discourage 
births out of wedlock. The measures would be modeled on conservative analyst 
Charles Murray's call for reducing the rising number of such births by denying 
cash benefits to single women who bear children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Rep. James M. Talent (R-Mo.) is circulating a competing 
reform bill that would deny welfare benefits to any parent under 21 and impose 
work requirements more broadly than either the existing House GOP bill or the 
plan under development by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the political landscape has changed since the Republican bill was 
developed," Talent said. "It is now possible to go much further than I thought 
it was possible to go four or five months ago. . . . The possibilities are 
open-ended now." 
</P>
<P>
 Within Republican circles "there's a sense that the whole spectrum has shifted 
right," one House leadership aide said. "What seemed about as far out as we 
could be and still be in play legislatively (in our proposal) seems to be about 
middle-ground right now." 
</P>
<P>
 With many liberals still suspicious of Clinton's call for "ending welfare as 
we know it," the rightward movement within the GOP will complicate the 
Administration's task of building a centrist coalition for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Republican initiatives is likely to become law. But as the more 
conservative proposals rise in prominence, it becomes more difficult for 
Clinton to attract significant bipartisan support for his plan, which is to be 
released next month. 
</P>
<P>
 This movement follows a pattern that has emerged on other issues, such as 
crime: As Clinton has tried to steer the Democratic Party toward the center, 
Republicans have moved further right. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, conservatives were the champions of requiring welfare recipients to 
work. But now that Clinton has called for mandating work after two years on the 
rolls, the center of conservative opinion is moving to the argument that 
deterring out-of-wedlock births, not demanding work, is the key to real welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're dealing with different premises, different analyses and 
fundamentally different proposals, it makes it more difficult to get a Clinton 
coalition" to pass welfare reform, said Peter Wehner, policy director at a 
Washington conservative think tank, Empower America. "But if you concede at the 
outset (that) the Clinton premise is right, you may get a bill -- but you don't 
get a bill that really deals with the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The hope, Talent said, is that, by moving to the right, Republicans will "hold 
Clinton to his commitments" against pressure from liberal Democrats to dilute 
reform. But more moderate welfare reform advocates question whether the real 
conservative goal is to deny Clinton a legislative victory on the politically 
polarizing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the nightmare scenarios for Republicans is that they join with the 
President to solve the welfare problem that has bedeviled the Democrats for 
decades," one left-of-center welfare lobbyist said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Republican thinking about welfare reform has not coalesced as 
much as in the House. The principal Senate Republican welfare proposal, built 
around an immediate workfare requirement for all able-bodied recipients, has 
attracted just 19 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the vacuum, GOP calls for more radical change are emerging. On Monday Sen. 
Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) proposed turning over responsibility for 
welfare, food stamps and the Women, Infants and Children nutritional program 
entirely to the states, in return for the federal government eventually 
assuming all costs for Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care program 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassebaum said Monday that her plan would allow states flexibility to redesign 
the welfare system in basic ways. "I do not think Washington can reform welfare 
in any meaningful, lasting way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clinton's evolving plan, the House GOP bill places primary emphasis on 
moving welfare recipients off the rolls by requiring them to work. And like the 
expected Clinton plan, the bill would require recipients to work after two 
years on the rolls and provide government jobs if no private employment is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill attempts to discourage out-of-wedlock births by preventing teen-agers 
on welfare from establishing their own households -- as Clinton is likely to 
propose. But the Republican plan would go well beyond Clinton's to say that 
states could not provide benefits to parents under 18, or to women who had 
additional children while already on the rolls, unless they pass legislation 
specifically authorizing such payments. 
</P>
<P>
 When House Republicans introduced their bill last November, 162 of the 175 GOP 
members endorsed it. And with its broad similarities to Clinton's approach, 
some legislative observers thought that it created the possibility for a broad 
welfare reform coalition. But that prospect is being clouded by the intense 
counterattack against the legislation within Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a process reminiscent of the toughening stand among GOP legislators against 
health care reform, this reassessment on welfare is being driven primarily by 
criticism from outsiders, such as Murray; Robert Rector of the Heritage 
Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank; former Education Secretary 
William J. Bennett, and Bill Kristol, founder of the Project for the Republican 
Future. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservatives have strafed the bill on policy and political grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal policy criticism is that it focuses too much on expensive 
workfare programs and does not do enough to discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
Conservatives have been urging at least experiments with the idea of cutting 
off all cash aid, except medical assistance, to unwed mothers since Murray 
wrote a Wall Street Journal article late last October presenting that as the 
best way to stem the tide of out-of-wedlock births -- expected to reach 40% of 
all births by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not understand why these people think getting poor women into the job 
market is going to solve the problem," Murray said. "You're still going to have 
urban centers where you don't have any fathers, and that's the source of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all observers consider Murray's idea too Draconian to pass Congress, 
but it is shifting the center of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely, sources said, that the GOP will amend its bill to allow states 
to experiment with Murray's proposal. It may also stiffen the measures allowing 
states to cut off welfare benefits to young mothers -- for example, by raising 
the age beneath which benefits would be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who led the task force that drafted the House 
GOP bill, signaled that he is likely to resist too many changes.

POSTAL SERVICE SEES 32-CENT STAMP AS ANSWER TO RED INK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Postal Service Board of Governors on Tuesday proposed raising the price of 
a first-class stamp to 32 cents as part of a general increase in postal rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal now goes to the independent Postal Rate Commission, which has 10 
months to hold hearings and rule on the request. If approved, the new rates 
would take effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The current 29-cent rate was imposed on Feb. 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-cent increase for a first-class stamp would cost the average 
household between 60 cents and 75 cents a month, postal officials estimated. 
But it would mean nearly $3 billion in added revenue for an operation that lost 
$1.7 billion last year and is struggling to hold the red ink to $1.3 billion in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us wants to raise postage rates," Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon 
Jr. said. "We're sensitive to the impact of our price increases on customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon and Postal Board Chairman J. Sam Winters called the proposed increase 
moderate and said it would require continued cost-cutting by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger increase "would have been a safer, less-demanding course," Runyon 
said. But he added that a sharp increase also would have cost the post office 
business from companies sending large volumes of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the post office accepted a proposal by the Mailer's Council, which 
represents major corporations and associations that send out billions of pieces 
of mail. It called for an across-the-board increase of 10.3%, which is 
essentially what the postal governors proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the proposal are a 32-cent charge for the first ounce of a 
first-class letter and 25 cents for each additional ounce. That is up from the 
current price of 29 cents for the first ounce and 23 cents for each added 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Postcards would increase from 19 cents to 21 cents and other rates would rise 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a rate increase of about 10.3% for first- and second-class 
regular-rate mail, 10.2% for third-class and 13.2% for fourth-class. 
</P>
<P>
 First class is cards and letters, second is magazines and other periodicals, 
third class is advertising and fourth class is parcels.

STANFORD PROFESSOR SWORN IN AS CHAIRMAN OF LABOR BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford University law professor William B. Gould IV was sworn in Tuesday as 
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, capping a nine-month 
controversy that drew heated opposition from congressional conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, whose nomination by President Clinton was confirmed by the Senate last 
week on a 58-38 vote, becomes the first African American to serve as chairman 
of the NLRB and only the second black member in its 58-year-history. 
</P>
<P>
 He took his oath of office in San Francisco and said that he would assume his 
duties in Washington "in a matter of days" with an eye toward reducing "the 
polarization . . . at the board and . . . between labor and management." Chief 
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco officiated at the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB is an independent agency created by Congress in 1935. It conducts 
union elections and rules on unfair labor practices and is charged with 
enforcing federal labor laws that give employees the right to join a union and 
to engage in collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations, the NLRB generally 
took on a pro-business, anti-union cast. But Gould declared his intention to 
"return the board to the center." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, 57, called his confirmation "a victory over a determined campaign of 
cynical character assassination . . . by right-wing ideologues in the 
Republican Party and in some elements of the business community." His opponents 
had labeled him anti-business and biased in favor of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong proponent of unions, Gould said in his latest book, "Agenda for 
Reform," that "unions are the most effective advocates of employee interests in 
the workplace."

TOP SCHOOLS LEVEL OFF UNDER NEW TESTS; EDUCATION: TYPICALLY HIGH-ACHIEVING 
VALLEY CAMPUSES FARE NEAR THE STATE AVERAGE BUT STILL OUTPACE LAUSD 
COUNTERPARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Fernando Valley schools that typically score high on standardized tests 
fared only about average on the new, highly touted California Learning 
Assessment System -- a series of tests designed to measure students' skills in 
reading, writing and math. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores, released today, show high-achieving Valley schools still outpacing 
many other campuses within the Los Angeles Unified School District. But the 
Valley schools did not make it to the top when measured against tough, new 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Given last spring to students in grades four, eight and 10, the tests are a 
new way to measure students' and schools' abilities in the three subject areas. 
The tests were developed -- and scored -- by teachers after 1991 legislation 
mandated a new assessment system. 
</P>
<P>
 But even schools that have implemented a more rigorous curriculum and whose 
teachers already have altered their instruction methods are not scoring at the 
top levels. The performance standards range, for example, from students showing 
little or no ability in math to an in-depth understanding of math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 At Carpenter Avenue Elementary in Studio City, which typically scores at the 
top of statewide tests, more than half of the fourth-graders scored in the 
lowest two levels in math. At Lawrence Middle School in Woodland Hills, more 
than half of the eighth-graders scored in the lowest three levels in reading, 
showing only general and superficial understanding of the texts. At El Camino 
Real High in Woodland Hills, almost one-third of the 10th-graders showed little 
or no understanding of math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 While many principals and teachers say they are not surprised by the results, 
they say students did not receive top marks for a variety of reasons. They say 
the test is much different than any other and that many teachers haven't 
adjusted their styles and methods for introducing new material. 
</P>
<P>
 As much a measure of students' knowledge, the tests also are a measure of how 
well the state-suggested curriculum is implemented in individual schools. 
Teachers are being encouraged to let students work cooperatively and to read 
literature rather than textbooks. Team-teaching is urged as well as giving 
students writing assignments in all subject areas -- not just in English 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I walk through classrooms, you don't need a test score to tell you that 
teaching hasn't changed that much," said Assistant Superintendent Sally 
Coughlin, who oversees the Valley elementary schools. "The process is going to 
take longer than I wish it would. We haven't provided the time for training. We 
haven't provided the money for training. It was a shock to many teachers to see 
that test last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The test in itself is a learning process. The students get credit as much for 
a right answer as for their work in figuring out the result. In the writing 
portion, students can discuss their ideas before writing essays, and in math, 
students can use calculators to compute answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Rosen-Kaplan, an English teacher at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, 
said she balked when she first saw the test. "I thought that these kids would 
never be able to do it -- that the whole thing was unrealistic," she said. "But 
it was a mind-boggling experience for me. I was just shocked at how well they 
went to work. You could have blown me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of the Birmingham 10th-graders scored in the top three levels of 
the writing test. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Rosen-Kaplan said she has changed the way she conducts her 
classes and that she believes her students will begin to score higher in the 
coming years. But large class sizes often inhibit teachers from presenting 
material differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 40 kids in ninth- and 10th-grade classes," she said. "They should be 
writing all the time, but there's not the individual attention. The optimum 
would be 20." 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacoima Elementary, where 61% of the students showed almost no 
understanding of math, Principal Larry Gonzales said the scores are "pitiful." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely and tremendously disgusted," Gonzales said. "I find it 
deplorable, and I'm not willing to sit back and look for excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said he wants all the teachers -- not just those who teach fourth 
grade -- to become more familiar with the test and the state curriculum 
guidelines. "It's time to put up or shut up," he said. "At this school, the 
task is enormous. I'm almost exhausted by the thought of all the work that 
needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Topanga Elementary Principal Steve Friedman said his campus 
already has changed its approach to learning. Teachers already are working 
together, math students already work with calculators and in groups and writing 
is stressed throughout the grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of teaching that lends itself to this kind of test," Friedman 
said, adding that the school gave the test to students two years ago as part of 
a pilot project. "It made the teachers realize that this is a whole different 
ballgame in terms of testing." 
</P>
<P>
 About half the Topanga fourth-graders showed thoughtful understanding of the 
reading material and coherent and organized writing skills. Even though the 
students did not score at the top of the statewide standards, they were among 
the top-scoring in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At Castlebay Lane Elementary in Northridge, Principal Natalie Messinger said 
high-achieving students did well but did not score at the top levels. While 
more than half of the fourth-graders displayed coherent, organized writing 
skills, more than half also showed limited math ability and only partial 
understanding of math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always surprises me that our kids don't do better, but then I look at the 
whole district and the other districts around the state," Messinger said. "When 
I compare us, I don't feel like we look bad at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Messinger said the school now is focusing on updating its 
teaching methods to adapt to the new tests. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sylmar Elementary, Principal Irene Smerigan said students need to be more 
confident about their skills and abilities to score better on the tests. More 
than half the students at the school -- 56% -- displayed little or no 
understanding of math. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids don't know how to think for themselves," Smerigan said. "We've been in 
this mode of right and wrong answers . . . instead of having them logically 
think through problems and solve them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking students what they think, and they are looking at you like, 
'What is the right answer?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein said the tests are a 
more authentic way of evaluating students and that she believes it will be a 
good measure of schools. But she said the state and the school district need to 
adequately train teachers before scores improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hold people accountable . . . if in fact they didn't know they were 
supposed to do things differently," Bernstein said. "I just don't know if 
teachers were adequately trained." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, school principals and teachers say parents also will have 
to change their thinking about standardized tests. These assessments can show 
parents how well -- or poorly -- their children and their schools are doing. 
Schools next year will receive individual student scores, which will be shared 
with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are used to having one score to hold on to," said Linda Lownes, the 
Los Angeles school district's testing specialist. "It's like having a safety 
blanket pulled away." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to help parents understand the new tests, the 31st District 
Parent Teacher Student Assn. has videos and manuals available for schools to 
hold parent meetings. "I think this particular test -- since it's 
performance-based -- gives parents a good idea and a more realistic idea of how 
well their children are doing," said Harriet Sculley, the president of the 
Valley PTA. "It's going to require parents to stretch a little bit. Change 
usually unnerves everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Rader, whose son attends Porter Middle School in Granada Hills, said 
she believes the tests are a worthwhile tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a general idea that your child's in a good school," she said. 
"Any little feedback I can get from a test or a teacher, I can use to help 
guide my child." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials, who oversee the development and administration of 
the tests, say they did not expect schools to score at the top this year but 
that the results did show very low scores throughout California. The Los 
Angeles school district scored near the bottom of the districts across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have chosen to set a very high standard for ourselves, and now we have to 
have the courage and strength and rise to meet that challenge," said William D. 
Dawson, the acting state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is if we have the will to follow through with it." Valley 
Test Scores 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System is a state-mandated series of tests 
given last last spring to students in grade 4,8 and 10. Students' reading, 
writing and math skills were measured against statewide performance standards. 
The standards, which are numerical from 1 to 6, range from little or no ability 
(1) in the subject area to skillful and creative (6). 
</P>
<P>
 The following are L.A. Unified School District schools that scored among the

SCHOOLS ON THE BOTTOM SAY NEW SCORES REVEAL LITTLE; ASSESSMENT: TEACHERS LAMENT 
THAT TRANSIENCY, INADEQUATE MATERIALS AND WEAK ENGLISH SKILLS PUT THEIR 
CHILDREN AT A DISADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty-nine percent of the fourth-grade students at Van Nuys Elementary School 
demonstrated little or no mathematical thinking. Forty-five percent of the 
eighth-graders at San Fernando Middle School wrote answers to questions in a 
disorganized, undeveloped and vague manner. Fifty percent of the 10th-graders 
at Canoga Park High School read with only superficial connection between 
different parts of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 But do these numbers really tell the story? According to teachers and 
principals at some of the San Fernando Valley schools that fared near the 
bottom in the California Learning Assessment System, they reveal very little. 
</P>
<P>
 A test that required a slow progression toward a new way of teaching, many 
say, was instead introduced hastily without acknowledgment of the realities of 
their schools -- the majority of them located in the northeast Valley, where 
English is a second language for many students and transiency rates sometimes 
reach 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very demeaning for the children and the teachers," said Irene 
Smerigan, principal of Sylmar Elementary School, which ranked near the bottom 
of the Valley's 131 elementary schools, according to a list compiled by The 
Times from combined scores in the three subjects tested. "If there was a way to 
take into consideration the amount of English instruction a student has had . . 
. but it just bulks them all together." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the test marked a dramatic departure from previous 
statewide assessment tests, which focused on multiple-choice and true-or-false 
questions. The new test requires students to think critically, both alone and 
cooperatively, in reading, writing and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers and principals at the lowest-ranking schools say they support 
the philosophy behind the new test. But they warn that at their schools it will 
take years to retrain teachers and restructure classes before the scores 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cite language barriers, a lack of adequate educational materials and the 
inability to offer consistent teaching to transient students as obstacles to be 
overcome before their students fare better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The testing was a very stressful situation for me," said Sarah Komen, a 
fourth- and fifth-grade math teacher at Langdon Avenue Elementary School in 
North Hills, which ranked near the bottom. "Kids are not used to doing things 
this way."  
</P>
<P>
 Komen said that implementing the new curriculum necessary to prepare for the 
test in her classroom -- where textbooks date back to the 1970s and only about 
five children are fully proficient in English -- will be a tremendous 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with some kids whose ability is very, very low. A number of 
kids don't even have subtraction down, let alone multiplication tables," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All regular students who have been in the country at least 30 months, except 
those who take their core courses in a language other than English, are 
required to take the test. But for students who made the transition into 
English classes just before the test -- as many do in the third and fourth 
grades -- teachers say the level of comprehension expected is unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my school, 98% of the students are being tested in their second language," 
said Diane Pritchard, principal of Montague Street Elementary School in 
Pacoima. "This is a very sophisticated test. If we could give it at the 
sixth-grade level, when they leave, the scores would be different." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is developing a Spanish version of the CLAS that it will field-test 
before implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 While admitting disappointment in their children's scores, many principals 
approached the results with reserved optimism, vowing to emphasize teacher 
training and class restructuring in order to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the very first year of a very different test," said Linda Ambro, 
principal of Sylmar High School. "It tells me that everyone needs to get on the 
ball."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big challenge," said Langdon Principal Dan Balderrama. "But we're 
taking baby steps. That's the best we can do at this point. If I can get half a 
percent improvement per year over five years, that's something." 
</P>
<P>
 But many teachers believe the test came too soon, before they had a chance to 
change their curriculum to better prepare students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think making such a dramatic change should even be evaluated 
for the first three years," said Renee Wells, who teaches fourth grade at 
Sylmar Elementary. "It's like giving a test to someone in advanced applied 
physics who doesn't know any advanced applied physics. It's demoralizing for 
the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, who administered the test to her students last year, said she had three 
children in her class who did not read at all. "They were expected to read and 
write logically, and their scores were lumped in. It's disheartening that 
politicians and the public take these scores as the measure of a school. 
They're not an accurate measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Bernstein, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said teachers have 
reason to be frustrated. "It's a good test and a good curriculum," Bernstein 
said. "Somebody just forgot to match the two."

FEMA INSPECTOR MISSING A WEEK IS SUBJECT OF SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What has become of FEMA Inspector Robert Francis Fisher? 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old construction worker and building inspector left his Oakland 
home for Los Angeles several weeks ago to help inspect houses damaged in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. He even "met a girl" on one inspection tour, whom he later 
took out to dinner, and bought a fishing pole at a neighborhood yard sale, his 
brother said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Fisher has gone, disappeared without a trace, and his brother and the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons Unit are looking for him. 
Fisher was last seen by colleagues on Tuesday evening of last week when he was 
heading for his room at the Comfort Inn at 8647 Sepulveda Blvd. in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As the days turned into a week Tuesday, his brother and police said they were 
beginning to fear the worst. Fisher's rental car is gone too, and so is his 
cellular phone and government-issued portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or four days ago, I was hoping he was having fun. But that would come 
to an end," said Fisher's brother, Rodney, 31, who also left Oakland on Feb. 12 
to make some money as a contract inspector for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. "It's been seven days. I just don't know. I'm worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher had just joined a company known as Suncoast Associates Inc. of Edmonds, 
Wash., when he was sent to Los Angeles on Feb. 5 for quake duty. His brother 
was sent to Los Angeles a week later, and said the two kept in touch every day. 
When Rodney Fisher returned to Los Angeles on Wednesday after several days back 
home in Oakland, he said no one had seen his brother for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more troubling, he said, was that the daily calls and messages had 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he would have called me," Rodney Fisher said. "He left all his 
clothes. I don't think he has anything except the clothes on his back." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his brother's disappearance, Rodney Fisher has spent hours working the 
phones and knocking on doors in search of him. Over the weekend, he and his two 
brothers-in-law, both of whom were sharing Fisher's motel room and working for 
FEMA too, scoured the areas where Fisher had last inspected houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all remember him," Rodney Fisher said of the people he visited, "but 
they haven't heard from him since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the neighborhoods were in South-Central Los Angeles, areas where 
Rodney Fisher said danger appeared to lurk on every street corner. He described 
his brother as somewhat naive, a loquacious and friendly man who wouldn't 
hesitate to talk to anybody he met during his work or travels, no matter the 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area he's (working) in, he didn't have a problem with the violence there. 
It was nothing to him. He'd just go over there and do his job and come back," 
Rodney Fisher said. "I went there over the weekend and some guys looked at me 
like they wanted to take my head off. I wouldn't work there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fisher fears someone may have taken advantage of his brother's 
friendliness, and that perhaps foul play was involved. He said his brother did 
not drink, do drugs or have a gambling problem. Even if Robert Fisher were the 
type to buy drugs, his brother said, he would never put himself in jeopardy by 
buying them from strangers in a dangerous neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher had already cashed his paycheck when he was last seen at 9 p.m. March 
1. He was staying in his brother's motel room for a few days while Rodney was 
up north, because there were three other people in his own room. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the last time anyone talked to him," Rodney Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Raynette Sincosky of the LAPD's Missing Persons Unit said nothing in 
Fisher's past gives authorities any reason to think he's the type to disappear 
on his own accord. But she said police also have checked the morgue, as many of 
the 250 or so local hospitals that they could, and even that vast repository of 
the wounded and the dead -- County-USC Medical Center -- to see if Fisher has 
shown up as an unidentified John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 They found nothing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to indicate any foul play; no shootings in the area, no John 
Does that have been identified (as him), nothing that leads us to believe he 
was a victim of crime," Sincosky said. "And he has no criminal record. He's 
just a normal person, who's disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hall, the Fisher brothers' Suncoast supervisor in Los Angeles, said 
Robert Fisher was working neighborhoods in Fillmore, South-Central Los Angeles, 
Century City and Pacoima. He said he too grows more worried by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea what happened," Hall said. "We're real concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said other Suncoast employees who travel to every federally declared 
disaster area have been held up at gunpoint and robbed since they've been in 
Los Angeles. "We've had a lot of problems; more than anywhere else in the rest 
of the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fisher had to return to work Tuesday to pay the hotel and rental car 
bills, but said he can think of nothing else but his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of got burned out, going place to place, running out of leads," 
Fisher said. "I don't know where to look. I'm not used to this area. I wouldn't 
even know where to start."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 1 KILLED, 2 WOUNDED IN FAMILY DISPUTE 
</P>

<P>
 A man embroiled in a dispute over his pending divorce allegedly shot and 
killed his estranged wife's uncle and wounded her father and a family friend, 
police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachatur Tonoyan, 23, of Reseda is being sought after the deadly 
confrontation Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Tonoyan and his father agreed to meet Telman Babayan, 
48, Tonoyan's father-in-law, to discuss the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Babayan, who was accompanied by a relative and two friends, told police that 
he asked the younger Tonoyan to stop harassing his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion escalated into an argument, then pushing and shoving, mainly 
involving Tonoyan and Babayan, said Los Angeles Police Detective Duane Burris. 
</P>
<P>
 During the scuffle, Tonoyan allegedly shot and killed Khatchatour Abouchian, 
47, of Los Angeles. Wounded were Akop Topachikyan, 50, of Los Angeles, who was 
shot in the chest. He remains in critical but stable condition. Babayan, of 
Northridge, was shot in the right hand and was treated and released. All the 
men were taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonoyan and his father fled after the 10 p.m. shooting in the parking lot at 
20141 Sherman Way in Canoga Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second incident in Encino, police said an Encino man was in critical 
condition Tuesday after he was shot several times in his home by a longtime 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Robert Chabala allegedly shot his friend, Charles Vidaurrazaga, 30, in 
a crime with no clear motive, police said. Chabala, who is at large, lived in a 
car after the Northridge earthquake, and Vidaurrazaga allowed him to use his 
apartment to wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidaurrazaga told police that he let Chabala into his studio apartment on the 
17200 block of Burbank Boulevard about 4 a.m. Tuesday. Vidaurrazaga went back 
to sleep while Chabala watched television for the next 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of remember waking up and turning off the TV," Vidaurrazaga told 
police from his hospital bed at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. "The next 
thing I remember was waking up when I was shot in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief struggle, Chabala escaped through the sliding glass door. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Chabala) never said a word when he shot him or during the brief 
struggle," said Los Angeles Police Detective Dave Steinbacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not have a motive in either shooting. CHAU LAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER SPEAKS AT UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Civil rights leader Andrew Young urged Cal State Northridge students to see 
the earthquake "not as something to be spurned, but as an opportunity," in a 
speech he gave on campus Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake damaged dozens of campus buildings. Young, former mayor 
of Atlanta and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, compared the 
problems it has caused to the kind of crises he dealt with as mayor of Atlanta, 
and to those he helped create in the fight for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crisis is really that which produces change and progress," Young said. "It 
brings out the best in people and produces real leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was not the reason for Young's visit. He came to survey the work 
being done by Law Companies Group, an engineering and environmental services 
firm in which he is vice president. Law Companies has been doing much of the 
cleanup work and damage surveys on campus since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders blamed the short notice, conflicting class schedules and lack 
of publicity for the low turnout at Young's speech.  
</P>
<P>
 Although about 30 students from a Pan-African studies class appeared toward 
the end of his talk, for the most part it was a few dozen campus officials, Law 
Companies officials and media that filled the seats in the roomy auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of students said they came out of admiration for Young, who also 
served three terms in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Student Union President Leslie Small said: "The man is an icon with 
respect to one, civil rights, and two, coming into the political mainstream. 
What better can you ask for as a student?" 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who served as a top aide to Martin Luther King Jr., told students that 
because of the earthquake they are getting more than most college students get 
from their education. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake "will prepare you in a way that just going to the library and 
doing the fun things about college life won't," he said. "Most people complete 
their studies and then go on and get their education somewhere else. You are 
getting yours now." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question by CSUN Student Body President Steven Parker, who 
asked about the role of anger in current civil rights debate, Young expanded on 
the theme of nonviolence, sounding for a moment less like a politician and more 
like the clergyman he once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens in violence is that blood runs from your head to your hands and 
arms and you prepare for fight or flight," Young said. "Both ways, you lose. . 
. . Anger is counterproductive." JILL LEOVY

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; DARE TO TAKE DARE

 Mark Pontin's nightmare is to wake up one day to find that the youngsters in 
his hometown have adopted aspects of Los Angeles youth culture -- not the 
kitschy lifestyle of Frankie and Annette on the beach and little deuce coupes, 
but the guns, gangs and early graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontin, you see, is a police investigator from Wales, a land of coal mines and 
rolling green hills, where even the most ill-behaved children do not come to 
school packing. And this mild-mannered man -- whose job allows him to spend a 
great deal of time working with children -- wants to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got problems like you have, but they are developing," Pontin said 
of the Hampshire Constabulary, where he has been a cop for 21 of his 39 years. 
"We have the chance to close the stable door before the horse has bolted." 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that, Pontin came to Los Angeles recently to enroll in the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, better 
known as DARE. His goal is to learn as much as possible from the two-week 
course and pass it on to law enforcement and educational officials in Wales 
upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontin is hopeful that DARE will help make up for what he calls "the lack of a 
coherent drug education policy in Great Britain." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a similar scheme, a diversion that will get (young people) 
involved in something other than drugs and gangs and whatnot," he said. "We 
want to do it when they're still young, instead of waiting until they're older, 
when if they're going to do it, they've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pontin's participation is part of DARE's attempts to expand its geographic 
scope. Various elements of the 10-year-old program are now taught in each of 
the 50 states as well as six foreign countries.  
</P>
<P>
 Pontin's training consisted of learning 17 45-minute lesson plans designed to 
be taught to fourth- and fifth-graders. They emphasize boosting children's 
self-esteem, which DARE supporters say enables young people to resist the 
temptation of drugs, alcohol and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 And though it is controversial -- in part because it relies heavily on 
psychological teaching methods and because uniformed officers do the teaching 
-- the program has won converts, including Pontin, because it focuses on 
education rather than enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's given us a lot of food for thought," Pontin said of himself and the 25 
other officers who graduated from the course recently. "As far as enforcement 
is considered, crime goes on anyway. What you need is education, and from what 
I've seen, this is a very good program." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that DARE'S lesson plans could be, well, condensed without 
losing a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some information in it, but it is mainly about developing personal 
skills," Pontin said tactfully. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first visit with American youngsters, at Langdon Elementary School 
in North Hills, Pontin came away surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very apprehensive about meeting them," he admitted. "What struck me was 
that they were just like English kids . . . innocent, keen to learn. It was 
wonderful."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to talking about his native land, Pontin gave the students at 
Langdon and at other local schools a DARE primer. "We tell them about the 
consequences (of using drugs and alcohol), ways to resist, how to build 
self-esteem . . . pretty much the whole thing . . . which was probably too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 The final element of Pontin's DARE training was to prepare his own lesson plan 
for the program's other officers, which can be a daunting prospect when cops 
behave like antsy 10-year-olds to test each other's mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really test your classroom-management skills," Pontin said of the 
wiseacres, some of whom sailed paper airplanes at him as he tried to lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did he think of his first visit to Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 "With the aftershocks, the whole thing was mind-boggling," he said. "The 
freeways, the earthquake, drugs . . . it took a weekend just to get my head 
around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, Pontin meant the drugs other people were using.

<P>
 An Earthquake Service Center is scheduled to open today in Van Nuys to replace 
Disaster Assistance Centers in Sun Valley and Van Nuys that were closed Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 A small service center is also opening today at Cal State Northridge for those 
who work or study on the campus.Service centers will eventually replace 
assistance centers, which were set up in the immediate aftermath of the quake 
to accept applications for aid and now number only three citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The service centers, operated jointly by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, will concentrate on 
follow-up services and long-term assistance. They will also accept applications 
for disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for filing applications is March 18, but assistance from federal, 
state and local agencies will continue as long as it is needed, the state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earthquake Service Center will open at 1 p.m. at 6939 Van Nuys Boulevard. 
Thereafter, it will be open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. The 
center at CSUN will be located on the northern end of the campus near 
Devonshire Street and Zelzah Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The two assistance centers in the San Fernando Valley that closed Tuesday were 
at Stonehurst Recreation Center, 9901 Dronfield Ave., Sun Valley, and at 14301 
Vanowen Ave. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 A third service center will open today at 3420 W. Jefferson Blvd. in Los 
Angeles to replace centers in Los Angeles and the Pico Union area. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service centers bring the total to nine of an eventual 11. JULIO MORAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY WEIGHS NAME FOR PROPOSED PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The names of a Spanish explorer, a Calabasas ranch family and the community of 
Lost Hills are the leading contenders for the moniker of a new park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council is scheduled to consider a name for the park -- to 
be located at Calabasas Hills and Lost Hills roads, at a special meeting 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned eight-acre park is expected to open as early as 1995 in the 
neighborhood, with a 2,400-square-foot recreation and nature center and trails 
leading into the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dennis Washburn said there is a significant movement in favor of 
naming the park after Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza, who led 240 
settlers through the area in 1776 to establish what later became the city of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very likely that De Anza and his party encamped right in that area," 
Washburn said. "I think we could build some lore over having had this historic 
event occur in our community. We're already trying to build the park around the 
potential of exploring the nature of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn said he is opposed to naming it Lost Hills Park for environmental 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to do that," he said. "We've already lost enough of the hills due to 
development. We don't need to be reminded of that." 
</P>
<P>
 A last-minute proposal was made to name it Sampo Ranch Park, for the Sampo 
family, which once owned the land where the park will be. Sam G. Currey of the 
Currey Riach Co., which developed land in the area, said the name would be 
appropriate because the family "grew and sold a very large variety of the best 
vegetables that one could find anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "The longtime residents in the area will remember it fondly very well," Currey 
wrote in a letter to City Manager Charles Cate. "How many thousands of the 
local residents and travelers stopped there over the years to buy the Sampos' 
produce is undeterminable." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the public are welcome to offer their opinions at the 7:30 p.m. 
meeting at City Hall. The council may choose a name tonight or postpone the 
decision. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; DECISION DELAYED ON NICKNAME CHANGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Associated Student Senate at Cal State Northridge has temporarily tabled a 
proposed resolution to let students vote on whether to change the school's 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Lazar, student body vice president and sponsor of the resolution, wants 
the college to change its nickname from the Matadors to the Quakes in 
recognition of Northridge's new notoriety as an earthquake epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The senate Tuesday considered whether to include the proposal on student 
election ballots next month to gauge whether students would support the change. 
But instead, the senate voted 11 to 6 to postpone a decision until its next 
meeting next Tuesday, Lazar said. The move to delay a vote came after some 
senators said they needed more comments from students. JILL LEOVY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PLANNERS APPROVE CANYON SUBDIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After two denials by the City Council and a pending court case, planning 
commissioners have approved in principle a plan for a controversial hillside 
subdivision in Sleepy Hollow Canyon. The proposal, submitted by the Doty 
Development Co. of Glendale, would include building 18 homes on a 30-acre site 
on the hillside inside the canyon, which is located northeast of downtown 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission put off a final decision on the project in order to work out an 
agreement on a long list of conditions that the city has suggested be imposed 
before development is allowed. Among the conditions to be considered is whether 
to build a secondary access road into the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also asked that the developer build sidewalks and street lights 
and plant seven trees on each lot. Doty has opposed both the road and the 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 residents attended the hearing, many of whom said they realize they 
must work with the developer to see their ideas included in the plan, even 
though they would prefer that the canyon remain undeveloped.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners have adamantly opposed the development in the past, saying it would 
permanently scar environmentally sensitive hillsides and ruin their canyon 
views, said Dave Weaver, president of the Glenwood Canyon Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The current proposal is different from the first two development plans because 
it shaves down a ridge above Sleepy Hollow Place rather than "cutting the top 
of it off," senior planner Wolfgang Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan sets homes in the canyon, rather than placing them along the 
ridgeline as originally proposed, concentrates development in a smaller area 
and allows for less grading on the site, Krause said.  
</P>
<P>
 The third proposal asks for 18 homes, where the first and second plans called 
for 25 and 22 homes, respectively. Citing permanent damage to the canyon's 
ridgeline, destruction of a wooded habitat and loss of open space, the council 
denied the first proposal in December, 1990, and the second plan in February, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer filed suit against the city in early 1993, alleging that the 
council's original decision to deny the hillside development did not allow Doty 
"economically viable use of the property," City Atty. Scott Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit's resolution is related to the council's decision on the third 
proposal, Howard said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DISTRICT SCORES HIGH IN READING, WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting county and statewide results, Burbank students scored higher in 
reading and writing than in mathematical skills, according to California 
Learning Assessment System test scores released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Unified School District Supt. Arthur Pierce would not comment on the 
scores, but said that in the past the district's scores had been slightly above 
the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests, administered for the first time this year, were given last 
spring in grades 4, 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high school level, students at Burbank and John Burroughs scored higher 
in reading and writing when compared with state and county averages, but lower 
in math. 
</P>
<P>
 MaryLe Emmett, assistant principal at John Burroughs High, said students there 
scored lower because the new test is based on an analytical approach to the 
subject to which the school has not yet converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmett said she agreed with the new testing philosophy, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're having the student do what is typical of what they would be doing 
after they graduate," Emmett said. "It's obviously harder and it means 
restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs has started putting together a math committee that will review how 
math is taught at the school, she said. Any curriculum changes would not go 
into effect until September, 1995, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In reading and writing, 11% of Burbank High students scored at the two highest 
levels in reading. Sixteen percent reached the highest levels in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 At John Burroughs, 8% of students taking the test scored at the highest levels 
in reading, with 16% reaching those levels in writing -- slightly better than 
state and county averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmett said that students at Burroughs were better prepared for the reading 
and writing tests because the school had in recent years been giving students 
an annual three-day test that focused on essay questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing testing like this, so they are used to it," Emmett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In math, test scores of Burbank eighth-graders were close to the county 
average and slightly worse than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 In reading and writing, the district's schools, with the exception of David 
Starr Jordan Middle School, scored lower than both the county and state 
averages. Jordan's average scores were better in those subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the reading and writing scores," said Jordan Principal Mary 
Margaret Kljunak. "I see some room for improvement in math, but that's true 
statewide." 
</P>
<P>
 At the fourth-grade level, the district fared slightly worse in all subjects 
than state averages. But their scores were slightly higher than county 
averages. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CRIME FIGHTER UNDAUNTED BY TROUBLED TIMES

 Philip (Flip) Smith says he has no regrets.  
</P>
<P>
 He sees his two grown children at least once a week, regularly attends a step 
aerobics class and has a penchant for Hawaiian shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 His business is not flashy -- he owns a tire shop on Sepulveda Boulevard -- 
but Smith considers himself a success. A founder of the Sepulveda Boulevard 
Business Watch, he has held on in a troubled neighborhood through years of 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 And police say that among business leaders in the San Fernando Valley, Smith 
and his organization have done more than most to fight crime and urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday afternoon, looking relaxed in a pink, navy blue and beige 
Hawaiian shirt, beige linen-look pants and sensible brown shoes, Smith, who has 
been married for 27 years, talked about the business and community leadership 
roles he has held since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I see a problem, I think about the solution," said Smith, who has 
lived in Van Nuys for 43 of his 47 years. "A lot of people try to point fingers 
or they blame someone else for not doing anything, but you can just roll up 
your sleeves and take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Business Watch was established in October, 1992, it has tackled 
crime, prostitution and panhandling in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has persuaded businesses to improve lighting and security and has been 
responsible for a move to reprogram pay telephones on the street so that they 
cannot take incoming calls. The group has also distributed cards with 
information about homeless services for passers-by to give to panhandlers in 
lieu of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past dozen years, Smith has served as president of the Greater Van 
Nuys Area Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club of Van Nuys and the 
Mid-Valley YMCA, he is current president of the Mid-Valley Police Council, and 
is a member of the state Small Business Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely supports the needs of the community and tries to get those 
needs across to business owners so they have a better understanding of 
communities and can better service the community's needs," said Romana Catton, 
who with Smith co-chairs a new organization -- the Unified Community Watch 
Group -- formed to fight prostitution and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he works with businesses on Sepulveda Boulevard because he sees 
that as the best way for him to get involved in the community and help people. 
He helped establish the Business Watch after the Van Nuys Chamber of Commerce 
invited him to work on a revitalization plan for Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, it is time for businesses and residents to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chamber of Commerce has always meant businesses helping businesses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to say it's also about businesses helping homeowners. They need to 
work together." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MOST TESTED LOWER IN MATH THAN READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of Glendale schools scored low in math proficiency, but relatively 
better in reading and writing skills, according to California Learning 
Assessment System results to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Unified School District officials said that while they are pleased 
with the overall test scores, standards used to judge math results are too 
rigorous and seem "unreasonably difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wiggle room in the scoring; it's almost impossible for a 
student to achieve a (level) 5 or a 6 in the math portion of the exam," said 
Bruce Dumbacher, the district's supervising psychologist and an expert in test 
school analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the CLAS test, administered for the first time this year, a 6 is the 
highest score given. The tests, given last spring in grades 4, 8 and 10, were 
developed by a task force that included educators, school board members, 
business leaders, parents and testing experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumbacher, who works in the district's testing center, said it's unusual for 
Glendale's culturally diverse student population -- many of whom are classified 
as having limited proficiency in English -- to perform better in writing than 
in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems paradoxical for kids here to do better in writing, especially when 
writing involves a good command of English," Dumbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale students, however, historically have done better on the written 
portions of standardized tests such as the California Assessment Program (CAP) 
exam, which was used to assess student achievement in the past, said Vic 
Pallos, district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 While students had the advantage of advance preparation for the written 
portion of the exam, they were unable to do the same for the math section 
because of its changing nature, Dumbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 While CLAS appears to be more reflective of the district's current overall 
curriculum when compared with outdated CAP exams, its math section is oriented 
more toward analytical word problems, rather than operations skills such as 
adding, multiplying and subtracting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will do a follow-up on math results to determine if they are true 
indicators of students' math proficiency, Pallos said. Officials will then 
attempt to develop a curriculum that allows teachers to teach the more 
analytical testing method used in the CLAS math section, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's 19 elementary schools scored higher than the county and on a par 
with the state in mathematics, district officials said. Local schools scored 
higher than the county and state in both reading and writing sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale district's five middle schools scored higher than the county and 
on a par with the state in math, lower than both the county and the state in 
reading skills, and higher than both in writing performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's four high schools ranked higher than the county and the state in 
math, reading and writing scores. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; OWNER ASKS ABOUT ABANDONING PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Four Corners Pipeline Co., which owns an oil pipeline that burst and 
caught fire during the Northridge earthquake, has asked the city of San 
Fernando about its policies on pipeline abandonment, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Public Works Director Mike Drake said the company inquired this 
week about abandoning the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a company spokesman said there are currently no plans to abandon the 
line, the request for a copy of the city policy is the first indication that 
the company would consider shutting down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians in Los Angeles and San Fernando have urged closing the pipeline, 
which burst in eight places during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire that followed the rupture burned just outside O'Melveny Elementary 
School in San Fernando, injuring a man and charring 17 cars on Wolfskill 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We routinely examine all options, but abandoning (this) line . . . is not a 
real option at this time," said Scott Loll, a spokesman for Arco, Four Corners' 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we'll see what happens down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline, which runs for 130 miles from Kern County oil fields through San 
Fernando to South Bay refineries, traverses just a mile of the city, but the 
line has become one of the hottest issues in the San Fernando City Council 
campaign. The election is April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that they are seriously considering abandoning the line," said 
Councilman Jose Hernandez at the council's regular meeting on Monday. "That 
would solve the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the groups opposed to the line are not satisfied with abandonment as a 
solution, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you abandon the line, it should be removed, because you have problems with 
old lines even when they are capped," said Michelle Grumet of Citizens Against 
the Pipeline and Pollution, a Los Angeles-based group. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Monday, the council approved a letter of recommendation to the 
state fire marshal suggesting additional safety tests for pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire marshal has jurisdiction over oil and chemical pipeline safety, 
according to San Fernando city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations suggested by the council include replacing pipelines over 50 years 
old and requiring yearly tests on those lines, instead of every two years. In 
addition, the council asked that Four Corners Pipeline Co. replace the ruptured 
pipeline with new pipe and that the line be buried at least 5 feet below the 
surface. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

RESULTS SHOW DRAMATIC HIGHS AND LOWS OF ACHIEVEMENTS; STATISTICS: OVERALL, L.A. 
COUNTY RANKS WELL BELOW STATE'S STUDENTS AS A WHOLE IN READING, WRITING AND 
MATH.

<P>
 The new generation of California test scores released today throws into high 
relief the dramatic contrast in student work in Los Angeles County's 81 school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tidy, well-appointed San Marino schools to the awesome diversity of 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, the county's 1.4 million public school 
students scored at the highest and lowest levels of achievement, with even 
students from the best districts showing many weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's toniest communities still compare well under the new scores, but 
the test results contain plenty of image-busting numbers that show highly 
regarded districts can fall short when measured against rigorous standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Beverly Hills fourth-graders, for example, were found to have limited 
or little or no math skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County results also display another point consistently 
repeated by educators: Students who live in poor communities, those who speak 
little English and whose parents have limited educations commonly score in the 
bottom rungs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who your mother and father is still dictates how well you do on any kind of 
assessment," said Los Angeles County Supt. of Schools Stuart E. Gothold. "The 
poorer communities tend to have high transiency and students are not in a 
stable school situation. When they speak a language other than English, they 
are starting with a great disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Not one fourth-grader in the Lennox School district -- where 82% of the 
students speak little or no English -- scored in the top levels of math 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Los Angeles County scored well below the state's students as a whole 
in reading, writing and math. When compared against new statewide math 
standards, more than two-thirds of Los Angeles County fourth-graders scored at 
the lowest levels. Math scores improved only slightly among eighth- and 
10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone is too surprised," Gothold said of the results, the 
first under the new California Learning Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in some of the most affluent areas -- including Beverly 
Hills, San Marino, Palos Verdes Peninsula, South Pasadena, La Canada -- 
consistently rank among the highest achievers in all three academic areas, far 
outpacing the statewide scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In reading and writing, the vast majority of students from these communities 
tested at the highest levels. Only a fraction, about 10%, scored in the lowest 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In both math and writing, the tiny Hermosa Beach City School District topped 
the list of high achievers with 34% of its fourth-grade class reaching the top 
standards in math and 83% scoring in the top levels in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Gwen Gross credited the high math scores to the intense teacher 
preparation for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators in even these elite districts, long accustomed to being on the 
top of the achievement scale, have been hit with some sobering statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Assistant Supt. Bert Pearlman said he is uncomfortable with the 
state standards that describe 50% of his fourth-graders as "limited 
mathematical" thinkers or students with "little or no" mathematical 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brand new test that is looking for expression of math competency 
that is new to us and our teachers," he said. "I think the goal is admirable, 
but the students have not had sufficient opportunity to prepare for being 
tested in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, Assistant Supt. Jack Rose, whose eighth- and 10th-graders 
topped the county list in math, was also rankled by low fourth-grade scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those fourth-grade questions were tough, very conceptual. It's expecting an 
awful lot out of them," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the ranking lists, the test results show that a number 
of school districts -- all home to many poor students who are still learning 
English -- repeatedly received the lowest achievement scores. In the 
27,500-student Compton Unified School District, which was taken over by the 
state last year after becoming insolvent, scores were at or near the county 
bottom at every grade level and in every category. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's new state-appointed administrator offered no excuses. "If the 
students are on the bottom, it means many of our teaching procedures are on the 
bottom," said J. Jerome Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lennox School District is only one notch above last-place Compton in 
fourth-grade writing and is last in that grade level in math. An overwhelming 
majority of their youngsters are not fluent in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of the stuff that is here on this new test is language based," said 
Assistant Supt. Dan Jurenka. "Even (for) the mathematical stuff you had to read 
first then respond with a drawing of 'x' number of coins -- it's all verbal . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pomona Unified School District, where 96% of fourth-graders scored low 
in math, as did 98% of 10th-graders, one official maintained that "the news is 
not all bad," citing that the district holds its own when compared against 
other low-income districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 645-campus Los Angeles Unified School District, scores fell below the 
statewide percentage in nearly every grade and subject level tested. The giant 
district hovered in the bottom third when ranked with county school districts 
in all subjects and grade levels, except 10th-grade math. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable snapshots of student scores in L. A. Unified show: 
</P>
<P>
 * In math, the vast majority of students scored in the bottom two levels on 
the six-point scale used by the state. Results showed that 83% of 
fourth-graders, 86% of eighth-graders, and 82% of 10th-graders show limited or 
little or no mathematical thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-thirds of fourth-graders placed in the bottom levels in reading, as did 
74% of eighth-graders, and 82% of 10th-grade students. A majority of students 
scored in the bottom levels in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 41% of all students taking the test were not fluent in English, more 
than double the statewide percentage. District officials say the lack of 
English skills hurts the scores and is not unexpected.

NEIGHBORHOOD FOCUS OF ZONING DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small Studio City neighborhood is in the middle of a land use dispute 
involving City Councilman John Ferraro -- who wants to impose new limits on 
development -- and the mayor and planning commissioners, who oppose the limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute, which has been brewing for several years, is expected to come to 
a head today when Ferraro asks his Los Angeles City Council colleagues to 
change the zoning on three blocks of Tujunga Avenue near Valley Spring Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would reduce by half the size of homes permitted and drop the 
height limit from 45 feet to 28 feet -- a reduction that landowners on the 
street say will slash their property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's going to take away our property rights," said John Corwin, 
who owns a 50-year-old triplex on Tujunga Avenue, which he was planning to 
develop into a condominium project. He said the change would kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has twice considered Ferraro's zone change request and 
twice rejected it because commissioners feared that it would hamper the city's 
ability to provide low-income housing, which is usually in high-density zones. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Planner Charlie Rausch, Mayor Richard Riordan has also 
opposed the zone change because it would leave the area inconsistent with the 
city's General Plan, the blueprint for long-term development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ferraro's planning deputy, Renee Weitzer, defended the councilman's 
position, saying the change would make the Tujunga Avenue neighborhood fit in 
with adjacent blocks that have single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Ferraro has promised residents in those single-family homes that he 
would try to adopt building limits to ensure that huge residential projects do 
not sprout up in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as John Ferraro goes, he has promised this to many people and he keeps 
his promises," Weitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute dates back nearly seven years, when the city Planning Department 
decided to reduce the density on the entire stretch of Tujunga between Moorpark 
Street and Ventura Boulevard. But, because of an error, three blocks near 
Valley Spring Lane were not included in the zone change. Weitzer said Ferraro 
simply wants to correct that error. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., has sided with 
Ferraro, saying the change is needed to reduce density and keep the 
neighborhood consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are behind it," he said. "Basically, it comes down to whether one block 
should be allowed to have high density."

PAROLEE'S LAWYER ARGUES A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY IN SLAYING OF GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguing mistaken identity, the lawyer for a prison parolee accused of 
murdering an armored-car guard asked a jury to reject the testimony of an 
eyewitness and acquit his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hill, who is defending Sean Darnell Slade, compared his case to that of 
a sensational 1989 slaying in which an innocent man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, accused in the 1992 slaying of a security guard in a robbery of a Home 
Depot store in San Fernando, was "fingered" by the mother of a man who Slade 
killed in 1987, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of manslaughter in the killing of Howard Baker, Slade, now 27, was 
paroled from prison only 25 days before guard Edwin Maldonado was killed. He 
faces the death penalty if convicted in the guard's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade was arrested after investigators developed a composite drawing, and 
Elizabeth Floyd, Baker's mother, called police to report that Slade was the man 
wanted in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill used the slaying of an affluent Boston attorney and her unborn baby as an 
example of the injustice he says his client suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Stuart initially told police that a black male had shot his wife, 
Carol, an attorney, in the head and him in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bennett was arrested after a massive manhunt. Bennett had a criminal 
record, but he maintained that he was framed. Bennett was never formally 
charged in the killing and was vindicated when Stuart's brother gave 
information to police indicating Stuart was the killer. Stuart apparently 
committed suicide by jumping from a bridge 10 weeks after his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade and Bennett both have criminal records, each generally fit the 
description given by witnesses, and in each case, police were under intense 
pressure from a "public clamoring for justice," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in our mind there is reasonable doubt," Hill said. "There 
is no doubt in our mind that Willie Bennett would not have to wait for a 
husband to confess in order to be acquitted by a jury of his peers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill emphasized Slade's claim that he was running errands at the time of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also attacked the sole eyewitness to the crime, an 
employee of the hardware store. The clerk sees so many customers that he would 
be hard-pressed to give an accurate description of anyone, Hill said. The clerk 
told police the gunman was 5-foot-9, 5 inches shorter than Slade, Hill told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Hill's calm and methodical argument, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff 
Jonas used a loud voice and dramatic gestures to call Slade and his alibi 
witnesses a group of liars. "Don't let yourself be haunted by the ghost of a 
man wrongly convicted," Jonas said. "In this case, it's an unreal dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury will begin deliberations today.

CHILDREN PROTEST AT DISNEY STUDIOS; LAND: TOPANGA CANYON GROUP OPPOSES PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT. BUT COMPANY'S LINK TO PLAN IS CALLED REMOTE AT BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dozens of Topanga Canyon schoolchildren and their parents took up placards 
Tuesday and marched outside Walt Disney Studios to protest a luxury housing 
project and golf course proposed for their rural community. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, they were in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has nothing to do with the project," said Bob Wilson, president of the 
partnership proposing the project called Canyon Oaks Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 A more accurate target for the 50 or so placard-waving junior activists would 
have been a nondescript office building in North Hollywood -- not under the 
ersatz palm trees and gargantuan statuary dwarfs that grace the Walt Disney 
Co.'s Burbank headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the adult protesters acknowledged that the Disney connection to the 
project was remote at best and the picketing largely symbolic. "But it would 
have taken a lot more explaining to the kids," said Jennifer Strom, a parent 
who helped organize the protest against a plan to develop 97 luxury home sites 
and a golf course on 257 acres at the top of Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks Estates is at the center of the longest-running land-use dispute 
in Los Angeles County history. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take a 
final vote on the project Thursday, ending a divisive 15-year battle of 
personal smears and innuendo between opponents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the campaign to kill the project included the children's march and 
their signs depicting Disney cartoon characters with fangs and slogans such as 
"Don't Mickey Mouse With Our Mountains." How they ended up in front of Disney's 
headquarters is a story almost as complicated as the saga of the project's 
tortuous history. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is owned by the Lund Family Trust, which was set up by the late 
Sharon Disney Lund to provide income for her family. Lund was a daughter of the 
late Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, in turn, had set up an investment company to support his heirs called 
Retlaw Enterprises Inc. (Retlaw is Walter spelled backward.) A vice president 
of the North Hollywood-based Retlaw is also president of the Canyon Oaks 
Estates limited partnership, although the two are distinct corporations, both 
from each other and from the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the children and their parents said they wanted to send a message to 
Disney heirs that they have greater public obligations than the average 
entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children of Walt Disney have inherited tremendous wealth from this 
company," project opponent Susan Nissman said outside the Disney compound on 
Alameda Street. "They have a social responsibility to the right thing with that 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Charlie McLaughlin argued that he was under direct orders from 
Lund to develop plans that were sensitive both to the environment and the 
surrounding community. He said he has fulfilled that obligation, even though 
some residents continue to oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the critics is 10-year-old Morley Strom. "I think they shouldn't do 
this," she said. "They're being grouches. I would like it to be a state park, 
definitely. I've taken hikes there and it's like a jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she thought the children understood the issues at play, Nissman 
responded: "Topanga 8- and 9-year-olds are pretty hip."

SUPERVISORS TO FUND NEW ANTELOPE VALLEY COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved a 
plan by Supervisor Mike Antonovich to find $2 million to $3 million in this 
year's county budget to complete plans for a new courthouse in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a state law that sets the county's court-construction schedule, three 
planned courthouses in North Hollywood, Westchester and Chatsworth are 
scheduled to be built before the Antelope Valley court, but county officials 
say the need in the isolated north county may be greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The population boom in the Antelope Valley in the 1980s has convinced 
supervisors that a planned $80-million, 21-courtroom building in Lancaster 
takes precedence over a state mandate to put up a new courthouse in North 
Hollywood, said Lori Howard, an aide to Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Jan. 11 motion by Antonovich, county officials are seeking to change a 
state law to allow them to place the Antelope Valley project ahead of the North 
Hollywood courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying that we don't want a court in North Hollywood, but the 
Antelope Valley court would take priority," Howard said. The 25-courtroom Van 
Nuys facility is able to absorb most cases coming out of the North Hollywood 
area, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the courthouse in Lancaster tries to manage all of its criminal 
proceedings in six courtrooms, Howard said. Civil cases are heard at the county 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, whose 5th district includes all of Antelope and most of the San 
Fernando valleys, gained the support of prosecutors and judges in lobbying for 
a new courthouse in the sprawling northern part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said the damage caused to Sierra Highway in the Northridge 
earthquake -- which made it more difficult for Antelope Valley residents to 
reach courthouses in Los Angeles -- was another factor in the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step forward in bringing judicial representation to the Antelope 
Valley," Antonovich said. "The earthquake, snowstorms and the Sierra Highway 
closing have proven to the board that a court to meet the needs of the people 
has to be built."

SCENE STEALERS; IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER THE FILM AND 
TELEVISION INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing come-hither smiles and rose-colored sunglasses, representatives from 
Thailand to Pittsburgh descended on Santa Monica last week, hoping to snatch a 
piece oA.'s signature film and television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They had their work cut out for them. Anyone venturing outside the annual 
location expo quickly encountered the sparkling Pacific Ocean, temperatures 
approaching 80 degrees and maybe even a celebrity or two. Southern California, 
for all its recent misfortunes, still looked every bit the glamour capital of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful -- I rented a convertible," a partially thawed convention 
official from New York marveled. But none of that was enough to keep boosters 
of frozen flatlands, crime-plagued cities and developing countries from making 
a grab for Tinseltown's tarnished crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed into the Santa Monica Convention Center, nearly 200 exhibitors spent 
three days at Location Expo '94, which ended Monday, pitching their locales as 
ideal for movie and TV production. 
</P>
<P>
 They insisted they came not to steal jobs from the Los Angeles area, as some 
local officials claimed, but to attract so-called "location" work that would be 
done outside of Southern California anyway. Whatever their motives, the 
delegates hawked their respective homes with a fervor that, despite the slick 
brochures and sweet financial inducements, sometimes seemed strained. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the sales job confronting North Dakota, which hopes to capitalize on 
its status as the nation's leading sunflower and rapeseed producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just huge fields of the stuff," enthused Kip Stolberg of the North 
Dakota Film Office, pointing to the potential for "panoramic crop shots" near 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 He also zealously promoted a defunct missile bunker as an ideal sci-fi movie 
set. But as the convention wound down, it became clear that North Dakota had a 
visibility problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walk by here and say, 'Oh, North Dakota,' " Stolberg grumbled. "It's 
like an afterthought. Some of these areas are just screaming to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, representatives from almost every corner of the planet showed up in 
Santa Monica screaming to be used, which helps explain why the exposition -- 
sponsored by the Assn. of Film Commissioners International -- is the largest 
event of its kind anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The show attracted 6,000 people, many of them producer-types based on the 
Westside. It was one of the major events associated with the American Film 
Market, a nine-day spree of movie marketing that attracts 10,000 visitors 
annually, injecting millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For Santa Monica, still recovering from the Jan. 17 earthquake, the timing 
couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 "February was a rough month," said Kathleen Rawson of the city's Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. "With the AFM coming into town, it filled our hotels 
again, and they needed it. For them it was the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 For television and movie producers, meanwhile, the convention provides a way 
to scour the world for film locales without leaving the confines of the 
Convention Center. For localities, it's a chance to compete for a slice of a 
$4-billion industry that tends to be clean, prestigious and increasingly 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah alone, for example, the industry now pumps $88 million a year into the 
state, up from $38 million just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials estimate that such location shooting represents a $1 
billion drain on the local economy, but that is of little concern to far-flung 
convention delegates who have their own interests to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure on Missouri described the Show Me State as "Your 69,674-Square-Mile 
Back Lot," while Louisiana officials peppered their PR with complimentary grab 
bags of Cajun spices and other indigenous goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're one of the few states that has really good swamps," boasted David 
Jones, director of the Louisiana Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still reeling from its much-publicized string of calamities, and from a 
lingering perception that it isn't business-friendly, Los Angeles was fair 
game. It was denied exhibit space after failing to register for the expo in 
time, forcing angry and chagrined city officials to pitch a promotional tent on 
the grounds of the adjacent county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Convention Center, rival delegations smelled blood. "After 
California's disasters (fires, earthquakes, mudslides, etc.), we're getting a 
lot of calls," said Karen Runtel of the Oregon Film Office.

 They stopped for a snack and ended up shooting two men to death, according to 
statements made in court Tuesday during a preliminary hearing for a pair of 
suspected gang members charged in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dewayne Parker, also known as "Drac," and Dialo Parker are each 
charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the May 
21, 1993, shooting at a Palmdale gas station and mini-mart. Dialo Parker is 
also charged with personal use of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they stopped for gas and a Coke," said Deputy Dist. Atty. David G. 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Parkers, who are not related, were ordered Tuesday by Antelope 
Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant to answer to the charges in Superior Court. 
Arraignment was scheduled for March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony given during a four-hour preliminary hearing Tuesday, 
the Parkers were driven to Palmdale from Pacoima on May 21 by three girls, one 
of whom was Dialo Parker's girlfriend. At a mini-mart at 407 E. Palmdale Blvd., 
the Parkers got into a fight with three men. 
</P>
<P>
 Dialo Parker, also known as "Dee," is accused of shooting the three men after 
Michael Parker "challenged" them and asked questions, such as "Where you from?" 
according to testimony and statements made Tuesday by the attorneys and 
witnesses. Michael Parker said, "We got some Crips," according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale residents Antwon Giles and his cousin, Kevin Robertson, both 22, died 
of gunshot wounds. Kubwa Gonsoulin was shot in the hand and leg but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-mart employee, Medhat Eid, identified Dialo Parker as the shooter 
during Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dialo Parker was arrested in a Palmdale apartment the day after the shooting. 
Michael Parker was arrested three months later in Omaha. He was later 
extradited to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Avrum S. Harris, an attorney representing Michael Parker, made an unsuccessful 
attempt to have the charges against his client dismissed.

 A 39-year-old Newhall man was arrested and booked on suspicion of unlawfully 
detaining a minor Tuesday after safely returning his girlfriend's 3-year-old 
son, who had been missing since March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Sykes was arrested by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies about noon 
after he returned Montice Williams to the Newhall home of the boy's 
grandmother.He is being held in lieu of $40,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandmother, Beverly Ann Smith, reported Montice missing last Tuesday.

SUSPECT IN SLAYING IS EXPECTED TO SURRENDER; CRIME: A MARTIAL-ARTS INSTRUCTOR 
IS CHARGED IN THE STRANGULATION OF A FORMER COLLEAGUE, A NATIONALLY RANKED 
BLACK BELT. 
</P>

<P>
 A Canyon Country martial-arts instructor is expected to surrender today on a 
murder charge in connection with the strangulation death of a former colleague 
Dec. 15 in a secluded area off Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, was charged Monday in Newhall Municipal Court with 
the special-circumstance murder of 29-year-old Veronica Estrada, a nationally 
ranked black belt who worked with Milburn as an instructor at Taekwondo USA in 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant has been issued for Milburn, who remained at large Tuesday 
but was expected to turn himself in for arraignment today, said his attorney, 
Darryl Mounger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He claims he's innocent and I put him on a private polygraph test and he came 
up clean on that," Mounger said. "At this point I don't think there is anything 
to indicate he is guilty of murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities accused Milburn of committing the murder after lying in wait and 
while sexually assaulting the victim -- both special-circumstance allegations 
that allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the evidence is compelling," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz, 
who said he will oppose bail of any amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger said that the prosecution's case appears largely circumstantial and 
that he is surprised at the special-circumstances allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has cooperated with this all the way through, so obviously they know 
something I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada was last seen walking along Soledad Canyon Road near Camp Plenty Road 
about 8:15 p.m. the night she was killed. Foltz said sheriff's investigators 
speculate that she accepted a ride home with Milburn and the two got into a 
dispute. They believe that she left the car and was walking back to the studio 
in the 19000 block of Soledad Canyon Road when he attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said that one witness saw a man he later identified as Milburn 
struggling with Estrada near the scene of her death and that another witness 
saw him run across the road shortly before that. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the killing may have been motivated by professional jealousy over 
Estrada's success at the martial-arts studio. Foltz said investigators also 
discovered materials in Milburn's apartment suggesting an interest in deviant 
sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this guy was kind of studying the area of unusual sexual 
behavior," he said. "Not just looking at magazines, but reviewing it and making 
notes."

OFFICIALS REVIEW SCORES, TO BEEF UP TEACHING; EDUCATION: RESULTS SHOW STUDENTS 
ABOVE AVERAGE IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CLOSER TO NORM IN ANTELOPE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER and PHIL SNEIDERMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Results of the California Learning Assessment System tests, given for the 
first time in May, showed that Santa Clarita Valley students generally scored 
above state and county averages, while Antelope Valley scores hovered closer to 
the averages. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators in the north county, where many residents moved to get a 
better education for their children, spent Tuesday reviewing test scores to 
determine where teachers need to beef up instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were administered by the state to students in the fourth, eighth and 
10th grades, measuring reading, writing and math skills. The results were a 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in previous statewide tests, students were not compared to one another 
or to a statewide average. Instead, they were measured against performance 
standards that educators say were set extremely high. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, very few north county students received the highest scores -- 
Level 6. However, many scored in the lowest ranking, Level 1, particularly on 
the math test. 
</P>
<P>
 Some administrators blamed the tests for the lower scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was certainly different this year," said Laurence Strauss, 
principal at William S. Hart High School in Newhall. "It clearly challenges the 
students to think critically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we would certainly show above the state average, which we did. . . . 
As we refine our curriculum, you'll see some changes in test results in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley Union High School District, students generally matched 
the state and county averages in reading and writing scores, but fell below 
them in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "This test should be used as a way for the schools to point out areas that 
really need to be worked on," said Ronald W. Ball, a pupil testing specialist 
with the district. "I think this test proves that throughout the state, there's 
a need to evaluate what we're doing in math instruction -- and make plans to 
improve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several elementary schools in the Keppel Union School District in Littlerock 
had particularly low math scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jean Fuller said her teachers need to prepare students to answer math 
questions with more than one answer. As an example, she cited a CLAS question 
that asked students to come up with several combinations of coins that would 
equal 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said the tests "were an indicator of where we are and where we need to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, "the state hasn't had the full resources to change the 
curriculum and provide the staff development and training to support the test." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing low math scores at his schools, Lancaster School District 
Assistant Supt. Ed Goodwin said teachers will have to change their teaching 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have some work to do in the teaching of logical thinking 
applications and problem analysis in the area of mathematics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Math scores in the Newhall School District were not quite as high as expected, 
even though one of its fourth-grade classes recently won a county math contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. J. Michael McGrath said the district's math program should not be 
evaluated solely on the test results. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at the scores in concert with other scholastic aptitude 
tests," he said. "I would hate to have our math program measured entirely on 
that. I think it's another piece of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Castaic Union School District, solid scores on the CLAS tests may help 
resolve lingering questions about the quality of the district's curriculum 
raised in the last school board election. 
</P>
<P>
 A slate of three candidates, led by then-incumbent Gloria Mercado, criticized 
the administration for poor student scores on other aptitude tests. But those 
candidates were defeated by another slate that expressed support for district 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people six months ago who would have had you believe the sky was 
falling," Supt. Scott Brown said. "At least by this measurement, that wouldn't 
seem to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being pleased with their marks, Castaic officials say results from 
CLAS and other tests are less reliable for smaller districts because a few 
scores can greatly influence overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture that was painted (by state officials) called for districts to get 
individualized scores. They're apparently not geared up for that yet," Brown 
said. "Until they can publish individual student results, we have trouble 
putting definition to this."

TIME-SHARING PUTS DISNEY MAGIC TO TEST; DEVELOPMENT: COMPANY HAS DONE WELL IN 
FLORIDA, BUT NEWPORT BEACH PROJECT MUST TRANSFORM INDUSTRY IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Walt Disney Co. jumped into the time-share business two years ago, it 
entered an industry suffering from a serious credibility problem after 
widespread accusations of fraud and unscrupulous sales tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 But that foray into the time-share market in December, 1991, included a 
repackaging strategy by Disney officials aimed at sprucing up the shabby image 
of time-sharing. That strategy -- which included a conspicuous absence of the 
very word time-share from the colorful brochures touting the Disney Vacation 
Club near Orlando, Fla. -- appears to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have definitely put the Disney touch to time-sharing," said David 
Matheson, a spokesman for the American Resort and Residential Development 
Assn., a time-share trade group in Washington. "They are really top notch." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers, however, speculate whether even Disney, which said Monday it 
will build a time-share development near Newport Beach, has the ability to 
burnish the tarnished image of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is not the only high-profile national corporation to get into 
time-sharing in recent years. Marriott Corp., Hilton Hotels Corp. and 
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. have also invested in time-share 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But there continue to be abuses, despite the recent entry in the market of 
publicly traded companies with reputations to protect, said Ralph E. Stone, a 
lawyer in the Federal Trade Commission's San Francisco office. "Although they 
add credibility, I'm not sure they solve any real problems" that the industry 
faces, Stone said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as some companies engage in hard-sell tactics and offer unrealistic 
promotions, Stone said, the industry will continue to suffer from a lack of 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The pall over the industry wasn't always so dark, and companies that offered 
lifetime ownership in vacation properties made millions of dollars trading on 
dreams of spending lazy weeks at beach or ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Ivy Corp., a Corona-based time-share operator, was one of the most 
lucrative operations. In its heyday, the Glen Ivy time-share group drew 
thousands of prospective customers to its ritzy Newport Beach conference rooms 
each week, dazzling the would-be vacationers with slick video presentations, 
fast-talking sales representatives and promises of free dinners, televisions, 
cars and other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after becoming embroiled in accusations that the company was guilty of 
defrauding thousands of owners by overselling time-share weeks and pressuring 
customers with one-time-only offers, the company folded last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Ivy is not alone. In October, California Riviera Vacations in Laguna 
Hills agreed to pay $100,000 in civil penalties to settle charges that it lured 
customers with deceptive advertising. The company agreed to pay the settlement 
but admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office is still investigating that company, 
according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And as recently as Monday, the FTC sued a Fountain Valley firm for allegedly 
defrauding as many as 20,000 time-share owners by falsely promising to match 
them up with prospective buyers of their vacation-resort stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said that pressures from the resale market will feed further abuses as 
supply vastly exceeds demand. Though there are an estimated 500,000 units on 
the resale market now, he said, only about 6,000 units -- new and previously 
owned -- are purchased each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those units, most of which are being sold at highly discounted prices, compete 
with new time-share properties -- including Disney's, Stone said. Some 
companies are forced, therefore, to increase the use of high-pressure sales 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a hell of a problem," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burns, vice president of sales and business development for Disney 
Vacation Development Inc., said that the company's 410-unit time-share complex 
at its Epcot Center theme park outside Orlando is half sold after 27 months of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company is more than pleased with the progress, he said, considering 
that Disney does not use promotions such as giving free dinners or other prizes 
in exchange for a sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the resort hands out information about the time-share complex at its 
amusement parks and hotels, including Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel. 
Prospective customers are encouraged to take videos and brochures home with 
them and call sales representatives at their leisure, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers also have 30 days to cancel the purchase, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to be 180 degrees different," he said. "It seems to be working 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Vacation Development is also planning resorts in Vero Beach, Fla., and 
Hilton Head, S.C., as well as the 650-unit Disney Vacation Club between Newport 
Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County complex is expected to open by early 1997. Time-share units 
are expected to start at $12,390, making them among the most affordable in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, a longtime time-share executive for Hilton and other large companies, 
said that it is not Disney's job to set new standards for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he and other time-share executives deplore the tactics of some 
less-reputable operators and hope that, with the inclusion of large hotel 
chains in the business, the industry will begin to police itself better. 
Time-Shares: What You Should Know 
</P>
<P>
 * Time-share resorts in the United States: 890; 249 with space available 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 U.S. sales: $1.5 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 projection: $2 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 sales worldwide: $4 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Other popular locations: Mexico, coastal areas of Western Europe and Greece 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE YOU BUY 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out the developer: American Resort Development Assn. can provide a 
list of members who adhere to its standards. Its booklet "Resort and Urban 
Timesharing: A Consumer's Guide" is available to the public. Information: (202) 
371-6700; or write ARDA, Suite 510, 1220 L St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. 
</P>
<P>
 * How is property managed? Find out what services are provided; ask to see 
owners' association budget. Are there adequate reserves for repairs or major 
replacement work? Does the rate of increase for annual maintenance fees exceed 
inflation? 
</P>
<P>
 * Get references: Ask developer or management company for names of current 
time-share owners and question them 
</P>
<P>
 about the property. They may be able to tell you about the exchange power of 
the location and season you want to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit the resort: Try to spend some time at or near the resort in question. 
Visit the competitors, too. If this is impossible, get photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of high-pressure sales: The big players like Disney and Marriott have 
a laid-back approach to sales. But some companies try to lure buyers with 
heavy-handed sales pitches and prizes. Better Business Bureau or local consumer 
offices can say whether complaints have been lodged against a particular 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read sales contracts carefully: Make sure you get in writing whatever 
promises are made by salespeople. Are you buying a lease interest that expires 
after a few years? Will you have vacation exchange privileges within a network? 
Will the developer provide financing? Find out how long you have to back out 
after signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider resales: You are more likely to cut a better deal with owners than 
developers, sometimes for just a fraction of the original price. Time-share 
resale brokers are listed in the Yellow Pages. TimeSharing Today, a quarterly 
publication, has classified ads that list units for sale. Write to TimeSharing 
Today, 26 Franklin St., Tenafly, N.J., 07670.

O.C. BULK MAILERS READY FOR RATE HIKE; POSTAL SERVICE: INCREASE WILL MEAN 
HIGHER COSTS FOR ADVERTISERS, BUT MANY HAD ANTICIPATED THE MOVE AND EXPECT ONLY 
MINOR CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The rate increases proposed Tuesday by the U.S. Postal Service will mean 
higher business costs for companies that advertise by mail, but many had 
anticipated it and view it as only a minor change. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter shops and mailing organizations, which handle half of the nation's 
advertising mail, will be directly affected, according to Mail Advertising 
Service Assn. International, an Alexandria, Va., trade group that represents 
commercial mail handlers. Magazine publishers, grocery stores that mail weekly 
flyers, shopping center ad collectives and mortgage brokers updating 
fast-changing interest rates will feel the effects as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the trade association is supporting the increase. It would be the 
first of its kind in four years, said Barry Brennan, a spokesman for the group, 
and "that is substantially less than the rate of inflation for that period." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising mail, also known as direct mail, is a large and rapidly growing 
marketing medium. Businesses sent 65.7 billion pieces of direct mail last year, 
up 5.2% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some companies may be forced by tight budgets to cut back at first, 
most will adjust, many businesses said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye Kaufman, owner of Services Etc. in Irvine, says her company -- which 
addresses letters, maintains mailing lists and offers other related services -- 
will see a decline in revenue at first but will recover within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal rate increases "always have an impact," said Kaufman, who has been in 
business for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-class postal rates, which apply to advertising flyers and other business 
mailings, would rise 10.2%, according to the Postal Service's proposal. The 
cost to mail a letter first class would go up 10.3%, from 29 cents to 32 cents. 
Any increase must be approved by the independent Postal Rate Commission, a 
process that could take months. But the rate increase is expected to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Armstrong, who owns a Mail Boxes Etc. franchise in Costa Mesa, said 
her customers had been complaining all day Tuesday about the possibility of 
higher rates. Armstrong said she will be passing along any increase to her 
customers. Together with the fee she charges for service, she said, prices will 
be high enough to cause some customers to squawk. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will probably still come," she said, "but they'll complain." 
</P>
<P>
 One local merchant, though, actually sees a possible business boom if rates 
rise. Brian Mullally, sales manager for Friden Neopost in Fountain Valley, 
predicted that companies will be more concerned about how much they spend for 
postage. And that could help his company, which makes high-volume scales and 
other mailing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes surprises," Mullally said, "especially when it comes to money." 
</P>
<P>
 Friden Neopost has another product that could realize a gain from higher 
postage: rate change protection. It is insurance against paying to have a 
technician recalibrate a company's postal meters each time rates go up. 
</P>

<TEXT>

earned $1.5 million, or 23 cents a share, for its latest quarter.That was 
nearly triple the company's profit of $593,000, or 9 cents a share, for the 
same period a year earlier. Net income for the latest quarter included the 
effect of an accounting change. Sales for the company's first fiscal quarter, 
which ended Jan. 31, were up more than 27% to $24.3 million from $19.0 million 
for the same period a year earlier.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; BUILDING PERMITS FOR NEW HOUSING ALMOST DOUBLE IN 
JANUARY 
</P>

 The number of building permits issued for new housing in Orange County almost 
doubled in January, according to the state Construction Industry Research 
Board. The number of permits totaled 591, up from 338 issued in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to read too much into January. I don't want to discount the 
increase, but I don't want to say it's a turn-around," said Ben Bartolotto, 
research director for the board. Because permits are an indicator of builders' 
intention to start construction, they usually go up after home sales start to 
increase, Bartolotto said. More important, he said, is that home-building 
permits for last year totaled 6,409, compared to 5,943 for 1992. For all of 
Southern California, he said, only Orange and San Diego counties showed a 
year-to-year increase.ORANGE COUN

ROCKWELL, TRUCKING COMPANY SIGN DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell said Tuesday it has won a multimillion-dollar contract to install 
telecommunications systems in 1,000 trucks operated by J.B. Hunt Transport 
Services, the nation's largest publicly held long-haul trucking company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, would not give the specific value of the 
contract. The company previously received orders for its mobile communications 
systems from CRST and Florilli Trucking, both Iowa-based trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockwell Pro2000 Mobile Communication System relays two-way data messages 
by satellite and processes vehicle position reports using the Global 
Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system. The systems are made 
by Collins Commercial Avionics, a Rockwell subsidiary in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

AST LEADER SEES HIMSELF AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE; COMPUTERS: SAFI QURESHEY RUNS 
COMPANY WHOSE PURCHASE OF TANDY PLACED IT AMONG THE NATION'S TOP FIVE PC 
MAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN RAMSTAD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safi Qureshey was attending a conference of business executives, listening to 
complaints about changes at other companies, when he felt compelled to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his hand, introduced himself and said: "I look at it like the 
biggest person that has to change is myself. If I do not change, I cannot lead 
because the company has to change." 
</P>
<P>
 His company, AST Research Inc., is going through its biggest change ever. 
Until last summer, AST was a solid but quiet grower in the frenetic personal 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it entered a $175-million deal to buy the manufacturing operations of 
Tandy Corp., a move that nearly doubled AST's size and placed it among the 
nation's top five PC companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the Tandy acquisition, AST's unit sales jumped 66% last year, 
analysts estimate. For the six months ending Jan. 1, the first half of AST's 
fiscal 1994, the company earned $26.2 million on sales of $1.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock plunged last week on word from the company that third-quarter 
results would fall below Wall Street expectations, suggesting a possible 
weakening of PC demand. But industry analysts said the market was overreacting 
and that the PC outlook remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 (Also last week, a group of shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit claiming 
that AST misled them about the acquisition of Tandy's manufacturing operations. 
The suit, filed in a federal court, contends that AST executives misled 
stockholders by saying the acquisition was consistent with the company's 
objectives when, in fact, it was a "high-risk gamble." An AST spokesman has 
declined to comment on the suit.)  
</P>
<P>
 In the eight months since the Tandy deal closed, AST has realigned its 
manufacturing worldwide. The biggest changes, designed to take advantage of 
bigger Tandy facilities, moved jobs from California to Texas and from Scotland 
to Ireland. In the process, AST eliminated 1,000 existing jobs and created 850 
new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey felt it was important to move quickly since so many employees would 
be affected. "We get paid for making decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole integration strategy is something that, in a company of our size, 
should have taken much, much longer if you consider the magnitude of the 
change," said Jim Forquer, who moved from Apple Computer Inc. to become AST's 
senior vice president of operations last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To concede the realities of inertia and resistance to change, Safi would 
prefer not to concede that," Forquer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey and two friends, Albert Wong and Tom Yuen, started the company 14 
years ago to sell enhancements to the original IBM personal computer. The "AST" 
came from the initials of the founders' first names. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey emigrated from Pakistan in the 1970s to study engineering at the 
University of Texas. Now 42, he is one of the few surviving founders in high 
tech's elite, a circle that includes Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates, Dell 
Computer's Michael Dell and Gateway 2000 Inc.'s Ted Waitt. 
</P>
<P>
 He has taken chances in some areas that received little attention and stayed 
away from others that brought the spotlight to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, AST was the first major PC company to venture into China and 
remains the biggest seller there. 
</P>
<P>
 AST was the first PC company to separate its machines into brand lines for 
businesses and consumers, and it returned to making laptop computers in the 
late 1980s, ahead of Compaq and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 When rivals Dell and Gateway boasted of lower prices through the use of mail 
order and toll-free telephone sales, AST pushed wholesalers into getting rid of 
artificially high discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But AST has stayed away from the strategy of direct sales to consumers. It 
also has wisely shunned pen-based and hand-held PCs like Apple's Newton, which 
have been slow sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have picked and chosen our areas," Qureshey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative technological approach means AST isn't criticized when 
something fails. On the other hand, it's not necessarily recognized for new 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no strong positive identity that comes to mind with AST," said 
Richard Zwetchkenbaum, PC analyst for International Data Corp. in Framingham, 
Mass. "They're working to correct that, but it's no easy battle when you've got 
companies like IBM, Apple and Compaq coming out with new technology all the 
time and you're just coming out with good things." 
</P>
<P>
 But AST promises a splash in a few weeks with new PCs for consumers that 
incorporate more telecommunication features. The company won't reveal more 
until then, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of PC buying among consumers fascinates Qureshey. He was the only 
chief executive of a major PC maker to attend the Winter Consumer Electronics 
Show in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there are two kinds of PC consumers: adults who work on a PC at the 
office and want to use it at home, who tend to be very selective, and parents, 
who will buy almost anything their computer-savvy children want. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous education going on below the surface that we don't 
realize," Qureshey said of children. "They get these game magazines. They know 
about bulletin boards and where you get shareware. They're traveling to each 
other's house with diskettes and CD-ROMs." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of multimedia PCs with compact disc drives, known as CD-ROM, is one 
of the few times where demand drove technology rather than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at CD-ROM, that did not come from us," he said. "It came from the 
consumer side." 
</P>
<P>
 He admits surprise at that change. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our industry, if our company was growing 2%, 3%, 5% a year, maybe I would 
get bored and do something else. We are part of an industry, though, and part 
of a company that is changing so fast, you've got a tiger by the tail."

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; LONG BEACH STATE WINS BIG DESPITE LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State lost its top starting pitcher, one of its top relievers and 
its top recruit before the season began. Nevertheless, the 49ers are winning as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning two of three games at Fresno State last weekend, Long Beach 
began the week with an 11-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, ranked 14th by Baseball America, were not expected to start fast, 
what with 17-game winner Daniel Choi signing a pro contract in Korea days 
before school started, and reliever David Goldstein and third baseman Tristan 
Paul being declared academically ineligible at the end of the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it appears that Long Beach will challenge second-ranked Cal State 
Fullerton for the Big West Conference title. The 49ers are hoping to make their 
second consecutive appearance in the College World Series, which would be their 
fourth in six seasons under Coach Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Long Beach started 12-12 before it got untracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some good results, but we're not playing nearly as well as we are 
capable of playing," said senior right-hander Mike Fontana, who is 3-0 with a 
2.20 earned-run average in 28 2/3 innings. "Still, this is like a breath of 
fresh air for me. I haven't played on a team that started out this strong in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana leads a staff that has also received strong performances from 
sophomore Scott Rivette, who is 4-0 with a 2.05 ERA; and junior Gabe Gonzalez, 
who has a 1.42 ERA and six saves in eight appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman infielder Jeff Tagliaferri, hitting .447; senior second baseman Eric 
Martins, .365, and junior outfielder Rolado Avila, .310, have been the main 
offensive threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played our first game (on Feb. 11) about a week or two later than we have 
in the past," Snow said. "With so many new faces and young guys, that kind of 
gave us a chance to get prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done well, playing seven of our first 10 games against teams from the 
Six-Pac (Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.) I think that's a pretty good 
statement that this team is establishing an identity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making a pitch: Long Beach has undertaken an aggressive promotional campaign 
with hopes of eventually building a fan base large enough to attract an NCAA 
Regional tournament to Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Several corporate sponsors have signed on, and there is a 22-game radio 
contract. Commercials on local cable television stations are trumpeting family 
days at the ballpark and promotional-night giveaways of batting helmets, 
T-shirts, seat cushions, coffee mugs, water bottles and wrist bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach drew 800 to each of its first two home games, more than double the 
average last season, and figures to steadily increase with the giveaways and 
home series against Wichita State and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the only man to have played on and been a head coach for 
Division I College World Series champions? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Power rating: Fourth-ranked USC began the week 11-5 overall and 6-3 in the 
Pacific 10 Southern Division after winning two of three games against 
California last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will participate in a tournament at Texas A&M starting Thursday. 
Junior third baseman Aaron Boone is batting .400 for USC, which plays 14 of its 
next 17 games on the road and has hit 22 home runs in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which traditionally boasts several power hitters, has hit only four 
homers. The 5-12 Bruins lost two of three games in their conference-opening 
series against Stanford last weekend. UCLA travels to California this weekend 
for a Pac-10 series. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Out in front: Loyola Marymount was struggling before its West Coast 
Conference-opening series against Pepperdine last weekend, but the Lions 
emerged as a contender for the WCC title by winning two of three against the 
perennial-champion Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola, which improved to 8-10 overall, has been led by senior Jesse Ibarra, 
who hit his sixth home run and earned his fourth save as the Lions swept a 
doubleheader on Saturday. Loyola has also recently improved its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say we were struggling because we made a long trip to Hawaii," 
Loyola Coach Jody Robinson said before the Pepperdine series. "But the doctor 
has diagnosed it as bad defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took all the gloves to a boot maker and he has sewn up all the holes, so I

 Still hot: Fullerton's loss to Fresno State last week was only a temporary 
setback for a team that is 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the loss, Fullerton had defeated Oklahoma, San Diego and previously 
top-ranked Georgia Tech to win the Anaheim Hilton & Towers tournament at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Parisi and Ted Silva combined for a six-hit, 2-0 victory over Georgia 
Tech, the first time the Yellow Jackets had been shut out in 152 games. Parisi, 
a junior right-hander from Arcadia, improved to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech catcher Jason Varitek, a senior who was drafted in the first 
round by the Minnesota Twins in 1993, had one hit in 10 at-bats and struck out 
four times during the tournament.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; SIGEL BECOMES A FORCE AMONG THE SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senior PGA Tour and a challenge issued by Jack Nicklaus have given Jay 
Sigel an opportunity to answer, at least partially, a question that has been 
asked many times. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, Sigel has been the best amateur golfer in the world -- 
the best according to Lee Trevino "to come down the pike since Bobby Jones."  
</P>
<P>
 A freak accident in 1963, in which his left hand was badly cut, deprived Sigel 
of a chance to make it as a pro golfer in his prime. At the time, his only 
ambition was to join the Tour. Missing his chance for a pro career was a major 
blow, but looking back he sees the injury as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long recovery period Sigel became the king of the amateurs, winning 
consecutive U.S. Amateur titles, playing on a record nine Walker Cup teams and 
winning the British Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also low amateur at least once in all the majors that permit amateurs. 
"I wouldn't trade the amateur experience for all the money in the world, " said 
Sigel, who won Sunday at Ojai in only his fourth Senior event. "I'm not just 
talking about the tournaments I won. It's the people I met, the honors and a 
lot of other things. More important, I might never have met my wife nor had a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 But always, there was the burning question: Could Sigel have made it against 
the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player? 
</P>
<P>
 That question can't be answered. But Sigel turned 50 last November and that 
was his chance for at least a shot at pro golf. A talk with Nicklaus gave him 
the final impetus and Sigel went to the senior qualifying school.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jack said I had a choice, but he added that I had won all the honors anyone 
could get as an amateur and they could never be taken away," Sigel said. "But 
unless I gave it a try, I would never know if I could make it in the pros. 'You 
have the ability,' Jack said, 'but it's up to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His four tournaments as a professional have established Sigel as the budding 
star of the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving notice with a first-round 65 in his third event, Sigel hit the 
jackpot Sunday at Ojai.  
</P>
<P>
 In an amazing performance, Sigel set a professional golf record when he came 
from 10 shots down in the final round, shooting an eight-under-par 62, then 
beating Jim Colbert on the fourth hole of a sudden-death playoff and reaching 
his first goal as a pro -- winning a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It also meant that he no longer had to wait to find out if he was eligible for 
any given tournament. He is now exempt for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a grueling 5 1/2 hours Sunday, Sigel said he figured it would take about 
two days for his amazing feat to sink in. But he already knows for certain he 
made the correct move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never played in more than 12 tournaments in any year as an amateur," he 
said. "And I never played from October to March. It's meant a change in 
lifestyle. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could do well. After three 
tournaments, I already was sure I belonged. I have been well received and 
treated great by the professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Sigel was attending summer school as a sophomore at Wake Forest, following in 
the footsteps of Arnold Palmer, when the accident occurred. Just a few weeks 
before, he had won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone went out the door of our fraternity (house) in front of me and I 
reached out to catch the door before it closed," Sigel said. "Instead of 
catching the frame, I rammed my left hand through the glass. The doctor that 
sewed me up quit counting after 70 stitches. He'd reached par. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hand didn't stop hurting for five years and I didn't start playing a good 
game again for 10 years. By that time I had a family and an insurance business. 
It was really a blessing. I probably would have been just another good pro, not 
a great one. And all the amateur honors would never have been mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a finalist for the Sullivan Award one year and was sitting next to the 
winner, Edwin Moses. He was astounded to learn that I paid all my own golf fees 
and earned only trophies when I won. He wanted to set up a foundation to pay my 
expenses. I finally made him understand that probably the only real amateur 
sport left is amateur golf."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISMAL OUTING DOESN'T HELP FARRELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Farrell sat slumped in front of his locker, his voice flat and lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent the last three years trying to save his baseball career, despite 
two reconstructive elbow surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 He began pitching in mid-December to prepare himself for spring training, 
knowing it would be the most critical camp of his career, that he would be 
judged solely on performance and results. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why his outing in the Angels' 11-4 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers was 
so traumatic for him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, 31, was unable to complete his scheduled three-inning stint, yielding 
five hits and seven earned runs in 2 1/3 innings. The crowning blow was a 
three-run homer by Tom Brunansky in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is the end but I realize this was not the step I was 
looking for," he said. "I'm not going to panic, but they need results from me, 
and this was not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is one of five candidates for the last two spots in the Angel 
rotation, and if there's any reason for hope, it's that no one else is doing 
much better. The Angels have yielded 49 runs in their five games, posting a 
9.86 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like this was a chance for me to move ahead of the pack a bit," 
Farrell said. "Now, I'm right in the middle of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is expected to get at least one more opportunity but another poor 
performance could exhaust the Angels' patience. They will begin making roster 
cuts next week, and will be required to pay only one-sixth of a player's salary 
if he's released by March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time John Farrell goes out there, it's critical," Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers said. "You try to give veterans a full shot, but we went quite a ways 
with him last year. In about another week, it gets serious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Andrew Lorraine, who has only six games of professional experience, 
has been so impressive this spring that Rodgers says it's no longer a certainty 
that Lorraine will start the season in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as good as advertised," Rodgers said. "Realistically, you'd say that 
he'll start out in double-A or triple-A. But realistically, you say, 'How much 
does this guy have to learn?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy we're going to have to keep our eye on because he'll move fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, the Angels' fourth-round selection from Stanford in the 1993 draft, 
yielded only one hit in three innings in the Angels' 4-3 victory in the B game. 
He probably will start pitching soon in A games, Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's a process of elimination, going the other way," Rodgers said. 
"If that continues, there will be new guys coming into play, and Lorraine is 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although left fielder Eduardo Perez played only two innings before leaving 
Tuesday's game, he said the move was by design to protect his right elbow. "I 
was scared two months ago," he said. "But the three hours a day of 
(rehabilitation) paid off big-time. I feel fine." . . . The Angels took 
advantage of the Mighty Ducks' being in town, ordering 30 tickets for Tuesday 
night's game. . . . First baseman J.T. Snow put in full day's work, playing 
every inning of each the A and B games. . . . Rod Correia, vying for a utility 
infield job, continues his impressive spring. He went two for two and scored 
three runs in the B game. . . . The lanky veteran playing first base for the 
Brewers in the B game was Von Hayes, who was released by the Angels in 1992 but 
is trying to make a comeback. BOB NIGHTENGALE

CAMPBELL HALL'S BIG GUYS HANG ON IN OVERTIME; DIVISION V BOYS: WITH ONLY ONE 
STARTER TALLER THAN 6 FEET, VINCENT MEMORIAL FORCES VIKINGS TO SCRAMBLE FOR 
68-61 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Campbell Hall High basketball team walked out for the opening tip-off 
Tuesday night, it looked like 6-foot-10 Viking center Alex Lopez would have an 
easy time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single starter on Calexico Vincent Memorial stood over 6-foot-2. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Lopez scored six points in the opening minutes of the Division V 
Southern California regional first round, the Vikings were primed for a 
blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 But late in the first quarter, Vincent Memorial center Paulo Wanchope began to 
score and wouldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 What looked to be a blowout changed thanks to Wanchope, who scored 43 points 
to single-handedly keep the Scots in the game until Campbell Hall was finally 
able to pull away with a 68-61 overtime win. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, events such as guard Damon Glymph returning after a seven-game 
injury absence hitting the winning basket in overtime was dwarfed by Wanchope, 
an exchange student from Costa Rica spending his second year in the United 
States and only his fourth year playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanchope wasn't intimidated by the presence of Lopez, whose 17 points and five 
blocks kept Campbell Hall in the game for three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of him," Wanchope said through an interpreter. "I just 
played a very good game." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanchope, a senior, has not selected a college yet, but is being recruited by 
the likes of Cincinnati and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall players came away bewildered by Wanchope. Viking Coach Jon 
Palarz used a variety of players to guard Wanchope, who was too big for guard 
Harold Sylvester and too quick for Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw they had only one 6-foot guy and figured we would have them pretty 
easily," Campbell Hall forward Simeon Woodall said. "(Wanchope) was just 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Wanchope, who also had 13 rebounds and seven steals, the Scots (18-11) 
took the lead early in the second quarter after Lopez picked up his second 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodall scored eight of his team-high 18 points in the fourth quarter to give 
the Vikings a 56-53 lead with 1:42 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Melvin Rios free throw and two free throws by Wanchope pushed the game 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Sylvester opened overtime with a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scots rallied to tie the score, setting the stage for Glymph. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking his first shot of the game, Glymph buried a three-pointer with 1:45 to 
play, giving Campbell Hall (24-8) a 62-59 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all confidence," Glymph said. "I hesitated for about a half-second 
then I saw they weren't coming out so I had to take it."

SANTA CLARA BOUNCES BACK, HOUNDS BASSETT, 81-53; DIVISION IV BOYS: SAINTS COME 
BACK WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE AFTER LOSING IN SOUTHERN SECTION FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Clara High boys' basketball team, a bridesmaid in last week's 
Southern Section tournament, probably wouldn't have watched anyway. The team 
the Saints would need to beat to spark a new postseason dream was right before 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Clara's players didn't bother to lift their heads as they dejectedly 
filed out of UC Irvine's Bren Events Center while the Bassett Olympians were 
running and gunning to a Division IV-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw them warming up a little, but we just went back to our hotel," said 
Santa Clara forward Damian Cantrell, whose career-high 37 points weren't enough 
to shoot down Verbum Dei in the division IV-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints didn't need to watch anybody else. They just needed to find 
themselves, which they did Tuesday inside Bassett's noisy gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara routed the host Olympians, 81-53, as Cantrell matched his career 
high with another 37 points. The Saints (20-8) outscored Bassett, 50-26, in the 
second half as Cantrell scored 28 of his points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell no, we didn't need to watch them," Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich 
said. "We prepare for everything. We've got everything in our game plan to 
compensate for the press or whatever they want to throw at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett (16-13), outsized by Santa Clara at every position but center, tried 
to turn the first half into a cat fight. The Olympians led early and kept it 
close at halftime, 31-27, by forcing turnovers and triple-teaming the 6-foot-4 
Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett, its crowd screaming and its small back court players setting a 
breathless pace, jumped out to a 13-8 lead in the first quarter. The Olympians' 
biggest player, 6-foot-5 Robert Henson (21 points), capped the early run with a 
three-pointer from the top of the key after he made a steal at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara, coaxed into 10 turnovers in the first half, scratched back to tie 
it, 13-13, with 1:05 left in the quarter on JeVaughn Baker's three-point shot 
from the wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints built a 21-13 lead with a 15-3 run, but Bassett narrowed the gap to 
one point before trailing by four at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell was nearly boxed, elbowed and pushed out of the game in the opening 
16 minutes while guard Damien Smith kept Santa Clara ahead with eight of his 13 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times in the first half Cantrell tried to dribble for a shot in the low 
post and three times 5-5 guard Johnny Phan stole the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Cvijanovich pulled Cantrell aside and told the senior to play his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to show everybody out there I'm a man," Cantrell said. "He told me 
to overcome my mistakes. Plus, the crowd was talking trash and I thrive off 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell drove for a layup to make it 35-28. He hit a 25-foot three-pointer to 
make it 39-28. He scored six consecutive points for the Saints to make it 
50-36, two coming off a steal and slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell put the game out of reach with 5:17 remaining when he scored a layup 
off an offensive rebound and was fouled by Michael Vega. He made the free throw 
to give the Saints a 57-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Santa Clara players scored, including Damon Gilmer, who had nine points 
off the bench.

REITH GIVES ALEMANY LIFT IN 4TH QUARTER; DIVISION II GIRLS: RESERVE FORWARD 
KEEPS INDIANS UNBEATEN BY SCORING SEVEN POINTS LATE IN 63-53 VICTORY OVER 
ESCONDIDO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspiration can be found in the unlikeliest places, but who would have thought 
to look to Kathy Reith? 
</P>
<P>
 Reith, a seldom-used Alemany High forward filling in for foul-plagued starter 
Zevette Mitchell, scored all seven of her points in the fourth quarter to spark 
the Indians' 63-53 comeback victory over Escondido on Tuesday in the first 
round of the girls' Southern Regional Division II State playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kid brings tears to my eyes," Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. "I 
told her she won the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (29-0) will face Mission Bay, a 59-39 winner over Hemet, Thursday in a 
regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reith's performance in the second half was not one she will soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a listless first half, the Indians were staring a shocking upset 
directly in the face. They trailed the Cougars (26-5) by 10 points midway 
through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Reith, an unassuming junior who is neither tall (5-foot-8) nor a 
particularly good shooter (she banked in a free throw), nor a deft ballhandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've been known for my defense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not known for her playing time. Hearlihy estimated that Reith averaged 
one point a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reith played a game that is the dream of substitutes everywhere. She dived 
for loose balls, made a key steal and threw in a couple of improbable shots, 
generally providing the team with a missing element: inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she kept us all going," center Carly Funicello said. "I wouldn't be 
surprised if she's starting." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be overstating the case, given that Reith entered the game mainly 
because Mitchell picked up her fourth foul early in the fourth quarter. But 
Reith played so hard and so well Mitchell remained on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Reith scored four consecutive points early in the fourth quarter to give 
Alemany a 46-43 lead, and her layup with three minutes to play boosted the 
advantage to 55-47. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Reith answered questions from two reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best," she said. "I feel honored that I'm a key in the game when 
we have so many good players." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unusual. I've never been interviewed before." 
</P>
<P>
 Reith's teammates Samantha Rigley and Kelly McKay also scored seven points 
apiece in the final quarter to each finish with a game-high 19 points. Rigley 
added 14 rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that the Indians needed Reith's hustle and heart was a measure of 
their poor effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're flat," Hearlihy said. "Hopefully, it was a wake-up call."

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: THEY'RE SPAWNING INTEREST AT THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PETE THOMAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring is coming and soon, by the light of the moon, the late-night waves will 
be aglitter with shiny little grunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The silvery smelt-like fish are scheduled to hit the beaches several nights 
this month to do their thing--the females drilling themselves into the wet sand 
to deposit their eggs and the males wrapping around the females to fertilize 
the eggs--before washing back to sea on receding waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the grunion, they won't have much privacy as it is open 
season on the scaly critters, whose first run of the year is scheduled Sunday 
about 9:50 p.m. The fish will show along dark and sandy stretches of beach from 
Santa Barbara into Baja California, starting a little later each night through 
March 16 and then disappearing until the next run March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no limit on catches, but to give the fish a fighting chance against 
the thousands expected to be lying in wait, the Department of Fish and Game has 
imposed a bare-hands-only rule this month. Taking grunion in April and May is 
illegal to allow the fish to spawn undisturbed before the season reopens for 
summertime runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the eggs of grunion are deposited in clusters in the wet sand, incoming 
waves break up the clusters and wash the eggs to sea. In only a few minutes, 
tiny grunion are born and begin to swim the turbulent surf zone. In a year they 
can grow to five inches and in three years can reach seven inches.  
</P>
<P>
 Grunion, however, have a life span of only four years--providing they aren't

 The striped marlin bite off Cabo San Lucas has finally slowed to the point 
where boats are actually getting skunked on some days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fish are still abundant in the Golden Gate area, where it's a 
matter of finding them in a mood to feed. When they are, multiple catches are 
the rule. The Gaviota Fleet reported 65 marlin (55 released) and the Pisces 
Fleet 55 marlin (47 released) in the last week.

 Anglers aren't complaining about any letup, however, as wahoo and dorado have

 How much would you pay to hunt a California desert bighorn sheep? 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California businessman recently spent $110,000 for the opportunity 
at a Foundation for North American Wild Sheep auction in Texas. Neither the 
California Department of Fish and Game nor the Wyoming-based FNAWS would 
release his hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand that you guys have a lot of antis out there," a FNAWS 
spokeswomen said, referring to anti-hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 The tag was one of two special bighorn tags the DFG has authorized for sale at 
fund-raising auctions this year. The money will go toward reintroduction 
programs, disease studies and monitoring of bighorn sheep populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the sole basis for our funding, but it's certainly a large portion 
of it," said Steve Torres, the DFG's bighorn sheep coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 During the same auction in Texas, a Montana Rocky Mountain bighorn tag sold 
for $310,000, the highest price ever paid for a fund-raising big-game tag.

 MISCELLANY--Volunteers can still participate in Sunday's San Gabriel Mountains 
bighorn sheep census. A mandatory orientation meeting is scheduled for Saturday 
at 6:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the Lytle Creek Ranger Station near San 
Bernardino, and a nearby campground will be available for participants. 
Details: (213) 256-0463. . . . The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed 
a regulation that would prohibit lead or zinc sinkers smaller than one inch in 
diameter, saying they pose a risk to waterfowl. A ruling is expected after a 
60-day comment period.

 A mysterious condition called withering syndrome has killed nearly all of 
Southern California's black abalone, and biologists are trying to save the 
species from extinction. Since the condition was discovered off Anacapa and 
Santa Cruz islands in 1986, 99% of black abalone in Channel Islands National 
Park have died. Only the red variety exists in numbers large enough to support 
a commercial harvest, Pete Haaker, a DFG marine biologist, told the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 CALENDAR--The Orange County Boat Show will be held Friday through March 20 at 
Anaheim Stadium. . . . Eagle Claw Fishing Schools will hold a 2 1/2-day session 
at San Martin Island off Baja California March 18-20 aboard the Holiday out of

FISHING REPORT: LARGEMOUTH BASS SEASON BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The largemouth bass spawning season has apparently begun, as the fish are 
moving into the shallows to deposit their eggs. Meanwhile, fishermen are 
pulling in some fatter than average bass. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Ventura County's Lake Casitas and Los Angeles County's Castaic 
Lake are producing the most, but for the first time this season a lunker of a 
largemouth was landed at Irvine Lake, which is known primarily as a trophy 
trout fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 And a rainbow trout is what Moses Vasquez had in mind when he cast a glob of 
Power Bait while fishing near the island at the Orange County Reservoir. But 
when he reeled in his catch, it turned out to be a 10 1/4-pound largemouth, 
which was weighed at the bait shop and released.

CRESCENTA VALLEY'S REMARKABLE RUN ENDS; DIVISION I BOYS: FALCONS NO MATCH FOR 
MATER DEI, 85-54, BUT GOFFREDO EXPRESSES ONLY ADMIRATION FOR HIS PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BIRSCHBACH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley basketball Coach John Goffredo couldn't have been more 
pleased with his team's performance. His Falcons played hard. They hustled and 
didn't quit until the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Falcons, it was still only good enough for an 85-54 loss 
to powerful Mater Dei in the first round of the Southern California regionals 
Tuesday night at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played well, as hard as we can play," said Goffredo. "We were up against 
an excellent team. We have nothing to be embarrassed about. We battled." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ended an emotional season for Crescenta Valley (19-11) that included a 
surprising trip to the Southern Section I-AA final before losing to Long Beach 
Poly last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (32-0), shooting 58% from the field, was in a foul mood after 
beating Huntington Beach Edison by only six points, 65-59, in the I-A final 
Saturday in winning its ninth Southern Section championship in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs began asserting their supremacy midway through the first quarter 
with highly touted freshman forward Schea Cotton scoring 10 points for a 21-13 
Monarch lead. Crescenta Valley could rarely get an open shot inside the 
three-point line and hit on only five of 17 field-goal attempts in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton led all scorers with 29 points and added 15 rebounds. Teammate Shaun 
Jackson pulled down 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei went on a 10-2 run at the start of the second quarter, but Crescenta 
Valley fought back and trailed, 38-28, on Mike Crowder's basket with 36 seconds 
to play in the first half. But the Falcons suffered a blow when center Blake 
Jacobson picked up his fourth foul in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were getting battered on the backboards already when Jacobson 
fouled out with 7:09 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their overall rebounding makes them as good as they are. They have a lot of 
talented players," Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jacobson sidelined, the Monarchs streaked to a 52-32 lead with 4:18 
remaining, but the Falcons put on an 8-2 run and cut the gap to 54-40 on Brock 
Jacobsen's bank shot with 1:18 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cotton put on another impressive display in the fourth quarter, making a 
spectacular two-hand reverse slam for a 68-45 lead with 4:30 left. Cotton 
received a technical for hanging on the rim, but the play was an exclamation 
point for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen led Crescenta Valley with 18 points and Richard O'Neill added 17, 
despite making only four of 15 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei was aided by Clay McKnight with 17 points and Mile Simon and Shaun 
Jackson with 12 apiece.

BUENA SURVIVES LACKLUSTER EFFORT TO DEFEAT VISTA; DIVISION I GIRLS: BULLDOGS 
MAKE ONLY FOUR OF 16 FREE THROWS BUT WIN WHEN PANTHERS MISS LAST 18 SHOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the Vista High girls' basketball team made even one of its final 18 shots 
from the field Tuesday night, Buena High players might be turning in their gear 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena was stone-cold as well, making only two of 12 free throws in the fourth 
quarter and four of 16 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buena survived the sloppy affair, 39-37, and advanced to Thursday's 
semifinals of the Southern Region Division I State playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round victory in front of 2,000 at Vista was an ugly performance by 
both the Southern Section champion Bulldogs (25-2) and the San Diego Section 
champion Panthers (20-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Buena trailed, 37-36, with 3:27 to play and tied the score with 2:39 to play 
on a free throw by Michelle Giordano. The winning basket was a layup made by 
Giordano with 1:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play like we should have," said Buena guard Eboni Conley, who 
scored eight points. "It shouldn't have been that close." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, No. 3-seeded Vista failed to score a field goal in the final 13:32 and 
missed its final 18 shots, including an NBA-range three-point attempt from the 
top of the key with one second to play. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAngela Minter, who will team with Buena's Michelle Giordano at Arizona next 
fall, took that shot, but it only proved to be the last of her 15 consecutive 
misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Minter, a 5-foot-6 guard who came in averaging 22.6 points a game, finished 
with a team-high 14 points, but 10 came in the first quarter when she made five 
of her first six shots. Minter has a sore hamstring, but "I can't use that as 
an excuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan made no excuses for the poor free-throw shooting, but he couldn't 
explain it, either. "We're normally a very good free-throw shooting team," he 
said. "I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano made only one of six free throws, but she scored nine of her 
game-high 21 points in the decisive fourth quarter as the Bulldogs outscored 
the Panthers, 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play our best game, but they're a great defensive team," Giordano 
said. "The way that game was going, back and forth, back and forth, anyone 
could have won it." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Buena's lowest-scoring game since losing to Ventura by the same score 
in a Channel League game in February. Still, it was enough for the Bulldogs to 
earn a date against Lynwood, a 76-37 winner over Bakersfield.

SAILING; CONGRESSIONAL CUP TO BEGIN OFF LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is this the 30th Congressional Cup or musical chairs at the United Nations?  
</P>
<P>
 One of 11 events on sailing's Omega World Match Racing circuit starts at Long 
Beach today with a fleet of 10 skippers representing five countries, but it 
isn't that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Rod Davis, the defending champion and only four-time winner, is 
a dual citizen of the U.S. and New Zealand, but he is representing Australia's 
Southern Cross Yacht Club because he will sail the 1995 America's Cup for John 
Bertrand's One Australia syndicate.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Roy Heiner of the Netherlands will have an all-French crew. 
Heiner has signed to sail the trial boat for Marc Bouet's Yacht Club Antibes 
campaign in the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 A double round-robin of racing is scheduled through Sunday, 11 a.m. daily, on 
a course set near the Belmont Pier. Races may be watched from the pier or from 
the east end of the grassy bluff along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who grew up in Coronado, is the only past winner competing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating this as a training regatta for next year's (America's) Cup," 
Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
 So are Kevin Mahaney of PACT 95, Marc Pajot of Yacht Club de Sete and Neville 
Wittey of Australian Y.C., who recently joined Syd Fischer's America's Cup 
syndicate.  
</P>
<P>
 Other skippers entered are the United Kingdom's 11th-ranked Chris Law, now a 
resident of Australia; No. 12 Peter Isler of San Diego; and locals Steve 
Grillon, Mike Elias and Mark Golison.  
</P>
<P>
 All will sail Catalina 37s designed for tight-course match racing.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: NEWBURY PARK NEVER RUNS OUT OF GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newbury Park High baseball team might as well be going to El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers are playing in the Loara tournament, which is based in Orange 
County. For five games, making about a 160-mile round trip between Newbury Park 
and Orange County, the Panthers will travel about 800 miles. If they drove east 
on Interstate 10 the same distance, they would wind up in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids get to get on a bus and get to know each other," Coach Gary 
Fabricius said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers began playing in the Loara tournament in Fabricius' first season 
eight years ago because they couldn't get into any local tournaments. Because 
of the quality of competition, Fabricius has chosen to return every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, eight years multiplied by 800 miles per year is 6,400 miles. Hmmm.

 Royal soccer player Kelly Adamson, a member of the under-20 national team, 
figured to be one of the area's top players, but the junior striker never 
played a minute for the Highlanders this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Adamson strained the lateral collateral ligament in her left knee 
at an Olympic Development Program camp in Florida. After seven weeks of 
rehabilitation, Adamson returned to practice and strained the anterior cruciate 
ligament in the same knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal advanced to the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals, but Adamson 
was relegated to watching from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have been a part of it," she said. "It was kind of sad." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent examination revealed that her anterior cruciate ligament was still 
too loose to play, so Adamson will undergo arthroscopic surgery next week and 
hopes to return to playing this summer.

 The Hoover baseball team is pretty beat-up despite playing only one scrimmage 
and one game so far. Several players have suffered minor injuries and two 
starters -- center fielder Chris Butler and catcher Ron Pirayoff -- have sore 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is, but we have a lot of soreness," Coach Bob Cooper 
said. "Maybe we've conditioned too hard. We have strains that we never had 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who was injured shortly before the start of the season, will be the 
designated hitter until he can throw. Pirayoff is questionable for two weeks. 
He landed on his shoulder diving for a fly ball in Hoover's 10-4 loss to St.

 If his first outing is any indication, Crescenta Valley senior Jim Parque will 
enjoy a great season. The 5-foot-9, 140-pound left-hander led the Falcons to a 
6-0 victory over La Canada. Parque, who had a 1.88 earned-run average last 
season, allowed no hits and struck out six with one walk in four innings.

 Senior right-hander Garrett Lee finished the game and struck out five. EAST

<P>
 Senior Sam Vizcarra, who had four hits in his first 25 at-bats last season, 
went three for four against San Fernando. And Francisco Dorame, Poly's best 
hitter a year ago, also had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly, which was outscored, 55-8, in its first five games a year ago and 
finished 11-12, is looking much improved. San Fernando has seven returning

 It was Rick Weber's first game as coach of the Birmingham baseball team -- and 
one he isn't likely to soon forget. The Braves faced El Camino Real's Randy 
Wolf, the 1993 City Section 4-A Division pitcher of the year -- and failed 
miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf tossed a one-hitter with five strikeouts and El Camino Real rolled, 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a loss that makes a coach long to be elsewhere. In Weber's case, he 
longed to be back at Buckley, where he had coached for several years.

 "The same day (Birmingham lost to El Camino Real), I saw my old school just 
killed their opponent," said Weber of Buckley's 14-1 victory over Viewpoint.

news: Van Nuys is 2-2.

 Before the season, Burbank Coach Chad Nammack said his team had no power and 
would have to use speed to score runs. Burbank's only long-ball hitter was 
first baseman Shawn Montgomery.

 "He's an all-or-nothing hitter," said Nammack, meaning Montgomery will either 
hit it far or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery's bat made no noise in Burbank's opening game last week, an 8-3 
loss to North Hollywood. But he hit two home runs the next day in the Bulldogs' 
5-4 victory over Verdugo Hills. Montgomery drove in four runs. TRI-VALLEY

 La Reina girls' soccer player Michelle Nuesca finished her high school career 
last week as the school's all-time leading scorer and assist leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive? Consider that the senior midfielder, who amassed 86 goals and 64 
assists in her career, missed an estimated 25% of the team's matches because of 
injuries dating to her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year starter's most recent mishap came on Christmas Eve when she was 
involved in an automobile accident. She suffered torn ligaments in her back and 
neck and received 25 stitches in her right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 She was out of action for a month but has scored 26 goals this season.

 Ankle injuries shortened her junior and sophomore seasons, and she missed 
about a month of her freshman season with pulled ligaments in her back. Around

FOR CHATSWORTH, JUST A BAD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth High baseball Coach Tom Meusborn will now summarize the 
Chancellors' 7-5 loss to Canyon on Tuesday in the final game of pool play in 
the Westside tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did a bad job pitching, a bad job fielding and a bad job hitting," 
he said, though fielding was probably most instrumental in the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Chancellors battled from a 4-0 deficit to take a 5-4 lead in the top 
of the fifth, Canyon had runners at first and second with one out in the bottom 
of the inning. Cowboy third baseman Mike Bench hit a sharp grounder to second 
baseman Josh Rawitch, who let the ball go through his legs. It rolled between 
the right fielder and center fielder and both runners scored, giving Canyon a 
6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys added a run when Bench stole third and scored on catcher Brandon 
Murphy's wild throw. Chatsworth (2-1), The Times' No. 1-ranked team in the 
region, made four errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth still won its pool and advances to the quarterfinals of the 
tournament. The Chancellors will play host to Buena on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Pat McDermott (1-0) picked up the victory in relief for the 
Cowboys (1-1-1). He gave up one run in 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth fell behind, 4-0, but started to come back after Murphy was plowed 
at the plate by Canyon's Rick Harbo in the bottom of the third. Harbo was 
ejected. The Chancellors then raced screaming out of their dugout and had to be 
restrained from fighting by the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
 That emotion carried over into the top of the fourth, when Chatsworth scored 
one run, and the fifth, when Chatsworth scored four more to take the lead. But 
it didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what it's got to take to get us ready to play -- our catcher 
getting knocked out -- then we're not going to win many games," Meusborn said. 
"When we're not ready to play, we are a very average team."

HOSOKAWA PLEADS FOR PATIENCE ON RICE DISPUTE; JAPAN: EMERGENCY IMPORTS HAVE 
INSTEAD LED TO AN ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE AS PANICKY SHOPPERS STRIP STORE SHELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Tuesday pleaded for the nation's patience 
amid a growing uproar over imported rice that may threaten the government's 
ability to keep control of Japan's highly regulated rice market. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency imports of rice to make up for a poor domestic harvest last year 
have instead prompted an artificial shortage, provoking chaos both in 
distribution and at the policy level. There has been panic buying and hoarding 
of domestic varieties since full-scale sales of foreign-domestic blends began 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the controversy reflects consumer unwillingness to buy foreign 
rice, which until now was banned from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a deeper level, the uproar is exposing the irrationality of Japan's 
rice distribution system, which is primarily designed to support rice farmers. 
In the long run, the brouhaha could bode well for imports, especially of 
California rice, a short-grained variety that fits Japanese tastes. Consumer 
dissatisfaction has been aimed mainly at long-grained rice from Thailand, which 
differs in texture and taste from Japanese varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers who may prefer one foreign variety over another cannot pick and 
choose, because the government is making the foreign rice available only in 
blends to avoid having to sell the imported varieties at lower prices that 
would reflect lower consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, consumers had assumed that even though imported rice came onto the 
market, domestic rice would still be readily available. But the government is 
insisting that most domestic rice must be blended with foreign varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 As it attempts to preserve what looks more and more like an unworkable system, 
the government thus finds itself caught in the awkward position of forcing 
consumers to buy foreign rice -- but only at huge markups in price. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, under sharp questioning in Parliament Tuesday, replied with a plea 
for the public's "understanding that until the new crop is in, it is necessary 
to consume a balance of imported rice together with the limited amount of 
domestic rice." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is fostering further growth of an already out-of-control black market 
in rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Black market prices for domestic varieties and California rice are running 40% 
or more above the official price at approved shops, while Thai rice has been 
selling at about half the government price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Agriculture's Food Agency, which theoretically controls all 
rice distribution in Japan, maintains prices at about eight to 10 times the 
world level as a means of supporting rice farmers. Allowing imports to be 
freely priced would destroy this system. So when the government decided it had 
to allow in foreign rice to make up for last year's poor harvest, it also 
decided to take windfall profits on its monopoly imports by setting prices 
close to the level of domestic varieties, which sell for up to $3 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the price incentive to buy foreign rice eliminated, the 
government and officially licensed retail outlets now have little choice but to 
search for ways to force consumers to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, many markets with some supply of domestic rice began selling it 
only if customers also bought a bag of imported rice. Outraged citizens brought 
the practice to the attention of the government's Fair Trade Commission, which 
condemned it as a violation of consumers' freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, however, the Food Agency was taking nearly the opposite position, 
saying that domestic rice could be sold only if it either was mixed with 
imported rice or sold in double packs containing bags of domestic and imported 
rice. 
</P>
<P>
 But these rules apply only to the 70,000 licensed retailers who sell most of 
Japan's rice. Estimates are that this year up to a third of the country's rice 
supply will be distributed through another 200,000 technically illegal outlets, 
ranging from gasoline stations to convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rice black market -- which participants often refer to as a "free 
market" -- gets even bigger, that may do more than just undermine the Food 
Agency's control of rice distribution. A freer sales system could boost 
pressures to offer imported rice to Japanese consumers at prices much closer to 
low world levels. It is no longer clear that the government would have the 
strength or determination to stop such a trend.

MEDIA; BELL ATLANTIC OFFERS ACCESS FOR DEVELOPERS OF SOFTWARE; MULTIMEDIA: PLAN 
IS ONE OF SEVERAL THAT HAVE PUT THE COMPANY IN THE INFO HIGHWAY FAST LANE.

<P>
 Bell Atlantic Corp., despite the collapse of its attempt to merge with 
Tele-Communications Inc., is still paving key portions of the information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Tuesday that it will open its network to software developers 
who want to invent and sell applications. Novell Inc. and Teloquent 
Communications Corp. are its first partners in the third-party software deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is one of several that have put Bell Atlantic in the forefront of the 
evolving industry, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Presumably, this could accelerate innovations for use of the telephone 
networks," said Jim Moore of GeoPartners Inc., consultant to telecommunications 
and computer industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional phone company had planned to hit the so-called information 
superhighway -- a futuristic plan to make electronic information easily 
available via telephone or computer -- with the proposed TCI merger. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $33-billion deal collapsed Feb. 23 after the two sides could not agree 
on a price for TCI, the largest U.S. cable company. The day before, federal 
regulators cut the rates that cable companies could charge their subscribers, 
which reduced TCI's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even without the TCI merger, we have a number of arrows in our quiver," Bell 
Atlantic Chairman Raymond Smith told investment managers a week later. He said, 
however, that new caution will prevent the company from spending where profits 
are not likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic can forge a leading industry presence without a substantial 
capital investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-party development plan, in which software companies can use a Bell 
Atlantic lab to gain access to its Advanced Intelligence Network platform for 
writing software, is one way to do just that, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be software developers from all over the country joining us," 
said John Prisco, vice president of marketing for large business services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our basic strategies are exactly the same -- to build full-service networks, 
to develop and deliver a robust package of value-added services over those 
networks and to expand beyond our regional territory," Smith said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic has made other key moves. It took on more than a minor role in 
the building of a video-based and data-based roadway when it became the only 
regional phone company legally allowed to sell cable TV in its own region. 
</P>
<P>
 It also developed and is testing an interactive multimedia product called 
Stargazer. It has installed fiber-optic lines and advanced switches in most of 
its territory, the mid-Atlantic states from New Jersey to Virginia, including 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very plain, when you look at the number of fiber miles and their 
aggressive upgrades, that Bell Atlantic is one of the most aggressive of the 
regionals," said Robert Rosenberg, president of Insight Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bell Atlantic is not the only Baby Bell laying the information 
superhighway's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 US West Inc. is named by most analysts as the other regional phone company 
leading the interactive multimedia and superhighway construction. US West owns 
25% of the cable TV unit of Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators in Bell Atlantic's region have made life easier than it is for many 
other regional Bells, Rosenberg and other analysts said. These states, in 
particular New Jersey, have favored aggressive spending on network upgrades 
using ratepayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other regionals have laid the groundwork to become powerhouses in wireless 
communications, as has BellSouth Corp., or venture into long-distance telephone 
service, as has Ameritech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco plans to offer very sophisticated 
multimedia services to its regional customers but has not reached into other 
areas.

VALLEY BRIEFING: MEETING OF THE MINDS; TAFT HIGH TEAM SETS SIGHTS ON 4TH STATE 
ACADEMIC DECATHLON TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in two years, nine students from Taft High School in 
Woodland Hills are heading to Stockton to represent the Los Angeles Unified 
School District at the state Academic Decathlon. The team leaves today. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Academic Decathlon began 14 years ago to encourage and reward 
academic excellence by motivating and preparing students through competitive 
events. The competition is made up of 10 events: math, fine arts, economics, 
science, literature, social studies, speech, essay, interview and the Superquiz 
-- an oral portion of the test that resembles a television game show. 
</P>
<P>
 Each high school has a team of nine, three each of A, B and C students, who 
are identified by their grade-point averages. Each student competes in all 10 
subjects and all students take the same tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft, one of more than 40 teams in the state competition, won the district 
championship in December with a record-high score of 50,515 points out of a 
possible 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is no stranger to the spotlight: It took the state title in 1988, 
1989 and 1993. It also won the national Academic Decathlon in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for Taft are: Daniel Berdichevsky, 17; Chris Huie, 17; Michael 
Michrowski, 17; Sheldon Peregrino, 18; Rebecca Rissman, 17; Andrew Salter, 17; 
Kimberly Shapiro, 16; Stephen Shaw, 16; Sage Vaugh, 17. All are seniors except 
for Shaw, a junior.

REWIND: 'FAWLTY TOWERS' HITS NEUROTIC HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Monty Python to "A Fish Called Wanda," John Cleese has specialized in 
portraying the repressed Englishman -- a part of him that he has struggled to 
overcome in his own life, he's said in interviews and in books. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all the emotionally straitjacketed characters he has created, none has 
come so tightly wound, or unraveled as spectacularly, as Basil Fawlty, 
proprietor of a small hotel in the English seaside town of Torquay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers," a BBC series of the '70s that still crops up occasionally on 
public television, is something like the TV equivalent of a train wreck: It's 
hard to tear your eyes away from Basil's self-destruction. To watch "Fawlty 
Towers" is to cringe and laugh at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese made only 12 episodes of the show, six in 1975 and six in 1979. He has 
said that it was simply too much work, with he and then-wife (and co-star) 
Connie Booth taking six weeks to write each episode. That attention to craft is 
evident in the work, a tight blend of broad physical comedy and acerbic verbal 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 episodes are available on video in a boxed set, or on individual tapes 
of three episodes each. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the action, always, stands Cleese, a supernaturally lithe 
physical comedian who also has an unrivaled way with insults. He is by turns 
fawning, with guests he thinks he should impress, and mockingly superior, with 
just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 His best asides are muttered under his breath to domineering wife Sybil, 
played wonderfully by Prunella Scales. Booth is Polly, the hired help who 
offers a bit of near-normalcy amid the lunacy; Andrew Sachs is Manuel, the 
inept but endearing Spanish waiter ("We're awfully sorry. He's from Barcelona," 
is Basil's ever-ready apology for Manuel's gaffes). 
</P>
<P>
 The shows follow a similar pattern: Basil makes a mistake of some kind, and in 
trying to cover it up and save face he merely careens closer and closer to 
complete nervous breakdown. Favorite episodes vary among "Fawlty Towers" fans, 
so here are a couple of personal picks. Overall, however, the series is 
amazingly consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Germans," Basil is left to run the hotel while Sybil undergoes a small 
operation. There is a hilariously sustained comedy sequence as Basil tries to 
organize a fire drill, during which an actual fire breaks out in the kitchen. 
Basil is knocked unconscious trying to fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Dazed from a concussion, he escapes from the hospital and sneaks back to the 
hotel, where he reduces a group of German tourists to tears with inadvertent 
references to World War II. He even does a goose-stepping Hitler imitation 
before being dragged back to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waldorf Salad" sets up an archetypal conflict for Cleese, in which an 
obsequious Basil is cowed by a bullying American tourist. Basil promises to 
deliver a Waldorf salad, even though he has no idea what it is. On the same 
tape is "The Kipper and the Corpse," in which Basil tries to conceal the body 
of a deceased guest, whom he assumes has died from eating the kippers at 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A taste for British humor helps in appreciating "Fawlty Towers." Even armed 
with that, however, there may be a limit to how many episodes one can watch in 
a single sitting. After two shows, for me, the cringes begin to outweigh the 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers" episodes "Communications Problems," "The Anniversary" and 
"Basil the Rat"; "Gourmet Night," "Waldorf Salad" and "The Kipper and the 
Corpse"; "The Builders," "The Wedding Party" and "The Psychiatrist"; "Hotel 
Inspectors," "The Germans" and "A Touch of Class." Each episode is 30 minutes. 
Not Rated.

SCHOOL TEST SCORES; SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments.

 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>

SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>

SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL TEST SCORES; SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores for the Los Angeles Unified School District are reported first; other 
districts are listed by grade level beginning on B5. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Los Angeles Unified School District, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B5 for 
fourth grade, B9 for eighth grade and B10 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a a solid box ( -- -- ). Schools follow 
in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1. Additional stories, B1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Ventura County school districts, first locate the grade you are 
interested in -- fourth, eighth or 10th. Under each grade the schools are 
listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up other districts, begin with the grade level. Turn to B4 for 
fourth grade, B5 for eighth grade and B5 for 10th grade. Districts are listed 
alphabetically by grade and marked with a solid box (*). Schools follow in 
alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may use the GUIDE in the top corner of each page to assist you in 
locating a school. The GUIDE on the left indicates the first entry on the page. 
The GUIDE on the right is the last entry. Each GUIDE lists the grade, district 
and school. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * No comparisons were available for districts. These are noted with a dash ( 
-- ). 
</P>
<P>
 * For some smaller schools, data was insufficient. These are noted with an 
asterisk (*). 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase, or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values, and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized, and undeveloped, or may be vague and 
difficult to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibits little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

 The scores for Maple Elementary in the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
were not available. Its scores are marked with a **. See story, B6, for more 
details. About the Tests 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. For More Information  
</P>

O.C. CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SCORES; SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO 
TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS, was developed by the state 
Department of Education, which released the results to school districts and 
posted them electronically on America OnLine and Compuserve.  
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up scores for your district, begin with the grade level. Turn to B4 
for fourth grade, B6 for eighth grade and B7 for 10th grade. Districts are 
listed alphabetically by grade in reverse type. Schools follow in alphabetical 
order. District totals have been omitted when there was only one school at that 
grade level in the district. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>

 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized and undeveloped, or may be vague and difficult 
to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibit little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise, logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

the Tests 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. 
</P>

O.C. CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SCORES; SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO 
TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS, was developed by the state 
Department of Education, which released the results to school districts and 
posted them electronically on America OnLine and Compuserve.  
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up scores for your district, begin with the grade level. Turn to B4 
for fourth grade, B6 for eighth grade and B7 for 10th grade. Districts are 
listed alphabetically by grade in reverse type. Schools follow in alphabetical 
order. District totals have been omitted when there was only one school at that 
grade level in the district. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized and undeveloped, or may be vague and difficult 
to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibit little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise, logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

the Tests 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. 
</P>

O.C. CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SCORES; SCHOOL TESTS: A GUIDE TO 
TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The performance of California public schools and their students is being 
measured in a new way. Students still take a test given statewide, but there 
are some major differences from past tests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, student work is being compared to new standards in 
reading, writing and math. The standards are intentionally high, and the same 
for all schools -- rich and poor, whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine. They include 
open-ended questions and require students to write their answers. Scoring is 
done by panels of trained teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS, was developed by the state 
Department of Education, which released the results to school districts and 
posted them electronically on America OnLine and Compuserve.  
</P>
<P>
 California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every 
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grader last spring. The first results are being 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 (Main story, A1.) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service, The Times is publishing the results for local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * To look up scores for your district, begin with the grade level. Turn to B4 
for fourth grade, B6 for eighth grade and B7 for 10th grade. Districts are 
listed alphabetically by grade in reverse type. Schools follow in alphabetical 
order. District totals have been omitted when there was only one school at that 
grade level in the district. HOW TO READ THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the school, begin at the center column of the table under the 
category "Score." 
</P>
<P>
 This center column shows the scale (1-6) used to score student performance in 
each subject. Six (6), at the top, indicates the highest level of performance. 
One (1), at the bottom, is the lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at 
the school who achieved each score in three categories: R (reading), W 
(writing) and M (math). 
</P>
<P>
 Read the columns vertically under each category. 
</P>
<P>
 The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to 
similar schools. Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by 
the state Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics 
and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column, it means that fewer than 10 
students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percentages do not necessarily total 100% because of rounding and 
statistical variations. THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to 
score the tests. The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested. 
READING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students demonstrate insight as (they) consider a whole text . . . 
are confident and willing to take risks . . . open to considering and 
developing new ideas; explore complexities in depth; revise their 
interpretations; expand on the possible meanings of a text; connect ideas to 
their own experiences and to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a 
whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new 
ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding; explore 
complexities and expand on the possible meanings; often revise their 
interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text; are 
confident in their interpretation, but have little willingness to take risks . 
. . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences; 
when directed, use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited 
way; identify some general significance or wider application of their 
understanding of a text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students demonstrate a plausible, general understanding of a whole 
text. Make superficial connections among the parts of a text; are safe readers, 
unwilling to take risks, with little tolerance for difficulties; rarely 
question a text, and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or 
superficial; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students demonstrate superficial understanding; may not see a text 
as a whole, tending to focus only on portions; occasionally recognize ideas 
without connecting them; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful 
evaluations of what they have read; and may not read a complete text. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word, 
phrase or title in a text. These readers do not demonstrate any understanding 
of the ideas or experiences offered or developed. Reading at this level is an 
act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing 
coherent meaning. WRITING 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a 
writing assignment. Writing is confident, purposeful, coherent and clearly 
focused, conveying the writer's knowledge, values, insights and clarity of 
thought. Language is clear, distinct, varied and precise. Support ideas with 
appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples, skillfully using a variety of 
sentence structures, committing few if any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment. 
Writing is purposeful, coherent and focused, clearly communicating the writer's 
knowledge, values and thoughts. Establishes an appropriate tone and uses 
effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples. The 
writing employs a variety of sentence structures with few errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment, generally 
communicating the writer's knowledge, values and clarity of thought. Writing is 
appropriately adapted to its audience, purpose and subject; coherent, 
adequately organized and developed, and supported by reasons and examples. Uses 
suitable language and employs some variety of sentence structure. Occasional 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing 
assignment, usually addressing all parts of the task, but having difficulty 
communicating knowledge and values. Writing may contain some insights, but also 
demonstrates confused, superficial or illogical thinking. Writing often limited 
in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple, repetitive sentence 
structures and noticeable errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment. 
Seriously limited in communicating the writer's knowledge and values, and may 
address all or parts of a writing task, but with lapses in coherence. Writing 
is typically brief, disorganized and undeveloped, or may be vague and difficult 
to understand . . . frequent errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment. Extremely 
limited in communicating the knowledge and values, and exhibit little or no 
concept of an audience. The writing is brief, incoherent, disorganized and 
undeveloped, and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in using language. Many 
errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. MATHEMATICS 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 6: Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of 
essential mathematical ideas. Responses meet and often exceed expectations; 
they are consistently correct and complete. . . . Generalizations and 
connections are supported by precise, logical arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 5: Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Responses fully meet expectations; are usually correct and complete . . 
. although sometimes containing minor flaws. Some of the student work contains 
generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 4: Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential 
mathematical ideas, including appropriate representations (for example, words, 
diagrams, graphs, pictures). Responses are usually correct although the work 
may contain flaws. Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools 
and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 3: Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. Some responses are correct; however, gaps in conceptual understanding 
are evident and representations (for example, words, diagrams, graphs, 
pictures) need elaboration.  
</P>
<P>
 * Level 2: Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical 
ideas. While responses are sometimes correct, student work often falls short of 
providing workable solutions. Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Level 1: Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas. Responses show 
little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks. There is little 
correct or appropriate use of tools, techniques or representations.

the Tests 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System became the new method for measuring 
student achievement under a 1991 law. It is designed to compare student work to 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exams in reading, writing and math were given to 1 million students 
in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to 
complete. Students read a passage and answered questions about it, met in small 
groups to clarify their thoughts, then completed a writing task. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two 
open-ended problems and answer a series of questions. 
</P>

O.C. CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SCORES; DISTRICT RANKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new California Learning Assessment System tests in reading, writing and 
math were given to fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders for the first time last 
spring. They were scored against objective achievement standards on a six-level 
scale, with six being the best score. Students' results were not reported 
individually. Rather, the scores were tabulated by school and district. The 
results are given as percentages of students who scored at each of the six 
levels. The following rankings were created by combining the percentages of 
students scoring in the top three levels on all three tests. FOURTH GRADE

 The Roadrunners had high expectations last year after a second-place season, 
but finished last. They should move up this year because of their experience. 
Zuniga batted .282 last year, but the shortstop garnered all-league honors 
because of his terrific glove. He and Ramirez (5-3) will switch off on the 
mound, and Pinedo (1.27 ERA) is the closer. The pitching is also bolstered by 
Eckenwiler and junior varsity standout Tony Torres. Two areas that should be 
improved by another year of maturity are hitting and defense. Mangram expects 
much more consistency throughout the lineup after a season of stranding 
runners--they batted .150 as a team. One player who shouldn't have trouble 
making contact is Mejia (.309), who led the team in hitting as a sophomore. The 
Roadrunners' excellent team speed should make it easier to manufacture runs and 
take advantage of opponents' mistakes.

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / PARIS; HIGH DRAMA, YES, BUT NOT ON RUNWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Expect high drama at a Karl Lagerfeld show. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, though, it had nothing to do with clothes. Well before the lights 
went up on the designer's fall '94 line Monday, a fire door slammed shut and 
water began flooding the showroom lobby. People were trapped for several long 
minutes and rumors circulated about a bomb threat by a women's group protesting 
exploitation of women via fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," protested Jacques Mouclier, president of the French Chambre 
Syndicale, organizer of the shows. Car-exhaust fumes in the underground parking 
lot set off the alarm, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another protest brewed on the other side of the fire door. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fairchild, publisher of the fashion trade newspaper Women's Wear Daily, 
let it be known that he wants no part of the Robert Altman film 
"Pret-a-Porter," on location here. People here fear it will be a fashion 
version of "The Player," the director's cutting commentary on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for Lagerfeld's show to begin, Fairchild stepped in front of the seats 
occupied by the U.S. fashion press. "It's not fair to us," he announced, 
pointing to a notice enclosed in invitations to the Christian Dior show later 
that day. The insert read: You may be featured in some of the shots. Therefore 
your presence during the event tacitly implies your consent to being in this 
film.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what they're going to do," Fairchild continued. "(This) reads 
like a legal thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour agreed. "They're setting us up," she said, 
referring to Altman and company. "Going to the Dior show is to consent to be in 
the movie. So we're not going to Dior." 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, she sent a fax to Dior saying she would attend only if the 
movie lenses were turned in other directions. Fairchild also showed up. Both, 
presumably, were out of camera range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altman is a genius -- I just hope he's doing something positive," said Andre 
Leon Tally, artistic director for Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To those with little at stake, such as newspaper journalists, the Altman crew 
has seemed surprisingly unobtrusive. Some have wondered out loud whether this 
tempest in a cafe au lait cup isn't the fashion industry's way of getting more 
attention. The shows do seem in danger of being overpowered this season. Still, 
Lagerfeld and Dior left an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld's purple, orange and yellow stretch jersey dresses, piled on top of 
each other and over pink tights and stiletto-heeled clear plastic boots, were 
an eyeful. Look for low-priced versions soon in stores such as the Limited and 
Contempo Casuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits and jackets were the best of this show. After several seasons of 
unmatched looks, this was a collection of monochromes. Deep green, wine, navy 
and black short jackets and short skirts, both wide at the hem, gave suits the 
vigor of a double flying trapeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantsuits, rarely seen in this line, were a strong theme. Longer black 
gabardine jackets topped skinny pants that crumpled over thick-heeled shoes. 
Black stretch pants worn with long jackets in gray tweed or solid black had a 
chic, energetic quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dior, designer Gianfranco Ferre, really put on the dog, inspired by 
Altman's cameras no doubt. This collection hasn't looked so young and with-it 
in several years. Black leather minis had silver hardware that resembled 
corsets. Dior showed them with crisp white shirts. Black body wear seemed 
downright ladylike tucked under long, swashbuckling coats. 
</P>
<P>
 A furry pink Angora sweater set trimmed with pearls topped a long black 
chiffon skirt for a sweetly romantic evening look. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, "Pret-a-Porter" cast members Lauren Bacall, Kim Basinger and 
Stephen Rea made like fashion regulars, climbing onto their chairs and hopping 
up on the runway to get backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the stars have been wearing Valentino, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix 
and Calvin Klein. But at Nino Cerruti's show, the press director handed out a 
list of who is wearing his label. Basinger, Tim Robbins, Marcello Mastroianni 
and Forest Whitaker, who plays fashion designer Simone Lowenthal in the movie, 
were on it. And this season's collections will appear in the movie, too, posing 
as Lowenthal originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Costume designer Catherine Leterrier, sitting in the front row, took notes 
when the runway filled up with ankle-length man-tailored coats of pale gray 
worn over deeper gray pin-striped pants and off-white suede Oxfords. Other good 
looks included a beige suede shirt dress with a flared hem, topped by a deep 
gray rib-knit coat, both short. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie bus arrived at Jean Paul Gaultier's show, held in an abandoned train 
depot, and out stepped Sophia Loren in an enormous black hat and dark suit that 
have been her uniform this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her outfit didn't look much like the clothes on the runway. Gaultier's 
trans-Siberian fashion trip led past a folkloric montage of sheepskin jackets 
with fake-fur hoods, silk pajama pants, quilted kimonos, Chinese silk parkas 
and a few of his favorite tartan plaid kilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld crammed his Chloe collection with baby-doll clothes in candy colors. 
Furry sweaters over taffeta apron-skirts, furry sweaters over little lace 
dresses and furry dresses with pink puffy sleeves and bubble skirts were 
clothes to wear to a gooey game of Candyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To get things rolling at her show on Sunday, Vivienne Westwood put a shot of 
cognac on every chair. By the time the event started 1 1/2 hours late, a lot of 
people were ready for another round. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was one show worth waiting for. British-based Westwood is on a 
mission to preserve such English fashion traditions as hand-knit sweaters, 
tartan kilts, tweed suits and aristocratic velvet evening wear. Preserve, but 
not protect. She spins them all on their ear. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, tweed suits had cushions underneath, to give those svelte super 
models fat-lady hips. From gold damask curtain fabric worthy of Windsor Castle 
windows, Westwood cut a long evening skirt with tulip hem, and a matching vest. 
They went over a dress of gingham checks, the sort of fabric once saved for 
kitchen tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-toned plaid suits with velvet collars, pale tartan kilts with huge 
paisley stoles, crocheted roses for trim, and an assortment of royal velvet 
evening dresses fit for a queen all paid tipsy tribute to Westwood's beloved 
old England. 
</P>
<P>
