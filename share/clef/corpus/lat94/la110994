KNICKS PUT IT IN THIRD GEAR TO DEFEAT LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: NEW YORK'S 
43-POINT THIRD QUARTER KEYS RALLY, 117-113. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing made sense. Not the Lakers taking a 20-point lead in the second 
quarter, not Anthony Peeler going from the end of the bench to playing, not 
Elden Campbell going from playing (allegedly) to the end of the bench, and 
certainly not those New York Runnin' Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 So of course the Lakers still had a chance Tuesday night despite trailing the 
defending Eastern Conference champions by six points with 1:20 remaining. They 
even made the Madison Square Garden crowd of 19,763 sweat out the home opener 
until the closing moments, until four free throws in the last 13.4 seconds 
finally gave the Knicks a 117-113 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what it has come to in 1994-95. New York going away from the playbook 
that included three ways to get the power forward into a full nelson on the low 
post to outscoring teams. As if Pat Riley has coached a running team before. 
</P>
<P>
 These Knicks, letting the opponents set the pace, have faced two up-tempo 
teams and gone stride for stride at 78 r.p.m. Friday, they beat Boston, 
120-107, and, after a quirk in the schedule allowed a three-day break after the 
first game for adjustments, they scored 117 against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers loved it at the start, going up, 47-27, with 7:44 left in the first 
half. They still had a double-digit cushion, 57-46, with 38 seconds left in the 
second quarter and went into intermission having forced 11 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the third quarter, and New York showed up. Forty-three points later, 
the Knicks had their biggest period since April 16, 1990, while making 15 of 18 
shots (83.3%) and getting 15 points from John Starks. A 93-90 lead -- their 
usual final score last season -- came with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks took a 110-102 lead and the Lakers were left for dead, but a free 
throw by Cedric Ceballos cut the deficit to 113-110 with 14.6 seconds 
remaining. When Nick Van Exel made his fifth three-pointer en route to a 
game-high 26 points, the Lakers were within 115-113 with 5.1 seconds left. But 
when Starks converted two free throws, the comeback was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to come back," said Ceballos, who had 22 points and 
14 rebounds, eight on the offensive end. "Riley was probably getting on them at 
halftime and during the timeouts. We never thought we could keep running away 
from them. It was the home opener and they were excited. We just wanted to keep 
the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that responsibility belonged to Peeler. After Peeler was not held out 
of a game during his first two years as a pro, Coach Del Harris kept him on the 
sidelines against both Detroit and Milwaukee in favor of Tony Smith and Sedale 
Threatt, even when starter Eddie Jones got in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days into the season, Peeler made his debut and played 19 minutes behind 
Jones. He took only four shots, making one, and scored only six points, but 
seven rebounds helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought A.P. worked hard in practice (Monday)," Harris said. "I wanted to 
give him a chance to play. It had nothing to do with Tony Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 Going without a rebound in 24 minutes the first two games, however, probably 
had something to do with Campbell not getting in at all against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised," he said. "But I knew when I didn't go in the first 
sub, I figured I wasn't going in later."

MORNING BRIEFING: NOT ONLY THAT, BUT FOREMAN WASN'T ALLOWED TO USE A CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every writer worth his salt has his own way of putting George Foreman's feat 
of winning the world heavyweight boxing championship at age 45 into 
perspective. This is how Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post saw it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Folks gushed when Jack Nicklaus won the Masters at 46. And it was a 
tremendous achievement because he did it over four days, and not only did he 
have to beat all the other golfers, he also had to beat his own jitters. But to 
the best of my knowledge -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- nobody was 
hitting golf balls at Nicklaus; Jack didn't have to take a three-wood right in 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreman wasn't only giving away 20 years to Michael Moorer, he had Moorer in 
front of him, punching him in the head! You didn't see George Foreman walking 
around a 20-foot putt to read the slope of the green, and then waiting for 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen great athletes who have done great things at advanced ages. But 
this is unique. So don't give me any blah-blah-blah about George Blanda or 
Nolan Ryan or Robert Parish or Willie Shoemaker." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many players have twice been runner-up for the Heisman 
Trophy? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's money? When Coach Butch Beard of the New Jersey Nets ordered a dress 
code for his players on trips, he announced that anyone who did not conform 
would be fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman showed up for the first charter flight garbed in sweats rather 
than the required sport coat, went to Beard with his checkbook and said, "Why 
don't I get it over with up front and write you a blank check to cover the 
whole season?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone for art? Tonya Harding is looking to touch up her image, not at an ice 
rink but at an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 A show featuring three silk-screened photo images of the figure skater opened 
in Portland with prices ranging from $5,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of brings out a little heart and soul in each picture of me that you 
don't get on TV," she said after arriving at the gallery in a stretch 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise: Dan Marino has been orchestrating last-minute comebacks for the 
Miami Dolphins for so long that Sunday's 22-21 victory over the Indianapolis 
Colts with four seconds remaining was almost expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you do it a number of times, you believe you can do it," Marino said 
after his 28th final-quarter comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That bad? Michael Arace, in the Hartford Courant: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you missed the Michael Jordan retirement ceremony on TNT last week, you 
missed a lot of stilted, scripted commentary from Dean Smith, Sinbad, David 
Stern, Spike Lee, Kelsey Grammer, George Wendt, Craig T. Nelson, Woody 
Harrelson, Bob Knight and a litany of other celebrities. Those who did see the 
show summed it up in this manner: "Sinbad?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimate insult: Maurice Thompson, in a letter to USA Today Baseball Weekly, 
writes: "To even suggest that anyone would go to a replacement game is foolish. 
It would be like watching a whole league of Cubs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Two, Glenn Davis, to Ohio State's Les Horvath in 1944 and Army 
teammate Doc Blanchard in 1945, before getting it in 1946, and Charlie Justice 
of North Carolina, who never won it, in 1948 to Doak Walker of Southern 
Methodist and 1949 to Leon Hart of Notre Dame.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be something new at the NFL and Pacific-10 Conference games in the 
Southland this weekend -- fans. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the Ram-Raider game at Anaheim Stadium a 67,000-plus sellout, 
about 63,000 tickets have been sold for the USC-Arizona game at the Coliseum. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Capacity for the current Coliseum configuration is 68,000, but the covering 
will be removed from additional seats behind the end zones if sales warrant. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest local crowd this season has been 55,385 for the Raider-San Diego 
game Sept. 25. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, bragging rights in Los Angeles, St. Louis and Baltimore will be at 
stake. . . . On Saturday, the right to remain in the Rose Bowl race will be the 
prize. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, Arizona and Oregon all are 5-1 in the conference, but the Ducks have 
beaten the Trojans and Wildcats and even a share of the title would be enough 
to put them in the bowl for the first time since Jan. 1, 1958. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I said before the season that the Pac-10 would be the best conference in the 
nation and I still think so," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. "There are more 
good teams, top to bottom, than anywhere else." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He must be forgetting about the WAC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tomey does acknowledge that the Pac-10 lacks a great team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sports Illustrated thought Arizona would be that team, ranking the Wildcats 
No. 1 and featuring them on the cover of the college preview issue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was crazy because the Wildcats obviously didn't have the offense of a 
national champion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could have played USC early in the year," Tomey said."Their young 
defense was making mistakes, but it isn't anymore." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arizona has been in the Pac-10 race five of the last six Novembers, but is the 
only conference team that never has played in a Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who sat ringside Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas were more 
impressed by the power of George Foreman's right hand that knocked out Michael 
Moorer than those who watched the telecast. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 From the second row, I could almost feel it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This was a 250-pound man with the greatest knockout percentage of any 
heavyweight champion delivering a short, crunching blow flush to the jaw of a 
222-pound opponent who was bent down, leaning in, and distracted by a left jab. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's head snapped back, his eyes were glazed, and his mouth was bleeding. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 It might not quite match Foreman's comeback, but unbeaten featherweight Mike 
Semaza will return to the ring after being sidelined for two years by bad hands 
when he faces John Ramirez on Thursday in an eight-round bout at the Irvine 
Marriott. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Semaza's quick and exciting," says Jackie McCoy, who has managed five world 
champions and now has a two-fighter stable of Semaza and Carlos Hernandez. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-flyweight champion Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez will have the home 
bullring advantage Saturday night during his rubber match against Michael 
Carbajal at the Plaza de Toros in Mexico City. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the same pay-per-view TV card, World Boxing Assn. junior lightweight 
champion Genaro Hernandez of East L.A., who hasn't fought since January because 
of hand surgery, will defend his title against Jimmy Garcia of Colombia. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most underrated sports announcer on network television might be Tom 
Hammond, who anchored NBC's Breeders' Cup coverage. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hammond is knowledgeable no matter the sport, has a wonderful voice, and 
doesn't get carried away with himself. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to the director of ESPN's telecast of the Raider-Kansas City game. 
The numerous close-up shots of Neil Smith, Harvey Williams and others were 
outstanding. On nights like Sunday, it is a pity that ESPN directors aren't 
credited. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A combination to watch at the Hollywood Park autumn meeting that begins today 
-- Eddie Delahoussaye on maidens. He won with 11 of the 32 he rode in the Oak 
Tree meeting at Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The USC men's and women's swimmers will compete against the U.S. national 
teams, featuring Janet Evans, Friday at 3 p.m. at the McDonald's Swim Stadium 
on campus. . . . Are you a hockey fan in need of a fix? The sixth annual Great 
Western Bank Freeze-Out will be be played Nov. 25 and 27 at the Forum. The 
opening games are Notre Dame-Maine and Princeton-Boston University. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is a school in Pennsylvania that is 7-0, but I'm afraid Penn has no 
chance to win a national championship.

 USC punter John Stonehouse has regained the lead in his battle with UCLA's 
Darren Schager for the Pac-10 punting lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Stonehouse, who had a 76-yard kick Saturday at Washington State -- longest in 
the conference this year -- averaged 48.3 yards on eight punts and is the 
Pac-10 leader at 43.7.

Washington State last Saturday, had gone up to 67.5%. In fact, his percentage 
actually fell slightly, from 68.2%. EARL GUSTKEY

 It was players' day off at Rams Park, but running back Jerome Bettis was there 
working hardto build up his battered shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Mondays I'm usually too sore to get a good workout in and here I am, a 
single guy, 22 years old and what am I going to be doing on an off day?" Bettis 
said."This is better than sleeping until 3. When you have a family, it's 
different. Then I can see where you would be spending time with Junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting these workouts in makes a difference. All that pounding loosens up 
your shoulders, and the stronger you can keep them the better off you're going 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Clausen, Ram conditioning coordinator, was wearing one of Bettis' "2,000 
yards or bust" T-shirts. An observer noted that it probably should instead 
read, "1,000 yards if I'mlucky." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be rough to get 2,000 yards, but that's the goal I set," said 
Bettis, who has gained 814 yards in a league-leading 233 carries. "That's the 
goal I will continue to set, and believe me, I'll get there some day." T.J.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the beginning of a week of preparation to play UCLA, and Arizona State 
Coach Bruce Snyder decided his team needed a talk about perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting ready for a game between two 3-6 teams in November seemed to demand 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I said to my team and I really mean it," Snyder said Tuesday. 
"When I'm asked how am I doing, I say I'm doing fine. When I'm asked how my 
team is doing, I say they're doing fine. I say it for this reason: I signed up 
to be a college coach in the Pac-10, and that's what I'm doing, and I have a 
game this weekend and it's on national TV. Now, if that doesn't make everything 
OK, I don't know what does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, in terms of the team, I asked them, 'How many of you guys would stop 
playing college football if the bowl system was outlawed? If you only play 11 
games and you're done, how many of you would quit? None of you would. It's 
because you are football players. You're doing what you like to do. We're 
playing for pride, for the love of the game -- really for the original purpose 
why the game created.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Think it will work? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Snyder said, "you know when you talk, they say that only 10% of the 
people hear 10% of what you said."

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: TOURNAMENT BENEFITS CHILDREN AND CANCER CENTER

 Mike Grzanich had nearly finished a song and the proud crowd at Cabo San 
Lucas' Hacienda Hotel was in the middle of dinner when 11-year-old Rosie 
Aguilar walked in with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 There was immediate silence, then loud applause. And there were tears 
streaming down Grzanich's face for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 And, many in the banquet room believed, Pete Lopiccola was looking down from 
the heavens, wearing the soft smile that endeared him to so many in his short 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The night was in Lopiccola's honor. It was in honor of people like Aguilar, 
too, who recently "went from a caterpillar to a butterfly," according to 
Grzanich, owner of Cabo's Latitude 22+. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopiccola, a respected fisherman and skipper from San Diego who spent much of 
his time in Cabo San Lucas, died in 1988 after a short battle with leukemia. 
News of his death came as a shock because he had refused treatment while 
keeping his illness a secret so as not to "disturb" family and friends.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 attended his burial at sea, at which time they vowed to fight 
the disease that stole his life two days short of his 30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Pete's sake," one mourner remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pete Lopiccola Memorial Fishing Tournament was born, and the all-charity 
event has been growing ever since. A record $125,000 was raised at the event 
last weekend, and will increase when the UC San Diego Cancer Center receives 
its donation and matches that amount later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 So great has the support been among Lopiccola's former friends -- many of them 
well-to-do yacht owners and fishermen -- that the Pete Lopiccola Leukemia 
Research Foundation is only one benefactor. A fund was also set up to help 
disadvantaged Mexicans, such as Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 A slender, shy child with big brown eyes, Aguilar was afflicted with a strange 
illness when she was only 3 months old. One leg was eventually amputated near 
the hip and part of the muscle in her other leg was removed. For the next 10 
years her muscles withered so badly that she could barely pick up a matchbook.  
</P>
<P>
 Tournament volunteers came to her rescue last year. They had her flown to San 
Diego and fitted with a prosthesis. She wore a constant grin when given a 
guided tour of Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
 Her muscles have since responded to her increased activity and she is getting 
around nicely, although she was a little late for this year's awards banquet at 
the beachfront resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a way, she was just in time.

 Randy Dewing of Carson City, Nev., won first place in the catch-and-release 
category for releasing the most marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the kill portion of the tournament went to angler Robert Buie 
of Rancho Santa Fe, who caught a 498 1/2-pound blue marlin aboard the Sea Call. 
Buie also finished fourth in the release portion.

 The largest largemouth in captivity lives on . . . but in memory only.

 The International Game Fish Assn. has reported the passing of Ethel the bass, 
at 19, in a Springfield, Mo., aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel was 11 when caught in Lake Fork, Tex. She was transported to Missouri's 
Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lived to twice her normal life expectancy in the pampered luxury of the 
aquarium, where she greeted more than 20 million visitors," the IGFA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel was 28 inches long and weighed a little more than 20 pounds when she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is survived by her relatives: 17-pound Wanda Bass, 16 1/2-pound Gerty 
Bass and 15-pound Lily Bass," the IGFA added.

 The battle between hunting groups and animal-rights activists sometimes gets a 
little silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoting "National Farm Animal Awareness Week," the Humane Society of the 
United States said, "Some cows love the music of Elvis and produce more milk 
when listening to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, which wages a constant war with 
"antis" in the courts, replied: "Perhaps. Although one might guess their taste 
would run to Meatloaf."

FISHING REPORT: FORGET ABOUT OTHERS, LOOK FOR COLD-WATER LUNKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Eastern Sierra trout season has ended, but Southern California's is only 
beginning, as the state is finally beginning to stock local waters with the 
cold-water fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Best bet is Irvine Lake, where a private plant of trophy-sized rainbow and 
German brown trout has anglers supplied with Power Bait pulling out lunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Hernandez of Harbor City took the biggest to date, a 12-pound 8-ounce 
rainbow from the lake's west shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona Lake figures to compete, however. Truckloads of trout -- 7,500 pounds 
worth -- will be dumped into the tiny lake this week in preparation for 
Friday's opener.

 Advocating Children's TV: A coalition of educational and child-advocacy groups 
is meeting with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt in 
Washington today to urge that the FCC strengthen its guidelines for 
implementing the Children's Television Act of 1991. "Under the current 
guidelines, broadcasters have been able to count 'The Jetsons' and 'The 
Flintstones' as 'educational programming,' " said Jeff Chester, executive 
director of the Center for Media Education, which organized the coalition. 
"We're calling on the FCC to champion the needs of children." Among other 
guidelines, the coalition is calling for at least one hour per day of 
specifically designed educational and informational programming on all TV 
stations. Broadcasters are lobbying against strengthening the FCC guidelines, 
which were issued in compliance with the congressional act.

 'Turning Point' Off Schedule: ABC News announced Tuesday that it would take 
its newsmagazine, "Turning Point," off the weekly schedule in January. Instead, 
the program, which is hosted by Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer, will become a 
series of specials, with at least six editions slated for 1995. The network, 
which was to have moved the Wednesday night newsmagazine to Mondays after the 
end of Monday Night Football, instead will bring back the weekly "ABC Monday 
Night Movie," dropping plans to have "Turning Point" follow a proposed new 
dramatic series, "The Marshal."

 Switching Stations?: Jerry Dunphy, the 73-year-old dean of local television 
broadcasters who has spearheaded Disney-owned KCAL Channel 9's expanded news 
operation since its inception in 1989, might soon jump ship. KCBS Channel 2, 
the station where Dunphy first made his reputation nearly 35 years ago, is 
reportedly interested in luring the anchor back. A KCAL spokeswoman said that 
station management was not surprised that other news operations were interested 
in Dunphy and that KCAL was currently "in discussions" to retain the services 
of its 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. anchorman. Dunphy's five-year contract with the 
station, which pays him about $1 million annually, expires this year.

 Echoing the Headlines: Producers say it's only a coincidence, but tonight's 
installment of NBC's "Law & Order" echoes the real-life case of Susan Smith, 
the South Carolina mother who's accused of killing her two sons. The 
long-planned episode is about Waneta Hoyt, an upstate New York woman accused of 
smothering her five children to death and then blaming crib death. MOVIES

 Halting 'Passage': A Santa Monica Superior Court judge has slapped a temporary 
restraining order against New Line Cinema and producer Gale Ann Hurd, barring 
the release of the Susan Sarandon movie "Safe Passage" or any new advertising 
for it. The order stems from a lawsuit filed last month by producer Dan 
Lupovitz, who claims he was ousted from the film after spending six months as 
its executive producer. Lupovitz, who says he brought Sarandon and director 
Robert Ackerman to the project, is seeking punitive damages against New Line 
and Hurd, as well as on-screen credit as executive producer. A hearing on the 
order will be held Nov. 16. The movie is scheduled to open on Dec. 25.

MUSIC REVIEWS; NEW MUSIC GROUP OPENS '94-95 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A smorgasbord of recent music is what we have come to expect at every outing 
of the New Music Group of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is exactly what the Group delivered, at its 1994-95 season opening, 
Monday night in Japan America Theatre: new works by Joan Huang and Nigel 
Osborne, the Los Angeles premiere of a 10-minute piece by Harrison Birtwistle 
and revivals of mid-1980s compositions of Mel Powell and Michael Tippett. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus a bonus: the first Philharmonic appearance, since his appointment, of the 
orchestra's new conducting assistant, Grant Gershon, who led two of these five 
works with aplomb and an admirably quiet and easy authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest items proved the most engaging. Huang's jolly "Tu-Jia Dance," a New 
Music Group commission (from Frances Glover) raises several ghosts, including 
those of Weill and Milhaud and of traditional Chinese music, which Huang 
experienced very personally while working on a farm during the Chinese Cultural 
Revolution of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Huang's aim in this piece, she told her audience before its performance, is 
"simplicity, directness and a cheerful mood." With the help of 13 New Music 
Group players, she achieved her aim, adding to the mix great wit and 
transparent textures. 
</P>
<P>
 Played with projected intensity by cellist Barry Gold, pianist Gloria Cheng 
and clarinetist Lorin Levee, Osborne's dramatic, 19-minute trio, "Sarajevo" 
(1994) became the high point of this event as well as its finale. Adapted from 
Osborne's recent opera/theater piece, which uses war diaries and Bosnian poems 
for text, the piece is not programmatic but grips the listener as if it were. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtwistle's "Ritual Fragment" is, as its title suggests, episodic -- a series 
of overlapping musical events from 14 separate, and separated, players arranged 
in a continuity not unpleasant. It also holds the ear, at least on first 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 One speculates that Powell's "Modules," subtitled "An Intermezzo for Chamber 
Orchestra," is a sendup of many previous pieces (by his colleagues) 
specializing in fragmented serialism and portentous silences. Unlike those 
pieces, however, it is easy to like; and the silences make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center of this two-intermission concert, guest pianist Paul Crossley 
reappeared -- he played at earlier Philharmonic events this season and returns 
tonight in a Debussy program at the Gindi Auditorium -- to play again Tippett's 
Fourth Sonata, which he introduced here in 1985. An engrossing and deeply 
serious work, it did not receive, despite Crossley's long association with the 
composer and his obvious dedication, all the colors and nuances one suspects it 
contains. 
</P>
<P>
 An irritating lightness of touch characterizes Crossley's approach to passage 
work, whether loud or soft. Such ivory-tickling stands in the way of genuine 
articulation of the composer's myriad musical ideas. One color does not fit 
all; this performance seemed to need a greater breadth of keyboard resources.

MUSIC REVIEWS; CANADIAN SOPRANO NIELSEN IMPRESSES AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The song recital is such a delicate yet demanding vehicle that it takes a 
performer of considerable taste and savvy to bring it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian soprano Wendy Nielsen showed that she had the proper tools for the 
task in her impressive Gold Medal recital at Ambassador Auditorium 
Monday.Intelligence showed in the makeup of her program, a wide-ranging affair 
touching on the familiar but mostly exploring lesser-known byways, and in her 
presentation of it: She knew when to turn on the emotive sluices, and when 
enough was enough. She seemed never to rely merely on her pretty voice. 
</P>
<P>
 A pleasant and relaxed stage presence, Nielsen gives a song its due, without 
cheap tricks. With sturdy, involved support from pianist Michael McMahon, there 
wasn't a wasted move in this recital, a steady stream of interesting music. 
</P>
<P>
 Her rich, vibrant soprano, with especially dark and luxurious low and middle 
registers, fluently negotiated the various challenges. After a brief Schubert 
group, Nielsen gave elegant expression to three Liszt/Hugo songs, including an 
airy "S'il est un charmant gazon" and a regal "Enfant, si j'e tais roi." The 
cutesiness of Tchaikovsky's "Behind the window" set her up well for the kill in 
the potentially maudlin "Was I not a little blade of grass?," delivered here 
with genuine impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic and coloristic sensitivity illuminated four well-crafted Dohnanyi 
songs, but enunciation was a problem in English songs by Hoiby, Argento and 
Walton (no texts were provided for these). Arias by Mozart and Catalani brought 
each half to resounding, florid conclusion. Her unusual encores were a comic 
Handelian setting of "Old Mother Hubbard" (by Victor Hely Hutchinson) and a 
Newfoundland folk song. TIMOTHY MANGAN

JAZZ REVIEW; A MUSICAL TRIBUTE TO LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends and family of Leonard Feather gathered at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall on 
Monday night to celebrate the eminent music journalist's life in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial was short on testimonials and long on music. The inherently 
modest Feather would surely have liked that. And, equally fitting, the 
performers all had close professional and personal associations with Feather, 
who died Sept. 22 at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was hosted by KLON disc jockey Chuck Niles and included 
expressions of affection from Quincy Jones, Gerald Wilson and Benny Carter, as 
well as a taped message from George Shearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the brief, powerful performances that best recalled Feather, who 
always preferred to put the music first. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Raney, singing with pianist Alan Broadbent, provided one of the more 
unusual moments with a warm reading of "The Heart You Stole From Me," a pop 
ballad written by Feather in the '30s. Pianist Gerald Wiggins, bassist John 
Clayton and drummer Sherman Ferguson followed with "My Buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Hyman also performed Feather music -- three quirky piano pieces (one, 
interestingly, in 5/4 meter) written in the late '50s for an instrumental jazz 
album. Toshiko Akiyoshi, who flew in from New York specifically to perform at 
the memorial, added a dark, somber rendering of her own "Farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's most dramatic moment arrived when Peggy Lee took the stage, in 
her wheelchair, to honor both Feather and his wife, Jane, who once was Lee's 
roommate. Looking a bit frail, Lee sounded somewhat shaky as she began the 
initial phrases of "The Folks Who Live on the Hill." Gathering strength as she 
continued, still singing with one of the unique vocal timbres in jazz, she 
finished to a hushed pause of silent sharing, followed by a roar of applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps appropriately, since Feather composed a large number of blues songs, 
the program concluded with a typically exuberant set of tunes from Joe 
Williams. Williams started with a delightful, gender-switched version of 
Feather's well-known "Evil Gal Blues" ("Evil Man Blues" in this case). But it 
was his second number, "The Very Thought of You," sung with a gorgeous, a 
cappella verse, that once again offered convincing testimony that he is 
probably the finest male singer in jazz today. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of event that Feather would very likely have given a rave 
review. But, best of all, it was the perfect way to admire his accomplishments 
and respect his memory.

TV REVIEWS; 'BATTLE OF THE BULGE' GIVES GRUNTS THEIR DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Battle of the Bulge," an "American Experience" marking the 50th 
anniversary of a brutal World War II passage, could be subtitled "A Song to the 
American Grunt." As is typical of this classy series, the personal takes 
precedence over the grand sweep of history, the telling small story 
illuminating and clarifying the bigger picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour-and-a-half short "Battle" is filled with reminiscences that give the 
documentary dramatic heft. Lines like "There's nothing out there that has any 
compassion toward me" give added, terrific power to pictures of war that are 
powerful in their own right. Especially poignant are understated expressions 
like "We had been surprised and were in trouble" juxtaposed with scenes of 
beaten, harried troops on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are numbing: Nearly 16,000 Americans were killed and 60,000 were 
wounded or captured when 30 German divisions -- 250,000 men strong -- attacked 
across an 85-mile front on Belgium's Ardennes Forest in an attempt by Adolf 
Hitler to split the Allies and wrest a favorable peace and end to a war he was 
losing. The "bulge" was a 50-mile-long dent the Germans succeeded in putting in 
U.S. lines -- territory that had to be regained at great expense. 
</P>
<P>
 And the G.I.'s had another fierce enemy to worry about as well -- Mother 
Nature, in the form of zero temperatures and blinding snow. "Both the enemy and 
the weather could kill you," recalls one private. "And the two of them together 
was a pretty deadly combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer-writer Thomas Lennon skillfully blends the stories of the troops with 
newsreel and Army footage; host-narrator David McCullough provides his usual 
steady oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the grunts close up the bulge is a testament to courage. You don't 
have to be a military buff to be caught up in this riveting chapter in our 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Battle of the Bulge" airs at 8 tonight on KPBS-TV Channel 15 and at 
8:30 on KCET-TV Channel 28. It also airs at 9 p.m. Friday on KVCR-TV Channel 
24. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

 Pamela Cohen's low-budget "Hope Street" documentary fits nicely into the 
scheme of "Life & Times," the KCET-TV Channel 28 series that taps segments of 
Los Angeles rarely granted exposure on the city's other news and public-affairs 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted and reported by "Life & Times" co-host Ruben Martinez, "Hope Street" 
traces the struggle of Latinos to force a slumlord to upgrade the run-down 
apartment house that they share with rats and roaches.In doing so, with the 
assistance of tenant activists, these people face a wall of government 
bureaucracy in addition to the cruel indifference of the slumlord, who at one 
point in this 1992 case is sentenced by authorities to spend 30 days in one of 
his own crumbly buildings while making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was reported on local TV then, but not from the perspective of the 
tenants, whose message here -- an important one -- is that organized advocacy 
is a powerful weapon for everyone, but especially on behalf of an underclass 
facing seemingly insurmountable odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, despite much of this conflict being on the public record, the 
offending slumlord is neither named nor shown in an identifiable way here, a 
condition he insisted upon in exchange for being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger flaw is the documentary's failure to defog the murkiness it 
creates when a tenant advocate mentions the "rights" of illegal immigrant 
tenants and says that it's "illegal" for slumlords to threaten them with 
exposure if they complain about conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Do undocumented non-citizens have the same tenant rights as citizens? And is 
it really unlawful to report an illegal immigrant under the above 
circumstances? The lack of illumination here is all the more dramatic given 
California's enduring divisive debate over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hope Street" airs at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

THEATER REVIEW; 'HOLLYWOOD HONEYMOON': A GAY FARCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many farces, a man schemes to bed his mistress, but the plot gets in the 
way. In "Hollywood Honeymoon," Tom Jacobson's new farce at Celebration Theatre 
in Hollywood, the hero does everything he can to avoid sex -- with a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Warr Acres (Colin Gray), action star, has a pathological fear of female 
breasts. This could spell trouble for his macho image, as would his affair with 
a male publicist. What he needs is a good cover, which comes in the form of 
marriage to Fionna Keane (Ericka Klein), a lesbian British actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson has chosen an apt target. Even now, 25 years into the gay rights 
movement, one senses a noxious hypocrisy when it comes to homosexuality in show 
business. How many celebrities, gay and bisexual, have toasted their mythic 
marriages for the sake of a nice spread in People magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Hollywood Honeymoon" only partly satisfies. Jacobson, a shrewd student of 
the genre, has borrowed the well-known staples from Feydeau and other farceurs: 
manic entrances and exits, mistaken identities, speech impediments, the 
suggestion of illicit sex and the crushing fear of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is set in a cabin in the Sierra Nevadas, where Acres and Keane have 
repaired after their hastily arranged nuptials. In tow are Acres' lover Gene 
Maxwell (Noel Alumit) and Keane's lover Lane Johnson (Coley Sohn). Bent on 
exposing the sham is Armada DeLongpre (Rende Rae Norman), a tabloid-TV host 
looking for a sleazy scandal to boost her ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Antics ensue, some funny, others wan and strained. DeLongpre hires a hustler 
(the guileless Donald Fowler) as bait for Acres, but the kid turns out to be a 
hilariously inept virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a flat beginning and end, the structure is efficient and 
workmanlike. But given such a juicy topic, Jacobson's wit is disappointingly 
mild and mainstream. Too often jokes are cobbled together using gay cliches 
(Judy Garland, "All About Eve"), yielding a smug, provincial tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Schrock directs with amiable, offhand panache, though he would be wise 
to find a way to speed up the action. The cast, meanwhile, seems far too 
tentative, though this too may be corrected before this "Honeymoon" is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hollywood Honeymoon," Celebration Theatre, 7051 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $15-$20.

GIFT FROM AN AGING EX-PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The handwritten public note from Ronald Reagan that he has Alzheimer's disease 
comes as sad news to all Americans, whether or not they agree with his 
conservative political philosophy. The former President has performed a 
singular and courageous service in calling attention to this little understood 
disease of aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as basketball legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson did for AIDS, Reagan has 
opened a window into what was once a matter of family shame. Barring a cure, 
the incidence of Alzheimer's is certain to climb dramatically over the next two 
decades -- because Americans are living longer. Alzheimer's afflicts 5% of 
people over 65 years, 20% over 75 and 47% over 85. So it is hardly surprising 
that Reagan, although still physically vigorous at 83, would be experiencing 
the memory loss and other mental deterioration associated with Alzheimer's. The 
National Institute on Aging estimates that the number of Alzheimer's patients 
will grow from 4 million today to as many as 15 million by the year 2020, 
failing a cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Local offices of the Alzheimer's Assn. around the country have been flooded 
with calls this week. That means the elderly and their families are getting the 
courage to obtain facts and help. First, a reliable diagnosis is essential: A 
number of treatable conditions -- such as certain thyroid ailments, excessive 
use of multiple prescription drugs and depression -- can mimic Alzheimer's. 
True cases of Alzheimer's impose an enormous burden. Families find themselves 
struggling to accept that a perhaps once strong parent can no longer function 
well and trying to find ways to provide sensitive support. 
</P>
<P>
 There is speculation that Reagan was suffering early symptoms when he was 
President. Such speculation is pointless. The more important message is that he 
and his wife, Nancy, have stopped trying to paper over his lapses and had the 
courage to raise awareness of the difficult journey many of us will ultimately 
make into what Reagan called the "sunset" of life.

STILL STRUGGLING ON RECOVERY ROAD; PROGRESS SINCE QUAKE, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center offers a microcosm of recovery in the wake of 
the earthquake that struck Los Angeles nearly 10 months ago. It presents us 
with signs of progress, a tally of what remains to be done and the knowledge 
that we're far from having come all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday one of the mall's anchor stores, The Broadway, opened for the 
first time since the quake. "It's a sign of rebirth," said Marie McGee of 
Reseda, who summed up the let's-move-on feeling of many when she added, "Do you 
know where the curtains are?" However, just three of the mall's 210 shops are 
open; the wait for the rest figures to be at least five months. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is much good news. On Friday, for example, the last broken 
link in the Southern California freeway chain (an interchange on the Golden 
State and Antelope Valley freeways) was finally repaired. Twenty of the 22 Los 
Angeles Public Library branches closed by the quake have reopened. And a Dun & 
Bradstreet analysis says that the earthquake did not cause any increase in the 
rate of business failures. But in the face of all this progress, significant 
problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
 HUGE PRICE TAGS: First came the $350-million repair bill for Cal State 
Northridge, said to be the most ever incurred by a university in a natural 
disaster. Then UCLA weighed in with a $650-million bill. Now officials of the 
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center say they need at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A new emergency room is badly needed at the Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, 
but that won't be built and open until at least 1998 because of the need to 
determine new tolerance designs for the building's steel frame. Experts and 
building officials are yet to come up with new construction standards for 
steel-frame buildings, which were damaged in the temblor although engineers 
believed they would withstand a shaking of that magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 MORE GHOST TOWNS: Earlier the number of post-quake "ghost towns" -- areas 
abandoned by owners and tenants -- was put at 13. Now three have been added to 
the list. The 16th, near La Cienega Boulevard and Corning Street, was named 
just last month. Vagrants, squatters and drug users had taken over. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,150 buildings remain vacant because of the quake, with more than 
12% of them in the ghost towns. As of September, one-fourth of the owners in 
those areas had no apparent plans to rebuild. Of the remainder, one in five had 
yet to make a decision on whether to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the reasons a new study of the rebuilding effort to date is 
badly needed, one that should come with the first anniversary of the quake, if 
not before. Among other things, it should address the question of how much 
housing was lost and how much of it figures to be regained by local and federal 
initiatives. Where do we stand in terms of business losses, and what can be 
done for those still struggling to reopen? We'd love to say that we've put the 
quake and its aftermath behind us. We can't just yet.

THE RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia, many in the West have argued, is a Vietnam waiting to swamp any 
outside power foolish enough to intervene. What too few have recognized is that 
the outside power likeliest to be swamped in a Bosnian Vietnam has always been 
Serbia. During the last week Bosnia began, visibly, to become a Vietnam for 
Serbia as the Bosnian Muslims and Croats scored major victories against the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Vietnam an unwinnable war for the United States was the 
psychologically inescapable fact that the Americans could always leave, while 
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong could not. In Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs have 
Serbia to flee to, the Bosnian Croats have Croatia but the Bosnian Muslims have 
only Bosnia. Lacking any refuge and faced with an enemy intent on "ethnic 
cleansing," the Muslims have no alternative but to fight on. Capitulation, for 
practical purposes, is not an option. 
</P>
<P>
 The British and French have warned that if the new fighting escalates too far, 
they may have to withdraw the troops they have committed to UNPROFOR, the U.N. 
peacekeeping force. They have also warned that withdrawal could follow any 
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 This embargo is what preserved the arms imbalance that enabled the Serbs to 
make their initial bid for a Greater Serbia stretching -- for the first time in 
history -- from the Danube to the Adriatic. As the Muslim-Croat federation in 
Bosnia increasingly receives arms via Croatia, this imbalance is fading. But 
Bosnia's U.N. ambassador said on Nov. 3 that forced to choose between UNPROFOR 
and a lifting of the embargo, Bosnia would choose a lifting of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day, the U.N. General Assembly voted 97 to 0 to lift the embargo. 
The resolution was non-binding, and the Security Council is likely to ignore 
it. But Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was right to 
compare Bosnia to the Ethiopia of the 1930s -- a country that, tragically, was 
denied the right to defend itself. She admonished the United Nations, saying, 
"We cannot allow the Bosnian Serbs to hold this organization hostage." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Security Council refuses to lift the embargo, the United States should 
do so unilaterally -- even as it assists UNPROFOR in its retreat.

S&L FAILURES AND REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Craig Roberts' Column Right ("June Bonds Draw Junk Justice," Oct. 25), 
blaming a federal regulatory law passed in 1989 for the collapse of our savings 
and loans, ignores these incontrovertible facts: Records of the FDIC show that, 
from the 1950s through 1981, our banks and S&Ls failed at an average rate of 10 
or fewer per year. Then came the deluge, and by 1986, the number had grown to 
145: a 14-fold increase.By 1988 it reached 221. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a law passed in 1989 did not cause a debacle that had begun several 
years earlier. Equally obviously, something needed to be done to ensure that 
S&Ls maintained a saner mix of risks in their investment portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 As to Roberts' glowing report on the track record of junk bonds since 
September, 1989, this ignores a multitude of bond issues that had gone into 
default before them. These were a prime cause of the spate of failures noted 
above. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD L. MEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Roberts' concluding paragraph states: "The charges against (Thomas) Speigel 
are the trumped-up charges of a corrupt government desperate to hide its 
responsibility for the collapse of the S&Ls at great taxpayer expense." 
</P>
<P>
 I have trouble with several parts of the above paragraph: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Trumped-up charges" -- I thought under our system we let a court of law 
decide the validity of charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A corrupt government" -- if Roberts has provable evidence of corruption and 
will name names, there are plenty of lawyers who will be happy to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Desperate to hide its responsibility" -- why should the present government 
be desperate to hide anything that was initiated by a prior government?

1994 SMOG SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Air Quality Management District appreciates your article, "Area's Smog 
Year Almost as Clean as Record 1993" (Nov. 1), showing that our region's air 
quality programs are paying off in healthier air for all to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora has demonstrated leadership in showing how local governments can 
contribute to the clean air effort by funding a number of creative programs to 
reduce emissions and promote air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of this commitment, Glendora voluntarily hosts the AQMD monitoring 
station serving the cities of the East San Gabriel Valley. Thus, we at AQMD 
believe it is a disservice to Glendora to single it out as "the nation's smog 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Readings at this monitoring station are representative of air quality levels 
in an area that includes the cities of Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, Bradbury, 
Covina, El Monte, Monrovia, San Dimas, Sierra Madre and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality levels in Glendora and the surrounding area are showing dramatic 
improvement. The only way we at AQMD can continue to document this progress is 
through the continued hospitality of cities like Glendora. Glendora should be 
commended for this contribution to clean air.

SHOTS FIRED AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Tremor of Doom in the Disunited States," Commentary, Nov. 1; 
</P>
<P>
 William Rees-Mogg sees in the recent attacks on the White House a portent of 
American decline. Perhaps, there is a simpler interpretation closer at hand.  
</P>
<P>
 To advance their ambitions, the Republicans and their allies to the right have 
accused the President of crimes ranging from draft dodging to murder. 
Newsletters and syndicated radio programs are devoted to peddling this 
nonsense. The candidate for the Senate from Virginia announces that the 
President and his supporters have stolen the country from good people and he is 
going to rescue it. He goes on to proclaim that he is superior to the law 
because his heart is pure, and politicians, even serious ones, stumble over 
themselves to support him lest they lose the votes of some cretin who has 
mistaken adolescent posing for political argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that someone already disturbed, as those who have attacked 
the White House clearly were, should take this ethical pollution as an 
invitation to violence, should even believe that it is brave and virtuous to 
take potshots at the President? 
</P>
<P>
 EDGAR SCHELL 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * It's maybe a long stretch for Rees-Mogg to equate a seriously deranged 
Colorado man's shooting at the White House with the deterioration of American 
values and economic supremacy in the world. Rees-Mogg is on solid ground when 
he envisions the eventual overtaking of the United States' industrial power by 
other nations -- that's the cyclical nature of the universe: What goes around 
comes around. 
</P>
<P>
 But the accused upholsterer's behavior is evidence of nothing except the 
wild-eyed, hare-brained, makes-no-sense activity of a nut-cake in transition. 
The dishonorably discharged, gun-toting Coloradan is symbolic of only his own 
miserable, frustrated, misspent life. Lord, let's not fancifully make any more 
of it than that.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * I read, with some sense of irony, your headline in reaction to the walk-by 
shooting at the White House, "White House to Weigh Limiting Public's Access" 
(Nov. 1). I wondered how many people who live in South-Central L.A., Beverly 
Hills, Calabasas, or Burbank would like to limit the "public's" access to their 
neighborhoods and homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, we've become accustomed to this type of response from 
Washington and politicians in general. They form a cocoon around themselves, 
shielded from reality and ponder weightier issues like their retirement plans, 
free parking at Washington National Airport, or how many millions of dollars 
they might want to spend on their campaigns. Maybe if they had to live with the 
same "access" issues that the rest of us do, there might be more of a sense of 
urgency in dealing with the issue of crime in this country.

<P>
 From the most depressing election year in recent history emerges one 
undeniable fact: The privately financed campaign is killing democracy in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the money comes from an individual, a corporation, a PAC or a 
candidate's own deep pocket, the result is the same -- "one dollar, one vote" 
replaces "one person, one vote."

 There is one way out of this mess, and one way only: publicly financed

ANGER AT GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Postrel's Column Right ("Voters to Government: Back Off!," Nov. 1) 
makes about as good a case against government-dictated regulations as any right 
column can make -- and it's a very weak case indeed. Postrel writes from the 
point of view of the business community, which is fair enough.But she lets that 
segment of society off a bit too easily.  
</P>
<P>
 What that faction wants of government is more than cutting down on red tape or 
on the number of forms to fill. It's against annoying snoopers poking into meat 
processing plants to check for standards of cleanliness; it's against being 
bugged by pesky intruders who claim it's not nice to dump poisonous byproducts 
in the nearest river, or fill the skies with noxious fumes emanating from 
smokestacks. In short, it considers regulations to ensure the health and safety 
of the public as "government harassment"! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Virginia, there are people who want freedom from regulations that would 
put a crimp into profits, which is like asking for year-round Christmas.

WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING?; CHRISTOPHER: THE SECRETARY'S LONG-VIEW APPROACH IS 
ALIEN TO WASHINGTON, BUT IT'S GAINING GROUND FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

undergraduate course in ethics and the news media at UCLA.

 Warren Christopher, the erudite Los Angeles lawyer whom President Clinton 
appointed his secretary of state two years ago, sometimes seems as comfortable 
with difficulty as he does with comfort, as if the only time he feels truly 
alive is when he is resting uneasily on a bed of nails. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly was what he got when he led the commission investigating the 
Los Angeles Police Department in 1991. And that's what he now has in his latest 
reincarnation: For it's hard to imagine that this ordinarily spectacular job 
has turned out to be everything he had ever dreamed of. The Cold War terminated 
the domestic U.S. consensus on foreign policy, and until very recently the 
President hardly seemed even to care that much about the world at large or the 
U.S. role in it. And then there came the inevitable foreign-policy setbacks -- 
and yet this man is still smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a smiling Christopher is what I found last week when we chatted in his 
seventh-floor office at the State Department. And this is the very man who 
Beltway bards predict won't hold his job much longer. Is that why he smiles -- 
because he'll be coming home soon? 
</P>
<P>
 After just two days visiting the nation's capital, I could see why returning 
to Los Angeles would look so appealing. There's a nastiness in Washington, a 
meanness that rises in the morning and doesn't set until long after sundown.  
</P>
<P>
 If Christopher does manage to escape from Washington without getting sucked 
into the swamp, he aims to defy political gravity. He has been pilloried in the 
press, ignored by the President, insulted by the Chinese in Beijing and 
underestimated by foe and friend alike. But cream does rise, and in the last 
few months, what with the seeming success in Haiti and Kuwait, U.S. foreign 
policy doesn't look nearly as inept as it did just a year ago. But worries 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 * The need for instant gratification: The CNN factor, as it is termed, 
obviously perturbs Christopher, an elegant man who seems to have been baptized 
while swathed in a pin-striped blue suit. Successful diplomacy, in his view, is 
never a dramatic home run but a succession of singles. Plodding patience, 
gritty determination and precise prioritization are essential. He feels that 
too many operators in Washington lack the requisite inner security to be 
effective, to ward off the constant, instant-feeding needs of the media and the 
common human urge for instant gratification. One senses that he thinks that 
both the nation and the Clinton Administration suffer as a result and that 
basing a foreign policy on what foreign-policy pictures CNN shows will fail, 
because no foreign policy can be successful unless it's sustained by public 
support.  
</P>
<P>
 * The need for more resources: Christopher feels hemmed in by the zero-sum 
game on Capitol Hill that limits America's ability to be influential. One 
imagines that he looks back on previous secretaries of state who not only went 
traveling with the backing of the big stick of the American military but also 
the big checkbook of the U.S. Treasury. He also appears to worry that too many 
people in the State Department are living in the past, when there seemed to be 
at least some money for almost any good idea. Those days are gone; there's a 
lot less money, and the need now is for select priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The need for better Foreign Service education: If our training of Foreign 
Service officers is too traditional, too unimaginative, he suggests, our 
foreign representation will suffer accordingly. Midcareer training to freshen 
State Department and Foreign Service officers is helpful, but the secretary 
worries about basic university training. Many of the new problems in 
international relations have little or no geographic content, he points out, 
and very few of them can be dealt with bilaterally. And yet the State 
Department, though now starting to reorganize, is still largely dominated by 
geographic bureaus; the emphasis remains on bilateral diplomacy. Thus American 
diplomacy must figure out how to relate to multilateral institutions and must 
emphasize powerful but often complex economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
 * The need for presidential involvement: Christopher tends to talk in 
purposeful generalities and doggedly neutral language, but does seem relieved 
that U.S. foreign policy is now starting to hit its stride. He notes that the 
President is spending more time than ever on foreign issues these days and that 
Clinton is more comfortable than ever with the issues and suddenly more 
decisive about them. When I posited the general theorem that all major 
foreign-policy decisions are presidential ones and that unless the President is 
personally focused on foreign policy, bad things happen, the secretary of state 
didn't disagree.

ARE YOU DOUBTING THOMAS?; HAVING USED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO REACH THE TOP, THE 
JUSTICE WOULD PULL UP THE ROPE AND DARE OTHERS TO FOLLOW HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas attended a roundtable discussion 
recently with a small, carefully chosen group of black men and women, he 
startled his select audience with this pronouncement: "I am not an Uncle Tom." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken literally, he's absolutely right. Uncle Tom, you'll remember, was the 
dear and faithful servant to Little Eva's family in Harriet Beecher Stowe's 
abolitionist novel, "Uncle Tom's Cabin." When one considers his character's 
portrayal, there is one huge and salient difference between Uncle Tom and 
Thomas: Uncle Tom loved his own people. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his body was owned by white folks, Uncle Tom's soul was also 
always mindful of the community from which he came. With the limited resources 
at his disposal, he did what he could to protect and nurture the members of 
that community. The same, alas, cannot be said of Thomas. And his powers are 
considerably greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern definition of Uncle Tom is hardly complimentary; it means a black 
person whose primary concern is being well thought-of by white people, often to 
the detriment of himself and other blacks. And in that sense, the good 
justice's assertion that he is not an Uncle Tom will probably be recorded in 
the annals of contemporary American history -- on the same page with Richard 
Nixon's "I am not a crook" disclaimer.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas received his opportunities for undergraduate and graduate educations 
because he was black and qualified and because the law recognized that not so 
long ago, institutions such as his alma maters (Holy Cross and Yale Law) often 
overlooked bright students of color because there was no penalty attached to 
excluding them. He was, in fact, a beneficiary of the same affirmative-action 
programs he sneers should be eradicated today. How ironic that his present job 
is exactly the result of the affirmative action that nobody, including most 
African Americans, wants: the window-dressing affirmative action that gave the 
policy such a bad reputation for so many Americans. It has since been 
demonstrated that there were other, more distinguished, thoughtful, 
conservative judges than Thomas who also happened to be black, and who would 
have made better choices for a seat on the Supreme Court -- a position usually 
seen as the capstone to a stellar career. The Bush Administration, apparently, 
preferred a black justice who could be counted upon to be indifferent, even 
hostile to black people. It chose well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas draws on his own impoverished childhood and early adolescence to credit 
his stringent self-reliance and reasons that if he can transcend such 
formidable barriers, so, too, should most other blacks. Evidently, the court's 
highest-profile justice is laboring under the delusion that his accomplishments 
are solely attributable to his own efforts and that the sacrifices of his 
ancestors and support of his community count for naught. Using affirmative 
action as his rope, he has scaled a wall, then pulled the 
</P>
<P>
 rope up after him. He now taunts others to try to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed strange how the same circumstances can shape two men so 
differently. Across the country, at about the same times Justice Thomas was 
struggling in Pin Point, Ga., Charles Ogletree was working in the produce 
fields of Northern California, helping his migrant-farmer parents pick crops. 
He attended public schools, entered Stanford University (quite possibly because 
given the then-new affirmative-action policies, the school was more inclined to 
diversify its student body), graduated Phi Beta Kappa and went on to receive a 
master's from Stanford and a law degree from Harvard. Today, he teaches 
constitutional law and social ethics at Harvard Law School. Like Thomas, he has 
scaled walls that at times seemed insurmountable. But unlike Thomas, Ogletree 
took the time to retain the rope, fashion of it a ladder, throw it over the 
wall and, via mentoring and extensive community service, encourage others to 
follow.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas told those assembled that he planned to be around for another 40 years; 
if they didn't like that, he snapped, they should "get over it." I only hope 
that Ogletree's life will be as long and as healthy, and that the many people 
whom he has helped to scale the walls to reach prominence in the legal and 
other professions will provide a potent antidote to our only black justice's 
poisonous self-hatred.

...GET OVER IT; TRY TO CHANGE HIS MIND, SURE, BUT STOP VILIFYING THE JUSTICE 
FOR ADHERING TO HIS VIEW THROUGH A 'COLORLESS PRISM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES WRIGHT, James Wright is the Capitol Hill correspondent for the 
Washington Afro-American newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was invited, along with 30 others, to a private meeting with Supreme 
Court Justice Clarence Thomas, I did not hesitate to say yes. I had been 
offered the opportunity to talk with a man whose opinions will affect the lives 
of generations of Americans. Thomas has been controversial since he was 
appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bush in 1991. Few Americans don't 
know about his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
when he endured subtle insults from such liberals as Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
and Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and answered asinine questions about his 
relationship with Anita Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the protests of black leaders, many blacks supported Thomas, feeling 
he would change with a lifetime job and a chance to truly express himself as a 
black man, without fear of retribution. But Thomas' tenure has been a 
disappointment. He has consistently toed the conservative line on voting 
rights, affirmative action and capital punishment. A strict constructionist, he 
has followed Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia in 
interpreting the Constitution by the letter rather than by the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 I am saddened by the possibility that Thomas may not be in the tradition of 
such men as the late Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Harry Blackmun or even 
his colleague on the bench, Justice David Souter, all of whom have shown that 
they will rule on progressive principles, regardless of who appointed them or 
of their individual backgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas' rulings, writings and speeches have led many to question whether 
he feels any responsibility to help those who have been oppressed by our 
country's legacy of racism, sexism and classism. Or whether he has forgotten 
that he is black. These were the questions that I wanted to ask Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 When he walked into the Supreme Court conference room, Thomas seemed genuinely 
glad to see us. He walked around the room and quietly introduced himself. He 
gave us a brief introduction to the court, talking about its apolitical nature 
and polite manner of conduct. Justices, he told us, never raise their voices 
with one another, even when they sharply disagree. And, he said, the justices 
rarely interact because of their overwhelming workload; their only regular 
meetings are for 15-minute lunches every two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time for questions. "Justice Thomas," I asked, "how do you respond 
to those who say that you are an Uncle Tom and a sellout to whites?" He glared 
at me. "I don't pay attention to that nonsense," he said. "Why is it that when 
blacks become successful, they cease to become black? If a white person becomes 
successful, does he stop being white? One of the problems of black people is 
that we do not allow differing views among our people."  
</P>
<P>
 Radio talk show host Ernest White asked Thomas whether he understands that his 
decisions affect the lives of black people. Thomas replied that he views his 
job through a colorless prism. He cited Justice John Harlan's dissent in the 
infamous Plessy vs. Ferguson decision, which legalized segregation, which 
called the Constitution "colorblind."  
</P>
<P>
 One bold questioner wanted to know if and when Thomas would step down. His 
reply was pointed: "I am going to be here for the next 40 years. For those who 
don't like it, get over it." He said his grandfather was his primary role 
model, and Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass were the thinkers who 
influenced him most. He bemoaned the fact that blacks do not openly debate the 
issues of the day in barbershops, over checkerboards or at Sunday evening 
dinners, as was the case 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I met Thomas, I had the impression that he was bitter, mean-spirited 
and hardheaded. I left the meeting in awe of the man, charmed by his good humor 
and willingness to listen to our concerns. While it does not appear that our 
appeals will cause him to reconsider his conservative philosophy, most people 
were satisfied that he is open to other ideas. I feel that he recognizes his 
obligation as a role model, but views life and the judiciary differently than 
most blacks do. It would seem that he is open to persuasion on any matter, as 
long as it is communicated through professional channels, such as letters or 
newspaper columns. It seems clear that name-calling and insults will only 
encourage his view that honest dialogue is not possible in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, even though I don't like his judicial philosophy, I like 
Thomas as a person. People who disagree with Thomas should listen to what he is 
saying and not dismiss him as a "sellout." They should continue an honest 
debate and try to persuade him that a kinder, gentler interpretation of the 
Constitution is in the best interest of all Americans, regardless or race, sex 
or religion.  
</P>
<P>
 It's time for those of us who disagree with Thomas to "get over it" and move 
on.

 L.A. -- the world's largest movie lot: When she was a high school teacher, 
Jackie Goldberg used to treat the kids in her Los Feliz neighborhood to outdoor 
movies during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hang up a couple of sheets on this little patch of grass near where I 
lived and run a huge extension cord from my apartment down to the park," 
recalled Goldberg, now a city councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, she rented the 1932 classic, "The Music Box," in which poor Laurel 
and Hardy struggle to lug a piano up a concrete stairway. Goldberg had never 
seen the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were watching it, and we noticed a median strip that looked like the one 
that separates the east and west sides of Vendome (Street) nearby," she said. 
"But, we figured there are a lot of medians. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we saw the corner of the building where I lived in the movie. Everyone 
started hollering and cheering. It looked like they were moving this piano into 
my apartment! We must have played that movie six times that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about changes of venue!It sometimes seems as though O.J. Simpson attorney 
Robert Shapiro has been subpoenaed to every gathering in town. Over the last 
few months, we've come across these mentions of him: 
</P>

 * At a Beverly Hilton tribute to producer Kathleen Kennedy emceed by Whoopi 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a book party for Motown Records founder Berry Gordy at the Beverly Hills 
home of Norman Brokaw, the chairman of William Morris.

<P>
 * At the Rose Bowl, taking in a Rolling Stones concert. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Beverly Hilton charity auction emceed by Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the courtroom -- yes, he's often there during daytime hours -- where he 
was admonished by Judge Lance Ito for receiving a call on his cellular phone, 
reportedly from talk-show host Larry King. 
</P>
<P>
 * At lunch in West Hollywood's Eclipse with CBS anchorwoman Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>

Variety's Army Archerd.  
</P>
<P>
 * In a profile in People Magazine, which alleged that he was "the best dancer 
at Hamilton High."  
</P>
<P>
 * At a party in the Beverly Hills home of producer-author Robert Evans. 
</P>
<P>

 Re "2 Bodies Found, Mother Held in Children's Death," Nov. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith should also be charged with character assassination of black men. 
It is people like her and Charles Stuart (Boston murderer who blamed a black 
man) that perpetuate the stereotype of the black man as the constant predator. 
</P>
<P>
 Society is quick to believe these ridiculous stories partly because of the 
media. This has got to stop and then maybe decent black men can enter 
restaurants, stores, elevators, etc., without the look of fear appearing on 
most faces.

 When it comes to scapegoating, God is hardly exempt. The minister at the 
service for Michael and Alexander Smith in South Carolina tried to explain the 
unexplainable by saying, "Sometimes God takes our precious jewels in life and 
gives them back. . . ." But God did not put these two small boys in the back 
seat of a car and push it into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister was more helpful when he said: "I like to think of them sitting 
in the lap of God." While we may use different language, unless there is a 
future for us, this life is all too brief and brutal. Unless we have a destiny 
with a God who transcends us, we are not unlike the little boys strapped in the 
back of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The indignity of originally identifying a black man as the abductor is a 
metaphor for centuries of scapegoating African Americans. Many of us are 
outraged by this, and offer our apology to the black community.  
</P>
<P>
 A universal article of faith is that God had created us for a purpose, and 
this purpose is not defeated by human evil or madness. The deaths of these 
little boys can never be explained away, but they may cause us to reflect on 
the deeper meaning and purpose of our lives.

PERSPECTIVE ON INTELLIGENCE; THE SAME RULES SHAPE PEOPLE AND TOMATOES; 'THE 
BELL CURVE' IS BASED ON A FATAL ERROR OF BIAS. GENES DICTATE INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES; ENVIRONMENT SHAPES THE BLOOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As I follow the debate over Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's "The Bell 
Curve," I am struck yet again by how difficult it is for Americans to think 
intelligently about intelligence. Partly this is because the history of 
research on IQ, heredity and race is marked with such loathsome prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in this century, H. H. Goddard, a leading educator, gave IQ tests to 
immigrants, including the non-English-speaking, as they arrived at Ellis 
Island. The results: 83% of the Jews, 80% of the Hungarians, 79% of the 
Italians and 87% of the Russians scored as "feebleminded." Goddard concluded 
that low intelligence, which he linked to poor character, is inherited, and 
that "undesirables" should be kept out of the country or at least prevented 
from having children. 
</P>
<P>
 But partly we have trouble talking about intelligence because we think it is 
somehow unjust to recognize that people differ in their intellectual abilities, 
just as they differ in the ability to play football or the violin. No one would 
dream of forcing Itzhak Perlman or Joe Montana to suppress his talents in the 
name of fairness to others less gifted. But intellectually gifted children are 
routinely denied opportunities to develop and expand their abilities, often 
confined to classes that bore them to death. 
</P>
<P>
 If "The Bell Curve" was actually about the bell curve of intelligence, it 
mightwell have served to generate sensible discussion of this issue. There is 
no reason for anyone to get hot under the collar about the evidence that some 
proportion of intelligence (at least the specific kind of intelligence measured 
on IQ tests) has a genetic component. So, as all parents know and research 
confirms, do aspects of temperament, such as shyness and extroversion. In 
psychology, only a few die-hard environmentalists still believe that you can 
turn a timid toddler into another Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Bell Curve" is based on a fatal error that makes a mockery of the 
authors' claims to be impartial and unprejudiced. The error is to assume that 
genetic variation, which can account for differences among individuals within a 
group, is also the reason for differences between groups. This is the mistake 
that every racist since Goddard has made, so it is important to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, geneticist Richard C. Lewontin proposed the following "thought 
experiment": Suppose you have a bag of tomato seeds that vary genetically; all 
things being equal, some seeds will produce tomatoes that are puny and 
tasteless and some will produce tomatoes that are plump and delicious. You take 
a bunch of seeds in your left hand and a bunch in your right. Though one seed 
differs genetically from another, there is no average difference between the 
seeds in your left hand and those in your right. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you plant the left hand's seeds in Pot A. You have doctored the soil in 
Pot A with nitrogen and other nutrients. You feed this pot every day, sing 
arias to it and make sure it gets lots of sun. You protect it from pests and 
you put in a trellis so even the weakest little tomatoes will have some 
support. Then you plant the seeds in your right hand in Pot B, which contains 
sandy soil lacking nutrients. You don't feed these tomatoes, or water them or 
sing to them; you don't give them enough sun; you let pests munch on them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tomatoes mature, they will vary in size within each pot, purely 
because of genetic differences. But there will also be an average difference 
between the tomatoes of enriched Pot A and those of depleted Pot B. This 
difference between pots is due entirely to their different soils and 
tomato-rearing experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 With people as with tomatoes, differences within racial, ethnic or national 
groups are partly genetic; but differences between such groups can be entirely 
environmental. Blacks and whites do not grow up, on the average, in the same 
kind of pot. Black children often receive fewer nutrients -- literally, in 
terms of nutrition and prenatal care, and figuratively, in terms of education, 
encouragement by society and intellectual opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, cultural groups differ in a zillion ways that can affect performance 
on IQ tests. For example, anthropologist Shirley Brice Heath studied a small 
African American community in the South and found that black parents were less 
likely than white parents to ask their children "what," "where," "when" and 
"who" questions -- the sort of questions found on standardized tests and in 
schoolbooks ("What's this story about?" "Who is this?"). They preferred analogy 
questions ("What's that like?") and story-starter questions ("Did you hear 
about . . . .") Teachers in the community used this information to modify their 
teaching strategies. They encouraged their black pupils to ask "school-type" 
questions, but they also incorporated analogy and story-starter questions into 
their lessons. Soon the black children, who had previously been uncomfortable 
and quiet, became eager, confident participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if we want to explain why American children of all races perform so 
much worse in math and science than do students in Japan and China, we must 
look to the "nutrients" that Asian children get. Their parents have much higher 
standards for achievement than American parents have; their parents expect them 
to study hard to succeed, whereas American parents tend to think you either 
"have" math ability or you don't; and Asian parents and children's peer groups 
support academic achievement. In the United States, many white students who are 
good in math and science are considered nerds and dweebs, and many black 
students who excel academically are accused by peers of "selling out" to white 
society. Asians and Americans grow up in different pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Plomin, a leading behavior geneticist, has observed that "the wave of 
acceptance of genetic influence on behavior is growing into a tidal wave that 
threatens to engulf the second message of this research: These same data 
provide the best available evidence for the importance of environmental 
influences."  
</P>
<P>
 An intelligent social policy on intelligence would not direct us to conclude 
that "it's all in the genes; there is nothing we can do." It would direct us to 
make sure that all children grow up in the best possible pot, with room for the 
smartest and the slowest to find a place in the sun.

COMMENTARY; FALL OF BOXING ALLOWED RISE OF GEORGE FOREMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, a good percentage of the reaction to George Foreman delivering a 
pair of straight right hands to the center of the face of a seemingly 
distracted Michael Moorer to win a heavyweight championship at age 45 the other 
night was both swift and wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt it was a staggering accomplishment for a still out of shape, 
middle-aged man who hadn't fought in 17 months and was unranked to dethrone a 
young champion. But cosmic? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's out of place to call Foreman's victory an indictment of boxing, 
because an old, cheeseburger-chomping has-been has no business becoming a king 
of the game's marquee division, it's equally inane to ascribe supernatural 
properties to the happening. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic victory in the history of sport? Come on. The best thing to 
happen to boxing in an age? Be serious. A form reversal beyond belief? Please. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this had happened many years ago when a fight fan knew the names of the 
seven champions from feather to heavyweight as well as he knew his kids' names, 
perhaps. But then, of course, a guy many years past his prime couldn't talk 
himself into the position Big George did strictly on the strength of his 
personality. And the lack of saleable commodities among the heavies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, meanwhile, probably had a whole lot more to do with what transpired 
than he's given "credit" for. It's a well-known fact Michael doesn't like 
boxing and it's readily apparent in his approach to an endeavor that requires 
total dedication and focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to the fight in which he won his two-pronged (International Boxing 
Federation, World Boxing Association) title. He beat a man, Evander Holyfield, 
who was in the throes of a heart attack from the fourth round on. He was ahead 
by a substantial margin when, in the late going, he appeared to lose interest 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't for his trainer and tactician Teddy Atlas climbing into his face, 
goading him and berating him unmercifully, Moorer might have somehow lost to a 
fast-closing Holyfield, who showed effort previously thought to be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Saturday night in Las Vegas, Atlas was lecturing his man as though he 
had just walked in off the street for his first boxing lesson. Everyone over 
the age of reason probably knows that as a left-hander, Moorer has to move to 
his right, or away from the best power punch of a right-hander (Foreman). 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerman got so sick of instructing Moorer to do this after a while, he 
just let it go and moved on to something else. Often it was as if he was 
talking to a guy who had English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 For the former champion to admit later, "maybe I got a little lackadaisical," 
is in the running for understatement of the year. Even moving in the wrong 
direction (to his left) through much of the fight, Moorer hadn't been in any 
real trouble because Foreman's chopping, "over the top" right hand was bouncing 
off the side of his head mostly harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Come the later rounds, Michael, who hadn't shown much movement since 
proceeding from his dressing room to the ring 45 minutes before, became 
completely inert. He was now standing directly in front of Foreman, a fact 
Atlas noted when he warned his fighter, "he's trying to sucker you for the 
right hand." The straight right cross with "body English" behind it, according 
to Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 Big George had talked about his thunderous right hand, the one that had 
obliterated Joe Frazier and 41 other fighters in an earlier life, but only a 
couple of times had it showed up during career No. 2 (1987 to the present): 
Against Bert Cooper in 1989 and Gerry Cooney in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, George can implode a building with a right hand if the situation is right 
but, mostly, even beaten fighters could escape the full force of the blow so 
slow was Foreman in delivering it. It was not unlike Satchel Paige's old 
"hesitation" pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The pawing left that grazed off Moorer's head distracted him just enough and 
he moved his right hand just enough for George to cross his right. Light's out! 
</P>
<P>
 Call it lucky or anything you want. But to fighters it's known as the "shot," 
a punch delivered at just the right time and in the proper manner to render 
them losers. 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of those el perfectos. It won a fight, a big fight. But with so 
many boxing organizations, we're up to five right now, and so many title 
holders since the heavyweight crown was divided up in the late '70s, Foreman's 
feat of regaining a crown at 45 will last only until some gent 46 comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 Which could be a lot sooner than anything thinks considering Larry Holmes is 
still around and he's 45 and giving no indication that he regards it as a time 
to sign up for AARP.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; HARPER'S INJURY NOT AS BAD AS FEARED 
</P>

<P>
 An injury suffered by Dallas Cowboy wide receiver Alvin Harper, who landed 
awkwardly trying to catch a pass as the half ended in Monday night's 38-10 
victory over the New York Giants, was diagnosed as only a sprain Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was thought to have torn a left knee ligament. Owner Jerry Jones said 
he was worried Harper was lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a magnetic resonance imaging test showed a sprain to the outside 
ligament of the knee. Harper was listed as doubtful for Sunday's game in San 
Francisco, but it wasn't a season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys hope offensive lineman Derek Kennard, who suffered a sprained toe 
against the Giants, can also play. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dallas also could get tight end Jay Novacek back for the 49ers. 
Novacek, bothered by a strained abdominal muscle, has only held for extra 
points and field goals in the last two games. 
</P>

 Denver Broncos running back Leonard Russell was arrested and charged with 
disorderly conduct for his role in bar fight hours after the team's loss to the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Glendale, Colo., arrested Russell, 25, and Scott McClelland, 33, 
early Monday after Russell floored McClelland, police said. Both were cited for 
disorderly conduct, but it's not clear who instigated the fight.

 Cincinnati Bengal Coach Dave Shula said Jeff Blake will remain the starting 
quarterback over David Klingler Sunday against Houston. It will be the third 
consecutive start for Blake, who led the Bengals to their first victory last 
Sunday in Seattle. . . . The Detroit Lions signed free agent quarterback and 
former Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta and placed quarterback Scott 
Mitchell (broken finger) on injured reserve. . . . ESPN's first Sunday night 
NFL telecast of the year, the Raiders at Kansas City, drew an A.C. Nielsen 
cable rating of 11.1, the network's highest for an NFL game in nearly four 
years.

 Installment Debt Jumps Again: Consumer credit rose $10.6 billion in September, 
the 22nd straight monthly advance, though the growth was slower than in August, 
the government said.The Federal Reserve Board said installment debt jumped 
14.6% at an annual rate, compared to a 21.3% increase in August, when consumer 
spending rose a revised $15.2 billion. The August increase, the largest since 
$16.3 billion in January, 1989, was originally estimated to have been a much 
smaller $11.2 billion. Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured 
by real estate. The totals were adjusted for seasonal variations.

 Stant to Buy Firm Founded by Windshield-Wiper Inventor: The Richmond, Ind., 
auto parts producer said it will purchase Buffalo, N.Y.-based Trico for $160 
million. Stant Corp. offered Trico stockholders $85 a share.Trico workers, 
reeling from the loss of 2,500 jobs in Buffalo since 1985, were optimistic as 
management handed around flyers announcing the buyout. Stant President David 
Paridy said he is optimistic about the future of the Buffalo plant. Stant, 
founded in 1896 to make buggy parts, went public last year, selling stock to 
finance acquisitions that included the purchase of Buffalo-based Fedco 
Automotive Components Co., which makes auto heaters. Trico was founded in 1917 
by John Oishei, who invented the windshield wiper after he hit a bicyclist in a 
rainstorm. It remained family-owned until the 1980s.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; NINE WIN PAGING LICENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government auction of regional paging licenses ended Tuesday with nine 
groups submitting winning bids for licenses to offer a new generation of paging 
and messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
 PageMart Inc. and PCS Development Corp. -- a consortium that includes Arch 
Communications Corp., A-Plus Communications and USA Mobile Communications Inc. 
-- were the big winners.Each offered to pay more than $90 million for five 
regional licenses, enough to gain nationwide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, American Paging Inc., MobileMedia Corp., AirTouch Communications, 
Benbow PCS Ventures and individual investor Lisa-Gaye Shearing each captured 
several licenses. Ameritech Corp. and Insta-Check Systems Inc. won a single 
license each. 
</P>
<P>
 Total high bids for the auction rose over 10 days to $488.8 million. However, 
groups owned by minorities and women will get 40% discounts from the Federal 
Communications Commission on some of the licenses, so the government's total 
earnings from the auction will be $394.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will use the licenses to offer such things as "pocket answering 
machine services," delivering voice or electronic messages directly to small 
pagers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited to be standing on what we believe is the edge of a whole 
new wave of personal communication technologies," said Maceo Sloan, chairman of 
PCS Development. "There are all kinds of exciting possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The licenses awarded Tuesday enable the winners to offer the two-way wireless 
services in five regions of the country. These supplement 10 national paging 
licenses the FCC auctioned in July.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: THE REGULAR ELECTION LOSER: TRUTH IN ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 election is dead, long live the cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
 The big, heaving sigh of relief is premature, however, because federal law 
gives political mudders and splatterers the right to extend their grubby 
television tactics to future elections as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With dirt from this election campaign still settling after Tuesday's vote, 
you'd love to send the following memo to media: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't take the money and run. Stiffen your spines next time and begin 
rejecting unfair political ads. By turning them down, you cut off a windpipe of 
deceptive campaigning. By accepting them, you nourish the myth of their 
inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice thought. When it comes to most of the spots on TV that you love to 
hate, though, the memo would be futile, for their inevitability is no myth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because federal statute requires broadcasters to accept virtually all 
political advertising from candidates, provided such ads include the sponsoring 
candidate's voice or photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Under no such restriction are print media, which alone must bear 
responsibility for the misleading political ads they choose to run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times last Friday, for example, took the unusual step of 
running a story refuting much of a full-page Michael Huffington ad run in the 
same edition of the paper (and later in the Sunday Times). In attacking Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, the misleading ad had selectively quoted, and taken out of 
context, portions of a Times story about her voting record vis-a-vis her 
husband's financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no assurance, of course, that those who saw the ad also read the 
Times story. Moreover, if the paper found the ad misleading enough to merit a 
separate story correcting the record, it should have avoided the misinformation 
by refusing to run the ad in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to television, meanwhile, what is an unfair political ad? A broad 
definition would include those oft-misleading, warm and cozy family shots of 
candidates. Acknowledging that absolute purity is an unrealistic goal, however, 
let them have their choreographed images of fuzzy home fronts, baby smoochings, 
hard-hat populism and other public-relations misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it another way, there's unfair, and there's unfair . 
</P>
<P>
 Mere bad acting by candidates, or even bad taste, seems almost quaint compared 
with the blizzard of tawdry political spots that California and much of the 
nation have just endured and likely will face again, unless it can be 
demonstrated that heavy doses of mean-spirited ads don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even paid ads that broadcasters believe to be deceptive or erroneous are 
protected under the law. In other words, ads that showcase even outright lying 
-- the most malicious smear imaginable -- cannot be rejected or yanked by 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they had wanted to, for example, California TV stations could not have 
refused a revolting Tom Umberg ad that all but blamed Attorney General Dan 
Lungren for the slaying of Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the shrill Huffington ad insisting that the Associated Press charged that 
Feinstein "lied, flat-out lied" about details of her employing a Guatemalan 
housekeeper in the early 1980s, although the wire service repeatedly said it 
did no such thing. Even after the AP requested removal of the ad, the 
Huffington campaign continued to run it along with another version substituting 
"hometown newspaper" for Associated Press, a reference to a story critical of 
Feinstein printed by striking San Francisco Chronicle employees, but later 
somewhat backed away from by the authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deceitful ads? Yes. But the free-speech argument -- that the cure would be 
worse than the affliction -- prevails here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very difficult area," said Andrew Schwartzman, executive director 
of Media Access Project, a Washington-based law firm working in public-interest 
telecommunications. "But allowing broadcasters with their own axes to grind to 
be able to censor candidates is antithetical to the system. Even broadcasters 
exercising good faith should not be in a position to deny voters the right to 
hear what the candidates have to say. The theory of the First Amendment is that 
an informed electorate will make the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the goal of some ads is clearly to create a misinformed public. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartzman sees the dilemma a bit differently. "The system that says that 
candidates can spend as much of their own money as they want is central to this 
problem," he said. "As long as one candidate can outspend another candidate, 
whether 2-to-1 or 100-to-1, you have a situation where a lie can go 
unrebutted." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is where broadcasters can play a significant role in balancing the 
scales, although you wouldn't have known it based on their performance in the 
California campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although newspapers such as The Times regularly run truth boxes that assess 
the veracity of political ads (mostly for TV) point by point, Los Angeles 
stations made no sustained attempt in their newscasts to specifically address 
unsubstantiated charges or correct misinformation in the ads they were forced 
by law to run. It was the least they could have done. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did stations reject a particularly misleading ad they could have rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The law does allow broadcasters to refuse non-candidate political ads such as 
those touting various ballot initiatives. Thus, they could have -- and should 
have -- turned down ads for Proposition 188 that hid the identity of its chief 
sponsor, the Philip Morris tobacco company, by carrying a tag that said only: 
"Californians for Statewide Smoking, Yes on 188." 
</P>
<P>
 Why wasn't this ad rejected? One possibility is that fees for non-candidate 
ads can far exceed "the lowest unit price" that stations are required by law to 
charge for candidate ads, said attorney Schwartzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Communication Commission rules "require that the true identity of the 
sponsor be known," says Milton Gross, chief of the agency's political 
broadcasting branch. Thus, acting on complaints about ads advocating 
Proposition 188, the FCC earlier this month had urged California broadcasters 
to extend the ad's closing line by adding "a committee of California hotels, 
restaurants, Philip Morris Inc. and other tobacco companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some stations did. Not giving a damn, others did not, affirming that when it 
comes to ethics, some broadcasters and candidates share the same values.

 They're ba-aaack! 
</P>
<P>
 Science-fiction movies, of the big-budget/big-effects variety, are, like 
Westerns, suddenly back in the saddle. Even before "Stargate's" record-breaking 
debut weekend in late October and even more stunning second weekend at No. 1, 
there were three times as many sci-fi movies as Westerns in production. 
</P>
<P>
 What "Dances With Wolves" and "Unforgiven" were to Westerns, "Jurassic Park," 
"Stargate" and the ongoing "Star Trek" franchise may be to science fiction.

 " 'Stargate' filled a void for science-fiction effects we hadn't seen in a 
while," notes movie analyst David Davis of Paul Kagan Associates. "But I think 
what will really bring back the science-fiction genre is when George Lucas 
makes the next three 'Star Wars' movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas -- whose in-development "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" is planned as the 
first of three "Star Wars" prequels to be filmed back-to-back -- is far from 
the only movie heavyweight with a future in science fiction. The seventh "Star 
Trek" feature film is due Nov. 18 and represents a passing of the torch from 
the original TV series cast to that of "The Next Generation" -- and presumably 
future generations of sequels in the popular franchise. 
</P>

 Kevin Costner is producing and starring in Universal's "Waterworld," a 
post-apocalyptic underwater "Road Warrior" that, at an estimated $135-million 
budget or more, may be the most expensive movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Keanu Reeves has finished shooting TriStar's "Johnny Mnemonic," with a script 
written by cyber-punk bestseller William Gibson. James Cameron has produced and 
co-written the just-wrapped Fox film "Strange Days," starring Ralph Fiennes, 
Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis and Vincent D'Onofrio. Oliver Stone is working 
on a "Planet of the Apes" picture, and Stanley Kubrick on a film about 
artificial intelligence. Tom Hanks is reportedly attached to Robert Heinlein's 
"Stranger in a Strange Land," now in development at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Why sci-fi, and why now? 
</P>
<P>
 Partly, it's because Hollywood feeds on itself. "Everybody jokes that there 
are only eight development people in Hollywood," says Paul Colichman, the 
media-division president of independent studio IRS, which has a half-dozen 
science-fiction movies in the pipeline. "And everybody knows everybody in 
Hollywood, and they think along the same lines -- that's why there were three 
'Robin Hoods' (in production simultaneously four years ago). You'll see these 
spurts in the Hollywood community." 
</P>
<P>
 Science fiction is, indeed, cyclical. In the 1930s, there were Flash Gordon 
and Buck Rogers serials. In the '40s, there was essentially nothing. The '50s 
brought a stream of Atomic Age movies, both serious ("The Day the Earth Stood 
Still") and frivolous ("Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman"). The 1960s were barren, 
except for the occasional "Fantastic Journey" or "2001: A Space Odyssey." Then 
the late '70s exploded with "Star Wars" and its countless imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after the early 1980s, science fiction stopped being called that in the 
theatrical market (although remaining popular in the direct-to-video market). 
Generally, sci-fi movies like "The Terminator" and "The Road Warrior" are 
stocked in the action-adventure section of video stores, and "Jurassic Park," 
with its cloned dinosaurs, is still considered a "family adventure film." Even 
"Stargate" producer Mario Kassar demurs when it comes to the term. "I know 
everybody's calling it science fiction," he says of his film, "but I look at it 
as just a unique drama." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid that calling a movie 'science fiction' may limit its 
audience to a fringe group," observes veteran science-fiction producer Pen 
Densham, who with John Watson and Richard B. Lewis produced MGM's just-wrapped 
"Tank Girl," and is launching a new "Outer Limits" series on Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like politics," he says. "It's putting a spin on the product so that 
people think of it as a general-audience film. Yet some of our greatest movie 
experiences have been science fiction. 'E.T.' is absolutely science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Colichman says major studios have avoided the science-fiction label for fear 
of attracting only sci-fi fans. The big studios want big audiences, and "the 
mass audience wants (expensive) state-of-the-art computer and other effects 
that will blow their minds," he says. Colichman, conversely, can produce 
low-tech sci-fi movies for a smaller audience, since "the aficionados, who are 
more into science-fiction philosophy and ideals, don't demand of me those kinds 
of expensive special effects." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the costs of special effects coming down, thanks to new computer 
animation software and editing systems, the risks of making science-fiction 
movies will diminish. This helped "Stargate" get made, says its director, 
Roland Emmerich. "We could do things we couldn't do a couple of years ago," he 
says, "because computer effects helped us to reduce cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there appears to be something else feeding this trend as well: the coming 
of the millennium. "We're going toward it like a boat toward the Niagara 
Falls," says Densham. "We're on a time stream, and we don't know what's on the 
other side. I think there's a tremendous curiosity now to try and get a vision 
of our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Weldon, a genre-movie specialist and editor of the magazine 
Psychotronic, agrees. "Science fiction never went away," he says, "but this new 
interest in it I think has something to do with the end of the century coming 
up, and people wondering what's next for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be the bleak future of Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" books, now in 
development at TriStar with a script by playwright David Henry Hwang? Will it 
have a techno-cool industrial look, as in Kassar's planned "Total Recall II"? 
Or will we look back to the future, with director Renny Harlin's remake of "The 
Day the Earth Caught Fire"? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the beginning of a cycle," Densham says. "And whether you're talking 
about making the movies or just living life, we're going through a renaissance 
and rediscovery of what we can do. It's truly becoming what the mind can 
conceive, the eye can believe."

 Television viewers called the cops last week, as ABC's "NYPD Blue" and CBS' 
revival of "Cagney & Lacey" scored huge numbers, according to the weekly A.C. 
Nielsen report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 4 ranking of the gritty police drama helped ABC to another win in the 
weekly race among the four networks.David Caruso's departure last Tuesday 
propelled the program to its highest rating in its two seasons. The showing 
will put even more scrutiny on the Steven Bocho series next week when Jimmy 
Smits arrives to replace Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more impressive were the high ratings (No. 6) Sunday for "Cagney 
& Lacey--The Return," starring Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly, which earned the 
highest rating of any movie this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NBC celebrated the strong showing by its Blackout Thursday slate of 
comedies: "Mad About You" (No. 11), "Friends" (No. 12) and "Madman of the 
People" (No. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 NBC also came up a winner against Fox in the battle of Roseanne movies, but 
the victory was nothing to crow about. "Roseanne and Tom: Behind the Scenes" 
placed 71st out of 88 shows. A month ago, Fox's Roseanne scored even lower.

ITO SLIGHTLY EASES CURBS ON JURORS' ACCESS TO NEWS; SIMPSON CASE: PANELISTS ARE 
ALLOWED TO READ EDITED COPIES OF NEWSPAPERS AND VIEW MOST ENTERTAINMENT 
PROGRAMMING ON TV. DEFENSE TEAM COMPLAINS ABOUT DEFENDANT'S FOOD AND THE 
ADDITION OF A BLACK PROSECUTOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito slightly relaxed the restrictions on jurors 
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Tuesday, allowing them to read edited copies 
of newspapers and giving them the go-ahead to turn their television sets back 
on after a long blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detailed written order crafted by Ito after he and attorneys for the two 
sides reviewed jurors' comments about their television viewing habits, the 
judge spelled out what his painstakingly selected jurors may watch while they 
await the beginning of their service in the Simpson case. It could be two 
months or more before their duties begin -- Ito said in court Tuesday that he 
does not expect opening statements before mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Oct. 18, the judge had required that prospective jurors in the Simpson 
case avoid all news media and stay out of bookstores in order to avoid any 
information about the trial, in which the football great faces charges that he 
murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
Simpson has pleaded not guilty to those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's loosening of those restrictions affects the 12 jurors sworn in last 
week as well eight prospective jurors left over from the first panel of 
prospects and roughly 75 from a second panel who have yet to be interviewed as 
possible alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson's lawyers raised questions about the latest addition to the 
prosecution team, highly regarded Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher A. Darden, who 
led the grand jury investigation into Al Cowlings, a close friend of Simpson 
arrested with him June 17. Darden was added to the prosecution team Monday 
after the Cowlings investigation was concluded, and he is the first African 
American to play a leading role in the prosecution effort. Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys, praised Darden's skills as a lawyer but 
suggested that he was put on the prosecution team because a predominantly black 
jury has been chosen for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's other lead lawyer, said his client is losing 
weight because he is getting inadequate food while in custody. On days that he 
appears in court, Simpson, like other jail inmates, does not get a hot lunch or 
dinner, and it is taking a toll on his health, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito warned jurors and prospective alternate jurors that he continues to 
weigh the possibility of sequestering them while the trial is under way. In 
response to a question from one panelist, however, he pledged to give them as 
much warning as possible and advised them to pack three days' worth of 
belongings in case they need to be sequestered without advance notice: "We're 
not just going to kidnap you and take you off to Motel 6," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Tuesday's new order regarding access to the media, a host of shows 
remain off-limits, but jurors are allowed to cautiously wade back into the 
world of entertainment. Movie channels, home shopping, sports and cartoons all 
made Ito's approved viewing list, as did most entertainment programming, 
provided that jurors vow to turn off their sets or leave the room during news 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Banned programs range from tabloid television shows such as "Hard Copy" and 
"Inside Edition" to news stalwarts such as "60 Minutes." Talk shows remain off 
limits, as does at least one comedy program, "Dennis Miller Live on HBO." 
Miller has occasionally spoofed the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to allow jurors to stay abreast of current events, Ito's staff 
will supply the panelists with edited copies of their favorite newspapers so 
they can read without stumbling upon news about the case. They got their first 
batch of papers Tuesday. The only drawback: It takes court personnel a day to 
edit and clip the papers, so jurors will get their news a day late. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the new, more relaxed rules, radio remains strictly off-limits: "It's 
too hard to turn it off when you're driving," Ito explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has gone to great lengths to permit jurors to re-establish some 
contact with world events even as he tries to shelter them from news about the 
case or its participants. He reluctantly forbade the panelists to watch Tuesday 
night election returns, for instance, but gave out the home number for one of 
his clerks and told jurors they could call her for updates until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Once opening statements begin and the jury is in place, a number of other 
accommodations may ease the burden on jurors. A company that records books on 
tape has agreed to supply its products to the jurors free of charge, and a 
videotape distributor has said it will lend tapes of movies for the panelists 
to watch, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 As jury selection resumed in the case Tuesday -- the parties now are seeking 
15 alternates to supplement the 12 jurors sworn in last week -- every one of 
the nine jury prospects considered was dismissed. Some were released from 
further service for unspecified causes, presumably based on their answers to 
the detailed, 79-page questionnaire that every jury prospect filled out in late 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were excused after the lawyers on both sides agreed that they would not 
make appropriate jurors or alternates in the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a coincidence," Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant 
working with Simpson's team, said of the parade of excused jurors Tuesday. 
"Hopefully it's not a pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Questioning began Tuesday with a 31-year-old South-Central Los Angeles man who 
was interviewed about his knowledge of and opinions about the case. Like many 
of the other jury prospects, the man said he had heard a widely disseminated 
911 tape in which Nicole Simpson called for help and a man she identified as 
her ex-husband could be heard yelling in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospective juror said Tuesday that he thought "something bad" was 
happening on the tape and concluded that Simpson might have been beating his 
ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing that remark, Simpson, who has attended every session in the drawn-out 
jury selection process, turned to one of his lawyers and said: "I wasn't 
beating her." 
</P>
<P>
 Another prospective juror was dismissed after she steadfastly insisted that 
she believes in Simpson's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would a person forfeit all this to take a life?" that panelist, a 
51-year-old South-Central woman asked. "Why would he take a life? I haven't 
bought into it. I won't buy into it. Right now my feelings are he's not 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Simpson's lawyers complained that their client is losing weight 
and suffering health problems because he is not receiving adequate food. On 
days that Simpson appears in court, he is given a sandwich or two for lunch, 
and similar fare for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got one slice of black bread, one slice of white bread, with one slice 
of mystery meat inside," Shapiro said, adding that the food is not enough to 
keep up Simpson's weight. The former football star has suffered from several 
ailments during the nearly five months that he has been in custody, including 
an intestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidel Gonzales, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
said Simpson has received the same food as all other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets no preferential treatment, no special treatment of any kind," said 
Gonzales, noting the department transports thousands of prisoners to and from 
court every day. "It's impossible to arrange for all of them to have hot meals 
on those days that they're in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys said they met with Ito and sheriff's representatives 
Tuesday and believe they have reached an accommodation that will allow the 
defendant to receive better food in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers also took a swipe Tuesday at the latest move by the Simpson 
prosecution team to bolster its ranks as trial approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, after concluding the case against Cowlings, the district attorney's 
office transferred Darden, the 38-year-old lead prosecutor from that 
investigation, to the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Cochran described Darden as a fine lawyer, but suggested that he was 
added to the team at least in part because he is black. "I don't think he 
should be on this case. . . . All of a sudden he shows up over here," Cochran 
said. "Why is that, now that we have eight African Americans (on the jury)? . . 
. I think it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, who is also black, added that he objected to Darden's appointment 
because Darden had played such an important role in the Cowlings investigation. 
Simpson's lawyers have long complained that the grand jury probe of Cowlings 
actually was a veiled effort to dig up potentially damaging information about 
Simpson, and they maintained Tuesday that Darden's addition to the Simpson 
prosecution effort confirmed their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, the district attorney's office denied the defense 
complaints regarding Darden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Darden joined the Simpson prosecution team," the statement said, 
"because of Gil Garcetti, Bill Hodgman and Marcia Clark's respect for his 
abilities as a trial lawyer, just as Hank Goldberg recently joined the team 
because of his prosecutorial skills."

COUNCIL OKS PLAN FOR HOMELESS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the urging of the mayor's office, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday 
approved in concept a plan to build a Downtown drop-in center for the homeless 
where transients could take showers, get job training or rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 13 to 0 to move forward with the $4-million center as part 
of a city and county effort -- funded by a $20-million federal grant -- to 
reduce homelessness in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "To succinctly put it, the city of Los Angeles wants to give people a ladder 
to climb out of the situation of homelessness," said Councilman Mike Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the homeless said they will continue their fight to ensure 
that the center does not become an "internment camp." 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle has begun," said Mike Neely, director of the Homeless Outreach 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "By its very design, the plan seeks to hide the homeless, not to house them," 
said Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row service 
center. "They want to make Downtown a pretty place for uptowners by ridding the 
sidewalks of the panhandlers and the homeless. . . . It is worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan, the city would purchase a vacant lot in a secluded 
industrial zone east of Downtown. About 80% of the area would be transformed 
into a landscaped, fenced lot where homeless people could rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for building a 50-bed shelter, showers, restrooms and 
lockers, along with a service center providing drug and job counseling. A van, 
staffed by social workers, will shuttle homeless people to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility was originally touted as a place where transients who refused to 
go to conventional shelters could sleep. However, in the wake of criticism from 
advocates for the homeless, the mayor's office has sought to portray the 
drop-in facility as a service center and a place for brief rest stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a concern from certain homeless providers that regardless of what 
the initiative said, the drop-in center would become an urban campground," said 
Deputy Mayor Rae Franklin James. "Let us reiterate: The drop-in center would 
not be an encampment site for individuals to live nor would anyone be forced to 
go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next 45 days, city officials say, they will hold six public 
hearings before returning to the council for final approval on the specifics of 
the plan. The Board of Supervisors must also sign off on the drop-in center 
before it can be built. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said they hope the facility will provide crucial services 
to a population that has been difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a first step out of homelessness," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be funded with $20 million in U.S. housing and urban 
development funds, as approved by Congress in August to combat homelessness. 
The council members said they want at least to approve the mayor's plan in 
concept for fear the city might lose the federal funds if it does not proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have plenty of time to debate on the fine points on how the money will be 
used and where it is used," said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "I think we 
should sign on and get it moving."

DEVOTED VOTER; ELECTION: MAN WHO RECENTLY BECAME A CITIZEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY 
CASTS HIS FIRST U.S. BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Luis De Mata made his way down La Cienega Boulevard, an umbrella aloft in one 
hand, his sample ballot in the other. He wondered out loud if the rain would 
stop people from voting. "People will find any excuse not to come out and 
vote," he would muse later. "It makes me feel sad in a way." 
</P>
<P>
 No quirk in the pantheon of Los Angeles disasters would have stopped De Mata, 
a 38-year-old Guatemalan-born hairdresser and newly minted U.S. citizen, from 
his civic duty Tuesday. He was voting for the first time as an American, having 
voted only one other time in his native Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 "There you are," said volunteer election worker Floyd Dodd, handing De Mata 
his pale blue ballot. De Mata spent five minutes in the wooden voting stall, a 
shabby contrast to the sleek, art-filled walls of the Los Angeles Art Assn. 
Galleries, which doubled Tuesday as a polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had difficulty putting the card in" the ballot-marking device, De Mata 
confessed later. "But then it clicked." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when voter ennui is taken as the norm, De Mata sounds as if he 
stepped out of a citizenship class, which he in fact did last year. "It's your 
duty to vote," he said. "Otherwise other people are making the decision for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 De Mata was 17 when he immigrated to Los Angeles in 1973 with his mother after 
his father died. They came at the urging of two of his older sisters, who were 
already here. He and his mother, who has since died, bought a roomy duplex on a 
wide, leafy street near West Hollywood. The house, where De Mata runs a 
one-chair hair salon in a back room, is now worth more than 10 times what he 
paid for it, he estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say this country's been good to me, and I've been very lucky," he 
said, settling back on a floral print couch in his meticulously kept house. A 
portrait of his mother hangs on one wall. All three of his sisters live here. 
Only his brother is still in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 De Mata, who hails from a part of the world where free elections are dearly 
prized and steeped in blood, was always puzzled by the legendary American voter 
apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Latin American people, an election means a lot -- to express your feelings 
about what's going on," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, long before he had earned his U.S. citizenship, he coaxed a 
blase American friend into voting in a presidential election. "I said, 'I'll 
drive you,' " De Mata recalled. He waited in the car while his friend cast his 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 De Mata applied for citizenship in May, 1993, and was interviewed in January 
by an immigration official who quizzed him on the broader points of Americana. 
"Basic things," De Mata said. "Who is the President, who is the vice president 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 On the day in June that he was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at a ceremony in the 
L.A. Convention Center, he was handed a certificate of citizenship and an 
application to register to vote. He mailed in the application the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for this election, he spent an hour at his kitchen table Sunday 
night poring over the voter information pamphlet sent out by the state and 
filling in his sample ballot. He was a thorough voter on Tuesday. No 
proposition, no judicial race was left unpunched by his stylus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure it this way," he said. "It's my first time. I want to do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his respect for the duty of voting, De Mata came to the task with the 
same reservations that many veteran American voters have. He spurned the 
negative campaigns of the past months and believes that campaign spending 
should be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should emphasize more what they're going to do and less 
mudslinging," he said. "It's tiring. You turn on the TV and they have three 
commercials in a row. I put it on mute -- or change the channel. Sometimes that 
doesn't help." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as sick as he was of the hatchet ads, he found some of the information 
useful. "The people who have ads on TV and in the paper are the ones you get to 
know. The others you don't know. And I think that's not right -- voting for 
someone you don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 A soft-spoken man of measured words, he does not argue politics and is 
reluctant to reveal whom he chose on his ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 But he made no secret of his new right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes after returning from his maiden voyage to the polls, his phone 
rang. "You know, it felt good," he told a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later a neighbor rang. "Yes, I did it," De Mata told the 
caller. 
</P>
<P>
 He hung up and smiled shyly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I registered, I told everybody," he said and chuckled. "I'm going to 
save my little stub and frame it, I think."

RACERS' NEMESIS; LANCASTER SPEED DEMON SNAGS 2 PRESTIGIOUS AIR RACING PRIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child, Jon Sharp used to "fly" a plane that was attached to a short wire. 
As an adolescent, it was remote-controlled airplanes. As an adult, he is still 
playing with small aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this one weighs more than 500 pounds and races around a three-mile oval 
course at better than 250 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp, 44, of Lancaster, built and pilots an "air racer" called Nemesis that 
has set a host of speed records and dominated the Formula One racing class 
since it appeared on the circuit in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He set a national speed record Aug. 1, 1993, at the Aeroshell Speed Dash in 
Wisconsin, where he piloted the long, smooth and slender Nemesis at 277.26 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he will be recognized by the National Aeronautic Assn. for his 
performance during the 1993 race season, receiving air racing's most 
prestigious award, the Pulitzer Trophy, which is kept on display at the 
National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Top pilots in four other air race 
classes will also be honored with the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Air racing is similar to auto racing except that it is done about 50 feet off 
the ground. The planes speed along a three-mile oval course. The 24-mile races 
take about 6 1/2 minutes to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp on Friday will also receive the Louis Bleriot Medal, an international 
award named for a French aircraft builder and designer who won the first air 
race in 1912 against the likes of the Wright brothers and other aviation 
pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale awards a maximum of 
three of the medals each year to holders of speed, altitude and distance 
records in planes weighing less than 2,204 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in my wildest dreams did I ever think it would be this successful," Sharp 
said of his plane and the Nemesis Air Racing Team. "Most of this is pretty 
numbing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp, who earns his living as a composites research engineer at Lockheed 
Advanced Development Co., says his desire to race dates back to his childhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "I raced everything from pedal cars to tricycles to slot cars," he said. "I've 
raced a lot of people from stoplights." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Sharp earned his pilot's license in the early 1970s, a co-worker 
told him about a home-built racing plane, a Cassutt Racer, that was for sale. 
Sharp bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't race it for a long, long time," he said. "I just flew it around to 
air shows and terrorized airports and that kind of stuff. It was a little, 
itty-bitty, tiny airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Sharp got a call from a friend who invited him to bring his Cassutt 
to a race in Mexico. "We came in last by a real long way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next year, Sharp did a little better in that race. And then he ran 
into a friend who used to build engines, and in the 1978 Cleveland Air Races, 
Sharp and his plane actually "got past a couple people." From that point, he 
said, "I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Sharp joined up with a pair of Orange County engine 
builders who through their company, Aero Mag, began constructing engines 
specifically for racing. Sharp won his first national title at the Reno 
National Championship Air Races in 1982 with such an engine in the Cassutt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Sharp and his team began building Nemesis. The name was selected 
based on what they hoped to do with the plane. "We thought of all the typical 
names -- Eliminator, Annihilator. We didn't want to eliminate anybody. We just 
wanted to be the thorn in their side." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Nemesis has been, winning 19 of the 21 air races in which 
Sharp has flown it, and garnering four national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bohannon, an air racer from Texas who often finishes second behind 
Nemesis, says the plane is the most modern racer on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been chasing them with a much older-design airplane," he said. "We're 
slowly catching them by learning more and more ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that everyone on Sharp's team is involved in the aerospace industry 
is a key to the plane's success, Bohannon said. "It's really difficult to beat 
a team that's as well dialed in as they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemesis, made of composite materials, was built in 15 months of evenings and 
weekends at a Mojave Airport hangar. Sharp flew it for the first time in July, 
1991, and that September it won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great airplane," said Ray Cote, a 26-year veteran of air racing and 
holder of more Formula One national titles than anyone else. "It's way out in 
front, way ahead of all the others."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BRENTWOOD; WON'T 
DEMOLISH MONROE'S HOME, NEW OWNER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A movie director who recently bought the Brentwood home where Marilyn Monroe 
died more than 30 years ago said Tuesday he does not plan to tear down the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ritchie said he bought the four-bedroom, Spanish-style house on a 
secluded cul-de-sac off Carmelina Avenue in September, hoping to make it more 
accessible to the actress's many fans.  
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie said he was incensed by the comments of a real estate agent who said 
that he was pondering whether to demolish the house and build another 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to have a chance to set the record straight," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
BACTERIA LEVELS MAY BE HIGH, BEACH-GOERS WARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials issued a reminder to beach-goers Tuesday 
that bacteria levels can rise significantly in water adjacent to storm drains 
during and after a rain.  
</P>
<P>
 The elevated bacterial levels may last for as long as 72 hours after a storm, 
so swimmers should stay away from water near storm drains and beach users 
should avoid contact with any storm drain discharge.The runoff may contain 
large amounts of bacteria from several sources. Sewage normally is not present 
because the sewer system is separate from the storm drain system.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis of water samples taken from drain discharge points after storms 
indicates that the water can exceed state bacteriological standards. Water on 
either side of a drain also can register high bacteria counts, depending on 
such factors as amount of discharge and ocean currents and tides.  
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Health Services analyzes ocean water on a weekly 
basis around the more active storm drains. If tests indicate a serious or 
unusual problem, the department orders the affected area closed to swimmers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY WILL 
SEEK EXPERT TO STUDY PUBLIC WORKS REVAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council authorized a search Tuesday for a consultant to 
recommend ways to streamline the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant also will look into the best way of revamping the giant agency 
if the Board of Public Works, the city's only full-time politically appointed 
commission, is abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan this year proposed eliminating the panel, but the 
council tabled the matter because a majority wanted a more detailed 
reorganization plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is our solution to that problem," said Chief Legislative Analyst Ron 
Deaton.  
</P>
<P>
 The council directed Deaton to prepare a request for proposals from consulting 
firms and allocated $200,000 for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a general departmental review, the consultant will examine 
"alternatives to consolidate, reorganize and/or streamline the department, its 
bureaus and the Board of Public Works." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, whose five members each earn $74,500 a year, oversees 
management of the agency's seven bureaus, which include sanitation, street 
lighting, street maintenance and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The department operates with an annual budget of $376.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Sanitation alone was allocated $338.3 million this year for 
upgrades of the city's aging sewer system.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; 2 WOUNDED IN 
SHOOTOUT AFTER BANK ROBBERY, CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were shot, a third was arrested and a fourth was still at large after 
a bank robbery in Torrance on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, all suspects in the robbery at a Downey Savings branch on Pacific 
Coast Highway, led police on a chase through Torrance and Lomita that reached 
speeds of 70 m.p.h. It ended when the suspects' late-model sedan was forced 
into a collision with a police car on Carson Street, said Torrance police 
spokesman David Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shootout that followed, two suspects were wounded, Smith said. Both 
were in fair condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The third suspect was 
booked into the Torrance jail and the fourth escaped, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer was slightly injured in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said two bank employees were slightly hurt in the robbery. Both were 
hit with handguns by the robbers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered several handguns and a bag of money from the suspect's car, 
Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the fourth robber eluded officers on foot, police said, he stole a white 
compact pickup truck from a carrepair business.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS TO OPPOSE PARTS OF FEDERAL CLEAN AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to oppose parts of a proposed 
federal clean air plan, saying the new rules would cost the county $35 billion 
annually and would cause the loss of 350,000 jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Implementation Plan, a project of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, seeks to bring the region into compliance with federal ozone health 
standards by the deadline set for 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors unanimously decided that the economic impact of implementing 
the plan in the county would be too great.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan "would cost cities and counties hundreds of millions of dollars to 
replace engines on ambulances, firefighting equipment, trucks, trash haulers 
and emergency equipment," Supervisor Mike Antonovich said.  
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District has recommended a plan to be 
presented to the EPA on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich asked his fellow supervisors to support the AQMD's plan instead of 
the federal plan because it would have a smaller economic impact on the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich had sought a vote to oppose the federal plan entirely, but 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke got an amendment passed calling for the 
supervisors to oppose the parts of the plan with "unacceptable economic 
impacts."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 EXCUSED 
FROM JURY POOL FOR ALLEGED MADAM'S TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Tuesday dismissed two more people from the pool of prospective jurors 
for the trial of accused Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne excused one potential panelist after the 
woman failed to show up on time.The second was dismissed after telling the 
judge that she had to visit an ill acquaintance in San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest dismissals bring the total of jurors excused to 18, leaving a pool 
of about 50.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither defense attorneys nor prosecutors have used any of their 10 peremptory 
challenges, which allow them to have jurors dismissed without citing a reason.  
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere in the court was relaxed. One potential panelist sitting in the 
spectator section of the courtroom appeared to be dozing and another was 
reading a detective story.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, who faces five counts of pandering and one count of possession of 
cocaine for sale, as well as a separate federal tax evasion case, smiled 
several times at the answers given by prospective jurors.  
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old daughter of a prominent Los Feliz physician, she could be 
sentenced to six years in prison for each of the pandering charges and a 
maximum of five years on the drug count if she is convicted.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ROSEANNE, 
TOM ARNOLD TO DIVORCE, PUBLICIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roseanne and estranged husband Tom Arnold have mutually decided to obtain a 
divorce as soon as is legally possible, her publicist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce is expected to be final by Dec. 9, according to the brief 
statement issued by Kevin Campbell of PMK Public Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All property issues will be resolved by settlement or trial at a future 
date," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress-comedian, who recently announced that she would use just her first 
name, said she was "happy to finally put this chapter of my life behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne reportedly plans to marry her bodyguard, Ben Thomas. She has several 
children with her first husband, Bill Pentland, whom she divorced in 1990 after 
15 years of marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 She has been married to Arnold for about four years.

PASADENA COUNCIL CENSURES RICHARD AFTER ANGRY EXCHANGE AT MEEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council has censured Councilman Isaac Richard for the third 
time after an angry exchange in which he tried to protest that a fellow 
councilman is permitted to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The censure, approved on a 4-0 vote late Monday night, deprives Richard of his 
travel expense account as well as the privilege of buying tickets to the Rose 
Bowl and other Pasadena events.It lasts through April, the end of Richard's 
council term. 
</P>
<P>
 The censure was triggered when Richard tried to discuss the permit issued this 
year to Councilman William M. Paparian. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Kathryn Nack tried to gavel Richard down, deciding that the subject was 
not appropriate for public discussion. Although the name of anyone holding a 
permit is public record, the details of why the person needs to carry a weapon 
are confidential, said interim City Atty. Christina Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard was "not allowing the meeting to go forward in an orderly manner," 
Nack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman continued to argue despite a warning by the sergeant-at-arms 
that he would be ejected. Nack finally recessed the meeting. Later, after 
Richard left, Nack, Paparian and council members Chris Holden and Rick Cole 
voted for the censure. No other council members were present. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said Tuesday that he objects to the councilman carrying a gun in the 
council chambers. He said that if Paparian is in danger, then perhaps a metal 
detector should be used at the entrance of the council chambers to protect 
everyone. Paparian could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has censured Richard twice for cursing and threatening city 
officials during council meetings.

PICK OF THE LITTER; CAR BUFFS AND DO-IT-YOURSELFERS FIND A PARADISE OF PARTS AT 
26-ACRE JUNKYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Most people look out upon the 26-acre U Pick Parts junkyard in the east San 
Fernando Valley and see nothing but thousands of beat-up, shelled out, mangled 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are folks like Robert Garcia, who see wondrous possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I build cars from," said Garcia, who restores old cars as a 
hobby. He had just found the very items he was looking for -- three bulbs for 
the exterior lights on his cherished '65 Buick Riviera. The total cost for 
these treasures: two bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I can rebuild a whole car by just coming here," he said, delighted 
with his find. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a regular at the Sun Valley self-service junkyard since it opened nine 
years ago, knows that shopping at the huge lot is a hit-and-miss proposition. 
There are no inventory lists, so you can spend hours searching through the 
3,000 cars, motorcycles, trucks and other vehicles without finding anything on 
your wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows you take your chances when you come here," said Garcia, 32, 
who lives a few miles away in Arleta. "If I don't find it here, I have to buy 
it someplace else and probably pay an arm and a leg for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers know there is no guarantee on anything, they pay cash, and they 
do the work themselves," said Andrew Adlin, controller for Aadlin Bros., the 
firm that owns the lot, and a member of the family that runs the junkyard. The 
extra "a" was added to the business name to get a higher placement in telephone 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a supermarket, the junkyard is restocked every day. The cars are added at 
a rate of about 50 a day, commonly coming from police auctions, tow companies, 
insurance companies and the back yards of people who want to make a few bucks 
off a car they had sitting around. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs in English and Spanish encourage customers to bring their own tools and 
wear sturdy footgear. Patrons pay a dollar to get in.  
</P>
<P>
 The price of parts ranges from $100 for a complete engine down to the $1 paid 
by Garcia for the bulbs. (The entrance fee doubled his cost.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to road vehicles, the junkyard is now the home of the huge yellow 
arches that once belonged to a Valley carwash, a condemned Santa Fe train car 
and the remnants of an old Army tank with an intact turret. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the lot is a Brahma bull named 7-Up who lives in a pen in the center 
of the junkyard with half a dozen chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nino Gasparini, 33, was at U Pick Parts one weekday afternoon looking for a 
right front fender and a hood that would fit his 1974 Chevy Malibu. He had 
wrecked the car that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance company won't pay for it because it is such an old car," he 
said, looking through a white Malibu on the lot for parts. "Here I can fix it 
and not have to pay more than the car is worth," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Villalobos, 35, of Pacoima came to the junkyard with her husband, who 
was searching for parts for his Chevy truck. Wearing white shoes, she 
delicately stepped over grease puddles and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like coming here, but you have to if you want parts for a good 
price," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the money we save, maybe he will get me a new pair of shoes."

FULLERTON COUPLE AND SON FOUND DEAD IN BURNED CAR

<P>
 A Fullerton couple were found burned beyond recognition in the back seat of 
their Honda and their 19-year-old son was found dead in the trunk of the car, 
which had been set afire late Monday outside a school, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of Dolores and Edward R. Charles had called Fullerton police Sunday 
night and reported a man screaming for help from inside the trunk of a car near 
her home. But when police arrived, she said, the car was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew (then) someone would turn up dead," said the woman, who was still 
shaken Tuesday and asked that her name not be used.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Orange County authorities were investigating the deaths as 
homicides, but would reveal few details of the case, including any possible 
motive for the grim slayings. Dental records were sought to positively identify 
the victims, but the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department late Tuesday 
released the victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police would not comment on the 911 call and what time it was 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Dolores Charles, 47, a real estate agent, and Edward Charles, 55, 
an engineer at Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton, were in the back seat of the car, 
and their son, Danny Charles, a USC student and opera singer, was found in the 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the family spokesman, Danny Charles' singing teacher, Wally Negrini, 
said that Eddie Charles Jr., the eldest son, and Dolores Charles' father were 
staying at the house with four or five others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charles neighbor said she could not remember exactly when she called 911 
Sunday night but she was walking friends out to their car when she heard yells 
for help coming from the trunk of a car parked across the street.

READING, WRITING, RUIN; RAVAGED BY TIME, VANDALS AND A LACK OF MONEY, PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS ARE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE WAR ZONES. WITH LITTLE OR NO BUDGET FOR 
REPAIRS, THE CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES.

<P>
 On a recent fall day, many of the 3,200 students at Benjamin Franklin High 
School in Highland Park walked to class, as they have for more than a year, 
past glass- block windows shattered by bullets, pellets and rocks. Across the 
way, they passed two empty classrooms charred a year ago by arsonists. They 
milled around lockers, more than 100 of which were bashed, broken or burned -- 
and unrepaired since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 A boys' bathroom reeked, its stench sometimes reaching the attendance office, 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was warm and cloudless, but one student described the campus as "gray 
and gloomy." The Los Angeles Unified School District hasn't once repainted the 
school since it was rebuilt in the 1960s. The older gym, heated with radiators 
from the 1930s, has no air conditioning. Three on-site custodians have been 
lost to cutbacks and until last week, no full-time gardener had tended the 
19-acre, multitrack, year-round campus. The principal waits weeks for 
maintenance help after reporting needed repairs and watches his fix-it list 
grow longer every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in an affluent pocket look down, both literally and figuratively, on 
what ideally would be considered an oasis of hope. One mother said, "Most of 
the people in Mt. Washington don't want their kids to matriculate at Franklin. 
They will sell their homes and move rather than go to this school." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than the exception, Franklin, through no fault of its own, is 
becoming typical of hundreds of regional public schools ravaged by time, 
vandals, lack of money and a generation of trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the schools built in the '50s and '60s were built to last 30 years," 
said Larry Picus, associate education professor at the University of Southern 
California and a school financing specialist. "Thirty years is up." 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those unaffected by earthquake damage, the deterioration is 
accelerating due to increased use and shrinking budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof at Utah Street Elementary School in Boyle Heights has been leaking 
for years. "They do come out and repair it and then after a while, it happens 
again," said Principal Dee Dee Mynatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Already this year, fifth-grade teacher Paul Delaney has had to place 
protective plastic over eight computers he purchased himself to protect them 
from the rain. But this was nothing new. Last season, he said, "at one point 
every night I had to push every table with a computer on it to what I hoped was 
a safer part of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher does not blame his administrators. "This is a fact of life in this 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling LAUSD has accumulated $600 million worth of deferred maintenance 
projects. "We're only funded at one-third of what the needs are," said Margaret 
Scholl, director of maintenance and operations for the district. "We spend less 
than any other major school district by far, and less than any school district 
I am aware of in the country on maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the current head of LAUSD's Facilities, Asset and Management 
division, recently warned board members that without additional funds, "that 
$600 million will grow to $900 million, that $900 million will grow to $1 
billion. Pretty soon you have to shut down schools and where are you going to 
put the kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, with the exception of newer suburbs, the angle of deferred 
school maintenance projects is becoming "sharper and sharper," said researcher 
David Honeyman, director of the Center for Educational Finance at the 
University of Florida. "Every year you don't fix something, it creates 
additional problems that need to be fixed."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in September, school officials in Washington, D.C., were forced to 
delay opening 164 public schools in order to fix 4,000 fire code violations 
including defective boilers, old, faulty wiring, clogged sprinklers and 
unworkable windows. 
</P>
<P>
 With 700 fewer custodians than it had five years ago to care for its 800 
schools, the LAUSD deals with maintenance on an emergency-response basis only, 
Scholl said. District painters are scheduled so rarely that when Maria Tostado, 
principal of Garfield High School, was told they were coming next in the year 
2048, she wasn't sure if they were kidding or not. In fact, it takes 30 to 40 
years for a school to get painted on the outside, said Bob Hamms, director of 
technical services for the LAUSD. Interior paint jobs "would be over 100 years 
given the current level of funding," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some worry that dilapidated buildings pose potential hazards and liability. 
Others cite a "Catch-22" situation in which facilities' rapidly declining worth 
may jeopardize the district's ability to borrow money to solve the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 But others suggest children are paying the price already. Said LAUSD board 
member Barbara Boudreaux: "It sends a strong message to children. Very strong. 
'We don't care about you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to one 17-year-old Franklin senior, "Education should be No. 1. It's 
the future. But it's like the district or whatever is not going to be around in 
the future. They're just thinking about now, about themselves. It's like they 
don't think about us being deprived is like the end of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and other members of the school's drill team and cheerleading 
squads come to school on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon to clean up the school. 
"It seems like we have to make a difference if the district isn't going to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like conditions are getting worse and worse," she said. Once as part 
of a class project, she said she wrote to Gov. Pete Wilson about the problems. 
She said she received no reply. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Almost routinely, after weekends or holidays, Andy Parker, a physical 
education teacher at Le Conte Middle School in Hollywood, finds human feces 
left by weekend soccer players behind the gymnasium near his office. "Kids 
aren't supposed to go back there, but they do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a pile remained inside the locker room for hours before it was 
reported to a janitor. But before it was removed, Parker said, "Some (student) 
grabbed it and rubbed it all over the door. I think that message was, 'Hey, why 
do I have to step over this to go to class?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because he says he has a reputation as a complainer, Parker has begun bringing 
his video camera to work to document what he sees: his office broken into and 
sprayed with graffiti, broken and boarded up windows, open ditches, trash that 
piles up in drifts. "You see liability around every corner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said some teachers are so disgusted by the environment, they transfer 
out as soon as possible. At first, he said, his attendance dropped off. "Then 
all of a sudden, I realized the kids really cared about me. It seemed to matter 
to them if I missed a day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only thing that makes me go back," he said. "I don't know what it 
is, these kids out of all the kids are the best, the sweetest, the nicest, the 
most submissive. Your heart gets torn. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm in the armpit of the world," Parker said. "But substitutes say Le 
Conte is not the worst." 
</P>

 Many Compton schools, built as part of the 1930s Works Progress 
Administration, are named for U.S. presidents or educational leaders. One has a 
memorial plaque to a long-forgotten local hero who "gave his life for 
democracy" in 1918, three years after the school was built. But now the schools 
"more resemble Third World schools than schools in Los Angeles," said Jerome 
Harris, an administrator appointed this year by the state Department of 
Education to oversee the debt-ridden and nearly bankrupt Compton Unified School 
District.  
</P>
<P>
 Some schools have boarded up the rotten buildings the district can afford 
neither to fix nor tear down. In one of the closed buildings, a middle school 
teacher once fell through the floor, its supports undermined by gophers, Harris 
said. One high school pool has been unusable since the 1987 Whittier 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School, built in 1922, parents have gamely 
painted the facade and planted colorful flowers. But the windows that are open 
won't ever close and the windows that are shut won't open. Some doors have no 
knobs. The toilet stalls have no doors. Principal Jackie Cochran said the sewer 
backs up once a quarter. But she said, "We can't sit down and wring our hands. 
We have a building that's standing up."  
</P>
<P>
 At Franklin Whaley Middle School, three sections of classrooms were torched by 
vandals twice during the past year. They stand charred and decorated with 
cobwebs as children chant lessons in portables nearby. On the threshold of the 
charcoal remains, graffiti broadcasts a bathroom-style sentiment about a 
teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to be an oasis out here," said Principal Charles Littles. But the 
damage "shakes their sense of security. A lot don't feel secure. A lot don't 
have good parenting." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides money, the officials say, what the community needs most are higher 
expectations, neighborhood success stories and education. "Without education," 
Littles says, "they'll still be pushing grocery baskets in 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Moved by horror stories in other inner cities around the country, many of them 
related by Jonathan Kozol in his book, "Savage Inequalities" (Harper Collins, 
1992), federal lawmakers have begun to take notice. Led by U.S. Sen. Carol 
Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.), this year they commissioned the General Accounting 
Office to study the physical conditions of the nation's schools. The report, 
due in January, will also consider whether a school's physical environment 
affects student achievement or teacher turnover.  
</P>
<P>
 Also this month, Congress for the first time allocated federal funds -- $100 
million -- to help school districts repair facilities that pose a health or 
safety risk to students. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum doesn't begin to match the huge backlog of school repair projects in 
Los Angeles alone, not to mention those of the nation, estimated at between 
$200 billion and $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But many believe money alone is not the answer. They cite issues of staff 
competence, bureaucracy, priorities or "spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said LAUSD board member Boudreaux: "You can't begin with us at the board, or 
any federal government, or any state government. It has to start at that school 
site. If you tolerate filth, you're going to have filth." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some schools in the most blighted neighborhoods have beautiful campuses, 
she said. "You can see a school, two or three blocks from another, one is 
filthy, one is clean." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a matter of setting high standards and instilling pride at the school 
site, she said. "Somehow, we have to heighten the sense of ownership" among 
parents, staff and community leaders. "We can't let the students off the hook, 
either," she said. Workers who must clean up trash have less time for cleaning 
hallways or replacing light bulbs.  
</P>
<P>
 Some say older, middle-class suburban schools may even be worse off than 
poorer schools because they do not receive special state and federal funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Even at Mt. Washington Elementary, teachers plaster the walls with artwork to 
cover up flaking and chipping paint. "The water that comes out of the pipes in 
the teachers' lounge you would not want to drink. It's rusty and gray," one 
mother said. "But we have to make coffee and punch with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike less affluent areas, the Mt. Washington parents have formed a 
booster club, a nonprofit corporation to raise more than $1 million to build a 
multipurpose room and four more classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way beyond what parents ought to be doing," the mother said. "The idea 
of a parent group in an elementary school raising over a million dollars to 
build a facility is ludicrous. The state is obligated to do this. And yet, you 
can't stop them. The people say, 'We'll never get any money here to build the 
facility.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, schools in other areas have reportedly raised $75,000 to $100,000 a 
year and used in-kind donations and services to perform their own repairs and 
upgrades -- especially air conditioning.  
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Joan Mark, principal of Carpenter School in Studio City, 
organized parents to paint the school and install air conditioning. The parents 
planted a rose garden and now also replenish the earthquake supply bin each 
week. "We chose a color scheme with the children," she said. "Some have blue 
walls, some have literature characters. You come in and you smile. It's clean 
and neat and shiny." 
</P>
<P>
 At Garfield High School, where students still use temporary bungalows that 
were scheduled to be removed after World War II, parents also come on campus 
each weekend to paint out graffiti. Sometimes the paint is paid for by the 
district, sometimes by the boosters, and sometimes by the student body. They 
also believe it is not their responsibility, but as community volunteer Lupe 
Robles said, "We don't want our kids to feel like second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the striking discrepancies between what can be accomplished in 
the have and have-not neighborhoods prompted one GAO official to predict school 
facilities will become the "issue of the '90s, replacing desegregation in terms 
of equity." 
</P>
<P>
 According to USC's Picus, "The fact still remains if Beverly Hills needed a 
bond measure, they could do it for a much lower tax rate than Baldwin Park. So 
it's very difficult to pass a bond measure and build a school."  
</P>
<P>
 Over a generation, standards have shifted and facilities declined so 
gradually, that many have become inured to their surroundings. Some parents say 
they have learned to accept less.  
</P>
<P>
 But those who live with the problems every day call it a crisis desperate 
enough to require radical solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the LAUSD's maintenance director Scholl: "We can't just let 
things continue. You can't depend on the goodwill of people forever. You can't 
forever take care of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point you have to address the issues."

WORST PART OF SCHOOL? BATHROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If he really has to use a restroom during the day, Garfield High School senior 
Steven Avila says he goes home -- even though it's against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearest boys' bathroom, only three of eight urinals and two of four 
toilets were working on a recent visit. Graffiti covered the walls floor to 
ceiling. By 10 a.m. all the paper towels were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always lines and they stink. They're always full of graffiti," he 
said. "Everybody hates it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the increasingly unkempt parts of a school, it's clear that bathrooms 
are the most upsetting to students and parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Even teachers avoid student bathrooms. "It's a matter of smell," said a 
teacher at Palisades High School. "They're like bathrooms on a public beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hear complaints that some children, fearful of filth or violence in 
the bathrooms, have had bladder problems after holding it all day.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents are "outraged there are no doors on restrooms at certain schools," 
said Margaret Scholl, director of maintenance and operations at the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is to control drug use, she said, but mostly it is to control 
vandalism. "Kids swing on doors and break them. In boys' restrooms, we'll 
maintain a door on one stall. Other than that, we won't put doors on others, 
they just get ripped off," Scholl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plumbers, she said, "find all kinds of things jammed down toilets. Juice cans. 
Paper towels. Soap dispensers."  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Barbara Boudreaux said another part of the problem has to 
do with "culture shock." Some children who have come from poor rural areas in 
other countries don't know how to use toilets and defecate on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 While district officials have introduced new cleaning products and are 
training custodians to do a better job, schools are trying various ways to 
handle behavior problems. Some have volunteer aides stationed in restrooms. 
Others keep the bathroom locked except at lunchtime. In some schools, children 
need to sign for a token to go to the bathroom, which is then inspected every 
half hour. "A record is kept of kids who use it. If there's any damage, all 
kids (who used it) are required to clean it. It's not perfect, but it's a 
control," Scholl said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as elsewhere, the main problem is too many students, too little money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield Principal Maria Tostado said her school, built in 1925, was never 
meant to hold 4,400 students year-round. She already reported the overflowing 
urinals but the last plumber, one of four serving 88 east Los Angeles schools, 
came four weeks earlier. Workers need 10 or 15 problems before they come out, 
she said. "They won't come out for one or two."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials ranked Garfield's facilities among the district's best 25%. LYNN

'MY DREAM WAS TO WORK AT THE DAIRY QUEEN'; AUTHOR: DENISE CHAVEZ IS EARNING 
RAVES FOR HER FIRST BOOK, WHICH CELEBRATES LATINO CULTURE. BUT SHE ISN'T MOVED 
BY HER NEW FAME. SHE JUST WANTS TO TELL HER TALES -- AND RE-STUCCO HER HOUSE.

<P>
 Before embarking on a 7 1/2-year odyssey to complete her first novel, Denise 
Chavez already knew what the last phrase would be: ni modo.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of that whole kind of philosophy that we Latinos have where your roof 
caves in, your sink goes out on you, everything bad, but you got to go on with 
life," Chavez explained in a recent interview. " Ni modo. No matter what 
happens to you, you are a survivor. You endure. You keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what her novel's protagonist, Soveida Dosamantes, does in "Face of an 
Angel" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1994), an earthy, colorful tale of a woman 
seeking the meaning of service, both personally and in her three-decade career 
as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's what Chavez, 46, has been doing since she started a journal at age 8, 
growing up in Las Cruces, N.M., and continuing through today as she prepares 
for her next novel without concern about how her current book sells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fame is not something that interests me," she said. "I would like to have 
enough money to re-stucco my house, and I would like to have enough money to 
help my father (whom she has cared for since he suffered a stroke 10 years 
ago). But I'm still going to be in Las Cruces. I know where my heart is and 
where my strength comes from: the landscape, the mountains, friendship, my 
cultura . 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no expectations of life. My dream was to work at the Dairy Queen. I 
look forward to becoming a viejita (a little old lady) 'cause then I can really 
get into my characters even more." 
</P>
<P>
 But like it or not, fame has reached Chavez because of mostly glowing reviews 
of her debut novel, which was a selection of the Book of the Month Club and the 
Quality Paperback Book Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In its September issue, Vanity Fair named Chavez as one of "Latina 
literature's new doyennes." 
</P>
<P>
 The group of Latina writers, who call themselves "Las Girlfriends" and sing 
one another's praises while providing endless support, include Ana Castillo 
("The Mixquiahuala Letters"), Julia Alvarez ("How the Garcia Girls Lost Their 
Accents") and Sandra Cisneros ("The House on Mango Street"). 
</P>
<P>
 For the dust jacket of "Angel," Cisneros calls Chavez a " chismosa par 
excellence -- a gossip, a giver-away of secrets, a teller of tales our mama 
told us not to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa McKenna, a USC English professor who teaches a class on Chicano/Latino 
literature, said Chavez's work stands out because it has a "performative 
writing quality." 
</P>
<P>
 "Denise has a wonderful mixture of a narrative writer with a good grasp of 
character, and a playwright," McKenna said. "It has to do with the visual 
quality of where you can almost see (her work) staged." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because Chavez -- who received her bachelor's degree in drama from 
New Mexico State and earned master's degrees in drama from Trinity University 
and in creative writing from the University of New Mexico -- is also a 
dramatist whose plays have been produced at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland 
and Joseph Papp's Festival Latino de Nueva York. 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of the theater faculty at the University of Houston who now 
teaches creative writing at New Mexico State, Chavez has toured with her 
one-woman play, "Women in the State of Grace," featuring nine diverse Latino 
characters ages 7 to 78. 
</P>
<P>
 "A synthesis of all my experiences have come together in 'Angel,' " said 
Chavez, previously best known for her collection of short stories, "The Last of 
the Menu Girls." "Drama taught me how to see things and also to listen to 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez also picked up storytelling skills from her mother (who died 11 years 
ago) and extended family, who spent summers in a small town called Redford in 
western Texas, sitting in the shade, eating watermelon and telling embellished 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The untold stories were always the ones that, as kids, we found the most 
interesting," she said. "Like the one about why one of my uncles had only half 
an ear. The story was that he'd been in a terrible accident, but we knew there 
was more to it. Back then people seemed to live life more deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they weren't telling stories, they were reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got so damn hot sometimes all you could do was read," she said. "I 
remember my grandmother loved to read. She found a joy in the language. These 
were people who had a love of literature and language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother, however, might have bristled at some of the language in 
"Angel," which at times is raunchy in chronicling three generations of women 
dealing with the Mexican tradition of serving husbands and God. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez also talks about incest, alcoholism, religion, relationships and 
machismo, issues that many Latino families believe should remain behind closed 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might see this as an indictment and say it has too many (vulgarities), 
it's too sexy, it has too much genitalia," she said. "But that in itself is a 
liberation for a woman to be able to speak the unspeakable. Latinas never talk 
about their sexuality. I've had a miscarriage, and women never talk about 
miscarriages. Women never talk about their aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think I show the good aspects of our culture, too. That we are 
passionate, loyal and long-suffering. We are a people of survivors. These are 
secrets of the human heart. To empower people to become the faces that we are 
without these masks. To be able to speak the truth of our families without 
shame, without whispers." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's McKenna agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women writers want to confront the issues of sexuality in the family, 
especially in their complexity," she said, "as opposed to presenting an image 
of what the family is. That runs the gamut from abuse to personal 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not airing dirty laundry. Latinos are human beings. We no longer need to 
create an image of what we're suppose to be to make ourselves acceptable to 
other people. It's no longer an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 And Chavez does not place all the blame on Latino men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women complain that men never change, but it's not just the men. Women don't 
change either. The mother is always running to take care of her sons and her 
husband. It's the mothers who are responsible for bringing up children who are 
unbalanced." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Angel," "Soveida is making her pilgrimage in search for ways to become 
complete and balanced. She is asking why are we here on this Earth? Are we here 
to serve or to be served? It's a little of both. We can't help other people 
unless we take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations in the book are a mixture of Spanish and English, the way Chavez 
grew up speaking in southern New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I purposefully did not want them to italicize the Spanish words because then 
they become separate," she said of an early fight with her editor, who in one 
of their first discussions asked her what a pinata is. "It's time for readers 
to pick up a little Spanish. It's like a plate of food with salsa, with the 
Spanish words the salsa. It gives it flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said her next novel will be from the point of view of a 70-year-old man 
with a Mexican mother and an Anglo father. The working title is "The King and 
Queen of Comezon." 
</P>
<P>
 " Comezon is an itch," Chavez explains, "but it is also a longing that can 
never be satisfied. When you straddle the world of multiculturalism, you live 
in a world where you are a Mexican but have another world to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot to learn from men and being in the voice and heart of a man. I'm 
really looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't have an ending yet.

'90S FAMILY; AN INTUITIVE TOUCH FOR TEEN BOOKS; AUTHOR: LOIS LOWRY NEVER 
PLANNED TO WRITE FICTION FOR YOUNG ADULTS. BUT FATE AND A NATURAL CONNECTION TO 
HER AUDIENCE STEPPED IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent dinner party, Lois Lowry was asked the question for the thousandth 
time. Now that you've had so much success as a writer for young people, Lowry's 
inquisitor wondered, why not write a real book? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me," Lowry replied. "Would you ask a pediatrician why she didn't become 
a real doctor?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry knows full well that the implication of the exchange is that "it is 
somehow a lesser art, writing for children." Her own parents sometimes 
questioned when she was going to get serious and write for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry herself postponed any kind of major literary endeavor until she was well 
into her 30s and dabbling in the kind of dilettante journalist career that the 
wife of a successful lawyer can afford to pursue. She wrote a free-lance 
magazine article here, an occasional short story there. Sooner or later, she 
figured, she'd settle down and produce the great American novel -- for 
grown-ups, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short story in Redbook magazine evoked an unexpected telephone call. An 
editor at Houghton Mifflin read the piece about a woman who loses her sister 
and suggested that Lowry turn it into a work of "middle grade fiction" -- 
publishing-speak for a young adult audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had never even occurred to me to do that," Lowry marveled. "Now, in 
retrospect, I wonder why I didn't think of it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The story bloomed into "A Summer to Die," the first of 21 young-adult novels 
that Lowry has written since 1977. "The Giver," her most recent title, won the 
1994 Newbery Medal, the counterpart in children's literature of a National Book 
Award. Lowry also earned a Newbery in 1990 for "Number the Stars," making her 
one of only four authors to earn a pair of the coveted prizes. All her books 
have been published by Houghton Mifflin. 
</P>
<P>
 Her success is at once felicitous and serendipitous -- "by chance," said 
Lowry, a basket of yarn at her feet and knitting needles in her lap -- "to the 
degree that anything is by chance." For just as she was launching this new 
career in the then-fledgling field of young-adult fiction, she was beginning a 
new life. Her marriage ended, and for a time, Lowry and various permutations of 
her four children (now ages 32 to 36) lived in Maine, not far from another 
then-novice novelist, Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lowry, blessedly, the stories seemed to flow forth so intuitively that 
they verged on automatic writing inspired mainly by her own memories. In an 
instant, she was back in Carlisle, Pa., in an era when no one got divorced and 
no one's mother worked outside the home. Every tiny detail returned full-force, 
right down to the color of dresses she wore in pictures that were taken in 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems amazing to her that not everyone shares this youthful recall. "I have 
talked to a surprising number of people who profess not to remember their 
childhoods," Lowry remarked. "When I remember my childhood, it's as if I become 
a child again." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gift, she conceded, and "I feel very fortunate. Of course, I'm a lousy 
tennis player, and I can't ski." 
</P>
<P>
 With encouragement from editors, educators and, most important, her young 
readers themselves, Lowry has tramped through the turf of the modern dilemmas 
that confront children 14 and younger. She recognizes, clearly, that "children 
now have a much more sophisticated childhood. They travel, they move. The kids 
in my neighborhood grew up in the same house, and didn't move until they got 
married themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Children's books in those days assiduously avoided any kind of significant 
subjects. And while she confesses to "not being a reader of children's books 
today," Lowry said her impression is that even the most shallow of young 
peoples' titles "attempt to deal with -- what is the word? -- contemporary 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry accepts her own literary responsibility -- but also views it with 
ambivalence. "I tend to be an idealist," she said. "I would love to be able to 
protect all children from all bad things. But I'm also pragmatic. I think it is 
probably and unfortunately necessary that they be alert to what lies out there 
-- because they're going to encounter it much younger than I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the line, Lowry lost track of a year of her life. She thinks 
she is 57, but until recently told people she was 56. She shrugged. Numbers, 
and years, seem so irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 With her Newberys, and her literary accolades, she is occasionally stunned to 
find herself in the company of famous authors whose lives are dissected down to 
the designs of their kitchens. (For the record, Lowry's kitchen is compact and 
efficient, even if her coffee maker does lie. "It says the coffee's ready," she 
said, admitting a deep family secret. "It's not.") 
</P>
<P>
 Her following grows with each book. In her early years, Lowry consigned 
correspondence to a fictional secretary, Marion Kline, who could say things in 
letters that Lowry herself would never dare. If someone wanted her to review a 
manuscript about talking caterpillars, for example, Ms. Kline could politely 
explain that Ms. Lowry was otherwise engaged. Ms. Lowry, by contrast, would 
probably have read every single talking-caterpillar word. 
</P>
<P>
 So now there is a real secretary and real response letters. The flood from the 
outside world, her readers, reminds Lowry that her craft needs no defending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Books for kids are very valuable things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm delighted that I'm able to do them well, and that kids respond to 
them."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; CHRISTMAS STRESS FACTOR IS COMING TO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at the season's first Christmas decorations at a department store six 
weeks ago, one working parent said she suddenly felt "utterly defeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Others reacted with physical sensations -- a constricting of the chest, a 
pinch in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only six weeks before the Big Day, what experts call "parent-burnout 
season" is reaching its zenith. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without holiday pressure, we are all more stressed out than we used to 
be. This year, a study by the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor 
found that working women's No. 1 problem was too much stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, especially for the driven, Type-A perfectionists, there's the whole 
Martha Stewart thing: the tree, the shopping, the wrapping of presents, the 
baking of cookies, the cards, the parties, the dinner feast. Then there's the 
whole money thing, especially in the lingering recession. And the whole family 
thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One Orange County businesswoman said that last year she had "stress coming out 
my ears." 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old grandmother went into the season with two strikes against her 
-- she was the family's prime breadwinner and her marriage was foundering. 
Still, she hosted her company's traditional party, oversaw a special project 
for suppliers, and sewed red flannel nightgowns for all the women in her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas morning, she said she found herself in the emergency room with a 
stress-related ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep pushing yourself a little harder. You say, 'I can just do a little 
more,' " she said. "You want to be the perfect grandmother and make sure the 
grandchildren have the perfect Christmas and your employees have a good 
Christmas and you recognize all your clients. So it all gets cranked up. It's 
like a vise that keeps cranking down tighter and tighter." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, she said, she's doing the health thing. She's exercising, eating 
healthy and getting enough sleep. She's not making any nightgowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents said they take the kids on vacation to get away from all the 
pressure. Some said they draw names for gift-giving to limit expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One 49-year-old father of three said that over the past several years he has 
developed a love-dread relationship with the season since the number of 
packages he's been able to place under the tree has dwindled with his 
construction-based profession. "I take it as a little bit of a failure," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the crunch, he said, his family has started a new tradition. At least 
one present must be something they make themselves. "At least it brings a 
dimension of what Christmas ought to be, anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 We burn out when we expect too much from Christmas and ourselves at Christmas, 
and those who cut back are amazed at how much they can get away with not doing, 
said Ruth Luban, a Laguna Beach counselor who has developed an audio tape on 
burnout for people who are too busy to read a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the best things we can do is embrace the season early and 
start making plans as soon as those commercial decorations go up, she said. 
Couples need to book baby-sitters so they can grab some time alone. Singles 
might book some time at a day spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Luban said that sometimes, children burn out, too -- especially when their 
parents park them too long in day care in order to accomplish all their tasks. 
Despite the hassles, we need to involve our children in shopping, budgeting, 
cookie-making and housecleaning, she added. What we may lose in efficiency, we 
gain in a more sensible way of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we model efficiency," she said, "we are raising burned-out, Type-A 
little monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, we need to realize Christmas is not a show. One day of the year 
is not going to make up for all the rest. Said Luban: "There's nothing like 
burnout to get you to open your head and say, 'What is this for?' "

'90S FAMILY; BACK TO THE BOOKS; PARENTS ARE TAKING TO THE CLASSROOM AGAIN -- 
BUT THIS TIME, THET'RE JUGGLING WORK, SCHOOL AND FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Patrick Reynolds wanted to enroll in the landscape architecture classes 
offered through UCLA Extension 10 years ago. He knew the four-year program 
offered the certification and knowledge he needed to enhance his landscaping 
business, but his two children were small and Reynolds had recently become a 
single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the chaos going on in their lives, he said he couldn't in good 
conscience leave the kids with a baby-sitter to attend school two nights a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to feel like they could handle my being gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when a sagging economy slowed business and his children had 
become teen-agers, he thought the timing was right. A dad who had been 
available to his children at any given time now found himself missing school 
functions and spending weekends on his own homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "These have been real formative years for us. It's definitely a trade-off," 
said Reynolds of Torrance. "There's still not as much time for them as I feel 
they deserve. Kids at every age have needs to be met." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of working parents who return to school each year is difficult to 
determine -- the U.S. Department of Education and other agencies don't keep 
track -- but take a peek inside college classrooms across the country and 
you're likely to find more and more working moms and dads attempting to juggle 
family, work and school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it with smoke and mirrors," said Reynolds, 45. "It's been a real 
challenge. We talked about my going back to school, and you're talking to kids 
who are nodding their heads yes, (but) their actions say otherwise. My son 
being the younger one had the most difficult time. His behavior became erratic 
and his grades started slipping." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many sit-down talks and meetings with teachers to straighten 
things out, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the size of the task that most parents in school find daunting. What 
can ruin your day, they say, is not knowing what will topple the balancing act. 
The key, they add, is trying to have a backup system. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has become much saner since Reynolds' fiancee, Nancy Fernas, and her 
13-year-old daughter came to live with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a great source of support. Most of the time one of us is at home in 
the evening, which makes life a lot easier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While balancing life on three fronts isn't easy, Reynolds said he hopes to set 
a good example for his kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they see now is that they want to do things that I can't do. When they're 
older I'm sure they'll be able to relate to it more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Jaimene, 25, a single mother living in Hollywood, loves her 
twice-a-month job as an investigative assistant for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. She wants to become a USDA criminal investigator, which requires a 
bachelor's degree in criminal justice or a related field. So two years ago, 
Jaimene returned to school at Los Angeles City College with plans to transfer 
to a university. Her first attempt at college was cut short by family needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brandon was a preschooler and there were day-care problems," she said. "Then 
he got pneumonia. I missed a lot of classes. My grades were terrible and I was 
dismissed. There was not a lot of sympathy for my situation. It works better 
now that my son is in grade school." 
</P>
<P>
 Better, but not any less grueling for Jaimene and her 7-year-old son. Two 
years away from a bachelor's degree, she spends 30 hours a week in class or 
studying in addition to working 32 hours a week in the student assistance 
center on campus. She also has her USDA duties. Jaimene's schedule leaves 
little time for fun, but the incentive of financial stability keeps her going. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get home at night we do our homework together. At least he sees that 
it's important," she said. "Just the other day he asked me, 'Mom, why do you 
always have to go to school?' and I told him, 'So we can have a better life. 
Don't you want nice clothes, money for the movies, a nice home?' and he said, 
'Yeah . . . OK, Mom, go to school. Don't be late.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of family encouragement is one reason why Loyola Law School offers 
a family orientation and free counseling to its part-time law students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's impossible for a student with a family to come to school 
without their support," said Anton Mack, the director of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Professors, staff and students' families meet with spouses and the significant 
others of new students to discuss time management and the rigors of law school 
for a working family. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on family is one reason Mark Bidwell of Long Beach chose Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Law school was a lifelong ambition for Bidwell, 37, an accountant/controller 
at the Bank of Los Angeles, but he knew hitting the books meant asking a lot of 
his wife, Colleen, and their daughter, Brittany, 4. Four nights a week for the 
next four years, Bidwell will go directly to school from his 9-to-5 job. He now 
spends 10 hours per weekend doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. It's very stimulating," Bidwell said, adding that he is grateful 
for the support he receives at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The orientation helped me to understand what Mark needed from me," Colleen 
said. "We need to look at it as if our whole family is going through this, not 
just Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen, who works as a nurse, tries to stay up on school nights so they can 
talk when he gets home. Making time for Brittany is more difficult. Bidwell has 
taken her to his workplace and school so that she might better understand what 
he does during the weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Merkle, acting director of the child development center at Los 
Angeles Valley College in Van Nuys, said he finds parents who return to school 
quite motivated. In fact, the rate of parents who complete their work each 
semester is between 92% and 95% -- higher than the average for the entire 
college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it takes some parents longer than others, because your life is very 
complicated when returning to school with work and small children too, but I 
find the people who are trying to accomplish this task already have some extra 
oomph," Merkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College system recognized some 20 years ago that 
child care is a major obstacle for parents returning to school, he said, and 
provides help for some parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our function to serve those who can't afford private child care," Merkle 
said. The California Department of Education subsidizes fees for low-income 
parents. Programs are available for preschoolers ages 3 to 5 during the day. An 
evening program accommodates up to age 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Many non-traditional students fit schooling into their lives outside of the 
designated time frames set by schools. Kim Riley-Taylor, 38, of Orange, is a 
pharmaceuticals representative and mother of Jamie, 7. She attended Pepperdine 
University's two-year MBA program last year, but a series of life's upheavals 
led her to take a year off. While she finds school taxing, she said she will 
resume next year, hoping a master's degree will allow her to move up within her 
company and make her more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I talk to my daughter about choices. I like the idea of her seeing 
that sacrifices pay off," Riley-Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Fairchild, a 32-year-old divorced mother from Long Beach, feels her years 
in nursing school have taught her two sons, 7 and 8, a great deal about 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cut out a lot of the extras others take for granted," she said. "They 
see that we can manage with school and work too. They are a big help around the 
house and they understand they're a little more grown-up than most kids."

 After 15 years, Planned Parenthood Los Angeles Guild's annual "Men's Dinner" 
-- when the husbands of guild supporters help top local chefs prepare an 
elaborate gastronomic feast -- has come of age. There were women in the kitchen 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided it was not politically correct anymore" to allow only men to cook, 
said Evelyn Levitt, co-chair of Sunday's spread at Rex Il Ristorante. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women felt it was time they be included as sous-chefs," added co-chair Susan 
Levich. "Besides which, one of the three chefs de cuisine is a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Odette Fada, chef de cuisine at Rex, looked like she had her hands 
full -- and not just of carciofino alle mandorle, acciughe e capperi (baby 
artichokes stuffed with anchovies and capers). 
</P>
<P>
 "Interesting," was all Fada could utter after seven hours in the kitchen 
directing 16 novice assistants, five of them women, cooking for 145 waiting 
dinner guests. Fada, along with Giacomino Drago of Drago and Il Pastaio and 
Angelo Auriana of Valentino, shared kitchen duties, each overseeing a different 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
 The location, all three restaurants' owners had agreed, would be Rex -- "the 
most beautiful" restaurant, said Valentino's Piero Selvaggio, who was married 
in Rex's grand Art Deco room. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one mishap. Warner Bros.' Ben Cowitt, husband of guild 
president Adria Cowitt, cut his finger while slicing eggplant.  
</P>
<P>
 And there was no shortage of volunteers, since no experience was required. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a matzo brie once a year," said Gil Cates, who produces the Academy 
Awards telecast. "But I have a lot of regard for what goes on in the kitchen 
now. What surprised me is, it's not mechanized. It's a lot of hard manual 
labor. A little thing like cutting onions or shallots. You ever separate skin 
from the garlic? It's tiring ." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to do something for the community, and as a dad with three daughters 
I thought it was a good cause," said Patrick Lopker, who works at the Disney 
Channel. His eyes locked on a tray being passed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see those little pastry boats here that are coming out? (It was the 
carciofino. ) They handed me the dough and said, 'Make a boat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've ever done anything like this and I'm hooked for 
life," said Bill Kobin, president of KCET, adding with complete confidence (or 
nearly so): "I just want you to know that I did the squid. With a lot of help. 
I don't mean to take credit." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was expected to raise about $40,000 to provide reproductive 
health-care services to men, women and adolescents, regardless of their ability 
to pay. Planned Parenthood also supports education to combat teen pregnancy. 
"It's decreased nationwide," pointed out Adria Cowitt, "but is definitely 
increasing in L.A."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone who supports the cause is required to don a toque 
blanche. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said the only meal he has mastered is 
breakfast. "So dinner is a little out of my league. I have to recognize my 
limits."

HIS FAITH IS HIS MEDICINE; BROWNS' VARDELL MAKES HARD RELIGIOUS CHOICE BECAUSE 
OF KNEE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tommy Vardell was a little boy with a fever or stomach ache, the cure was 
always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 He would crawl onto his mother's lap and together they would lose themselves 
in prayer until the fever broke. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a young man with a sprained ankle or a broken collarbone, the cure 
was always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 He would find a quiet spot in his room, close his eyes, and once again look to 
his source of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he always found it. In his first 17 years as a celebrated running 
back, from the Pop Warner League to Stanford to the Cleveland Browns, he missed 
only three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turning to God, and leaning on him, has always been my medicine," Vardell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in a townhouse outside Cleveland, he is lost in prayer again. Only this 
time he is facing an injury more devastating, and the stakes are much greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardell is relying on his unusual faith to recover from reconstructive knee 
surgery that does not fit into the tenets of his religion. 
</P>
<P>
 As the NFL's only acknowledged Christian Scientist, Vardell, 25, had never 
visited a doctor on his own. He had never taken a prescribed drug, a spoonful 
of cough syrup or even an aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 When parts of his body were twisted, bruised or even broken, he refused to 
allow the routine applications of ice, heat or ultrasound stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was hurting, the only prescription he filled was for prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply know there is absolutely nothing that arises that can't be resolved 
by appealing to God and his laws that govern us," Vardell said in his first 
in-depth interview about the subject. "From Day One, Christian Science has been 
my health-care system." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the afternoon of Oct. 2, Vardell has used that system more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third play of a game against the New York Jets, Vardell reached back to 
catch a short pass from quarterback Vinny Testaverde. He was hit by Jet safety 
Brian Washington. Vardell's left knee twisted into Cleveland Stadium's wet 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The minute Vardell hit the ground, he began praying. 
</P>
<P>
 He was still praying several hours later when he was told the knee required 
surgery if he hoped to continue playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of procedure he had agreed to undergo, if necessary, before 
the Browns made him the ninth overall pick in the 1992 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the Browns he would honor his word and have the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also asked them if he could have a few days to work it out himself. The 
doctors wanted to operate immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 He surprised them by declining pain medication during the 36 hours before the 
operation. One of the attending nurses even commented that he couldn't believe 
Vardell was in no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He also surprised doctors by using no more than one day's worth of pain 
medication after returning home, two days after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Vardell is smiling and cheerful as he hobbles around his 
townhouse, wearing a brace that has already replaced a cast. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not have the drugged-out look some people have after a major 
operation. He has not gained weight, even though he has been unable to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm working with the trainers in their rehabilitation, but I'm 
getting some wonderful prayerful work done," he said. "It's not like I have 
this unbelievable faith that makes God's laws apply to me. His love for us and 
His healthy government of us applies to everybody, whether they are aware of it 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The oft-repeated statement by NFL insiders who know of Vardell's beliefs is 
not really a statement, but an amazed question. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he do it? 
</P>
<P>
 How does one of the 150,000 members of the Church of Christ, Scientist, 
survive in professional football? 
</P>
<P>
 "His beliefs and pro football, they seem so opposite," said Bill Tessendorf, 
the Browns' trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Football players routinely spend as much time in the training room as on the 
field, even when they are not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Many need pain pills or anti-inflammatory medicine merely to recover from a 
weekend game. Some take so much medication to help them survive a practice 
week, they could qualify as pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
 There are cortisone shots, electro-stimulation therapy, muscle relaxers, the 
cupful of pills delivered to your hotel room the night before an important road 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Vardell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really surprised he has gone this far while being able to stick to his 
beliefs," said Standley Scott, veteran Stanford trainer. "I really respect his 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott did not know of Vardell's religion when the running back signed with 
Stanford as an All-San Diego County running back at Granite Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vardell began politely refusing customary pills and routine treatments, 
Scott quickly figured it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't waive medical clearance," Scott said. "He had to be safe to play 
every week. But other than that, Coach (Dennis) Green ordered us to give him a 
lot of latitude." 
</P>
<P>
 When X-rays indicated a broken foot in his freshman year, Vardell politely 
turned down pain medication. Five years later, a more thorough predraft exam 
showed that there had never been a break. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how these things work out sometimes," Vardell said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he broke his collarbone in the final game of his college career in the 
Aloha Bowl, his refusal to medicate it, and perhaps hasten his recovery, was 
considered draft suicide by many. 
</P>
<P>
 His special workout for scouts later that spring, however, was impressive 
enough to move him among the top 10 picks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people wonder how I can practice this faith . . . I wonder, how can I 
practice anything else?" Vardell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every team that considered drafting Vardell in 1992 questioned him about his 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "With teams looking to invest time and money in me, they had to know they 
could handle me the way they saw fit," he said. "I understood their 
perspective, and while the circumstances weren't ideal, it seemed right to 
concede to their methods of handling injury for the greater good of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 While he undergoes more treatment than he would like, he is still allowed to 
refuse medication not absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The informal agreement we have is that we treat him, and the good Lord heals 
him," Tessendorf said. "But we'll give the good Lord a chance to heal him 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says that discomfort with his new environment did not contribute 
to his play, Vardell struggled through his rookie season, and early in his 
second year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed "Touchdown Tommy" by Green for his 34 touchdowns in his final two 
seasons at Stanford, Vardell didn't score until his 17th pro game. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first two seasons, he was given the ball only 270 times and gained 
1,013 yards, scoring three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season was different. He said he stopped worrying so much about 
fitting in. 
</P>
<P>
 He had become a proficient blocker and pass receiver -- 16 catches for 137 
yards -- while helping the Browns to a 4-1 record when he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he was becoming a Midwestern version of Dallas Cowboy fullback 
Daryl Johnston 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Belichick, the Browns' coach, was openly moved by his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy's a very special player," Belichick said. "Although I think we have 
good depth in our backfield, we don't have another Tommy Vardell, by any 
stretch of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 That last sentence can hardly be debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardell is the league's only player who never had a family doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 But contrary to popular perception about his religion, "I've always had a 
choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That statement is supported by the other strong Christian Scientist in his 
family, his mother, Travis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although juries have found the church liable for Christian Scientist children 
who died of untreated illnesses -- and parents guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter in those same cases -- Travis said that was never an issue in 
their El Cajon home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardell's father Ken is not a Christian Scientist, and was always given an 
option of taking Tommy or brother Ted to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, they are your children as much as mine," Travis said. "If you 
want to see a doctor, fine."  
</P>
<P>
 Ask Vardell about his various illnesses as a child and he shrugs. Because he 
never saw a doctor, he doesn't know what he had. 
</P>
<P>
 Only that he survived whatever they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I saw His work in my life, the more I understood me," Vardell said. 
"I realized that obeying His laws was not limiting, but freeing. And that 
living rightly is not self-righteous and isolating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I felt the peace and joy and power that was available to me, there was 
no way I could ever turn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends remember seeing cuts and scrapes on Vardell's body, even a nasty gash 
under his chin once. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was amazing," said longtime friend Donnie Carroll, a former outfielder 
in the Dodger system. "He was always fine. He always got through things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it very difficult to believe that he can have that same lifestyle now. 
But obviously, he has found a way." 
</P>
<P>
 That way includes a lifestyle that is often healing to others, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the most accommodating, gracious person I have ever met," said high 
school friend Reid Marquand. "He'll come back home for a vacation, we'll be 
sitting around at a restaurant and see somebody he hardly knows from a long 
time ago . . . and he always asks not just how they are doing, but what they 
are doing, and whether they are happy doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vardell is still famous at Stanford for surprising the insecure fifth-grade 
son of his fraternity house cook. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had been getting bullied at school by people who didn't believe he 
really knew Vardell. After hearing the story from the boy's mom, Vardell showed 
up at the school one afternoon and sat with the youngster during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 An old woman selling flowers on a downtown Cleveland street corner will not 
soon forget him, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardell once jumped out of his car, bought all of her flowers, and left her a 
huge tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry some of these stories are so syrupy," Travis said. "That's just 
Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
 The best story of all, Vardell figures, will occur when he runs onto the field 
next year with his knee in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 He will run, he says. And his knee will be in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he sees it, it doesn't take a medical degree to figure that out.

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN WORTHY IS GONE, SO IS LAST LINK TO SHOWTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Worthy is on the verge of retirement from professional basketball, comes 
word on the grapevine. Say it ain't so, James. Say it ain't so. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell us you will be there Friday when the Lakers play their first home game of 
the season. Tell us that we will see that whiskered, regal, Faberge egg of a 
face of yours. Your presence is required, sir. Friday is Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem is an actor and Magic's an owner and Jamaal's a realtor and Coop's a 
coach and Byron's a Pacer and A.C. is a Sun. For many of us, the Forum was like 
Camelot with hoops, but all of the knights have taken leave. We wouldn't 
recognize nine or 10 of today's Lakers if we passed them in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 So, get your golden tank top and bottom over to the gym, James, where you 
belong. That way you can be properly introduced and we can pay our respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last link to yesteryear, Worthy is halfway out the door marked Exit. He 
figures marginally at best in the Lakers' strategy. He went home to North 
Carolina for his mother's funeral, then was put on the injured list with 
tendinitis, so this is not the greatest time of James' life. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't blame him one bit if he quit. 
</P>
<P>
 First, if seeing James Worthy ride the bench is hard on us, imagine what 
torture it must be for him. Second, if the thought of Scott or Green or Kurt 
Rambis playing for Laker opponents is uncomfortable for you, picture Worthy 
making a jump shot against the Lakers. Makes me cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing James Worthy play for somebody else would be like hearing Chick Hearn 
call a Knicks-Celtics game. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I doubt that James has much left, apart from desire. Although he has 
always kept himself in tip-top shape, those original factory parts have a few 
hundred thousand miles on them. Nobody goes on forever, except vampires and 
Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, I can think of a couple of NBA organizations for which Worthy 
could probably be a starter. At forward last week, the Clippers started someone 
who had never spent one day in the league, and I am not speaking of some 
rookie. Worthy not only would be a Clipper regular, he would lead them in 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and don't mention anything to that Riley guy, but Worthy also could start 
for the Knicks. All he would need are goon lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of pro talent is strained. For example, should anyone out there 
have a son or nephew 7 feet tall or larger, please, submit applications. Among 
the starting centers in the NBA, we have Will Perdue, Chris Dudley, Benoit 
Benjamin, Acie Earl, Mark West, Jon Koncak, Joe Kleine and Felton and Elmore 
Spencer, all of whom are eligible for this year's No-Star game. Shawn Bradley 
stands 7-feet-6 and Saturday against Shaquille O'Neal he got one basket, one 
rebound and six fouls. Thanks for coming, big guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because forwards and guards are easier to come by, Worthy is more expendable. 
He is not as needed as A.C. Green, who was on the court for 46 of 48 minutes 
Sunday for Phoenix. As for Byron Scott, who was washed up as a Laker, he scored 
19 points Saturday for Indiana, in only 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often the last year or two, Worthy has entered a game for the Lakers 
and reminded us of what he once was. The man still knows where the basket is. 
His instincts are keen, his court sense is uncommon and, let me assure you, 
this is a player who, if he so desired, could make one heck of a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 A pay-scale structure guarantees that Big Game James' income over the next two 
seasons will be right up there with Big Dog Robinson's, even though the 
Milwaukee rookie has the distinct disadvantage of having won or done absolutely 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike another wealthy fellow, outfielder Mike Jordan of the Arizona 
instructional baseball league, Worthy has never publicly expressed any 
dissatisfaction with NBA life, or any desire to get out while the getting's 
good. I get the feeling the man simply finds pleasure in playing basketball. No 
way I'm telling him to wake up and smell the Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of teams that have to gulp hard before parting company with loyal 
people -- Joe Montana, Steve Garvey and Dale Murphy leap to mind -- the Lakers 
must hate the thought of nudging Worthy toward the door. But they also must be 
sensible. Yesterday's gone. The kids need the playtime.

TROJANS' MR. INSIDE; ONE MISTAKE CAN'T DETRACT FROM KOPP'S PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Pullman, Wash., last Saturday afternoon, USC's football team seemed in firm 
control of a game it needed to win to stay in the Rose Bowl race.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were ahead, 13-3, as the fourth quarter began, and Washington 
State's offense had the ball at USC's 33-yard line after a Cougar interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, USC experienced a rare breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jeff Kopp, considered one of the best linebackers in the Pacific 10 
Conference, muffed a play that gave the Cougars six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State quarterback Chad Davis found his tight end, Eric Moore, alone 
on the sideline and connected with a touchdown pass. On the play, Moore beat 
Kopp badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off the field in a rage, Kopp hurled his helmet at the Trojan bench. 
Then he kicked the bench. Then the defensive coordinator, Don Lindsey, 
approached him and held Kopp's head until they were nose to nose. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kopp, Lindsey said, "Listen to me! If they run that play 100 
times, I want you to cover it every time. You know why? Because I believe in 
you, that's why!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant a lot, when he said that," Kopp said. "I felt awful. It was one of 
the worst plays I ever made. They'd run that same pattern earlier and it became 
a screen that I'd covered for a no-gainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I hesitated a step and the guy got behind me. I blew it. Never in my 
career, going back to high school, had I been beaten that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone saw it. Everyone knew I'd blown the play. But after Coach Lindsey 
said what he did, the players came up to me and made me feel a lot better, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Kopp -- USC's leading tackler -- had one of his best games 
of the season Saturday. He had two sacks, a team-high eight tackles and helped 
stop several Cougar drives. 
</P>
<P>
 All season, playing one of two inside positions, he has been the linchpin of a 
big-play USC defense that has held its last three opponents to four touchdowns 
-- 10 points in the last two games -- in a four-game winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
 Kopp, a 235-pounder from Danville, Calif., is a three-season starter. He leads 
the Trojans (6-2, 5-1 in Pac-10) with 74 tackles, 21 more than the runner-up, 
linebacker Brian Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about him is his strength as a human being," Coach John 
Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has exceptional toughness, intelligence and leadership. Sometimes coaches 
hesitate to call players leaders, because the next thing you know they're 
shooting their mouths off.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Jeff's leadership style is quiet, nonverbal. There's a firmness to him, 
the way he talks to the other players . . . everyone just knows he's a leader.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he wanted to coach, I'd hire him tomorrow, if I had an opening. And if he 
was running for something, I'd vote for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp had 83 tackles a year ago while playing on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Lindsey for encouraging him to play a more aggressive, attacking 
style. And when you open the season against Washington and Penn State, is there 
any other way to play? 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after USC's 24-17 opening victory over Washington, Kopp was still on 
a high.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I came to SC, to play the best -- Washington, Penn State, Notre 
Dame. To play against a great back like (Napoleon) Kaufman and do pretty well 
against him, it's a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lindsey joined Robinson's staff in early 1993, he saw in Kopp a talented 
player fearful of errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Lindsey came in and watched films, and then watched me in spring 
practice, he told me he thought I was playing too conservatively," Kopp said. 
"He told me again when we went up to Oregon last season. He said: 'I want you 
to let it all fly, but above all else have fun out there. I know you love to 
play aggressively, so do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp partly attributes his 1993 conservative play to being at the wrong 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "At outside linebacker, I was worried all the time about getting beat by speed 
guys, and it affected how I played," he said. "I'm much more comfortable 
inside, challenging the run. To me, inside linebacker is like being on a stage 
-- it's a high-profile position. I love the challenge. When an offensive 
lineman comes after me, with a ballcarrier behind him, I take that personally. 
I love that challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenges are big in the Kopp family. Jeff's father, Tom, was his freshman 
football coach at San Ramon High in Danville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad loves challenging me to do more, to play harder," Kopp said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He came down to visit during training camp last summer. One morning he shows 
up with his jogging stuff on and wants me to run around the campus with me.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to tell him, 'Dad, we're in two-a-days now.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Or he'll sometimes come up to me in the off-season and say something like, 'I 
ran six miles today, Jeff. What did you do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp wears No. 35, which is identified with former USC linebackers Riki 
Ellison, Rex Moore and Scott Ross, who in 1990 turned it over to Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp was a redshirt freshman in 1990, Ross an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took me aside one day and told me about the other great players who had 
worn 35, and told me to make sure I wore it with distinction. Then he said, 'We 
don't want some blankety-blank offensive player wearing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The late-season surge by USC's defense, Kopp said, is simple maturation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young guys we played early, who were making some mistakes early, aren't 
young anymore and they aren't making many mistakes," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing loose and hard, and we aren't afraid of making mistakes. 
Freshmen like (defensive end) Darrell Russell, (cornerback) Brian Kelly, (nose 
tackle) Cedric Jefferson and (defensive end) George Perry have gotten their 
education on the field.  
</P>
<P>
 "Other teams, like Washington State and Arizona, might have better defensive 
stats, but we're not giving up many points and we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the tricky reading of defensive statistics, USC ranks seventh in 
Pac-10 total defense, yielding 390 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC has beaten four teams ranked higher defensively, among them Washington 
State, the conference's defensive leader. And Cal, beaten, 61-0, by the 
Trojans, ranks third defensively. Kopp, in his quiet way, talks like a player 
whose best games are ahead of him. USC meets Arizona in a game with major Rose 
Bowl implications Saturday, then UCLA and Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
 "Football and winning, it's all about goals," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is the Rose Bowl. I'm a senior. This is it for me."

A MAJOR LEAGUE QUESTION MARK; SOCCER: THERE ARE FEW DEFINITE ANSWERS ABOUT 
FUTURE OF ROTHENBERG'S VENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART and GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a decidedly tough room. More than 200 international soccer journalists 
were assembled in a Santa Monica hotel ballroom in April 1993 to hear World Cup 
boss Alan Rothenberg brief them on the progress of Cup preparations. It was a 
moment crucial to the credibility of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Rothenberg took over the flagging Organizing Committee, there had been 
a very real chance that the World Cup would be yanked out of the United States. 
That would have pleased many in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing confidently at the front of the room, Rothenberg was peppered with 
questions that had as their presumption the imminent failure of World Cup '94. 
Skepticism lurked behind every query. 
</P>
<P>
 When the organizer of the World Cup promised sold-out stadiums, French 
reporters stole sidelong looks at Italian reporters and rolled their eyes. When 
Rothenberg -- who, as far as this group was concerned was just another slick 
attorney -- began to speak of his plans for launching a new professional soccer 
league in the United States after the World Cup, veteran European sportswriters 
abandoned all protocol and laughed out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 As events have transpired, Rothenberg had the next laugh when the World Cup 
set attendance records. Who laughs last -- and at whose expense -- remains the 
subject of much speculation. THE CREDIBILITY GAP 
</P>
<P>
 Major League Soccer has a logo, an official game ball and contracts for 
uniforms for what the league has said will be 12 teams. There is a joint 
venture with ABC/ESPN. But since identifying seven league cities in June, there 
have been postponed announcements, missed deadlines and, mostly, silence from 
Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 No team names. No coaches. No players. One announced investor. 
</P>
<P>
 The information vacuum has spawned speculation and rumor in the tight little 
world of soccer, but even the sport's highest officials are in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem is that right now no one knows too much about what's 
going on," said Hank Steinbrecher, secretary general of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known so far: 
</P>
<P>
 -- MLS has made no announcement yet, but the league will not start next April. 
The league has failed to meet its original goal of raising $100 million from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only 10 cities -- not 12 -- will be in place for the first year, whenever 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only two of the announced franchise cities met the season-ticket sales 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An announcement identifying investors and additional cities has been 
postponed twice but will be made next Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Groff, commissioner of the rival -- and active -- American 
Professional Soccer League, surveys MLS's sophisticated, foot-noted business 
plan and the lofty but unfulfilled expectations of its executives and snorts, 
"It's a fantasy league that specializes in planning." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, soccer's international governing body, is said to have been angry but is 
now resigned to the fact that the United States has failed to fulfill one of 
the requirements it had agreed to as host country of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Some had hoped that MLS and the APSL, specifically their commissioners, would 
be able to set aside their differences and work together for the good of the 
sport. In recent weeks MLS and the APSL came close to agreeing to coexist as a 
single league, eight teams in a division. But progress always stopped at MLS's 
insistence that it be regarded as the Division I league and the APSL's 
superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, MLS agreed to drop plans to move into Colorado for the time being. 
The APSL operates a team in Denver and MLS had plans to put a team in Mile High 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The new franchise cities expected to be named by MLS are Chicago, Kansas City, 
Mo., and Tampa, Fla. Named previously were New York, Boston, the New Jersey 
Meadowlands, San Jose, Los Angeles, Columbus, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS' single-entity concept -- the league will own all players and franchises 
-- does allow for operator-investors to run local teams. But so far, only six 
of the 10 cities have investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been criticism of the league-ownership concept for flying 
in the face of free trade, MLS officials argue that the central control will 
allow MLS to avoid the problem of one or two big-spending owners throwing 
league salaries off kilter. The byword for now is parity.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem MLS has to contend with is its apparent failure to begin 
the league when it said it would. Rothenberg says he won't be limited by 
timetables, that he would rather start the league in '96 and do it right than 
rush into an April start. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one sponsor, however, is having trouble with the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating because we had come to an agreement based on the 
'95 season and were poised to go, and then . . . it became difficult to get 
information," said Peter Moore, vice president of global product marketing for 
Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as such, our sales efforts have stalled somewhat and we've had to 
back-burner a lot of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 USSF's Steinbrecher notes that, however unfair it might be, MLS bears the 
burden of every U.S. soccer failure that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who doesn't think that, doesn't have a grip on the reality of the 
situation," Steinbrecher said. "That's the reality. There have been failures 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely understand the arguments for waiting. I really do. But there is 
an opportunity for us to be on the shelf selling a product. And to me, that's a 
concern. From my seat here as general secretary of the federation, I'd like to 
see things move." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not merely another complaint. The USSF awarded MLS its Division I 
rights and it can take them away if the league fails to live up to its 
promises. WHERE'S THE MONEY? 
</P>
<P>
 MLS is existing on a $5-million loan it received from the World Cup Organizing 
Committee. Cash being hard to come by, MLS officials recently made an offer to 
the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation, which was established with $40 million 
of World Cup profit: In lieu of cash repayment of the loan, MLS offered $5 
million in league stock. The foundation passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all the start-up problems, raising money remains the most acute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that anybody's ever put together a league structure quite like 
this before," said Kevin Payne, vice president of Soccer USA Partners and a 
potential MLS investor. "It's like many investments. Everybody's sort of 
looking around, saying, 'Well, I'll jump in when you jump in.' At some point 
you have to get to the point where everybody's willing to hold hands and all 
jump in together. I think that's what Alan (Rothenberg) is working toward now." 
</P>
<P>
 Four shoe companies have signed four-year deals. Nike, for example, will pay 
each of its five sponsored teams $150,000, will provide $100,000 in marketing 
support and will supply uniforms and footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 There is big money -- perhaps $6 million -- expected from Dentsu, a major 
Japanese marketing-advertising firm, but there is no deal so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsley Nyce, owner of a U.S. Interregional Soccer League franchise in 
Columbus, said the money problems have to do with timing and ideas too big for 
modest soccer budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easy (flaw) is that between now and April '95, they want the teams to 
make just under half a million dollars in local advertising revenue to make the 
budget work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is absolutely impossible. I don't care what your marketing force is. The 
(problem) all the way around is that we're dealing with people who ran the 
World Cup. Now, they ran a very successful World Cup. I give them credit for 
that. But now it's changed. You can no longer spend whatever it takes to get 
the job done, which is what they did for the World Cup. You now have to spend 
in a range that you can have a return on, and that changes the game." 
</P>
<P>
 MLS's biggest financial drain might well be paying its commissioner. Its 
business plan calls for Rothenberg to be paid $1 million a year. Investors 
countered with an offer in the range of $250,000-$350,000. Sources say the 
commissioner's salary will probably be $500,000 to $700,000. WHERE WILL THE 
PLAYERS COME FROM? 
</P>
<P>
 Assume conservative numbers. Assume 10 MLS teams instead of 12. Rosters of 18. 
Assume five foreign players. That means 10 teams must find 130 American 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are they? 
</P>
<P>
 MLS officials speak of signing U.S. World Cup players who want to play in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 To whom are they referring? American players in Europe are playing 
professional soccer at the highest level possible. It has taken the hard work 
of a few Americans to pave the way for the rest and now it's possible for 
talented Americans to play in any European country. 
</P>
<P>
 These players are not going to mess with their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, there is the money factor. Will Alexi Lalas turn his back on 
more than $400,000 a year, a car and an apartment so he can return to the 
United States and play for $50,000-$70,000? As John Harkes, an American playing 
in England, observed, "The MLS can't afford us." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the foreign players, the entire league budget for transfer fees is 
$24.5 million. Transfer fees are not salary, they are fees paid to a player's 
club to obtain his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the best players in the world, transfer fees are astronomical. In 1992, 
for instance, A.C. Milan spent $20 million to get Gianluigi Lentini. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS officials say they don't expect to get the best players in the world and 
their budget seems to reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mark Abbott, MLS senior vice president, a dozen high-quality 
players will earn more than $100,000. The rest of the league will consist of 
30-35 players currently or formerly on the national team, 20-30 from the 
Olympic team, 20-25 from other U.S. leagues and an unspecified number of 
college players. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems identified with the downfall of the last great 
professional soccer experiment, the North American Soccer League, was its lack 
of emphasis on developing American players. MLS addresses this by limiting the 
number of foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a problem with that. Steinbrecher confirmed that the federation 
would allow only three non-American players per team. MLS literature indicates 
that there will be four foreign players on each team and league officials admit 
that it might be necessary to have five in the early years. WHO WILL WATCH 
THEM? 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott disputes the contention that the World Cup created soccer fans who 
won't wait for MLS to start in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never understood that argument," he said. "That's like saying 
professional basketball fans lose interest in basketball the day after the NBA 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was Abbott who wrote the MLS business plan, which spoke at length about 
capitalizing on the fan interest created by the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tears my heart out," said Mike Connell, who formerly played with the Tampa 
Bay Rowdies in the NASL and is now a businessman involved in promoting MLS in 
Tampa. "When you look at what the intent of the World Cup was and everything 
that the World Cup was intended to do, (it) is no longer available to us 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't say there is great momentum. We can't say there is great passion. We 
can't say the American people have proven that they love the sport. Because, 
obviously, all that has passed and is forgotten and nobody is going to worry 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nyce of Columbus said that since the initial rush of ticket sales, there has 
been little information for the fans and, subsequently, little interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, there's nothing going on here," he said. "They're going to 
play in a 96,000-seat stadium (Ohio Stadium). The intelligence level for that 
is just scary because (playing in huge stadiums is) what Alan (Rothenberg) said 
he'd never do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rothenberg and MLS officials insist that fans will watch a first-class 
league with top-level players. And everyone involved agrees that a postponement 
might help achieve that goal, even if the short-term criticism is sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Peter Moore of Reebok, "I'll support Alan on this issue -- I'd rather it 
not start off half-assed and start off in '96, than to get off to a poor start 
and once again invite the scorn and ridicule of the general press and media who 
are going to be against it from the get-go anyway and wishing that it fails."

RAVELING LEAVES HOSPITAL, BUT WON'T COACH SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling was released Tuesday from USC University 
Hospital but said he will not return to coaching for at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, walking with a cane, said at a news conference that he would need 
more rehabilitation before he has enough strength to return to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I am on the side of the mountain -- I am not on the top of the mountain 
-- and I have a lot of work to do to get back to being a normal human being," 
he said. "Right now, my No. 1 priority in life is my health, and it probably 
should have been that way for a long time before now but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, suffered nine broken ribs, a broken pelvis and clavicle, and a 
collapsed lung in a traffic accident near USC on Sept. 25. He had been 
hospitalized since. 
</P>
<P>
 "My official weight is 125 -- wait a minute, 225, and I can't tell you the 
last time I weighed 225," he said. "I would imagine at the time I came in the 
hospital, I was about 260 or 265. So, now the challenge is for me to keep my 
weight off." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said the accident had altered his viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective, I don't see how you can go through an experience like I 
have and have your life ever be the same," he said. "I think the situation 
demands that your life is going to be altered and you change the way you do 
things. For example, I'm going to put greater emphasis on the way I eat, I'm 
going to put greater emphasis on exercise and I'm going to place my health at 
the top of the realm, when to be honest, I never did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling will return for three days of therapy a week at USC University 
Hospital and leave coaching the Trojans to assistants Charlie Parker and Jack 
Fertig, along with Adrian Walters.

KNEE INJURY RESULTS IN AMPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors have amputated the lower portion of defensive end Jamie McPherson's 
right leg because of complications from a knee injury in Southern Mississippi's 
game last month against Samford. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson, a fifth-year senior from Grand Saline, Tex., had surgery Monday and 
was reported in stable condition Tuesday in the intensive care unit of a 
Hattiesburg, Miss., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had numerous surgeries Thursday through Saturday," Coach Jeff Bauer said. 
"He has had some clotting problems. They have done everything they possibly 
could do to help save his leg. It was to the point where they had to make a 
decision and go do that." 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson hyperextended his knee and severed a large artery when teammate Tim 
Bell's shoulder hit his leg as the two attempted a tackle.

 George Perles, wiping away tears, was fired as Michigan State's football coach 
Tuesday by a university president tired of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter McPherson, Michigan State's president, said Perles would coach the last 
two games of the season.The Spartans are 4-5 this season and 72-61-4 in his 12 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Perles, 59, who has three years remaining on his contract, was asked to 
resign. He refused and it will cost the university about $1.3 million to buy 
out his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this in the best interest of Michigan State? There's two sides to that," 
Perles said. "I have a lot of energy left and would still like to coach. But, 
I'm not being given that chance. I don't want to create any controversy. So I'm 
going out as a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Perles has always bragged about running a clean program, but in recent weeks, 
Roosevelt Wagner, a former player, claimed some Spartan football players 
received cash and had grades fixed to meet eligibility requirements. Perles has 
denied any wrongdoing.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WILD-CARD BERTH IS NEWEST GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no question Sunday's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs was a crushing 
defeat. It might have even ended the Raiders' hopes of winning the AFC West 
because it left them three games behind the front-running San Diego Chargers, 
also losers Sunday, with seven games to go. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still the wild-card berths. At 4-5, do the Raiders remain 
postseason contenders? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, four teams -- Kansas City (6-3), Pittsburgh (6-3), Buffalo 
(5-4) and the New York Jets (5-4) -- are ahead of them in the battle for the 
three wild-card spots. Of the seven opponents left on the Raider schedule, four 
have below .500 records. The overall mark of all seven opponents is 32-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring that a 10-6, or at least a 9-7, record will be required to squeak 
into the playoffs, the Raiders could make it by beating their four sub .500 
opponents, including the 4-5 Rams on Sunday, and then winning one or two of the 
remaining three against San Diego (7-2), Pittsburgh and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean winning five or six out of seven for a team that is below 
.500. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the Raider inconsistency, is it realistic to expect a turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we do?" Coach Art Shell said. "Do we just shut the engines down? We 
don't do that. We keep trying to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose, there's frustration from everybody. The easiest thing in the 
world to do is to drop your head. But you can't do that because there's still 
too much left in this season. Even if we were out of it, you've still got to 
play on. But the thing is, we're not out. We're still in this thing." STEVE 
SPRINGER

HOLLYWOOD PARK MIGHT SHOWCASE ECLIPSE HOPEFULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leftovers from the Breeders' Cup appear to be skimpy for the 34-day 
Hollywood Park season that starts today. If the meeting is to have any Eclipse 
Awards connotations, One Dreamer and Soviet Problem will have to run at the 
Inglewood track. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is more likely to get One Dreamer than Soviet Problem, and if the 
gray, 6-year-old mare were to win the $400,000 Matriarch on Nov. 27, Eclipse 
voters might have this decision to make in the older filly-mare division: 
Should they vote for Sky Beauty, a filly who has won 10 consecutive races in 
New York the last two years, but ran fifth and last in the Breeders' Cup 
Distaff? Or should they go for One Dreamer, who sneaked into the Distaff at 
47-1 and then stole off with a victory in the Breeders' Cup race that had been 
advertised as the toughest of the day to win? 
</P>
<P>
 Another option for Tom Proctor, who trains One Dreamer, is the $200,000 Falls 
City Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile dirt race at Churchill Downs on Nov. 24. The 
Distaff was also 1 1/8 miles on dirt. The Matriarch is 1 1/8 miles on grass. 
Leonard Lavin, a Chicagoan, uses Willard Proctor, Tom's father, as his trainer 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, One Dreamer deserves some sort of award for versatility this year, 
having won two stakes on grass and two on dirt. Her only Grade I victory was in 
the Distaff, but the Matriarch could give her a Grade I on grass as well. The 
Falls City is only a Grade III race. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the French-based Hatoof, the female grass title seems out of reach 
for American-trained horses, even Aube Indienne, who is the only runner with a 
chance to register a rare year-end double by winning the Yellow Ribbon at Santa 
Anita and the Matriarch at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatoof ran only twice in the United States this year, but both starts were 
highly visible as she beat Flawlessly, a two-time Eclipse winner, in the 
Beverly D. at Arlington International, and finished second to the French colt 
Tikkanen in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Hatoof was nominated for the Matriarch, but 
last Sunday, the day after the Breeders' Cup, she was sent by van to the 
Lexington, Ky., farm of her owner, Sheik Maktoum, where she will be bred early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hatoof was traveling Sunday, the owners and trainer of another talented 
filly, Soviet Problem, were thinking out loud about what to do next after a 
heart-breaking loss, by only a head, to Cherokee Run in the Breeders' Cup 
Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem is eligible for the Hollywood Turf Express, a 5 1/2-furlong 
grass race on Nov. 20. But that opportunity pales alongside the invitation that 
Soviet Problem has to run in Tokyo on Dec. 18. That purse, for running six 
furlongs on grass, is an estimated $1.8 million, compared to the Turf Express' 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo race, closer to the mailing of the Eclipse ballots, would have more 
of an impact on the voters if Soviet Problem won it. Her record of nine 
victories and three seconds in 12 starts this year is far superior to Cherokee 
Run's, but Cherokee won the Breeders' Cup Sprint the only time they met, and 
that might be enough of a barometer for the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champion sprinter, Cardmania, didn't win a race until October, but 
the voters supported him after he had won the Breeders' Cup Sprint in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Injured early this year, Cardmania got into an oversubscribed field for 
Saturday's Sprint only because he had won the race a year ago, and he justified 
the selection committee's decision by running third, less than two lengths 
behind Cherokee Run. 
</P>
<P>
 After the race, trainer Derek Meredith said that Cardmania is likely to run in 
the $100,000 Vernon O. Underwood Stakes at Hollywood Park, a six-furlong race 
on Dec. 10, and he's also expected to run next year, as a 9-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Breeders' Cup horse from California who ran well without winning was 
Dramatic Gold, who was third, behind Concern and Tabasco Cat, in the Classic. 
Dramatic Gold led the Classic with an eighth of a mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mile-and-a-quarter was just a bit too far for him," trainer David Hofmans 
said. "But he's going to continue to be tough at anything up to a 
mile-and-an-eighth." 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold might also resurface at the Hollywood Park meet. One of the 
first graded stakes, the $100,000 Laz Barrera, is 1 1/16 miles on Nov. 19, and 
the $100,000 Native Diver Handicap, at 1 1/8 miles, is scheduled for Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two $500,000 races on the schedule, the Hollywood Futurity, has been 
won three times by trainer Wayne Lukas, but he has closed the 1994 books on 
Timber Country, his Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner, and will skip the Dec. 18 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm figuring on the same program that Tabasco Cat had this year," Lukas said. 
"Timber Country will train in California, and he should have one race in 
February, one in March and one in April to get him ready for the (Kentucky) 
Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Park meet will start modestly today with the $50,000 Jim Hill 
Stakes for 2-year-old fillies. The season, which runs through Dec. 24, will not 
be without its specialties, which include night cards every Friday in the fall 
for the first time, and full-card simulcasting from Bay Meadows. Hollywood 
plans to put more emphasis on the Bay Meadows races than the recently completed 
Oak Tree Racing Assn. meet at Santa Anita did. . . . The meet also lists five 
different times for first post, with 12:30 p.m. the most frequent. The Friday 
night cards will have 6:45 starts, except for the 4 p.m. program Nov. 25. . . . 
Cezanne, the British 5-year-old who was ninth in the Breeders' Cup Classic, 
might be headed for Hollywood Park and a return to grass. . . . A new stake on 
the fall turf festival schedule is the $150,000 Hollywood Mile on Nov. 27.

BASEBALL TALKS CENTER ON TRUTH IN ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With baseball's collective bargaining scheduled to resume Thursday and likely 
to produce little more than familiar rhetoric, the owners have turned to the 
fans for salary-cap support, angering the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Management, in a full-page ad in today's USA Today, says the game can remain 
"affordable, accessible and competitive" only with a change in the compensation 
system, and that long-term viability and competitiveness have been threatened 
by "skyrocketing costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the union, said the ad is a cover for 
management's plan to implement the cap unilaterally and is designed to "fool 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's regrettable but not surprising, given their motivation through all of 
this," Fehr said. "The timing makes it crystal clear that their purpose is not 
to negotiate or reach an agreement but to conduct a public relations campaign 
aimed at the fans. They are hell-bent on imposing (the salary cap)." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Thursday at a resort in Rye Brook, N.Y., special mediator William J. 
Usery will preside over four days of negotiations. There have been only five 
negotiating sessions since the strike began on Aug. 12 and only one since the 
World Series was canceled on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources on both sides said there has been no change in the basic 
positions regarding the cap -- nor any indication that Usery, despite his 
impressive success in other stalemates, will be able to keep the owners at the 
table when their calendar dictates it is time to implement the cap, probably 
within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "These will be the first meetings of any substance and I'd like to believe 
something positive will happen, but we have no indication of that," Fehr said. 
"I'm not optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 It is anticipated that at some point during the renewed talks, owners' 
negotiator Richard Ravitch will reintroduce a reworked proposal, still based on 
a cap but without the $1-billion compensation guarantee for the players, the 
requisite last, best offer of sorts before implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig, reached at the clubs' marketing meeting in 
Phoenix, insisted again Tuesday that no decision had been made on 
implementation and that the ad in USA Today was not meant to be 
confrontational, having been written two weeks before this week's negotiating 
sessions were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that fans, players and management understand that at this time 
in history, baseball needs some fine tuning," Selig said in a statement 
released in conjunction with the ad. "That should be the context into which all 
parties seek answers and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been no sign of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have the once-promising back-channel talks between some owners and 
the union dissolved -- "The owners used Usery's presence to shut off 
negotiations," Fehr said -- but in their tit-for-tat relationship, both sides 
have filed charges of unfair labor practice with the National Labor Relations 
Board, and there have been four other grievances relating to the labor 
situation filed with baseball arbitrator George Nicolau -- three by the union 
and one by management. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a union attorney said the players are concerned about the absence 
of activity and the specter of collusion in the free-agent market and could be 
ready to discuss it next week.

MARLIN MAKE A COMEBACK; CONSERVATION EFFORTS OF LAST DECADE RESULT IN GREATER 
NUMBERS OF BILLFISH OFF CABO SAN LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The monster billfish emerged from the depths with angry eyes, its huge mouth 
agape and its long, bony snout pointing toward the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gentile's jaw dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fishing Cabo for 20 years and I never saw anything like it my whole 
life," said the 40-year-old Chatsworth resident, who goes by the nickname 
"Rocky." "All I could say is, 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 feet long and thick as a rhino, it was one of the largest blue 
marlin ever to surface off Land's End. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile was looking astern when the broad-shouldered beast popped out of the 
sea only 20 feet away. It whacked one of the trolling lures aside and inhaled 
the one at the end of Gentile's line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost went over the side of boat," said Gentile, who was holding the rod 
at the time. "I had to (loosen) the drag just to get back in the fighting 
chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Strapped in, using state-of-the-art gear and aided by some fancy boat 
maneuvering by skipper Bob Hamm, Gentile had the fish in the boat in less than 
an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, the deckhand, stuck it with a flying gaff, but the gaff-head failed to 
disconnect. The fish dove and Carlos, still holding on, went overboard, landing 
almost on top of the marlin, which could have done him in with one swipe of its 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all shouting, 'Carlos, swim away!' Gentile recalled of the incident 
nearly two weeks ago. "I was wearing a white T-shirt and . . . he turned just 
as white. His eyes were as big as the whole outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos was able to climb back aboard the boat. The billfish was then subdued 
with another gaff, hauled through the transom and "hog-tied" on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the marina, 12 people were needed to drag it up the ramp to the scale, 
where it measured 17 feet and weighed 993 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 For winning the Bisbee's Black and Blue marlin tournament, the world's 
richest, Gentile and his team netted more than $500,000 in money and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gentile said, "I felt very bad about keeping it, we usually release 
everything we don't eat. But it was a 1,000-pounder and we were in a 
tournament. And it ended up feeding a lot of poor people in town, so. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is sad when such a magnificent creature is taken from its world for the 
sake of money, but at the same time, were it not for people like Gentile, such 
creatures might not be thriving as they apparently are these days off Land's 
End. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, there were so many striped marlin you could almost walk on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy then, there were so many boats fishing for them they were almost 
crashing into each other," said Tracy Ehrenberg, 30, who with her husband, 
Marco, owns the Pisces Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 And the late summer and fall have produced some of the best fishing anywhere 
for blue and black marlin, with many in the 500-pound class and some, such as 
Gentile's, nearing 1,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 This, many say, is a direct result of Cabo's growing conservation movement, 
born of necessity a decade or so ago. Every year, more marlin fishermen get 
hooked on catch-and-release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're even releasing blue marlin," said Marco Ehrenberg, whose Pisces 
Fleet boasts a release rate of nearly 80%. "Before, it didn't matter what size 
blue. A 100-pounder? You killed it, just because it was a blue marlin. Today, 
they say, 'Oh I released a 300-pounder, a 400-pounder. Five years ago, that 
would be on the dock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Billfish Foundation of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which promotes billfish 
conservation, has honored Pisces with its group achievement award in four of 
the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pisces isn't alone. Other fleets now stress release as well, and many of 
the hotels award customers certificates for setting their marlin free. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only marlin being killed these days, it seems, are in tournaments. 
But even tournaments, a huge source of revenue, have gotten into the act. Some 
offer prizes for most releases as well as for biggest fish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bisbee's event, only fish weighing more than 300 pounds were eligible 
for weigh-in, and only 19 met that requirement. About 150 smaller marlin were 
released. Gentile said he would have gladly released his near-grander, had 
there been a way to weigh the fish at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, who would have believed him, what with the money at stake? 
</P>
<P>
 "If people were honest, we could have the greatest tournaments in the world -- 
all release tournaments -- but they're not," said Bob Smith, a 20-year Cabo 
resident whose wife, Minerva, is the local International Game Fish Assn. 
representative and runs a tackle store and the sportfisher, Minerva III.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not. But most of the thousands who compete in tournaments here are 
also avid year-round anglers who, like many who come to Cabo each year, have 
long since quit slaughtering their billfish for the mere sake of having their 
pictures taken with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I killed a marlin -- and, believe me, I do a lot of fishing -- 
was probably five years ago," said Tom Lowey, 73, a retired San Diego-area car 
dealer who has been fishing in Cabo for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago Cabo San Lucas had a couple of hotels and a cleared strip of 
dirt for an airport. The city was born because of the abundance of marlin off 
its coast and now, with a resident population of about 30,000, still relies on 
the swift and powerful billfish for its survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there weren't any marlin, there wouldn't be any of that," said Dave 
Kaminski, 57, pointing from the deck of a cruiser to a sprawling city that now 
boasts dozens of hilltop mansions and a waterfront cluttered with condos and 
five-star resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminski and his family, from Indiana, discovered Cabo San Lucas 10 years ago 
and have been coming here twice a year since. "We don't fish tournaments, and 
we don't keep marlin," said Chris Kaminski, 31.  
</P>
<P>
 A refreshing attitude, considering that the marlin resource was dwindling 
rapidly in the 1980s, in large part because of pressure by the foreign 
long-line fishing fleet, which was expelled a few years ago, but also because 
of the growing number of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Today an average of about 300 boats, with two to six anglers aboard, leave the 
harbor every morning to try their luck on the high seas. Some still return with 
dead marlin, and occasionally a 70- or 80-pounder is hung from the waterfront 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 But more often it is only the marlin flags fluttering in the wind that 
indicate a boat's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not advertise with a dead fish on our boat," Tracy Ehrenberg said. 
"People come in and when we sign them up, we start by asking, 'What do you want 
to do with your marlin if you're lucky enough to catch one?' And nearly 
everybody now says, 'We want to release them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a law passed a few years ago, at the behest of hotel owners and the 
local sportfishing association, those who insist on killing their marlin are 
allowed one a day. The sportfishing association is pushing for an even stricter 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law says you can kill one, so six guys with licenses go out on one boat 
-- they can kill six marlin," said Marco Ehrenberg, president of the 
association. "We're trying to get the law changed to one marlin per boat and as 
many releases as you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that these waters are prolific with a variety of challenging and tasty 
game fish, notably tuna, dorado and wahoo, few are likely to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest to convince that killing marlin is not in anyone's best interest 
in the long run are some of the local cruiser and panga captains and crews -- 
mostly independent operators or those from the smaller fleets -- who have long 
relied on marlin as a means of advertising but also as food. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem we really have here now is with our own people who won't 
release the fish," Smith said. "But you've got to remember, too, that for many, 
many years, that was their diet here. That was the only thing they had to eat.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was no electricity, there was no refrigeration, so they would cut the 
marlin up, take it home, salt it and hang it over the clothesline. You didn't 
see any clothes on the clothesline; it was all marlin. So it's going to take 
them awhile to get over that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but judging from the number of flags flying in the hot afternoon sun 
these days, it seems they're on the right track.

DIGEST: BOXING TO RETURN TO HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Grand Ballroom of the Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills will be the 
site of a second boxing show, Nov. 23, starting at 7:30 p.m., organizers 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing's debut one week ago in the upscale West Valley was marred by confusion 
stemming from a late change in the seating configuration inside the hotel's 
venue.The fire department requested the elimination of about 140 of 1,344 seats 
after a last-minute safety inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, boxing action was delayed twice -- for a total of about 40 
minutes -- and refunds were distributed to about 300 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fight promoter Peter Broudy said revised plans for a 1,088-seat venue were 
approved by hotel management and the fire marshall on Monday. "No one will feel 
the difference," Broudy said. "There's all kinds of aisles. It's perfect." MIKE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Wilson of Moorpark College posted his sixth victory in seven races this 
season, but Glendale placed five runners among the top seven finishers to 
dominate the team competition of the Western State Conference cross-country 
final Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a former standout at Newbury Park High, timed a course record of 19 
minutes 50 seconds over the four-mile distance at Kenneth Hahn Park in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who set the record of 20:05 in the season-opening Santa Monica 
Invitational, was never seriously challenged. He had a nine-second lead after 
the first mile (4:36) and more than doubled that at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nacho Delgado (20:10), Jacques Sallberg (20:15), Eduardo Macias (20:25) and 
Jose Padilla (20:29) placed second through fifth for Glendale as the Vaqueros 
totaled 21 points to win their sixth WSC title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (76 points), Bakersfield (84), Santa Barbara City (96) and College of 
the Canyons (133) rounded out the top five. GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: For the past two seasons, Rigby has toiled in the shadow 
of running back Josh Hawkins, who leads area Southern Section players with 
1,459 yards rushing. Rigby, who usually blocks for Hawkins, has rushed for 538 
yards in 103 carries, has 10 receptions for 105 yards and is the Rangers' 
second-leading scorer with seven touchdowns.His presence in the backfield has 
helped Hawkins amass more than 3,000 yards in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: In Nordhoff's 36-27 victory over Moorpark last week -- a 
game that figures to determine the Frontier League championship -- Rigby stole 
the show. He scored on runs of 34 and four yards, and threw for a touchdown on 
a 42-yard play.

SIDELINES; DYNAMITERS COULD USE MORE EXPLOSIVENESS, DUKE'S SWAGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Mike Hiserman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before he became John Wayne and a movie legend, Marion Morrison 
demonstrated true grit for Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, Morrison, a 170-pound senior guard, "battered great holes through the 
line," as reported in the school yearbook, helping Glendale to a Southern 
Section football championship with a 26-0 victory over Compton. Seventy years 
later, the championship remains one of only two the Dynamiters have won. The 
other was in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's interesting is, they even called him 'the Duke' back then," said Pat 
Lancaster, a journalism teacher at Glendale and curator of the school's 
archives. "Every senior had a nickname -- 'Droopy,' 'Lefty,' 'Mac.' It's right 
here in the yearbook: Marion (Duke) Morrison." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the field, young Wayne served as sports editor of the school paper, vice 
president of his junior class and was a member of the Shakespearean club. From 
there, he went to USC on a football scholarship and rode tall in the saddle as 
a hero in dozens of westerns before dying in 1979 at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne obviously went on to greater fame, but the real standout of the Glendale 
line was tackle Jesse Hibbs. He was selected state player of the year, went on 
to be named All-American in his junior and senior seasons at USC and later 
played for the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters could have used such heroes this season. Glendale, which 
concludes its season Thursday night with its annual game against cross-town 
rival Hoover, is winless in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 No qualms: Best known for the fleet feet that have rushed for 929 yards in 
seven games, Mario Qualls used quick thinking and an accurate arm to lift the 
Kilpatrick football team to a dramatic 15-14 victory over L.A. Baptist last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 After running 53 yards for a touchdown to bring Kilpatrick to within 14-13 
with nine minutes to play, Qualls got the call on the two-point conversion and 
started around right end. Seeing his path blocked by several defenders, he 
raised up and threw a strike to Shawn Reed in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The play was not designed as an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls, who rushed for 223 yards against L.A. Baptist, would be the tailback 
at Inglewood High had he not landed at Kilpatrick, a camp for juvenile 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10, 185-pound senior was suspended for the first two games this 
season but has returned to lead the Mustangs (7-2, 3-1 in league play) to the 
brink of a Division X playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Farrar side: In Nordhoff's 36-27 victory over Moorpark -- a game that 
probably determined the Frontier League football championship -- the Farrar 
family played prominent roles. Senior linebacker Brian Farrar had two sacks, 
sophomore linebacker Russell Farrar returned an interception 45 yards for a 
touchdown and their father, Coach Cliff Farrar, successfully gambled twice in 
his play-calling. The Rangers converted a fake punt for a first down and a 
halfback pass for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Net return: The Highland High girls' volleyball team has won nine matches in a 
row and the Golden League championship -- the first title won by a girls' 
program in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Highland boys' team last spring surprisingly vaulted into 
playoff contention. The Bulldogs were undefeated during the regular season and 
advanced to the Southern Section Division II title match. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Coach Mike Bird, the teams have few things in common. The boys 
feature a quick-strike offense. The girls play tough defense and often score 
after long rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls don't hit the ball super hard like the guys do," Bird said. "We try 
to make the other team make mistakes." Quotebook  
</P>
<P>
 Going into Thursday night's Marmonte League football showdown, Agoura High 
Coach Charlie Wegher believes he has discovered a defense that will contain 
Westlake receiver Billy Miller and the Warriors' high-powered offense: "We're 
going to play with 16 guys, and put four of them on Miller." Statistics  
</P>
<P>
 He holds the unusual distinction of leading the Santa Clara High football team 
in receiving and passing after nine games, but Andy Super's numbers still don't 
quite live up to his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Super has 16 catches for 282 yards and two touchdowns. He has completed 48 of 
97 passes for 443 yards, but unfortunately, he has thrown 14 interceptions. 
</P>

 Three wide receivers, Isaiah Mustafa of Moorpark College, Tim Hilton of 
Glendale and Rodney Williams of Pierce were selected football offensive 
tri-players of the week in the Western State Conference. Pierce linebacker 
Selves Smith was named defensive co-player.

<P>
 Fab five: Cal Lutheran placed five players on the All-Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference men's soccer team. Halfback Jeff Aycock and 
fullback Mattias Larson were first-team selections. Forwards Brian Collins, 
Frode Davenger and Jan Hammervold were chosen for the second team. Things to Do

PLAYERS BOYCOTT PRACTICE BUT IT'S A MYSTERY; NORTHRIDGE FOOTBALL: NO REASON 
GIVEN BY DOZEN OR SO PARTICIPANTS, WHO ARE PLANNING NEXT STEP; COACH BURT 
PERPLEXED BY LATEST DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another peculiar development in a season punctuated by distraction and 
disappointment, a handful of Cal State Northridge football players boycotted 
practice Tuesday for undisclosed reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen players skipped practice without informing Coach Bob Burt of 
the particulars of the decision, leaving their status for Saturday game against 
Northern Arizona up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycotting players were scheduled to meet late Tuesday night to discuss what 
happens next, according to sophomore defensive back James (Scoody) Woods, one 
of the players who didn't attend practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't decided what the next move is," Woods said. "We need to get 
together before we say anything. . . . We have reasons, but we aren't going to 
voice them right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the missing players are from the defense, which held a lengthy meeting 
with coaches after practice Monday. Players aired grievances over a number of 
issues, including coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of it, but not all of it," Woods said. "There's just some things 
here that we agreed shouldn't be going on. It's going to all work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the players who missed practice were several key starters, including 
defensive backs Joseph Vaughn, co-captain Vinnie Johnson and Woods; linebackers 
John Herrera and Tony Simon; and running backs Mark Harper and Shaun Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Darren Walton, expected to start at tailback for the first time 
Saturday, defensive back Robert Crosby, linebackers Arnie Madrid and Miguel 
Cerna, and defensive lineman Tim Gardner also were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the team boycotted practice on the Monday before a nonconference 
game against Nevada Las Vegas. Players cited their growing dissatisfaction with 
the level of funding for the cost-containment program. No players were 
suspended or benched. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt guessed the boycott Tuesday was as much a part of the team's growing 
frustration -- Northridge has lost three games in a row -- as anything. 
Northridge was bombed, 45-20, last weekend by Southern Utah and fell to 3-5 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, players who miss practice without authorization would not start, 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge secondary Tuesday consisted of junior cornerback Jim Rose and 
two freshmen who are redshirting -- not enough players to field a team. Emile 
Williams and Robert Camacho, who have yet to play in a college game, would use 
a year of eligibility if they play. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt seemed mystified at the latest distraction for the Matadors. The team 
already has had to cope with the defeat of a controversial student-fee 
referendum that might result in the program's elimination, and a starting 
player was charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said he learned of the walkout shortly before practice Tuesday, then 
received confirmation after conferring with some of the 43 players in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I'll find out when they tell me what the reasons are," Burt said. "I 
honestly don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one player who boycotted practice has questioned the action taken by 
his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what's going on," Crosby said Tuesday night. "There's a lot of 
frustration right now and I'm trying to figure this out myself. But there was a 
consensus and I went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Players who attended practice also were at a loss to explain the absence of 
their mates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to think -- I don't know enough to have an impression," 
said a player who asked not to be identified. "I'm not sure anybody knows much 
about this. I'd just like to know, why now, and for what reason?" 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, it marked another jarring pothole on a tortuous road for the 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not one thing, it's another," the player said. "Welcome to 
Northridge."

BOYS' VOLLEYBALL COACHES STILL IN LIMBO OVER PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District held discussion Tuesday night on a motion 
to pay stipends for boys' volleyball coaches at Buena and Ventura highs, but a 
decision won't be finalized until the next board meeting on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board currently pays all coaches in all sports except for walk-on 
assistants and boys' volleyball coaches at Buena and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and players representing the two teams hoped for a resolution, but 
must meet with the superintendent to clarify questions before the next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little confusion about which budget the money needs to come out 
of -- they thought it was (for) next year, but we want it for the spring." said 
Christine Coil, president of the Buena boys' volleyball booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents originally asked the school district to begin paying stipends in late 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boys' volleyball teams were formed in 1989, the district, citing 
funding shortages, placed the burden of paying the coaches on the parents and 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and players raise approximately $5,000 each season for the varsity and 
junior varsity coaches through fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go ahead and proceed like we've got to raise the funds 
ourselves," Buena Coach Steve Berk said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS ; LEGISLATIVE SEATS; BEILENSON, SYBERT CLOSE; GALLEGLY IS EASY 
VICTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson and Republican challenger Rich Sybert were locked in 
a tight race to represent Thousand Oaks in Congress after early returns, while 
Rep. Elton Gallegly won an easy victory over a little-known Democratic opponent 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a humbling experience to have such a strong level of support," 
Gallegly said of his lead, also noting the Republican landslide nationwide. "At 
the very least, this should be a wakeup call for the President. People in this 
country want change." 
</P>
<P>
 In the west county's two open seats in the state Legislature, Democratic 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell built a comfortable lead over Republican Steve 
MacElvaine for the state Senate, and Republican Brooks Firestone was easily 
outpacing Democrat Mindy Lorenz to replace O'Connell in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to our success has been our strong bipartisan support," said 
O'Connell, who had a strong showing in traditionally conservative absentee 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent lawmakers were apparently headed for victory in the county's two 
other Assembly districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) appeared on her way to handily 
defeating Democratic opponent Josh Arce, a 19-year-old UCLA student, in the 
38th Assembly District that covers Simi Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 And Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) surged far ahead of his Democratic 
challenger, Dorothy Maron, an old adversary from his years in Oxnard city 
politics. Takasugi represents the 37th Assembly District that stretches from 
Oxnard to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty confident we're going to come through victoriously," Takasugi 
said. "We didn't feel it was going to be much of a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the county's races, Beilenson's bid for a 10th term in Congress 
attracted the most attention and political donations from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former planning director for Gov. Pete Wilson, lent his campaign 
more than $400,000 to kick-start his first bid for Congress. He attacked 
Beilenson as "weak on crime, weak on defense and tough on taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of his congressional colleagues, Beilenson did not shrink from 
supporting President Clinton. The congressman told voters that despite 
Republican claims, the Democratic-controlled White House and Congress have made 
progress, passing a crime bill, national gun-control law, family leave plan and 
deficit-reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Beilenson criticized Sybert for "ripping off" California 
taxpayers by moonlighting as an attorney while he was on the governor's 
payroll, and characterized him as "PAC-Man" for accepting at least $60,000 from 
special interest political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson refuses PAC donations -- a campaign theme that he broadcast to the 
24th District's voters in the San Fernando Valley and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring 23rd Congressional District, Democratic challenger Kevin 
Ready complained that Beilenson and statewide Democratic candidates siphoned 
off all the available campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ready, an attorney and former Army and Navy officer, attacked incumbent 
Congressman Gallegly for waffling on anti-crime legislation, refusing to 
support Clinton's decision to send troops to Haiti and even how Gallegly 
avoided the draft nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ready's cash-starved campaign was never able to deliver his message to the 
voters in a district that includes most of Ventura County and Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Gallegly, he mostly ignored his opponent. He said he spent less time 
and money on this race than any of the previous four reelection efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question we could have spent more money," Gallegly said. "But our 
objective was to win the election and have some money left in the bank for the 
next time." He predicts his campaign will end up with $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 18th Senate District race, Assemblyman O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) ran a 
$1.1-million race against MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo County 
supervisor. The district covers Ventura, Santa Paula and the Ojai Valley as 
well as all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine went on the offense early in his nearly half-million-dollar 
campaign, hammering O'Connell in political mailers and television commercials 
as a tax-and-spend Democrat. He maintained that O'Connell, as one of Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown's top lieutenants, should shoulder part of the blame for 
the state's economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But some conservatives quit channeling political donations to MacElvaine after 
he announced his opposition to Proposition 187 and its ban of health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, O'Connell unleashed television ads that attacked MacElvaine for 
supporting offshore oil drilling along the district's coastline while he was a 
member of the California Coastal Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 But most of O'Connell's campaign was focused on touting his achievements, 
especially how he has helped constituents cut through knotty problems with the 
state bureaucracy. And he intensified his effort by taking his campaign in 
person to the voters' doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted for Jack O'Connell," said Don Essig, who moved to Ventura in August. 
"He came by my house and I was impressed with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th Assembly race, both Firestone and Lorenz spent considerable time 
walking precincts to personally contact voters. They also engaged in one of the 
county's nastiest and most expensive campaigns, trading blows in radio and TV 
ads and in a blizzard of political mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who owns the Firestone Winery in northern Santa Barbara County, 
fired off the first hit-mailer. It featured a large picture of a color-changing 
chameleon, intended to draw attention to Lorenz's history of switching 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Firestone issued mailers that accused Lorenz of being a political 
extremist who wants to legalize such drugs as cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz struck back with a mailer that accused Firestone of being involved in a 
voter fraud case against two women who submitted the names of dead people as 
newly registered Republican voters.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th Assembly District, Takasugi spent minimal effort defending his 
seat against Maron, a former Oxnard councilwoman. It was not the first time 
Maron had challenged Takasugi for his job. Four years ago, she tried, but 
failed, to unseat him as mayor of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Maron criticized Takasugi for doing little to curb crime 
and joblessness during his first term in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi dismissed Maron's criticism as the rabble-rousing of a desperate 
politician. He said he has already helped business by joining in successful 
legislative efforts to pass tax credits for manufacturers and reform workers' 
compensation laws.

LOCAL ELECTIONS ; PROPOSITION 187; LAST-MINUTE RALLIES HELD BY STUDENTS 
</P>

<P>
 Student protests over Proposition 187 -- including Ventura County's first 
demonstration in support of the initiative -- continued Tuesday as community 
activists mounted an 11th-hour push to defeat the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nordhoff High School in Ojai, supporters and opponents of the initiative 
squared off in competing noontime rallies. At Ventura High School, about 50 
students walked out during a morning break in that school's only anti-187 
march. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Oxnard, about 75 students from Frank Intermediate School took to the 
streets about 8 a.m. to support a group of hunger strikers who have been 
fasting since Sunday to demonstrate opposition to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The students marched to Oxnard's Plaza Park, where they were joined by Oxnard 
High School students on a three-mile march through the city. Along the way, 
they waved placards and chanted "Raza (the people) Si, Wilson No." 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't just here to ditch school," said 14-year-old Beto Bustos, an 
eighth-grader at Frank Intermediate. "We're fighting for our education." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, about 50 of the protesters joined a door-to-door push to get voters 
to the polls. Led by the hunger strikers, most of whom are Oxnard College 
students, they fanned out across Oxnard's La Colonia district. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Inda and Alma Becerra, both 15-year-old Oxnard High students, knocked 
on one door after another, exhorting residents to vote against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you voted yet?" Alma asked a woman in Spanish. The woman said she 
hadn't, but that she planned to do so later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, be sure to vote no on 187," Alma urged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'll vote no," the woman answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though their day off from school had cost them detention, Alma and 
Michael said it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it to support our race," said Michael, who took part 12 days ago in a 
1,200-student walkout, the largest in the county against the initiative. "And 
my parents don't mind that I walk out. I'm fighting for what I believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Lawson, an immigrant-rights advocate who coordinated Tuesday's voter 
drive, said more volunteers than usual took part in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of people are doing this specifically because of Proposition 187," 
Lawson said. "Without the 'No on 187' campaign, we probably would have had 
fewer volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that campaign, many voters said Tuesday that they supported the 
initiative, which would deny public education, non-emergency health care and a 
host of other benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Mussi, a Thousand Oaks resident who immigrated from Italy 57 years ago, 
said he voted for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took hard work for me to come to this country legally, and I think it's 
disgraceful that after working this hard, I have to spend my money to pay for 
people who come illegally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, 73-year-old LeRoy Andrews said he was infuriated by the student 
protests against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree that kids need an education," Andrews said. "But if they are going to 
go around carrying the Mexican flag, they ought to go to Mexico and get an 
education there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Westlake Village resident Heidi Helstrom said she opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do, there are going to be people here illegally," she said. "At 
least people should have the chance to be healthy and to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
 At Nordhoff High, about 50 students lined a sidewalk in front of the school, 
holding signs and chanting anti-187 slogans. They were met by a smaller group 
of students, also holding signs and chanting slogans in support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide driveway separated the two groups. The students exchanged angry words 
but otherwise did not clash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Bluntschly, an 18-year-old Nordhoff graduate, said he joined the 
counterprotest to voice his views on the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely pro-187," he said. "I was born and raised in California and I 
don't think that illegal immigrants should be able to get better health care 
than I can." 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura High, about 50 students walked out of school and down to De Anza 
Middle School, where they urged the younger students to join them. Hundreds of 
De Anza students, some of whom marched to Ventura High in their own protest 
Monday, were prevented by teachers from joining the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the high school students said they felt compelled to speak out 
on the immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're marching so everybody knows that 187 is not a game," said Sheila Lara, 
an 18-year-old senior from Ventura High. "For me it's a challenge, and we stand 
up to this challenge."

LOCAL ELECTIONS ; CITY COUNCILS; VOTERS FAVORING INCUMBENTS IN CLOSE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County voters on Tuesday elected representatives to eight city 
councils, apparently favoring incumbents in several close races. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Thousand Oaks, five candidates bunched at the top of the pack, including 
incumbents Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah. In a race too tight to call, 
firefighter Andy Fox and police detective Michael Markey, both pro-business 
candidates, also surged in early returns. Former Councilman Lee Laxdal also 
emerged as a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Oxnard, incumbent Tom Holden, an optometrist, jumped to an early lead 
amid a crowded field of little-known candidates. Businessman Dean Maulhardt, a 
descendant of two prominent farming families, pushed toward the front of the 
pack as well. Also in the running were former Oxnard solid waste superintendent 
John Zaragoza and longtime city activist Roy W. Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Simi Valley, the two candidates with the best name recognition -- 
Councilwoman Sandi Webb and former police chief Lindsey Paul Miller -- led 
slightly in early returns.  
</P>
<P>
 While Ventura's ballot did not feature a council race this year, voters did 
confront a heated campaign on a key policy issue: whether to reopen Poli Street 
near Ventura High School during school hours. The ballot initiative seeking to 
open the street, Measure E, was losing by a substantial margin in early 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the county's council races -- in Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Thousand 
Oaks -- featured more than 10 candidates. With so many names leaping off the 
ballots, some voters said they leaned toward candidates with the greatest name 
recognition -- either incumbents or longtime local activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked for people with a track record in the community," said Bonnie 
Hampton, 76, as she left a Thousand Oaks polling place early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Webb, apparently on her way to winning a second term, 
said incumbents enjoy a definite advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a track record that people can look at and see . . . how you 
actually perform as opposed to what you say you will do," Webb said. "I think 
that goes a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county's nastiest local race was in Thousand Oaks, where 16 candidates 
fought for three seats in a campaign marred by death threats and vandalism.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in city history, the race produced two slates, emphasizing 
the ideological split running through the fierce campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and the two political novices she endorsed -- city operations manager 
David Hare and retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari -- promised to slow growth, 
expand public parkland and adhere strictly to all city development standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, on the other hand, billed herself as "the voice of reason" and argued 
that council members must compromise to achieve fair solutions. Her generally 
pro-development stance won an endorsement from retiring Mayor Alex Fiore, who 
also backed three challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite mudslinging between the factions, some voters said they were glad that 
so many candidates with so many ideas had entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it was encouraging that there was such a large field of candidates and 
so many of them were just Joe Regular people," said Brian Saline, 39, a 
Thousand Oaks banker. "It's good that when people are fed up, instead of just 
complaining, they want to go out and do something about it."  
</P>
<P>
 In marked contrast to Thousand Oaks' no-holds-barred race, the seven 
candidates jostling for two seats in Simi Valley ran clean campaigns, with 
little mudslinging. Incumbent Webb and the six challengers held similar 
priorities: Keep the city safe, build a bigger police station and bolster the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, opposed only by a teen-age, write-in 
candidate, was poised to win his fifth term on the council by promising to keep 
the city on its current track. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, Oxnard's crowded council race focused on hotly contested 
local issues, such as how to redevelop fading neighborhoods and how to provide 
more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven candidates bid for two seats, with several political newcomers arguing 
that the council needed a fresh perspective to guide the city's long-term 
growth. Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez ran unopposed for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city needs stronger economic growth and it needs redevelopment," said 
Kirby Shaw, 62, who voted for two challengers in the Oxnard race. "I think it 
needs to happen, after this election. I think it needs some new life." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, another hectic council contest turned into a referendum on 
two key issues: the fate of a proposed recreational-vehicle park and the future 
of the city's small Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme officials have estimated that the RV park could bring in $400,000 
each year. But environmentalists have fervently fought plans to develop the 
park along the fragile dunes of Hueneme Beach. The newly elected council 
members will decide the sensitive issue. They will also vote whether to disband 
the city's police department or raise taxes to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also seemed to be favoring incumbents in Camarillo, where candidates 
debated the merits of a proposed civilian airport at the Point Mugu Navy base; 
in Fillmore, where one challenger vied with two incumbents; in Ojai, where the 
main issues were tourism and traffic, and in Santa Paula, where candidates 
outlined rival plans for attracting new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those races were low-key and low-budget, they featured full ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, no one stepped forward to challenge the three incumbents -- Mayor 
Paul Lawrason and councilmen Bernardo Perez and John Wozniak. Rather than spend 
$4,500 to hold an uncontested local election, the council decided earlier this 
fall to appoint the three incumbents to fresh four-year terms. 
</P>

LOCAL ELECTIONS ; COUNTY RACES; HEAVY VOTER TURNOUT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS; 
SUPERVISORS: CANDIDATES FOR 2ND AND 4TH DISTRICTS ARE LOCKED IN CLOSE CONTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid an unexpectedly heavy county voter turnout, Thousand Oaks Councilman 
Frank Schillo and challenger Trudi Loh were locked in a tight race for one 
supervisor's race late Tuesday, while Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery battled in another close contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The two races were the most prominent on the county ballot on an Election Day 
dominated by Proposition 187 -- which ended up pushing Ventura County voters to 
the polls in greater numbers than election officials had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials initially projected only 59% of the county's 351,921 
registered voters would cast ballots -- about the same as in the last two 
gubernatorial elections. Instead, Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters, 
said that number might go as high as 65% by final count -- a turnout of roughly 
229,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I can think of that would be driving this is (Proposition) 
187," Bradley said Tuesday night. "And the early returns show that this county 
is strongly in favor of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A computer glitch delayed the counting of absentee ballots, so that only about 
half of the 48,000 absentee ballots were counted late Tuesday, Bradley said. 
The problem made it difficult for many candidates to judge their chances of 
victory by the early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the votes were being counted at the County Government Center, hunger 
strikers who had camped for three days without food in Oxnard's Plaza Park 
literally brought the issue to the election headquarters, marching seven miles 
through the dark to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Riot-helmeted sheriff's deputies greeted them there -- some standing guard on 
the roof, others mounted on horses, and still more stationed around the 
building waiting for a larger wave of angry protesters that never came. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the 2nd Supervisorial District, Schillo took a slight early 
lead over his aggressive opponent, attorney Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will hold on to the lead," Schillo said. "It's got to be related 
to the amount of work I put into the race personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, however, remained hopeful that she would close in on Schillo's lead 
before the night was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still right in there," she said. "But I'd rather be ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates were running for the seat being vacated by Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk, who is stepping down after one term. VanderKolk's district covers 
most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th Supervisorial District, Mikels held a slight early edge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery said it was too early to concede in the 4th District, which 
covers Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell anything from these figures. We don't even have all the absentee 
ballots counted yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two supervisorial races, incumbent Thomas O. Mahon was 
outdistancing challenger Richard Morrisset for the job of county 
auditor-controller, according to early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 County voters also cast ballots Tuesday for eight candidates seeking three 
seats on the county Board of Education and for eight running for three trustee 
seats in the Ventura County Community College District. Voters also elected new 
members to eight city councils, 17 school boards and 18 special district 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tallman, a former Ventura College administrator, was ahead in the early 
vote in the district's Area 1, which covers Ventura, Saticoy, El Rio and north 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates were battling it out for an open seat in Area 2, covering the 
Oxnard Plain, Thousand Oaks and the Santa Rosa Valley. College Trustee Pete E. 
Tafoya was unopposed in Area 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Albert Rosen had an early lead for one seat on the Ventura County 
school board, while challengers Angela N. Miller and Marty Bates were leading 
in the races for two other seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's two biggest local races, the battle for the 2nd Supervisorial 
District turned into one of the most expensive ever. Schillo and Loh, a 
political newcomer, spent more than $200,000 in a bitter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The key fight was over a proposal to develop a landfill at Weldon Canyon near 
Ojai. Loh, who ran on a pro-environment platform, opposed the plan, preferring 
instead to explore other options for disposing of the county's trash, including 
possibly shipping it elsewhere by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo attacked Loh's proposal, saying it would more than double trash rates 
for east county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh lashed out at Schillo for his record on development during his 10 years on 
the Thousand Oaks City Council and accused him of mismanaging city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Thousand Oaks voters surveyed at the polls Tuesday said they 
favored Schillo because of his support for the city's new $64-million Civic 
Arts Plaza, which Loh once criticized as "a senseless project." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be wonderful," said resident Deborah Duclon. "It means my 
7-year-old child is going to be in a city where there is culture. And to me, 
culture is education." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh supporters, however, said they believed the project was too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been good times, that would be one thing," said Bernice Booz, 83. 
"But there are so many other things that need to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the county's 4th Supervisorial District heated up in recent weeks 
when Montgomery demanded that Mikels reveal her stand on Proposition 187, the 
statewide ballot measure that would deny most government benefits to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels refused, saying that Montgomery was trying to exploit an issue that had 
no place in the supervisors race. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels counterattacked Montgomery, accusing him of misleading the public about 
his college education. She said he claimed on his resume to have a bachelor's 
degree in management from Pepperdine University, when in fact he lacked 12 
hours of general education courses and did not receive his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major issue the candidates disagreed over during the campaign was a 
proposal to train county firefighters as paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by firefighters, Montgomery supports such a program, which he said is 
needed to improve emergency response times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, who received campaign contributions from the county's largest private 
ambulance company, said she is not convinced a county paramedic program is 
needed and does not want government taking on more services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some voters surveyed Tuesday said they were not impressed with either 
candidate because both received strong support from developers.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; RAINS MAY DELAY MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>

<P>
 With meteorologists forecasting a 60% chance of showers beginning this 
evening, a trio of helicopters may not make their third malathion-spraying 
mission to combat the crop-eating Medfly today, said Larry Hawkins, an official 
with the Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said the spray operations in eastern Camarillo could also be delayed 
or canceled for the evening if winds are more than 15 m.p.h. A decision on 
tonight's operations will not be reached until late this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rule of thumb is that we won't go if there is a 50% chance of rain or 
greater in the 24 hours after an application," Hawkins said. "After all, it's 
not very effective if it just washes away." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities battling the Medfly infestation say they will adjust 
their spraying schedule near the Thanksgiving Day holiday so not to 
inconvenience residents living in the 16-square-mile spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spraying Nov. 23 -- Thanksgiving eve -- cooperative officials said 
they will move up the spraying 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it would be easier on everyone by moving it one day," said 
Douglas Hendrix, a cooperative spokesman. "Additionally, we felt that on the 
night before a big holiday, there would probably be more people running around 
later in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
 An 86-square-mile quarantine zone was established after the Medflies were 
discovered Sept. 29 near St. John's Seminary. So far, 63 of the pests have been 
discovered, but there has not been a new find since Oct. 6, Hendrix said. J. E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; BRIDGING A GAP IN COMMUTER CONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new concrete bridge with wider lanes, shoulders and a sidewalk was open for 
traffic south of Fillmore on Tuesday, replacing a narrow, 65-year-old steel 
landmark that in its day claimed more than a few side-view mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Mayor Pro Tem Roger Campbell said local residents were happy to see 
the opening of the new bridge, which carries traffic on California 23 over the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old bridge, while it is picturesque, was way too narrow for modern 
vehicles," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said some drivers stopped to make sure no one was coming in the other 
direction before they dared to dart across the old bridge. Others lost 
side-view mirrors in minor scrapes while trying to squeeze through, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One impatient elderly woman reportedly had a habit of barreling through the 
center of the old bridge, her tires straddling the double yellow line. Locals 
knew to watch out for her, Campbell said, but her vehicle once collided head-on 
with that of some out-of-town visitors. No one was injured in the crash, 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the new bridge began in March, 1993, Caltrans spokeswoman Pat 
Reid said. The entire project, including demolition of the old bridge, will 
conclude in April, and cost $6 million, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bridge was open Tuesday only to southbound traffic. Officials said it 
should be open completely for a ribbon-cutting ceremony inaugurating the new 
bridge on Tuesday. Reid said the event will include speeches by local 
politicians and a parade of antique cars. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENT, 14, KNIFED; SCHOOLMATE 
ARRESTED

<P>
 A Valley View Junior High School student escaped serious injury when four 
classmates attacked him with an Exacto knife, Simi Valley police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested one of the assailants, age 14, on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon and released him after referring the case to juvenile 
authorities, said a report by Lt. Tony Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said the victim, a 14-year-old white youth, was standing in front of 
the school about 3 p.m. Monday when four Latino schoolmates came up. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the youths held the boy against the wall while the fourth put an 
Exacto knife to his throat and laughed, Harper reported. They then let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes later, three of the four youths chased the victim and he fell 
to the ground. The youth who had held the knife to the victim's throat poked 
him in the back with it, cutting his clothes and scraping his back, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials reported the assault to police at 9 a.m. Tuesday, and 
Detective John St. Laurent, who patrols the schools, arrested the suspect, the 
report said. Police later recovered the knife from the suspect's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are still investigating the assault, but they do not believe that 
it was gang-related, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Valley View student Phillip Hernandez, 14, stabbed classmate Chad 
Hubbard to death. Hernandez was sentenced to serve four years in a California 
Youth Authority facility for involuntary manslaughter. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESPONSE LUKEWARM TO PROPOSED INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura councilman's proposal to add a city initiative to next November's 
ballot has met with lukewarm enthusiasm from his colleagues, at least one of 
whom said he would like to know more about the idea before he supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett proposed a ballot measure that would exempt a city 
lemon orchard from a save-the-greenbelt initiative -- land that has been at the 
center of a tug of war between developers and preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett brought his proposal before the council Monday night, but council 
members Rosa Lee Measures, Gregory L. Carson and Gary Tuttle could not vote on 
the issue because they have conflicts of interest. The remaining council 
members said they were not comfortable with the measure as it currently reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom said he wants to see a legal draft of the initiative 
before he makes a decision. "I want to wait and discuss it a little more," he 
said. "It'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of development on the city-owned, 87-acre orchard was the reason 
nearby homeowners proposed the greenbelt initiative last spring. The measure 
would forbid development of any land designated agricultural until 2010, unless 
the project was put to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchard, at the corner of Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue, carries the 
agricultural zoning and can only be developed if the council amends its 
Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenbelt initiative is slated to be on the November, 1995, ballot. 
Bennett's measure would exempt the orchard from the greenbelt law as long as 
its development was linked to construction of a regional park -- a major goal 
of the council. The council wants to use the orchard to help cut a deal for an 
eastside park, trading permission to develop homes on it for a park site.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY WON'T CONDEMN MOBILE HOME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of debate, Ventura City Council has decided against condemning the 
Ventura Marina Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Park tenants have lobbied the city for years to condemn the property and force 
the family that holds the lease on the park to sell it to the homeowners.These 
tenants say they are tired of paying rent hike after rent hike and want to 
control the park's finances themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until September, Wayne and Norma Peterson, the lease's owners, were willing 
to participate in the condemnation. However, in a letter to the council dated 
Sept. 19, the Petersons said they had waited three years for a decision and 
could wait no longer. They will oppose any such proceedings in the future, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's council meeting, council members heard from some residents who 
opposed the condemnation proceedings, including Mary Meyer, a former member of 
the mobile homeowners' board of directors.  
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of buying the park is a good one, but the cost involved and the 
money available makes it impossible at this time," said Meyer, who maintained 
that only one-third of the residents supported the condemnation. "Everybody 
keeps talking about, 'We're going to own our property, own our land.' We're not 
going to own anything but a lease."  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were wary about wading into the domain of private 
property rights anyway, but with such disagreement between the owners and the 
residents -- and even among the residents themselves -- they would certainly 
steer clear of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I felt there was a unanimous feeling out there (in favor of condemnation) 
that might sway me," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, before the council voted 7 to 
0 to oppose the condemnation. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HOMEMADE BOMB SHATTERS WINDSHIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A homemade bomb shattered the early morning calm and a construction worker's 
windshield in Simi Valley on Tuesday, but injured no one at the home where it 
exploded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone packed a small aluminum tube with explosive material, taped BBs to it 
and placed it on a white Ford Ranger pickup truck owned by Richard Diaz, 28, 
said Simi Valley Police Detective Roger Meffan. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb went off about 5 a.m., damaging the truck and embedding shrapnel up 
to one-inch deep in the plywood door of the garage the truck was facing, Meffan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone was within 10 or 15 feet of it, it would have caused serious 
injury," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was asleep on the other side of house, and called police after the blast 
woke him, Meffan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the bombing could have stemmed from a dispute between Meffan and a 
neighbor, but they are still trying to establish a clear motive for the attack.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY KEEPS BUS ROUTE FROM HARBOR TO MALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pelted with heartfelt requests from disabled residents, the Ventura City 
Council has elected to keep SCAT Bus 12 running between Ventura Harbor and the 
Buenaventura Mall -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 City analysts had asked the council to request cancellation of the route to 
the South Coast Area Transit board.The SCAT board usually accedes to such city 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus carries about nine riders an hour and recoups only about 8% of its 
cost, city officials said. Ventura could face up to a $250,000 public 
transportation budget deficit next year, and eliminating the route would have 
saved the city $95,000, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday night, the council watched as resident after resident approached 
the microphone to explain how SCAT Bus 12 gave them transportation to the first 
good job they have ever had. Most of the speakers have some form of mental 
disability and work as housekeepers at the Colony Harbortown Marina Resort, 
through a program organized by Goodwill Industries.  
</P>
<P>
 Tammie Wheatley, the hotel's general manager, capped off the appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take this bus away from (my employees) now would be a cruel and 
devastating thing to do," she said. "Housekeeping is the hardest job on my 
staff to do, the hardest and the lowest-paid, and these people are so proud and 
happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council members decided to retain the bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also authorized the mayor to meet with officials from other west 
county cities, to devise a plan to cut the cities' contributions to Metrolink, 
the commuter train connecting Ventura County with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city officials maintain that west county residents are paying a 
disproportionately high share of Metrolink costs, since west county ridership 
is not very high. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEAMSTERS LOCAL TO BE MONITORED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A national Teamsters representative has been appointed to monitor the 
activities of Teamsters Local 186, according to union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 186, which represents 2,400 Teamsters in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, came under investigation by national union leaders this past summer 
after some members accused local officials of various improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 National leaders held a three-day hearing in Ventura in August to consider 
whether local union officials should be ousted and replaced with trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they appointed Ed Mireles, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 952 
in Orange County, to monitor Local 186 for an undetermined length of time. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said it was very unlikely a trusteeship would have gone into 
effect since all the local leaders in question were voted out of office in an 
election Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations against the leadership included claims that they had locked some 
members out of meetings and physically threatened Scott Dennison, who then was 
the local's president and is now secretary-treasurer, which is the union's 
chief administrative officer, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union had also been accused of refusing to allow Dennison to sign checks 
or review financial matters for the local, even though it was a requirement of 
his position as president, Hawkins said. MARY F. POLS

 A 38-year-old Oak Park man accused of setting fire to his own home pleaded not 
guilty Tuesday to charges of arson, brandishing a weapon and cruelty to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In an arraignment, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles Campbell set a 
Dec. 12 trial date for Richard Rose on charges related to a Sept. 29 incident 
where, following an argument with his wife, he allegedly set his house ablaze 
and then brandished a knife at two neighbors who attempted to help, Deputy 
Dist. Atty.Richard E. Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is also facing a charge of animal cruelty, because the two family dogs at 
the Pesto Way residence were trapped by the flames and died of smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose himself fled the fire by jumping out of a second-story window, Simon 
said. He was arrested a short time later. Rose remained in Ventura County

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMPAIGN DONATION AMENDMENT DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisors on Tuesday delayed amending a Ventura County ordinance that limits 
the amount of money residents or businesses can contribute to candidates 
running for county offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the wishes of Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, the board voted 4 to 1 to 
wait a month to consider changing the law, saying they want to gather 
information from current candidates and their treasurers about this year's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who did not seek reelection to the board, said she wanted to amend 
the law before she left office. But her colleagues on the board said it would 
be more prudent to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance needs a lot of work, and this is kind of a piecemeal approach," 
Supervisor John K. Flynn said. The proposed changes "are not going to do the 
job," he said. "There are too many loopholes in it." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who wrote the 1991 campaign finance reform ordinance, said she 
wanted to clear up confusion about the rule, which limits the amount candidates 
can receive from individuals and businesses to $750 during primary campaigns 
and $250 during general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not correct some of the problems that are glaring?" she asked. "Why not 
pass (the amendments) today?" 
</P>
<P>
 The other board members, however, said more analysis needs to be done before 
the ordinance can be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairwoman Vicky Howard suggested the one-month delay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the board directed staff members to survey each of the 
candidates for current county offices, as well as California Common Cause and 
the League of Women Voters about the effectiveness of the current ordinance.

 Federal disease officials confirmed Tuesday that three Ventura County 
residents died of valley fever, an airborne fungus carried on clouds of dust 
kicked up by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Centers for Disease Control reported that a 71-year-old Simi 
Valley man died in March in an unprecedented outbreak of 203 cases of the 
flu-like illness that followed the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But after further investigation, the agency attached two more deaths -- a 
56-year-old Oxnard man in May and a 71-year-old Newbury Park woman in June -- 
to the valley fever outbreak, a CDC epidemiologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three deaths will be outlined in a report that the CDC plans to forward in 
two weeks to the Ventura County Public Health Services Department, said the 
CDC's Dr. Eileen Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider and other federal researchers began investigating the connection 
between valley fever and the earthquake after Ventura County logged four times 
more cases in a few weeks than it had reported in all of 1993. Schneider would 
not name the people who died, citing their families' right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park woman died of valley fever-related pneumonia about two months 
after she was diagnosed with the illness, Schneider said. The Oxnard man, who 
had suffered diabetes and other medical problems, also died about two months 
after being diagnosed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual that people die of valley fever," Schneider said. "It's 
rare, but it does occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley fever is actually a fungal infection scientists call 
coccidioidomycosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus lives in the earth, but the Jan. 17 earthquake and hundreds of 
aftershocks threw it into the air in tan-colored clouds of dust, researchers 
believe. And hundreds of people -- particularly in Simi Valley and eastern 
Ventura County -- inhaled the spores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In about 60% of cases, the infection produces no symptoms. But within about 
two to five weeks of inhaling the spores, some people experience flu-like 
exhaustion, coughing, high fever and even pneumonia. The illness usually hits 
older people the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 120 of the 203 earthquake-related cases of valley fever afflicted 
Simi Valley residents, while about 40 were found in Thousand Oaks and even 
fewer in Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, before the earthquake, there were only 52 cases of valley fever 
diagnosed in all of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake-related cases were noted on a map in the county public health 
department, which showed that valley fever spores might have spread out 
southwesterly from Simi Valley toward Thousand Oaks on seaward breezes before 
thinning out over the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.8 earthquake was centered in the San Fernando Valley, but 
health officials there have reported little change in the numbers of people 
infected there: Only 46 cases had been reported there by late August.

WITNESS TELLS OF THORNTON'S HAND-WASHING COMPULSION; COURTS: EX-GIRLFRIEND 
TESTIFIES HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH SCRUBBING DAYS AFTER SHOOTING DEATH OF KELLIE 
O'SULLIVAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Accused Thousand Oaks murderer Mark Scott Thornton developed an obsession with 
scrubbing his hands clean in the days after Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan's 
shooting death, his ex-girlfriend testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was scratching the skin off them, like they were really dirty," Stephanie 
Campbell, 17, told the jury hearing Thornton's death-penalty trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it wasn't dirt above the skin," she added. "It was below the skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's testimony in Ventura County Superior Court came during a 
contentious cross-examination by Thornton attorney Susan R. Olson, a deputy 
public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Campbell was kidnaped by Thornton and held for five days 
against her will after the defendant had already killed the nurse and stole the 
woman's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell first told sheriff's investigators about the defendant's 
hand-cleansing obsession after he was arrested in Reno, Nev., on Sept. 19, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Campbell testified that she was unaware of O'Sullivan's murder at 
the time and had no idea why Thornton was suddenly so compulsive about his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike her lucid testimony under direct examination a day earlier, Campbell 
often said she could not remember events about her abduction during four hours 
of lively cross-examination Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson sought to show that Thornton loved Campbell at the time of the abduction 
and would not have done anything to harm her. He had plenty of opportunities to 
hurt her if he wanted, she suggested, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Her questions also implied that Campbell never tried to get away from her 
captor. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell remembered that shortly after her abduction, Thornton shed his shirt 
and revealed on his shoulder a tattoo displaying her name. Recalling the moment 
brought tears to Campbell's eyes and caused a short delay in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris asked her why she had cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a tattoo with my name on it on his back," she said. "I feel . . . that 
he was obsessed with me, and he was very possessive. And that scares me." 
</P>
<P>
 To her knowledge, the tattoo is permanent. "I don't want it on his body," she 
said. "I don't like the fact that he sees it everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first night of the abduction, the two stayed at a Bakersfield Econo 
Lodge, where Thornton made her wait in the bathroom with him while he showered, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also pressed the witness about why she never tried to escape at several 
stops Thornton made as they drove to Northern California, after leaving 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney was also curious as to why Campbell did not tell investigators 
about those stops at various department stores until just several months ago in 
August -- nearly a year after her abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell responded that she did not remember exactly what she told 
investigators when she informed them about making stops at J.C. Penney's and 
Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was only two or three months ago, and you don't remember that 
conversation?" Olson asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Campbell replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange was typical of the day's acrimonious dialogue between Thornton's 
attorney and his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also noted some inconsistencies in statements Campbell had made to 
police and the girl's court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell declared she was telling the truth in court. Her statements to 
police, she said, came soon after Thornton's arrest, a time in which she was 
still shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock. I was very excited because I got to go home and see my 
family," said Campbell, who testified that she has moved from the area with her 
mother in search of a new start. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, however, Olson asked her if she realized the importance of the 
trial, that Thornton is fighting for his life. She said she understood that. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson honed in on the fourth day of the abduction, when Thornton and Campbell 
woke up at Patrick's Point Campground in San Francisco and went to a festival 
in Arcata. Campbell said that the mood was indeed festive and a lot of people 
milled around, including police officers. She said, however, that she never 
felt comfortable trying to alert any of them of her predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That next day, she said, she did finish her shower at the campground before 
Thornton finished his, but still did not seek help for fear that he would harm 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 On their fifth day together, the two arrived at the Circus Circus casino in 
Reno, Nev., where, after two hours, Campbell got help when Thornton "walked 
away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the defendant phoned her once from jail after she arrived back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he tell you that he loved you?" Olson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Was he crying?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you tell him that you hated him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hang up on him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Campbell answered.

LANCASTER MAN NAMED A STATE TEACHER OF YEAR; EDUCATION: JOB IS 'MY ONE AND ONLY 
EXPERIENCE WITH LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,' EX-COLLEGE DROPOUT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After dropping out of college, Dick Chapleau drifted from job to job, waiting 
tables, punching a clock in a department store, desperately fearing that he had 
wasted his prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost by accident that the 39-year-old Lancaster man fell into 
teaching. From the start, the guitar-playing, doggerel-spouting teacher knew 
that he had found a career, calling the classroom job "my one and only 
experience with love at first sight." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, others are saying it shows. The Palmdale High School science instructor 
has been named a teacher of the year in California and will represent the state 
in the national competition next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel like Cinderella. I was so lost in my life, and now here I am," 
a happy Chapleau said Tuesday. "How do you describe it when you know in your 
heart you're where you're supposed to be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau's "mixed past" is familiar to his students because he tells them 
about it while instilling real world lessons. "If I tell them, 'You can make 
huge mistakes and still recover,' that's better than a lot of what I teach 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau arrives on campus 90 minutes early to prepare for the day. He tutors 
students on school holidays and, when the campus was short on computers, he 
persuaded Los Alamos National Laboratory to donate them. 
</P>
<P>
 But students appreciate other qualities. "He's funny, like goofy," said Tacha 
Jeanty, a 15-year-old sophomore. "He's so silly; it's like he's an ordinary 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 "He acts like he's doing it for fun, not because he has to," Kidron Incle, a 
17-year-old senior, added after Chapleau regaled the class Tuesday with more 
jokes than David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of nitrates, he said: "That's how much a hotel charges you in the 
evening -- a night rate." The class groaned. 
</P>
<P>
 He also entertained them with his guitar. "I've got the chemistry blues from 
my head down to my shoes," he sang. "My GPA's going from a 4.0 to somewhere 
around 2." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks he deserves it," Jeanne Hicks, a 14-year-old sophomore, said 
of the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau was a graduate student in molecular biology at Cal State Northridge 
when his girl dumped him and his world fell apart. He went to work waiting 
tables and worked at Bullock's before he started teaching in 1987. He joined 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District in the fall of 1989 and now 
co-directs Palmdale's medical magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau was selected the district's teacher of the year in the spring, then 
became one of 12 teachers from Los Angeles County picked to compete in the 
state program. He was chosen one of five state teachers of the year. The 
national winner will be chosen in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau said his philosophy is to "teach from your heart, not from your mind. 
You can't be a slave to your material, but you still must teach it." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, "don't make me sound like a hero in doing this. Every school 
has phenomenal teachers. If you go out there, you'll find them."

L.A. COUNTY'S CHILD ABUSE TOLL ON THE RISE; VIOLENCE: FORTY-ONE DIED AT HANDS 
OF PARENTS OR CARETAKERS LAST YEAR. YOUTH SUICIDES HIT NEW HIGH OF 44. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports of child abuse and deaths rose in nearly every category in 1993, led 
by a grim toll of youthful suicides that have child welfare experts perplexed 
and worried about the well-being of children in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four young people killed themselves last year, the most such suicides 
recorded in any of the six years that those statistics have been kept. The 
youngest victim was 11. In nearly three-quarters of the cases, the method of 
choice was a firearm, usually a family gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleak numbers are included in a report to be released today by the Los 
Angeles County Inter-Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect (ICAN), which 
also found that the overall number of child abuse cases jumped nearly 24% in 
1993. The council was established in 1978 to review child deaths and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a child in Los Angeles County is probably more difficult now than it 
has ever been," said ICAN Executive Director Deanne Tilton. "They are living in 
a place where violence abounds and where stresses due to the economy, isolation 
and lack of services contribute to fear and insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 The report lands at a time when public attention has been galvanized by the 
tragic deaths of two young South Carolina boys allegedly killed by their 
mother. Their deaths have sparked a renewed concern over the exploitation and 
abuse of children and how such cases can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one of the few downturns locally, child abuse homicides in Los Angeles 
County actually dropped, with 41 reported in 1993 compared to 46 in 1992. It 
was the second year of decline in that category, following a record 61 victims 
in 1991. The report notes that the rate of child homicides by parents or 
caretakers has dipped from 1 in 10,000 children in 1989 to 1 in 13,225 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, over the past five years, not a month has passed in Los Angeles County 
without the death of a child under age 2 at the hands of a supposed protector. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers, the largest category of perpetrators, were involved in 25 of the 
slayings. Seventy percent of the child abuse homicides were caused by direct 
assault -- head bashing, punches to the stomach, strangulation, suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 1993 victims, a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old, were shot by their 
parents or caretaker. One father fed his 3-month-old daughter a fatal 
concoction of 20 to 30 iron tablets, which he ground up in her formula. The 
majority of victims -- 69% -- were under age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the public attention given to child abuse homicides and the tragic 
nature of such cases as the one in South Carolina, the difference between an 
abused child and one abused to death is only a matter of degree, child welfare 
experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every child who dies, at least 10 kids are hospitalized for abuse," said 
Michael Durfee, a child psychiatrist with the county Department of Health 
Services and an expert on child abuse prevention. "Most assaults on kids 
involve an explosion, and whether one explosion kills a kid or results in 
injury is just luck. If we want to prevent these deaths, we have to prevent 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics were gathered by social service providers, county agencies, 
schools, hospitals and law enforcement officials who documented cases ranging 
from the murder of a newborn girl found at Los Angeles International Airport 
with tape covering her mouth and nose to the death of a 16-year-old boy who, 
despondent over not making his high school football team, hanged himself in his 
bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, educators and law enforcement officials have attributed rising 
child abuse rates to increased public awareness and better reporting methods. 
But there is mounting evidence that, in Los Angeles County at least, the 
numbers reflect real increases, spurred in part by a protracted recession that 
has strained the psyches of the region's children as well as its adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Children suffered more physical and sexual abuse, severe neglect, 
exploitation, emotional abuse and lack of adequate food, shelter and clothing 
than ever before, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 And they suffered accidental deaths at an alarming rate as well. One hundred 
and four accidental deaths were reported in 1993, including 40 drownings, the 
most water-related deaths in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a definite parallel in the rise of abuse and neglect and the rise in 
the last several years of welfare recipients, unemployment and economic 
strains," Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, chairman of the council, 
said in an interview. "Certainly the depressed economy has created a highly 
tense atmosphere in many families, where a child . . . suddenly becomes a 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistic most perplexing to child welfare experts is the explosion of 
childhood suicides, the 44 deaths representing a 69% increase over 1992 
figures. Child psychiatrist Durfee called the suicides of an 11-year-old and a 
12-year-old last year "an incredible comment" on the state of the condition of 
children in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1993 victims, 84% were male. And although 17-year-olds have committed 
more suicides over the past six years than any other age group, the average age 
of victims is decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cases examined was that of a 14-year-old boy who left a suicide note 
saying he was despondent over how his father had disciplined him. He went to 
his parents' bedroom and shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case cited by the report, a 16-year-old boy, still grieving over 
the loss of his parents 10 years earlier, told his brother he wanted to be with 
them and hanged himself in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year-old girl, an immigrant from Central America who yearned to return to 
her homeland, also hanged herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking steps to reduce childhood suicides, homicides and abuse, the county 
will soon establish a centralized computer system, known as the Family and 
Children's Index, to monitor abuse and domestic violence and link agencies that 
interact with troubled families. Grim Findings 
</P>
<P>
 The number of adolescent suicides rose sharply in Los Angeles County last 
year. In nearly three-quarters of the cases, the method used was a firearm. The 
report also found that the overall number of child abuse cases increased in 
1993.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; THERAPY GAME HELPS CHILDREN DISCUSS ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of testing players' knowledge of North African geography or the 
evolution of the French farce, this deceptively cheery-looking board game asks 
more disturbing questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some grown-ups kick children. Has it ever happened to you? 
</P>
<P>
 * Some children pretend they can't see. What don't they want to see? 
</P>
<P>
 * What did the person say to you while they did the yucky stuff to you? 
</P>
<P>
 It's called Playing It Safe . . . With SASA, and if the questions are 
disturbing, the answers are often more so. But for an abused 5-year-old, 
playing a game -- even a difficult one -- can be less traumatic than sitting on 
a giant couch and being grilled by a strange therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "SASA is actually a clinical procedure used . . . as a way to stimulate 
conversation about deep-rooted issues that are otherwise difficult or 
impossible to elicit during normal counseling," said co-inventor Susan Brown, 
director of the Julia Ann Singer Center in West Los Angeles. "It is another way 
of tapping into the subconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a bright board with spaces marked home, the police station, the 
worship house, where a player can go after landing on the proper space and 
discuss what happened there. There are color-coded cards, one set for direct 
questions about abuse, another for less touchy subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the more subtle questions can offer surprising insight. When one young 
boy drew a card asking, "How would you dress an animal?" he responded, "I would 
dress it sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is the straw-haired SASA (Speaking About Self-Awareness) puppet. 
First, the doll is for cuddling, but it also can act as a less threatening 
counselor. When a question is just too difficult to discuss with the therapist 
guiding the game, the child can speak to the puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children's medium is game and play," said clinical psychologist and 
co-inventor Etti Hadar of Tarzana, also a therapist at the Singer Center. "They 
don't always want to talk to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with traditional -- and often uncomfortable -- counseling methods, 
Hadar and Brown created the game nearly a decade ago. It is now used at therapy 
centers around the United States and in several other countries.  
</P>
<P>
 And though it was created as a tool for counseling children (a therapist must 
guide the game, which is only available to professional counselors) SASA has 
proven effective with adults and families as well, the inventors said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Singer Center recently, one mother and her 5-year-old daughter -- both 
having been sexually and physically abused by the girl's father -- played the 
game as part of their ongoing therapy. It is not always fun, the mother said, 
but it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of growth for both my daughter and I," said the 31-year-old 
mother. "It's both difficult and rewarding." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; MTA TO FINANCE BIKE PATH, WALKWAY 
</P>

 The Metropolitan Transit Authority will foot the bill for a $990,900 bike path 
and pedestrian walkway to be built along the train tracks from the Metrolink 
station on the west side of San Fernando to Recreation Park on the east side of 
town.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday approved hiring Boyle Engineering Co. of Los 
Angeles to design and oversee construction of the mile-long path, which 
includes major landscaping improvements, construction of an iron fence between 
trains and the path, and four planned pedestrian crossings. The engineering 
firm was hired at a cost of $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project includes substantial landscape improvements that will beautify 
and increase the safety of the Metrolink right of way," said Mike Drake, San 
Fernando's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighted path will be located about 20 feet from the train tracks, 
separated from the tracks by an iron fence. The path itself will be about 16 
feet wide, providing about eight feet of pathway in each direction for 
bicyclists. A narrow section of the path will be located on one side for use by 
pedestrians.  
</P>
<P>
 Drake added that the pathway will be accessible to police patrol cars, and 
that engineers are working with the city to devise a way to prohibit other 
kinds of vehicles from entering. After the bikeway is built, the city will be 
responsible for its maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed design includes four pedestrian crossings that will be controlled 
by electronic signals to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to cross or exit the 
tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 Several residents expressed concerns about pedestrian fatalities along the 
Metrolink train tracks in the San Fernando area. The most recent fatality on 
the tracks, which stretch for approximately one mile parallel to Truman Street, 
occurred Sept. 26 when a man intentionally dove into the path of a commuter 
train at the Brand Boulevard crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials emphasized that the bikeway is currently in the planning stages 
and that additional studies, including environmental reviews, are required 
before construction can start. If it is approved in its final form, 
construction could begin in June, with a completion date of November, officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bikeway will essentially be like a new road," said city engineer Jerry 
Wedding. "We'll have to ensure that it remains safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake said the planned bikeway was proposed as a pilot project and, if it is 
successful, it may be extended through other towns along the Metrolink railway.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; ROBINSONS-MAY PLANS REOPENING FESTIVITIES

<P>
 Nearly a year after the Northridge earthquake forced its closure, the 
Robinsons-May department store in Topanga Plaza will reopen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was retrofitted and brought up to seismic requirements after the 
temblor damaged the building in January, said Jim Watterson, vice president of 
public relations for Robinsons-May. 
</P>
<P>
 The work cost in excess of $20 million, Watterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 square feet of shopping space were added, including an atrium on 
the top floor that floods the building with natural light. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really consider this our flagship store for the entire San Fernando 
Valley," said Watterson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Plaza store, originally a May Co. store, was built in 1966, making 
it the 10th in Southern California. Forty-two stores have been erected since 
that time, and were renamed Robinsons-May in 1993 when the parent companies of 
the two chains announced their consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's reopening will feature a weekend of special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can pick up home decorating tips from experts at noon Friday. KROQ 
radio personality Tami Heide will headline a young men's fashion show from 2 to 
4 p.m. Saturday, when models from local high schools will show off the latest 
clothing trends. 
</P>
<P>
 A character from the Walt Disney film "The Lion King" will make a special 
appearance Sunday to highlight the opening of a department filled with stuffed 
animals, clothing and toys depicting characters from the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Dodgers star Steve Garvey will sign autographs from 2 to 4 
p.m. Sunday. ALICIA DOYLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS SEWAGE PLANT ODORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sewage odors being released by the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant will be the 
subject of a community meeting Tuesday at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Los Angeles Department of Public Works' Bureau of 
Sanitation will discuss what is being done about the odors. The meeting will be 
held at 7 p.m. in the conference trailer, 6100 Woodley Ave., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have complained for years about the sewage smells emanating from the 
plant, which treats sewage and extracts water that is used to supply the 
recreational lakes in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant manager Robert W. Birk explained that most of the odors are being 
released where sewer lines come into the plant. The problem is that the odors 
have not been efficiently drawn off to aeration tanks for odor removal, and 
that a reduction in the amount of industrial toxins in incoming sewage has 
increased the amount of odor-causing bacteria, Birk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has undertaken a $1.2-million project to add air ducts, fans 
and other equipment and to seal holes in the present duct system and sewage 
channels that convey sewage from one section of the plant to the other. Now 
mid-way through the design phase, the project is slated for completion in 
August, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, started in October, 1992, will take nearly four years because of 
the time it takes to get funding, choose a contractor and complete 
construction, Birk said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Birk said, plant officials are attempting to address the odor 
problem by expanding a spray system that spritzes odor-neutralizing chemicals 
around the sewage channels that may be leaking odors, and by building a 
temporary enclosure around a piece of equipment that screens the largest solids 
from incoming sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 Birk said he has sent notices of the meeting, which is open to the public, to 
people who have called to complain about the odors and to nearby homeowner 
associations. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE POLICE SEEK HELP IN CAPTURING STEALTHY BURGLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale police are asking for the public's help in capturing a man suspected 
of breaking into 14 homes in the pre-dawn hours and stealing cash from wallets 
and purses while the residents were asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man is described as an African American between 20 and 30 
years old and between 5 feet, 10 inches and 6 feet tall with a slender build 
and short black hair. He has been seen by at least two of his intended victims, 
who heard him trying to break into their homes and went to investigate. In both 
cases, the man fled before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if this individual is armed, and so far he hasn't attacked 
anybody," said Chahe Keuroghelian, a police spokesman. "He doesn't steal 
valuables. He seems only to be interested in the money, and in one case he also 
stole food stamps from a purse." 
</P>
<P>
 In another break-in, the man escaped with $3,000 in cash, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spate of break-ins began in August and the most recent crime occurred Oct. 
31, police said. The crimes have occurred at homes in Glendale and in the Eagle 
Rock section of Los Angeles, just outside Glendale city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe the same individual is responsible for all the crimes 
because in each case, the robber uses a screwdriver, hand drill and other tools 
to enter through sliding glass doors or windows. He makes his escape either 
through the window he broke into or through the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 The man has struck single-family houses and apartments alike, but all of the 
victims have lived on the ground floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Police also believe the burglar may be "casing out" his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the suspect is aware that the victims are at home sleeping 
when he breaks into the residence. Unlike most residential burglars, he likes 
them to be home," Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said anyone who sees a person matching the suspect's description 
loitering in their neighborhood can call the robbery division at (818) 548-2097 
or (818) 548-4840.

MAN DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who appeared to be a transient rolled off a bus bench Tuesday and was 
hit and killed by an MTA bus, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, believed to be in his late 30s, was asleep at a bus stop in the 7900 
block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Strathern Street at about 2 p.m. when "he 
fell off the bench on his own and a bus ran over him," said Lt. Thomas Kirk of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police could not identify the man but said an investigation will continue. The 
driver of the bus was not cited.

3 VENTURA COUNTY DEATHS LINKED TO VALLEY FEVER; HEALTH: TWO MORE NAMES ARE 
ADDED TO EARLIER REPORT OF A MAN WHO SUCCUMBED TO THE QUAKE-RELATED ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal disease officials confirmed Tuesday that three Ventura County 
residents died of valley fever, an airborne fungus carried on clouds of dust 
kicked up by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Centers for Disease Control reported that a 71-year-old Simi 
Valley man died in March in an unprecedented outbreak of 203 cases of the 
flu-like illness that followed the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But after further investigation, the agency attached two more deaths -- a 
56-year-old Oxnard man in May and a 71-year-old Newbury Park woman in June -- 
to the valley fever outbreak, a CDC epidemiologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three deaths will be outlined in a report that the CDC plans to forward in 
two weeks to the Ventura County Public Health Services Department, said the 
CDC's Dr. Eileen Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider and other federal researchers began investigating the connection 
between valley fever and the earthquake after Ventura County logged four times 
more cases in a few weeks than it had reported in all of 1993. Schneider would 
not name the people who died, citing their families' right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park woman died of valley fever-related pneumonia about two months 
after she was diagnosed with the illness, Schneider said. The Oxnard man, who 
had suffered diabetes and other medical problems, also died about two months 
after being diagnosed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual that people die of valley fever," Schneider said. "It's 
rare, but it does occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley fever is actually a fungal infection scientists call 
coccidioidomycosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus lives in the earth, but the Jan. 17 earthquake and hundreds of 
aftershocks threw it into the air in tan-colored clouds of dust, researchers 
believe. And hundreds of people -- particularly in Simi Valley and eastern 
Ventura County -- inhaled the spores. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 60% of cases, the infection produces no symptoms. But within about 
two to five weeks of inhaling the spores, some people experience flu-like 
exhaustion, coughing, high fever and even pneumonia. The illness usually hits 
older people the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 120 of the 203 earthquake-related cases of valley fever afflicted 
Simi Valley residents, while about 40 were found in Thousand Oaks and even 
fewer in Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, before the earthquake, there were only 52 cases of valley fever 
diagnosed in all of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake-related cases were noted on a map in the county public health 
department, which showed that valley fever spores might have spread out 
southwesterly from Simi Valley toward Thousand Oaks on seaward breezes before 
thinning out over the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.8 earthquake was centered in the San Fernando Valley, but 
health officials there have reported little change in the numbers of people 
infected there: Only 46 cases had been reported there by late August.

ZONING PANEL REDUCES HOURS AT LE SEX SHOPPE; CANOGA PARK: ADULT BOOKSTORE THAT 
HAS ANGERED NEIGHBORING BUSINESSES MUST ALSO HIRE TWO SECURITY GUARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the delight of frustrated neighbors, a Los Angeles zoning panel voted 
Tuesday to substantially reduce the operating hours of a Canoga Park adult 
bookstore that police say has been a magnet for public sex acts and other 
problems in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Board of Zoning Appeals voted to limit the operating hours of Le 
Sex Shoppe on Sherman Way to from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. It has recently been 
operating from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," said James Bruinsslot, the owner of a 
nearby print shop who said he expects a "dramatic improvement" in the 
neighborhood due to the shorter hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board ordered the business to employ two security guards, one 
of whom would be armed and would patrol the alleys and streets around the 
bookstore at night. The owner and the guards were also required to submit 
monthly reports to the city about the efforts to eliminate the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 David Brown, an attorney for Le Sex Shoppe, said the owners of the business 
have already complied with many other restrictions previously imposed by zoning 
officials. But he said he was not sure if they would appeal the board's latest 
restriction to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision is the latest chapter in a long and emotional battle 
between the bookstore -- which sells sexually explicit videos and magazines and 
includes private viewing booths -- and neighbors who say the business is a 
public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have asked that the city close the business, saying it has attracted 
problems for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to such complaints, zoning administrator John Parker imposed 20 
conditions on the business last month, including a requirement that the 
business operate only from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. It had previously been open 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Sgt. Tony Vlaskamp said the business has for years 
attracted men who "cruise" around the shop, sometimes meeting each other in 
alleys and nearby parking lots to perform sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real problem," he said. "I don't want to underemphasize how big a 
problem it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vlaskamp suggested that additional security guards might help scare 
loiterers away from Le Sex Shoppe's vicinity, he said he doubts anything would 
completely eliminate the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what would work, to be honest with you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and business owners said patrons of the shop also leave trash in 
nearby alleys and intimidate the customers of nearby businesses, including an 
adjacent restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said the problems around Le Sex Shoppe have diminished since the 
owners of the business agreed to comply last month with most of Parker's 20 
restrictions, including the shorter hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the panel did not have any evidence to show that the shorter hours 
would eliminate the problems and that he thinks the board simply wants to close 
the business altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really sounds like the objective is to close the business," he said.

CALABASAS CENTER TO COMBINE CARE FOR KIDS, SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas will soon be home to a unique day-care facility that serves children 
and senior citizens and stresses the value of interaction between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a generation of people over 65 who feel depressed, and the reason 
they feel depressed is because they don't feel useful," Dr. Arnold Bresky said 
at a recent groundbreaking for the facility, which is scheduled to open in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Bresky, who for the last 25 years has practiced obstetrics and gynecology in 
the western San Fernando Valley, will run the facility with his wife, Phyllis, 
a marriage and family counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Evergreen Generations, located on 12 acres off Old Topanga Canyon Road, will 
have a 24-crib nursery, according to Bresky. The for-profit facility is geared 
to accept as many as 100 clients. It will be open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole idea is to get society back on the right track by going back to the 
extended family," he said. "It worked for 5,000 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept serves as a perfect solution for a working adult who has small 
children and must also care for an aging parent, Bresky said. Both can be 
dropped off at the facility in the morning and picked up at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea began as a result of high turnover among staffers at nursing homes, 
said Judy Wolf, adult day-care and intergenerational coordinator for the Mark 
Taper Joining Older and Younger Program, an intergenerational day-care center 
in Van Nuys, which opened about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because nursing home staffers could not find day care for their children, Wolf 
said, someone hit on the idea of combining child and senior day care, and the 
concept was born. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea works because seniors and children get along well together, Wolf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They belong together," she said. "That's always been the way with 
grandparents and children. The children are very accepting and don't have a lot 
of expectations. The elderly give them unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
 Interaction with children has proved to be beneficial to seniors in nursing 
homes, Wolf said. The seniors are often depressed because they are so dependent 
on others and sometimes won't cooperate with staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, seniors frequently respond well to children when asked to 
participate in activities such as drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, an elderly person won't draw a picture for a staffer," Wolf said. "But 
they will do it for a child."

PIERCE SEEKING BIDS TO RUN DRIVING RANGE ON CAMPUS; REVENUE: COLLEGE OFFICIALS 
HOPE TO HAVE GOLF FACILITY OPERATING BY NEXT FALL TO HELP BAIL THE SCHOOL OUT 
OF FINANCIAL HARD TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College officials hope to begin accepting bids soon for a privately 
operated golf-driving range on the campus to bring revenue to the fiscally 
strapped school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will send out requests for proposals to anyone who asks, Pierce 
College President Mary Lee said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes to have the facility -- which would be on the north end of 
the campus between Mason and Winnetka avenues -- in operation by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator would be allowed to build and run the facility in exchange for 
sharing the revenue and funding various improvements to the school, she said. 
That would include building a jogging course and improving the Victory Avenue 
entrance to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Another requirement, said Lee, is that the driving range be made available to 
students who golf as part of a physical education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has estimated that the operation could bring in about $300,000 a year to 
the school over the course of a 10- to 20-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over in April, Lee has been under pressure to bring more money 
into the school. The driving range -- which was under consideration before Lee 
took over as president earlier this year -- is one of several revenue 
enhancement proposals under study. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has suggested introducing various other commercial ventures, including a 
farm museum, a 300-seat domed theater that would double as a planetarium, a 
discovery pavilion and a 160- to 260-seat conference center.  
</P>
<P>
 She has been meeting with neighborhood groups in an effort to improve 
relations, which have soured over the years, in part due to various plans to 
cut back operations of the school's 240-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Margo Murman, who is spearheading an effort to preserve the farm, could not be 
reached for comment Monday. But she has said in the past that her main concern 
is to keep the farm as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 She is urging Lee to consolidate her tentative proposals into a 160-acre tract 
near the administration building, instead of encroaching on the farm as Lee has 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Murley, executive director of the Woodland Hills Homeowners 
Organization, said Monday that he believes school officials may secretly want 
to get rid of the farm.

 "I wouldn't be surprised if they put an 18-hole golf course there," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; IMPROVED VALENCIA LIBRARY SET TO REOPEN; 
QUAKE: RENOVATED FACILITY INCLUDES NEW BOOKS, SUPERIOR LIGHTING AND BETTER 
ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE HANDICAPPED.

 Once the busiest of Los Angeles County's 87 library outlets, Valencia Library 
has been closed since the Northridge earthquake toppled its shelves and 
ruptured its water pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is scheduled to reopen at 11:30 a.m. Thursday, and patrons may find 
the temblor was the best thing to happen to the branch in its 22-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back and we're better," said Evelyn MacMorres, library administrator 
for the north county region. 
</P>
<P>
 New books, improved lighting and better accessibility for handicapped patrons 
are among the Valencia Library's windfall from the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A private insurance policy absorbed the bulk of the nearly $1 million in 
damage inflicted on the facility, said David Flint, assistant finance and 
planning director for the county library system. Most of the remaining costs 
will be covered by the earthquake recovery funds from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be out of pocket very little," Flint said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has paid $76,000 in cleanup costs to Valencia Library and provided more 
than $10,000 so far for an architectural engineering report, according to FEMA 
spokesman Russ Edmonston. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the report is completed, the agency will determine what additional funds 
to award the library, Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the library damage was to written materials rather than the 
24,000-square-foot building itself. About one-fourth of the library's 155,000 
books, periodicals and other publications were soaked when they toppled into 
four-foot deep piles and water flooded the building's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance money and FEMA funds have replaced reference books, government 
publications, magazines and paperbacks soaked beyond repair and salvaged some 
7,500 lesser-damaged materials through vacuum freeze-drying. 
</P>
<P>
 They've also paid for new ceiling lights and a new paint job, both of which 
are expected to provide improved illumination for patrons. Some 
handicapped-accessible fixtures have been installed as well, Flint said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovated Valencia branch will also offer more than double its pre-quake 
operating hours. The temblor, however, can't be credited for the additional 
service hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors allocated $22.5 
million in general funds for libraries. The decision boosts the Valencia 
facility from 28 operating hours per week to 60, and increases the hours of 
Santa Clarita's Newhall and Canyon Country branches from 19 hours per week to 
45. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Library opened in May, 1972. Located in the Los Angeles County Civic 
Center complex in Santa Clarita, it had the highest circulation figures of the 
entire county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 250 volunteers have participated in the library's recovery, MacMorres 
said. They helped library staffers retrieve, catalogue and box materials in the 
days after the earthquake and have been re-shelving publications during recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building is not completely back to us -- the bathrooms are not fixed -- 
but we're working hard," said MacMorres. "The books are back on the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Thursday, they'll be back in the hands of patrons.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COLLEGE STUDENT DIES AFTER FALL AT CAMPUS; 
ACCIDENT: LIBERTINE OXCIANO, 21, LOSES HER FOOTING ON RAIN-SLICK INCLINE AT 
COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. 
</P>

<P>
 A woman student at College of the Canyons apparently lost her footing and fell 
on a rain-slick incline Tuesday, then died of head injuries, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertine Oxciano, 21, of Canyon Country, was dropped off by her brother at 
the community college minutes before students found her lying on the pavement 
next to a trash bin behind the bookstore at about 9:20 a.m., according to 
college officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said she was still breathing and had a weak pulse, but was bleeding 
from the mouth and had a swollen neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was out cold," said Angela Lindsey, 19, a student who helped provide 
first aid to Oxciano. "There was nothing we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was walking up an asphalt incline that was wet from the rain when she 
lost her footing and fell on the hard surface, hitting her head," said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxciano went into cardiac arrest when an ambulance arrived several minutes 
later and she was pronounced dead at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia. The cause of death had not been released Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked as a nursing assistant at the Valencia hospital and had applied to 
enter the college's nursing program next year. A nursing program administrator 
said Oxciano had attended the school "for some time" and had high grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, including a 22-year-old woman who learned at about 12:30 p.m. of her 
classmate's death, were stunned by the news and left in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be her," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. "She was a 
good person. She was a loving person. She didn't deserve to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The hillside where Oxciano was found is commonly used as a shortcut by 
students to get from parking lots to the main campus, especially during the 
morning, said college spokeswoman Sue Bozman. Officials said Oxciano was 
wearing a backpack and carrying other schoolwork as she walked, apparently 
alone, up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Olmstead, 19, said she was walking up the same hill to class with a male 
friend when they saw a man about 20 years old over Oxciano, apparently trying 
to help her. Olmstead said Oxciano was lying with her arms at her side, her 
glasses were broken, and her backpack and clothing appeared undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other students stopped, some helping remove Oxciano's backpack and 
turning her head so she could breathe, Olmstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus security officers and sheriff's deputies sealed the area for several 
hours to allow homicide investigators to inspect the scene, but the death was 
officially classified as an accident late Tuesday afternoon, Jones said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER COUNCIL EXTENDS CITY MANAGER'S 
CONTRACT THROUGH '98; GOVERNMENT: TWO MEMBERS AND MANY RESIDENTS DENOUNCE JAMES 
C. GILLEY'S NEW PAY AND SEVERANCE PACKAGE AS TOO GENEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a boisterous three-hour hearing, the City Council voted to extend City 
Manager James C. Gilley's contract despite a public outcry over several 
provisions, including his salary and severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilley's contract, which was due to expire in August, 1997, was extended on a 
3-2 vote for another year at an annual salary of $127,000, with pay raises 
linked to the yearly increase in the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, according to the new agreement, if the council fires him before the 
contract runs out, Gilley must receive 180 days notice and a cash payout equal 
to 18 months salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting for the new contract, Mayor Frank Roberts and Councilmen Henry 
Hearns and George Runner threw out two other controversial provisions. One 
would have automatically extended Gilley's contract for another year each 
August. The second would have allowed him to receive up to 30 months extra pay 
as a consultant if Gilley was fired by a 3-2 vote of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was debated before a standing-room-only crowd of more than 300 
people, many of whom protested that the agreement was too generous. "Nobody 
gets this kind of golden parachute," complained resident Richard Wood. "This is 
an extremely irresponsible action." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said council members who approved the new contract were "going to be 
staring a recall in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Runner dismissed the public outcry as "a bit orchestrated and a 
bit unnecessary in many ways. It's easy to whip up a frenzy." 
</P>
<P>
 Runner also alleged that the protest was part of a calculated effort to oust 
Gilley from his post. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was stirred up in part by the two newest council members, Michael 
Singer and Deborah Shelton, who voted against the contract changes. After 
learning about the proposal late Friday, Singer and Shelton contacted reporters 
over the weekend to denounce the agreement and the way it was added to the 
meeting agenda at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The two council members charged that timing of the posting was meant to keep 
public attention from the matter. Singer denied in an interview Tuesday that 
his actions were aimed at removing Gilley, and during the meeting, Shelton 
insisted, "It was only my intent to inform the citizens, not to inflame them." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton asked that the vote on the contract changes be postponed so that she 
would have more time to study Gilley's contract and to compare it to those of 
other city managers. "Am I giving away the farm?" she asked at the meeting. "I 
don't really know." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilley was Lancaster's city manager from July, 1981, until July, 1988, when a 
new City Council majority voted to remove him. Two other men served short 
stints as city manager before Hearns, who was then mayor, urged Gilley to 
return to the city post in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing more than two dozen speakers criticize the provisions of his 
extended contract, Gilley himself said he had "never been through a meeting 
like I just went through." But he added, "I recognize that if you can't take 
the heat, you shouldn't take the seat." 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the audience: "I didn't ask for this job. They convinced me to 
give up a business where I didn't have to be a whipping boy. The council made a 
commitment to me at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time he returned to the post, Gilley was part-owner of a local real 
estate firm and a lobbyist for a major home-builder. As a condition of his 
return, he asked for and received a three-year contract that required the 
council to pay him for all remaining months if he was fired before his contract 
expired. That remained in force in 1993 when the council extended the contract 
through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new state law forbids cities from giving a fired administrator more than 
18 months severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-month consulting contract was proposed as a way to give Gilley the same 
financial security he received under the old agreement, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new state law requires that Gilley's contract negotiations now be 
conducted in public, instead of behind closed doors, as had been done in the 
past.

IKEA FOUNDER ISSUES APOLOGY FOR LONG-AGO TIES TO NAZI GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founder of the Ikea international furniture store chain based in 
Stockholm, Sweden, has written a letter to about 25,000 company employees 
worldwide acknowledging and apologizing for associating with pro-Nazi groups in 
the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual admission by Ingvar Kamprad, now one of Sweden's richest men, drew 
mixed reactions Tuesday from U.S. Jewish organizations. The response of the 
public here and elsewhere could have major business implications for the 
fast-growing chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ikea stores operate in 26 countries -- including 13 in the United States, five 
of them in Southern California -- where they have proven highly popular with 
young families because of a reputation for high quality and low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamprad's admission followed the disclosure by a Stockholm newspaper that 
Kamprad attended meetings of Nazi extremist groups from 1945 into the early 
1950s. He founded Ikea in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Kamprad said he severed his Nazi contacts in the 1950s and that 
the period was "a part of my life which I bitterly regret." Kamprad said he was 
never a formal member of the pro-Nazi groups and that he was mainly attracted 
by the socialist, non-communist views of Per Engdahl, a leading Swedish 
pro-Nazi of the post-war years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have been young yourself," Kamprad said in his note to employees. 
"Perhaps something happened during your own youth which you now, a long time 
afterwards, think was silly. In that case it will be easier for you to 
understand me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal 
Center, said he was disturbed because the associations occurred after the 
defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it abhorrent that a young man -- living in a democracy that 
received information about the genocide that occurred -- would associate with 
groups promoting fascism," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said Kamprad could establish a financial fund to benefit indigent 
survivors of the Nazi atrocities as a sign of contrition. He also called on 
Kamprad to release more details on his association with pro-Nazi groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League, the human rights group that monitors anti-Jewish 
activity, said it would accept Kamprad's account of his past involvement with 
the controversial groups barring any evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate that it took so long for Mr. Kamprad to admit to his past," 
said David Lehrer, regional ADL director for Southern California. 
"Nevertheless, we believe in redemption and in the ability of people to correct 
the errors of their past." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the company's damage control efforts, Warren Bennis, a professor of 
business at the University of Southern California and chairman of USC's 
Leadership Institute, said Kamprad was properly remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be an effective leader, there must be candor and the ability to 
communicate that candor," Bennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamprad's "letter was self-deprecating and remorseful. He was asking for 
forgiveness. . . . The candor was impressive. The question is: Why didn't he do 
this earlier?"

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; 'GRIND AND FIND'; 
ROBOTS, VDTS MAY BE THE RX FOR NEW PHARMACEUTICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming stumbled on penicillin in 
1929, drug development has been more serendipity than science. Researchers at 
large pharmaceutical companies screen thousands of compounds in trial-and-error 
"grind and find" tests before finally hitting on a promising drug -- typically 
spending $400 million and 12 years in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotechnology was supposed to change all that with breakthrough techniques 
such as genetic engineering. But while a few early pioneers such as Genentech 
and Amgen have struck it rich by "picking the low cherries on the tree," in the 
words of one scientist, broader progress has been slow: Though there are about 
520 biotech companies in the United States, only 26 biotech drugs are in 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Now many researchers and biotech industry watchers are pinning their hopes on 
a new set of drug development techniques that exploit cutting-edge computer 
methods and advanced robotics technology. By combining the ability of computers 
to analyze and model reams of data with robots' precision handling and cutting 
abilities, these methods could radically reduce the amount of time and money it 
takes to develop new drugs -- to the benefit of the sick and biotech investors 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can often make breakthroughs by marrying two separate technologies," says 
Ken Lee, national director of the life sciences practice at accounting firm 
Ernst & Young and co-author of an annual report on biotechnology. "That's 
what's happening with high-powered computing and biotech. Something great is 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no guarantees, of course: None of these technology-savvy companies 
have approved drugs to validate their approach, and some analysts say they lack 
the broad expertise in pharmaceuticals needed to produce effective drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the techno-drug companies have been producing an impressive number of drug 
candidates for human clinical trials, often in record time. The Johns Hopkins 
Oncology Center will soon begin the trial of an anti-cancer drug that 
BioNumerik Pharmaceutical of San Antonio developed in just 18 months using 
supercomputers. Agouron, a San Diego drug company, is now testing two 
anti-cancer drugs and a possible treatment for AIDS. Arris Pharmaceuticals, a 
South San Francisco-based company, is testing a drug for asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if the current purveyors of the new approach to drug making don't 
survive, few question that the technology they are developing will become part 
of the mainstream, accelerating drug development in companies large and small 
and transforming a stream of new discoveries about man's genetic makeup into 
useful drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A hundred years in the future, everybody will be 'genotyped' and you will 
design drugs on demand fitted to that person's target protein," says David 
Galas, vice president for research at Darwin Molecular Sciences, a start-up 
company backed by Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates. The firm plans to 
combine advanced robotics with high-speed computers to sequence genes and find 
new ways to tackle such treatment-resistant diseases as cancer, AIDS and 
multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are many different approaches to computer-driven drug development, 
the broad goal is typically the same. First, the objective is to find a 
protein, or "receptor," that plays a key role in a disease. Once a receptor is 
found, the task is then to find a compound that will attach itself to the 
receptor and either disable the receptor if it has harmful functions or 
activate it if it has a positive role. Think of the receptor as the lock that 
must be opened or closed for treatment and the drug as the key that must be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 But though their goals are similar, the various companies are tackling the 
problem in radically different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Agouron's method, called rational drug design, is to create new compounds 
"atom by atom." When Agouron set out to find a compound to disable the HIV 
protease, a piece of the AIDS virus that's involved in replication, it began by 
cloning the protein and turning it into a crystal structure. 
</P>
<P>
 By bombarding the crystal with X-rays and recording the way in which the rays 
are deflected -- a process called protein X-ray crystallography -- company 
researchers created a three-dimensional image of the HIV protease. The image 
was then used to design on computer a new compound that would fit neatly into 
the protein, like a plug into a socket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We designed a molecule you couldn't come upon in any other way," says Peter 
Johnson, Agouron's chief executive officer. "These are things that don't occur 
in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent criticism of rational drug design is its failure to recognize that 
compounds and their targets change shape under different conditions, which 
means the computer model sometimes bears little resemblance to reality. And 
X-ray crystallography doesn't work on the many proteins that cannot easily be 
converted to a crystal structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arris has tackled the problem by using pattern recognition, an approach to 
sorting visual information first developed by the military to help guide 
missiles to their targets. Arris uses the technology to find common patterns 
among the thousands of compounds known to make effective drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the system might suggest that compounds with a tower sticking up 
on the right, a certain electrical charge on the side and a flat, greasy 
surface on top will link with a particular receptor, says Michael Ross, chief 
technology officer. The new drugs are then designed, tested for effectiveness 
against computer models and further refined in continuing cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It offers completely new insights," Ross says. "It is the breakthrough 
knowledge that is the most important." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say rational drug design has limited applications because it requires 
a huge amount of information about the molecule being studied. Such information 
isn't available for most drug targets. 
</P>
<P>
 So another group of companies has taken an opposite tack, sometimes referred 
to as "irrational drug design." They use databases of thousands or even 
millions of different compounds -- plants, animals and synthetically produced 
materials -- in conjunction with a range of computer techniques to separate out 
those compounds that have the best chance of attaching themselves to the target 
receptor. 
</P>
<P>
 Affymax Research Institute, a Palo Alto company, for example, has borrowed 
from semiconductor production methods to speed up the old grind-and-find 
approach. The company builds up layers of molecules on glass slides and covers 
them with a protective surface. Photolithography -- a mainstay of semiconductor 
making -- is then used to cut away areas, each cut exposing a layer of 
molecules to which new compounds can be selectively added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, a tiny chip is created that has on its surface 65,000 
identifiably different but related compounds. The compounds can be tested 
simultaneously with a few drops of fluid containing the target receptor. Those 
that bind give off a fluorescent flash, which is picked up by a laser and 
recorded by a computer as promising compounds. The results are offered to large 
corporate partners for further development. 
</P>
<P>
 BioNumerik of San Antonio has built computer models based on fundamental 
tenets of pharmacology, chemistry and biology to try to predict how molecules 
of a given structure are likely to react. To process its lengthy equations, 
which are based on quantum mechanics, the company uses supercomputers and is 
working with computer makers to custom design computers dedicated for the 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computers are strategic for us," says Frederick Hausheer, BioNumerik's 
founder and CEO. "We don't have to do much testing in the lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another group of biotech companies are taking advantage of research coming 
out of the 15-year, $3-billion Human Genome Project but to tackle a different 
part of the equation. Instead of focusing their efforts on finding new 
compounds, they are looking for new drug targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next five to 10 years, almost all new drugs will be used against 
targets not yet discovered," says Galas of Darwin, a molecular biologist who 
helped oversee the Human Genome Project while at the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin plans to develop a high-speed robotic production line that will analyze 
gene fragments at rates 100 to 1,000 times faster than is possible using 
current methods. The process yields the sequence, or code, for each fragment, 
and the code is then fed into a computer and matched against thousands of known 
proteins. If the gene's code is similar to that of a protein known to be 
related to a disease, it may be a potential drug target. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach of genome companies like Darwin is to find new doors to a disease 
that might be easier to unlock. Developing Drugs With Computers 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, drugs were developed using lengthy trial-and-error methods 
sometimes known as "grind and find." Now computer technology is making new 
techniques available to speed the process. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Identify new drug targets: 
</P>
<P>
 Laboratory robots prepare and sequence fragments of genes believed to be 
responsible for a medical condition. Scientists then search databases for 
proteins -- called receptors -- that are similar to the genes. The hope is to 
find drugs that will latch on to a receptor and either disable it if its 
activity hurts the body or activate it if it helps. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Find compounds with drug potential: 
</P>
<P>
 High-powered computers, in combination with traditional chemistry techniques, 
are used to sift through thousands of compounds to winnow out those that can

JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DEALS IN SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS COULD HELP 
CLEAR THE REGION'S AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Editor's note: Starting today, James Flanigan's Wednesday columns will focus 
on business and economic trends and issues in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the election is mercifully over, we can turn to really urgent matters 
facing the Southern California economy. No, not immigration or nannies or 
campaign spending, but a regional clean air plan that must be augmented and 
approved by Gov. Pete Wilson and the California Air Resources Board and sent to 
Washington by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There the Sacramento plan must be accepted quickly by the federal government 
as meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Deadlines are tight and the 
consequences for missing them potentially severe. They include a withering of 
the Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach, loss of tens of thousands of jobs and a 
decidedly gloomier future for the five-county economy of Southern California. 
And that's no overstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment, disaster has been averted. The region is dodging a bullet 
thanks to unprecedented cooperation among politicians, air quality overseers 
and environmental and industry officials who came up with a compromise response 
to a court-ordered regimen that would have crippled commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed the cooperation is the most promising development to come out of a 
comedy of errors and omissions that began with a 1988 lawsuit by 
environmentalists challenging the region's compliance with anti-pollution laws. 
The lawsuit persisted, like a tale from Dickens, through one court after 
another and came back last February to bite Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in effect that the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency must draw up a plan to clean Southern California's air 
because local government and industry had not done so or could not. The 
resulting federal implementation plan, or FIP, focused particularly on 
emissions from trucks, ships and planes, which operate in interstate and 
international commerce and had been beyond the authority of the local Air 
Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations were jolting. They imposed heavy taxes on emissions 
by shipping companies and airlines and required trucking companies to replace 
diesel engines. "If those rules were in effect right now, ships would have to 
steam 100 miles offshore and shippers would have to pay $300 million a year in 
extra fees," says Gordon Palmer, manager of planning for the Long Beach section 
of the Port. Freight would shift to the ports of San Francisco-Oakland or 
Seattle or Ensenada, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the FIP, Los Angeles and its region would fade as a crossroads for trade 
with Asia and Latin America. The Alameda Corridor -- the proposed rail and 
truck route through the city -- would not be built "because the volume of 
freight would be inadequate to sustain it," Palmer says. 
</P>
<P>
 In trucking, smaller firms would go out of business and trucks coming from out 
of state would be restricted to a single stop in Southern California. Some 
airlines, notably TWA, would have to stop flying into Los Angeles because they 
couldn't afford new planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the region's initial reaction to such baleful prospects was argument 
and name-calling. Business was "crying wolf"; environmentalists were 
"anti-jobs." But EPA saved the day by asking for specific analyses of the 
regulations' economic consequences, says Patricia O'Toole, an environmental 
partner in the Los Angeles law firm Lamb & O'Toole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port, airport and local industries supplied analyses that sobered the 
discussion. The total tab would be $5.4 billion a year in new costs imposed on 
business in a regional economy struggling to emerge from recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FIP regulations would not have been the most cost-effective way to clean 
the air," says Jane Hall, an economist at California State University, 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat was so stark that it softened resistance by environmentalists and 
regulators and allowed Mayor Richard Riordan's office to produce a compromise 
solution, one that essentially meets present federal requirements but allows a 
little more time to meet 1997 standards for soot-like particulate pollutants 
and for the nitrous oxides in ozone. The compromise allows more leeway for 
transporters to operate while anti-pollution technology is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 The politically correct stance for all parties was to work on the compromise 
and support the economy. "We are after a prosperous economy like everybody 
else," says Denny Zane, head of the Coalition for Clean Air, one of the 
organizations that brought the original 1988 lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked to save industry," says Norton Younglove, a Riverside County 
supervisor and governor of the South Coast AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace is wonderful, but are they compromising the public health? Southern 
California's air problem is extreme, with 27% more lung-scarring ozone than 
Houston and 51% more than New York City. Ventura County has lower ozone, but 
its air also is below the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, the compromise on environmental plans does not threaten health; it 
merely buys time, until 1997, to find solutions that are not readily available 
today. Indeed, work on low-emission truck engines and zero-emission automobiles 
will have to be pressed with even greater vigor now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the threat is far from over, say environmental experts. First, 
the state's Air Resources Board, in meetings the next two days, must add to 
this region's plan to make it acceptable to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Then state and federal deadlines must be met or Southern California could find 
itself next February under a court order to submit to the Draconian strictures 
it has dodged to date by ingenuity and compromise. Chances are, most deadlines 
will be met, although some delays may cause temporary sanctions on business in 
our region. 
</P>
<P>
 However, times may have changed. The cooperation on solutions to regulatory 
problems that has characterized recent months could become a healthy habit. The 
Mayor's office, local industry and environmentalists may well get together on 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, the FIP regulations -- like chest pains that prompt more 
exercise and better diet -- will be seen as a useful adversity for having 
launched a new work-together spirit in a region blessed by geography as the 
gateway to Asia and Latin America. Of course, exercise without chest pains and 
cooperation without a hangman's noose is always wiser.

DENNY'S ACTS TO INCREASE BLACK-OWNED FRANCHISES; RESTAURANTS: THE CHAIN'S 
PARENT FIRM MAKES A DEAL THAT COULD INVOLVE UP TO 47 OUTLETS IN NEW YORK AND 
NEW JERSEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after agreeing to pay $45 million to settle discrimination charges, 
the parent of Denny's Restaurants said Tuesday that it has a deal with a 
black-owned company to acquire several Denny's franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based NDI Inc., which currently owns and operates 23 Blockbuster Video 
Stores, will acquire or develop as many as 47 Denny's restaurants in New York 
and New Jersey over the next six years, said Flagstar Cos., Denny's 
Spartingburg, S.C.-based parent. 
</P>
<P>
 NDI said it will purchase 17 of Denny's company-owned restaurants this year. 
It has rights to purchase another five in 1995 and plans to build 25 new 
restaurants in the two states over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar said the franchise agreement with NDI fulfills a commitment it made 
to the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People last year to 
increase the number of minority-owned Denny's across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar faced a firestorm of criticism from the NAACP and others in the past 
two years over thousands of claims by black customers who charged that 
personnel at Denny's restaurants offered inferior service to black customers 
and had policies to discourage black customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the customer lawsuits were filed in California. Denny's currently has 
only one black-owned franchise in California, according to a Denny's 
spokeswoman. The company has more than 50 minority-owned restaurants across the 
country, including many owned by Asian Americans in California, the spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Flagstar settled with the U.S. Justice Department, pledging to end 
discrimination and increase minority hiring and also to increase the number of 
minority franchise owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major step for Denny's in meeting and, in fact exceeding, our 
commitment to increasing African American franchisees," Denny's President C. 
Ronald Petty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's spokeswoman Karen Randall said the company has made good progress in 
recruiting African American franchisees, noting not only the agreement with NDI 
but also a so-called fast-track program that the company has developed to 
assist 15 new minority candidates in acquiring franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the agreement was reached, Petty said Denny's had plans to take the 
number of restaurants owned by blacks from two to 22 and that its black 
management hires rose by 56% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Norsworthy, the only black Denny's owner in California, said that he and 
his Carson-based restaurant have received a lot of support from Flagstar and 
from black customers, who have been largely responsible for increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've got a good group," Norsworthy said of the company, "and 
they've certainly gone out of their way to help me." 
</P>
<P>
 NDI board member Richard Venegar said his company entered into the agreement 
solely because it represented a good business opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at this purely from an economic standpoint," Venegar said. "We're 
not doing this because we feel a social obligation to alleviate their 
problems."

JETLINER MAKER SELECTS DALLAS OVER LONG BEACH; AEROSPACE: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS' 
DECISION ON THE MD-95 BREAKS A 74-YEAR AIRLINER MANUFACTURING TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp., confirming weeks of speculation, said Tuesday that 
its newest jetliner will be built in Texas and not in Long Beach, home of the 
company's Douglas Aircraft division. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time in Douglas' 74-year history that one of its commercial 
airplane production lines will be based outside California. 
</P>
<P>
 The new MD-95, a 100-seat model that will compete in the small-jetliner 
market, will be assembled at Dallas' Love Field by closely held Dalfort 
Aviation, aided by $73 million in city-arranged financing that will help 
Dalfort expand its facilities there. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell had previously indicated that Long Beach was out of the running 
because of Southern California's high business costs. Nonetheless, the decision 
is another setback for the region's dwindling aerospace industry, because about 
5,000 jobs will be created in the Dallas area when the MD-95 is in full 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is the largest one-time job creation in the history of the 
city of Dallas," Dallas Mayor Steve Bartlett said. "It will have an enormous 
impact on the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas still employs about 10,000 people in Long Beach -- who build its 
MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11 jetliners -- but that's down from 42,000 only four years 
ago because of a sharp drop in Douglas' sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Bartlett said McDonnell's decision is "not a 
negative consequence" for Long Beach because "these are all new jobs. They're 
not coming from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 He also dismissed recent published reports that suggested McDonnell delayed 
its announcement until Tuesday to bolster Gov. Pete Wilson's bid for reelection 
in California, speculation both Wilson and McDonnell have denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can absolutely verify that the (timing of the) decision was not politically 
driven," Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell has yet to formally launch the MD-95, which is expected to sell for 
$20 million to $25 million. The company is peddling the plane to airlines in 
search of enough orders to start production. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, McDonnell has signed up vendors from around the world to 
provide components and help pay the plane's development and tooling costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suppliers include Israel Aircraft Industries (landing gear), Korean Air 
Aerospace (nose assembly) and Italy's Alenia (fuselage), along with U.S. 
suppliers such as AlliedSignal Aerospace in Torrance (environmental control 
system). 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell and other plane makers use suppliers from various nations partly to 
bolster the airplane's sale in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to their advantage to involve countries worldwide that have their own 
airlines," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with the consulting firm JSA Research 
Inc. in Newport, R.I. "All the manufacturers play that game."

 Comptroller OKs Purchase of Glenfed Branches: Barnett Banks Inc. won approval 
from a second regulator to buy a batch of thrifts, even though the Justice 
Department believes Florida's biggest banking company unfairly denied loans to 
minority borrowers.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OKd Barnett's 
plans to acquire 34 Florida branches of California-based Glendale Federal Bank, 
a little more than a month after the Federal Reserve Board granted similar 
approval. The Fed gave its approval while the Justice Department was conducting 
an inquiry of Jacksonville-based Barnett on fair-lending allegations. The OCC, 
which oversees national banks, said it found no evidence of lending bias 
between July, 1993, and July, 1994.

FAIR PLAN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE DETAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Tuesday unveiled pricing and coverage 
details for the stand-alone earthquake insurance policies to be offered through 
the California Fair Plan, the industry-financed, high-risk insurance pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with homes built after 1950 and located in seismically active areas -- 
virtually all of Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area -- will pay 
$3.25 in premiums per $1,000 of coverage, Garamendi said.Thus, a policyholder 
with $150,000 worth of coverage will pay $487.50 a year for a policy with a 10% 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate for homes built before 1950 in seismic areas is $4.25 per $1,000. 
However, older homes retrofitted to withstand earthquakes will get the same 
rate as newer homes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big increase from the current average of about $2 per $1,000 for 
earthquake coverage, though Garamendi has recently begun approving substantial 
rate hikes that will probably move the average closer to $3 per $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Plan policies will also have limited coverage compared to 
conventional policies. For example, coverage of a home's contents will be 
capped at 20% of policy limits, and coverage will be skimpy for swimming pools, 
chimneys and exterior structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing total losses of $10 billion or more from the Northridge earthquake, 
most California insurers have suspended or sharply limited their writings of 
new homeowners and earthquake insurance, making it difficult for many consumers 
to find coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 State law requires insurance companies to offer earthquake coverage to their 
homeowners customers, so in order to avoid additional quake exposure, companies 
stopped selling both lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing insurers to offer their customers earthquake coverage through the 
Fair Plan "should encourage them to once again make homeowners insurance 
available to California consumers," Garamendi said Tuesday in a statement.

UNION PACIFIC PROPOSES TRUST FOR SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Union Pacific stepped up its hostile bid for Santa Fe Pacific late Tuesday by 
offering to buy Santa Fe for $3.27 billion and then place the railroad in a 
voting trust until the merger is approved by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe investors had urged Union Pacific to propose the trust, because it 
would enable them to get their money upfront while leaving Union Pacific to 
bear the risk that the merger would later be blocked by the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific lowered its price for that risk, however. It proposed a cash 
tender offer of $17.50 a share for 57% of Santa Fe's stock, followed by an 
exchange of stock also valued at $17.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific had previously offered $20 a share in stock without a voting 
trust, and that remains an option for Santa Fe to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe, whose shares closed Tuesday at $14.875, has so far spurned UP in 
favor of being acquired by another big railroad, Burlington Northern. JAMES F.

PEOPLE: NANULA TO HEAD DISNEY STORES CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard D. Nanula, Walt Disney Co.'s chief financial officer and one of the 
most senior black executives in the entertainment business, was named Tuesday 
to head the company's 335-outlet chain of Disney Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said the move was made by Chairman Michael D. Eisner to give the 
34-year-old Nanula, who is considered one of the company's rising young stars, 
operational experience. His title will be president of Disney Store Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanula replaces Paul Pressler, who was appointed president of Disneyland on 
Monday. Nanula is expected to continue serving as chief financial officer while 
the company conducts a search for his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanula's appointment is part of a reshuffling of Disney's executive ranks that 
was triggered in part by the death in April of President Frank G. Wells and the 
subsequent departure of studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg. It is also seen as 
part of a larger effort by Disney to put in place its next generation of senior 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Eisner said the company wants to give Nanula and other top 
young executives "hands-on experience with our various businesses to prepare 
them for broader roles within the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Nanula, a Los Angeles native who joined Disney eight years ago, has been 
involved in a number of major tasks recently. Earlier this year, he and Disney 
Senior Executive Vice President Sanford Litvack led the negotiations with 
European banks that resulted in the successful financial restructuring of the 
ailing Euro Disney theme park near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanula also initiated the much-publicized sale last year of $300 million in 
100-year bonds, which some wags called Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" bonds due to 
their unusually long maturity date. In an interview, Nanula said his only goal 
at this point for the unit is to "grow it as quickly and as profitably as 
possible."  
</P>
<P>
 As the head of Disney's stores, Nanula will oversee one of Disney's 
fastest-growing operations. The number of Disney stores has doubled in the past 
two years, and plans call for raising the number to about 600 worldwide by 
1998.  
</P>
<P>
 The growth in stores was one of the chief reasons that revenue for Disney's 
consumer products segment soared 24% to $1.3 billion in the nine months ended 
June 30.

 Microsoft, Visa to Develop Secure Electronic Payment System: The software 
giant and the credit card purveyor said they will work together to develop a 
secure method for transmitting credit-card information between buyers and 
merchants.The effort could eventually make it much easier for customers and 
merchants to conduct business over the Internet computer network or other 
on-line computer services. The technology will be based on Microsoft's popular 
operating system Windows and will be available in 1995. It will include 
encryption capabilities -- which scramble sensitive information so that only 
the intended receiver can read it -- from RSA Data Security Inc., a closely 
held Silicon Valley company.

 Maxxam Rejects Alternatives for Pacific Lumber: The company said it has hired 
Salomon Bros. to examine alternatives for its Pacific Lumber Co. unit but that 
it has decided against pursuing any of the suggestions.The Wall Street Journal 
reported that Maxxam Inc. Chairman Charles Hurwitz, who controls 60% of the 
Houston-based firm, was exploring the sale of most of the lumber unit, for 
which he had hoped to get at least $1 billion. Hurwitz was said to be tired of 
pressure from environmental lawsuits, regulations and Congress affecting the 
firm's logging plans. A Maxxam spokesman did not identify the suggestions or 
describe Maxxam's plans for Pacific Lumber, the world's biggest producer of 
redwood lumber.

 Yields Rise in Treasury Auction: Yields on three-year notes rose to their 
highest level in four years as the government opened its $41-billion quarterly 
refunding. The average yield was 7.41%, up from 6.61% at the last auction Aug. 
9.It was the highest rate since three-year notes sold for 7.78% on Nov. 6, 
1990. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 7.375%, with each $10,000 
in face value selling for $9,990.70. A total of $17.2 billion in notes were 
sold out of bids totaling $49.6 billion. The refunding continues today with the 
sale of $12 billion in 10-year notes and ends Thursday with the auction of $12 
billion in 37-day cash management bills. The auctions are held four times a 
year to replenish government coffers drained by huge deficits.

 Bristol-Myers Squibb Halts Drug Trial: Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it halted 
a clinical trial of a heart drug, d-sotalol, after more patients taking the 
drug died than those taking a placebo.The New York-based drug company was 
testing the drug on heart attack victims at risk for cardiac arrhythmia, an 
abnormally fast heartbeat. Bristol-Myers said 54 of 1,373 patients given the 
drug died, compared to 28 of 1,389 placebo patients. The company is continuing 
other clinical trials of the drug. D-sotalol had a market potential of $50 
million, Hemant Shah, an independent analyst in Warren, N.J., said in a 
research report. The company had sales of $11.4 billion last year.

 Wholesale Sales Decline: Sales fell for the first time in five months in 
September, and stocks of unsold goods rose for a third straight month, the 
Commerce Department said.Total sales by merchant wholesalers fell 0.3% to a 
seasonally adjusted $174.68 billion, after jumping a revised 3.2% in August. 
The August increase was previously reported as 2.7%. The revised gain was the 
largest since a 4.6% increase in February, 1987. Inventories rose 0.4% in 
September to a seasonally adjusted $228.41 billion, after rising a revised 0.4% 
in August. The August gain was previously reported as 0.8%.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CITADEL INVESTOR ASKS LIQUIDATION BUT FIRM DIGS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 James Cotter has a history of making waves in other peoples' pools. Now he's 
getting a taste of his own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotter, 58, heads Craig Corp., a Los Angeles firm that is basically a shell 
through which Cotter has invested in numerous other businesses over the years. 
He also manages the Forman family fortune, a $300-million-plus portfolio (as 
estimated by Forbes magazine) built from profits of the family's giant Pacific 
Theatres movie theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cotter gained a reputation in the 1980s as a savvy corporate raider with 
a sharp eye for value -- particularly in real estate -- the 1990s have not been 
as kind to him. Craig shares, which traded above $20 in 1989, now sell for 
$10.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. And one of Cotter's big investments, 
Citadel Holding Corp. (which he chairs), has virtually collapsed since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Seared by Citadel's plunge, one of its shareholders -- a Columbus, Ohio, 
investor named Roderick H. Dillon -- has launched a proxy battle to challenge 
Cotter's effective control of Citadel. Characteristically, Cotter is spoiling 
for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale-based Citadel was the holding company for Fidelity Federal Bank. Like 
many S&Ls, Fidelity suffered severe losses in California's real estate crash. 
As a result, Fidelity took a huge write-off this year and, with regulators' OK, 
was recapitalized in August with a $108-million infusion from new investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that recapitalization cost Citadel dearly. Its 100% ownership of Fidelity 
dropped to a 16% stake -- the major reason Citadel's shares have tumbled. 
Today, Citadel's only substantial assets consist of its Fidelity stake, four 
real estate properties and options on two other properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon, who says he has invested in several California S&Ls as "turnaround" 
situations since the 1980s, began buying Citadel shares in January. He now owns 
about 650,000 shares, or 9.7% of the total, at an average cost of $5.80 each. 
With the stock at $3.75 on Tuesday on the American Stock Exchange, Dillon is 
underwater. So is Cotter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the value of the company is a lot less than I had anticipated," 
Dillon admits. Yet he also thinks Citadel stock isn't fully reflecting the 
value of the stake in the recapitalized Fidelity. What's that worth? All 
investors can do is guess until Fidelity files its latest financial statements 
next week, providing a post-recap picture of the S&L. 
</P>
<P>
 One clue to Fidelity's value, however, is that the investors who recapitalized 
it paid $5.25 a share in August. Those investors include such respected players 
as Omega Partners and Mutual Shares Corp. Dillon figures it this way: With $3.7 
billion in assets and 33 branches, a now-healthy Fidelity is a certain takeover 
candidate for a bigger S&L. For their trouble, the recap investors would 
probably expect to at least double their money. Put a $10 takeover value on 
Fidelity shares (which trade only privately), and that makes Citadel's 4.2 
million shares of Fidelity worth $42 million. Which in turn figures out to 
$6.36 per Citadel share. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hypothetical, of course. In any case, rather than let the market value 
Citadel's "intermediary" role as a Fidelity investor, Dillon has what he thinks 
is a better idea: Liquidate Citadel, distributing the Fidelity shares to 
Citadel holders on a prorated basis. To that end, Dillon is putting up his own 
slate of directors for Citadel's Dec. 12 annual meeting. And he has enlisted 
the help of Bradley C. Shoup, a partner with La Jolla-based corporate raider 
David Batchelder. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Cotter think of liquidating Citadel? Citadel CEO Steve Wesson says 
only that "we don't feel it's in the best interests of shareholders." And in a 
clear sign of Cotter's intention to fight, in late October Citadel issued 
74,300 new shares to Craig Corp., raising Craig's Citadel stake to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a formality in S&L regulations, that move paves the way for Craig 
to quickly boost its stake in Citadel before the annual meeting, Dillon says. 
The goal, he contends, would be to thwart his proxy fight. On Monday, Dillon 
filed suit against Cotter and Craig Corp., charging that Citadel's new share 
issuance to Craig was improper and designed to "enable (the defendants) to 
maintain themselves in office . . . and to impede the voting rights of Dillon 
and other stockholders of Citadel." 
</P>
<P>
 In calling for Citadel's liquidation, Dillon says he's just interested in 
realizing his investment's true value. If Cotter has a better idea -- a good 
reason why Citadel needs to exist -- Dillon wants to hear it. Craig Corp. 
holders, who also have seen little value realized since 1989, might be asking 
the same question about that Cotter entity. Citadel's Slide

 Stocks rallied Tuesday as Wall Street bet that the Republican Party, viewed as 
more friendly to Wall Street, would make strong Election Day gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was also aided by a retreat in long-term interest rates, which fell 
on news of surprisingly weak retail sales, after a strong showing at the 
Treasury's auction of three-year notes. But the dollar edged lower as the 
currency markets were nervous about the outcome of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.87 points to 3,830.74, with advancing 
issues narrowly outnumbering declines on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit markets, the Treasury's key 30-year yield fell for the first 
time in six days, closing at 8.12%, down from 8.16%. Its price, which rises 
when yields fall, was up 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $17.2 billion in three-year notes at a yield of 7.41%, which 
analysts said was roughly in line with expectations and reflected satisfactory 
market demand for the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 As bond prices rebounded, market speculators who had bet on a drop in prices 
Tuesday were compelled to join the buying spree, giving a further boost to the 
market run-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar declined in cautious trading as currency dealers avoided taking new 
positions, uncertain over how the results would affect the currency market. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the dollar closed at 1.509 German marks, down from 1.516 
on Monday. The greenback ended at 97.13 Japanese yen, down from 97.33. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rising on general optimism, the stock market performed as it often 
does after a sharp decline, rebounding as investors bought shares that tumbled 
in last week's more than 3% decline in the Dow average, said Michael Metz, 
managing director at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks performed particularly well, Hays said, amid expectations 
that a key indicator for the semiconductor industry and the entire technology 
industry -- the book-to-bill ratio -- would be strong for October. The ratio 
measures orders and shipments for U.S. semiconductor companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader market indicators, the NYSE's composite index rose 0.99 point to 
255.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.58 points to 465.65, while 
the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.23 points to 767.54 on the back of strong 
technology stocks. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 
0.64 point to 451.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 289.14 million shares, up from 
256.20 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kemper rose 3/4 to 51 on reports that four financial services firms, 
including Dean Witter Discover & Co., were exploring a takeover of the company. 
Last week, Canseco Inc. reduced its offer for Kemper to $60 a share from $67. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotus Development and Hewlett-Packard said they agreed on a broad strategic 
alliance. Hewlett-Packard, also boosted by bullish comments from Salomon Bros., 
rose 1 3/8 to 98. Lotus gained 3/16 to 38 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unum tumbled 6 3/8 to 40 1/4 after posting a third-quarter loss and taking 
an unexpectedly large charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trico Products, a maker of windshield-wiper systems, surged 20 1/2 to 81 1/2 
on news that it was being acquired by Stant Corp. at $85 a share. Stant rose 1 
1/4 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * Piper Jaffray dropped 7/8 to 9 3/4 after it reported a drop in its 
fourth-quarter profit and cut its quarterly dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rose, including Microsoft, which rose 1 3/4 to 63 5/8; 
Apple Computer, up 1 1/2 to 42 1/2, and Applied Materials, up 3 to 51 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southwest Airlines fell 1 3/8 to 21 7/8. The company forecast that 
fourth-quarter profit would be below year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad. Short-covering pushed prices higher in Frankfurt, 
with the DAX 30-share average rising 9.92 points to 2,053.44. Tokyo's 225-share 
Nikkei average ended at 19,609.02, down 10.20 points. In London, the Financial 
Times 100-share average lost 2 points to close at 3,063.8. Mexico's Bolsa index 
gained 23.59 points, closing at 2,611.94, about four points off its session 
high.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; ENRON PLAN FOCUSES LIGHT 
ON THE IMPROVING SOLAR CELL; ENERGY: FIRM SAYS NEW METHODS CAN PRODUCE 
PHOTOVOLTAIC ELECTRIC POWER AT 25% OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES' COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A surprising proposal by Enron Corp. to produce photovoltaic electric power 
for a quarter of the cost of existing technologies has refocused attention on 
the steadily improving solar cell. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 15 years of development, photovoltaic cells are commonplace on 
hand-held calculators, satellites and in remote locations. But photovoltaic 
energy will have to be as cheap or cheaper than the 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour 
that Enron aims to achieve if it is to reach the larger ambition of its 
proponents -- to carve out a major role as a utility-size power generator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is on our side. A lot of people will be using it in the future," says 
Richard King, program manager for photovoltaic research at the Department of 
Energy. But in the meantime, King says, "there is the chicken-and-egg problem." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as it costs 25 cents a kilowatt-hour for solar cells to make energy -- 
compared to 3.5 to 4.5 cents for the newest generation of natural gas turbines 
-- utilities and their government regulators will remain reluctant to support 
large-scale generating arrays. Yet proponents say that the economies of scale 
from big installations would be a major factor in bringing costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cottage industry," King says, "and you have to lift it out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the solar power world is abuzz over the Enron proposal. The 
Houston-based energy giant has proposed to build a 100-megawatt plant at the 
Department of Energy's Nevada test site near Las Vegas -- huge by photovoltaic 
industry standards. And it says it can do so without research and development 
subsidies, though it does want a DOE contract to buy the power at the 5.5-cent 
price and tax-free bonds to help finance construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Enron, which just completed a mammoth 1,875-megawatt natural gas generating 
plant in England, would invest $150-million in the project, with an eye to 
exporting the technology to the energy-hungry developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the impact of such a plant: Only 7 megawatts of photovoltaic 
electricity are now being fed into utility power lines worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one questions the technology itself anymore. The first solar cells 
were 6% efficient -- that is, they converted to electricity 6% of the sunlight 
that fell on them. (The other solar technology, thermal, focuses the heat of 
the sun on water, oil or liquid salt, which in turn powers 
electricity-generating turbines.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today, standard photovoltaic cells are 12% to 14% efficient. Last week, the 
Electric Power Research Institute, which manages research for the nation's 
electric utilities, announced that Amonix Inc. of Torrance has a solar cell 
system that is more than 20% efficient. In the lab, experimental cells have 
reached 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in place, solar panels have proven to be largely maintenance-free for two 
decades or more -- and, of course, there are no fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Enron declines to give details of its cost-cutting technology, Kelly 
said the company's plan exploits economies of scale as well as improvements in 
the non-solar-cell parts of the system. But it would also involve one of the 
most widely watched research paths: development of so-called thin-film cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common photovoltaic technology uses crystalline silicon. The material 
must be expensively treated and formed into glass-hard ingots, which are then 
sliced with diamond saws and individually wired into a panel. These cells are 
the most efficient so far but are labor-intensive to produce and waste 20% of 
the ingot material in the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 With thin-film technology, a very thin layer of the photovoltaic substance is 
usually sprayed directly on a glass panel, a procedure easily performed in an 
automated factory. So far, thin-film panels are no more than 6% to 10% 
efficient. Another approach, called spherical cell technology, has reached 10% 
efficiency as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "But thin film is certainly the technology that a lot of people feel holds the 
ultimate hope for less cost. . . . It just uses a whale of a lot less 
material," says Jim Birk, EPRI manager of renewables and hydro. 
</P>
<P>
 While utility-scale solar arrays are still not here, a few utilities are 
already finding uses for photovoltaic power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento Municipal Utility District now gets 2.6 megawatts of its total 
844-megawatt load from photovoltaic facilities, including the world's largest 
existing plant -- a 2-megawatt array at Rancho Seco, 30 miles from Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Through Southern California Edison, customers who want lights in their 
mountain cabins without paying to bring in power lines can now lease solar cell 
systems set up and maintained by the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison also recently set up solar panels at a neighborhood school in South 
Pasadena. The new power will augment existing lines in the area, which have 
reached capacity. The photovoltaic array is cost-effective compared to the 
disruption and expense of tearing up the streets to put in larger wires. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is called distributed generation, and many proponents see it as the 
answer to the power demands of developing nations lacking their own fossil 
fuels or a way to avoid the high cost of national transmission grids like those 
in industrialized countries.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; USING YOUR COMPUTER TO SPREAD HOLIDAY CHEER

<P>
 Personal computers cannot sew T-shirts or manufacture coffee mugs, at least 
not directly. But enterprising software developers have figured out ways to 
enable you and your PC to create these and other items, thus adding a new 
dimension to holiday gift giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you want to stick with more traditional gifts, you can still use your 
PC and printer to make greeting cards, holiday posters and banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Gift Maker ($45.95) from Maxis ((800) 336-2947) is the most comprehensive 
program for creating personalized items. 
</P>
<P>
 The software, which requires Windows, is essentially a simple graphics program 
that lets you combine clip art, text and borders against an outline of whatever 
gift you've selected. Once you've created the design, you send it in via modem 
or mail in a diskette, and the personalized gift arrives at your home a few 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 40 items to choose from, including an apron ($15.95), baseball 
cap ($11.95), clock ($19.95), mug ($19.95) and Christmas tree ornament ($9.95). 
T-shirts start at $13.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the program doesn't have any drawing tools, it does come with lots of 
"clip art" images. And you can import graphics created by other programs, as 
well as scanned photos. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter Katherine used it to create a T-shirt with pictures of our pets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another company, T-Shirts Online ((207) 865-3077), allows you to use any PC or 
Macintosh graphics program to design your own shirts. You don't need any 
special software -- even Paintbrush, which comes with Windows, will do -- and 
you can include photos, graphics or text from virtually any type of graphics 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've created a file, you can send it by modem ((207) 865-1806) or mail 
a diskette. The shirts start at $14.90, plus $3 shipping for every two shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 William, my 8-year-old, loves the T-shirt he created: The photo he used had to 
be blown up and looks a little grainy, but it's still quite nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeting cards, banners and other decorations can be created with any graphics 
program, but Print Shop Deluxe makes the task truly painless. 
</P>
<P>
 When you start the program, you're given a choice of a greeting card, banner, 
sign or calendar. For a greeting card, the program prints out a single sheet 
you can fold into a card. 
</P>
<P>
 The calendar can be personalized with birthdays, anniversaries and other 
events. The program comes with hundreds of graphics images and lets you import 
others. A CD-ROM version for Windows ($79.95) works with Photo CD images, 
prints labels and includes an address list manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Print Shop is very easy to use, but it's not as versatile as a general-purpose 
graphics or desktop publishing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Publisher 2.0, a desktop publishing program for home and small 
businesses, includes a greeting card feature and can also be used to create 
brochures, flyers, newsletters, banners and just about any other type of 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Visio Home from ShapeWare is a fine Windows drawing program and can be used to 
create greeting cards, calendars, family trees, maps, garden plans and other 
illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes with pre-drawn shapes that you drag to any location in your document, 
and, like Print Shop, it's able to create one-page greeting cards you fold into 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a color printer, you can print out your creations in black 
and white and supply some local kids with a box of crayons. Photos add a lot to 
these cards and gifts: If you don't have a scanner, find a local copy shop or 
service bureau that will scan your photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without graphics software, you can create surprisingly attractive signs 
and posters with your word-processing program. Nearly all Windows and Mac 
word-processing software lets you insert graphics files, and most -- including 
Word, WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Microsoft Works -- come with a collection of 
graphics. ClarisWorks 3.0 ($99), the integrated program for Mac and Windows 
from Claris Corp. ((800) 544-8554), has built in "assistants" that will 
automatically create certificates, calendars, flyers and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, I imported some graphics into Microsoft Word, created a one-page 
Christmas greeting, then used my fax modem to send it to colleagues the day 
before Christmas. It's nerdy, I know, but some people appreciated the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a wider choice of pictures and drawings, you can purchase clip art 
from various companies. 
</P>
<P>
 T/Maker offers a package called the Holiday Seasonings with images for 
Hanukkah, Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Year's; Occasions and Celebrations 
also includes Fourth of July, birthdays, weddings, graduation and other 
holidays and events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paper Direct ((800) 272-7377) offers high-quality greeting cards you can 
imprint using a laser printer or certain ink-jet printers. A box with 15 
greeting cards and envelopes costs $18.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also makes fancy paper and stock for bumper stickers, signs and 
all sorts of other creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many on-line services, computer bulletin boards and the Internet also have 
stocks of graphics files for downloading via modem. Prodigy, for a fee, enables 
customers to send electronic greeting cards to other Prodigy members. (Jump 
"Greeting.") 
</P>
<P>
 And Mac users with a hankering for Christmas lights and Hanukkah candles can 
try Christmas Lights ($19.95) from Atticus Software ((203) 348-6100), which 
displays decorative lights on your screen while you work. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday music plays in the background, and, after a few minutes of inactivity, 
a "snow blower" screen saver takes over your screen. The music, thankfully, can 
be turned off. Software for the Season

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CALM DOWN -- IT'S TIME 
FOR COMDEX TO REAR ITS MONSTROUS HEAD; COMPUTERS: MICROSOFT'S ON-LINE SERVICE 
IS EXPECTED TO MAKE THE BIGGEST SPLASH AT THE TRADE SHOW THE INDUSTRY LOVES TO 
HATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the madness and mayhem of Comdex, add Marvel. That's the code name for 
software giant Microsoft Corp.'s entry into the booming category of on-line 
services, which Chairman Bill Gates himself is expected to unveil to the media 
Monday on the mega-convention's opening day in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel is likely to make the biggest splash at the fall Comdex, that monstrous 
trade show the computer world loves to hate. It looms again -- all five days, 
2,200 exhibits, 2.5 million square feet and 190,000 attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 With the computer industry experiencing boom times, Comdex is a must for 
computer vendors, electronics retailers and technology journalists -- but few 
relish the experience. Taxi lines are endless, plane reservations impossible 
and prices for booth space and hotel rooms extortionate. 
</P>
<P>
 And Comdex has become too big and diffuse to be the hotbed of breaking news it 
once was. These days, it's almost better known for its lavish after-hours 
parties. (Details below.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Most larger companies try to avoid making announcements at Comdex because you 
just get lost in the noise," said Richard Shaffer, a principal in Technologic 
Partners, a New York consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be some trends and companies to watch. If you're headed there, 
here's a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * The PowerPC partners -- IBM, Apple and Motorola -- have leased a 
17,000-square-foot tent in the convention center parking lot to showcase their 
efforts to make their new microprocessor a force with which Intel must reckon. 
Inside this "PowerPC Pavilion," 60-odd software developers will demonstrate 
applications on a variety of operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * An ideal fillip for the PowerPC triumvirate would be an announcement by some 
company -- notably IBM -- that it is licensing Apple's Macintosh operating 
system, but experts who read the industry's silicon flecks don't foresee such a 
revelation at Comdex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft's Marvel -- one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry -- will 
finally get a formal public airing at a media luncheon Monday. Will Microsoft 
Network -- as it's likely to be named -- run away with the entire installed 
base of Windows users? Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the technologically challenged (i.e., most of us), computer maker Acer 
America will spotlight its "Out of Box Experience," a new on-line service on 
Acer multimedia systems that walks a user through the set-up of software and 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch for some interesting portables -- very lightweight, very thin, fully 
functional -- from Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three heavy hitters -- Gates of Microsoft, Bob Frankenberg of Novell and 
Andrew Grove of Intel -- will deliver keynote speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 * And now for the really important stuff: the parties. On Monday night, Tony 
Bennett croons for WordPerfect and Novell, while Eric Idle of Monty Python fame 
graces multimedia fledgling 7th Level's "Complete Waste of Time" bash, 
featuring hot rock 'n' roll from the likes of one-time Pink Floyd saxophonist 
Scott Page. Willie Nelson headlines Micrografx's Tuesday evening 
"Chili-for-Children Cook-Off" fund-raiser for the National Center for Missing 
and Exploited Children. And Intuit, whose full-court press in personal finance 
software prompted Microsoft to offer to buy it for $1.5 billion in stock, 
features the Harlem Globetrotters in a Wednesday night hoop-la.

 With their firms' share prices slipping on worries about Microsoft's upcoming 
on-line service, executives of two of the nation's leading on-line service 
providers took aim at the software company Tuesday over its ambitions to become 
a player in their business, suggesting it would be an unfair competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online shares fell $6.75, or 9.3%, to $66.25 Monday in heavy Nasdaq 
trading, and shares of H&R Block, which owns CompuServe, fell $1.25, or 2.9%, 
to $42.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of Marvel," said Keith Benjamin, analyst at Robertson Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel is the code name of the on-line service Microsoft, the world's largest 
personal computer software company, is developing. Until now, Microsoft 
officials would not officially confirm that the company would introduce such a 
service, but the Redmond, Wash.-based firm said its chairman and chief 
executive, Bill Gates, will unveil its on-line strategy at the big Comdex 
computer show in Las Vegas next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a conference in New York on the future of electronic commerce, 
executives from America Online and CompuServe said they are concerned that 
Microsoft may include an on-line service directly in its soon-to-be-released 
Windows 95 operating system. That would enable a computer user to hook into 
Microsoft's service with a click of a mouse. To access America Online or 
CompuServe, by contrast, users have to load up a separate program.  
</P>
<P>
 "The (Windows) Operating System is almost like what dial tone is to the phone 
industry," said Steve Case, America Online's chief executive. He argued that 
just as consumers who pick up a phone automatically get a phone company's 
signal, Microsoft's huge installed base means that anybody who signs on to a 
computer will be on its "line." Phone firms have been regulated to assure 
access to other telecommunications concerns, Case said, and in the computer 
field, "there needs to be a level playing field on which companies can 
compete."  
</P>
<P>
 Case said Microsoft should be free to market a stand-alone on-line service 
that competes with existing services but that such a service must remain 
distinct from Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the Justice Department has raised concerns about the antitrust 
implications of Microsoft's acquisition of Intuit Inc. He said America Online 
is watching to see how regulators will act. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tim Oren, CompuServe's technology vice president, who was also at the 
conference: "We welcome the competition as long as the playing field is level 
and we're not dealing with cross-subsidies." In a cross-subsidy, a company 
sells a product at less than market value by supporting it with resources from 
other units. The executives expressed concern about the entry of not only 
Microsoft, but also the potential for phone companies, specifically AT&T Corp., 
to join the competition.

 Michael Hoffmann, professor of environmental chemistry at the California 
Institute of Technology, thinks that one way to neutralize toxic chemicals in 
water is to blast them with sound. 
</P>
<P>
 When sufficiently powerful ultrasound is sent through a liquid, microscopic 
bubbles form, swelling until they reach a size whose natural resonant frequency 
-- the wavelength of its vibrations -- equals the ultrasound frequency. Like 
wine glasses shattered by powerful soprano voices, the bubbles absorb sound 
energy, balloon outward and collapse, all in a few microseconds. 
</P>
<P>
 As they explode, the temperature inside the bubbles briefly soars as high as 
5,500 degrees Celsius. That's hot enough to incinerate any organic chemical. 
Hoffman's group has worked with drug, heavy manufacturing and electronics 
firms, all of which produce chemicals that are difficult and costly to treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the Memory: Unless you are one of those who believe you can't be 
too thin, too rich or have too much computer memory, Christmas morning could 
turn out to be memorable in all the wrong ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia-equipped home computers are expected to fly off the shelves this 
holiday season. But many of the systems being sold might not support the most 
popular software programs, some of which are serious memory hogs.  
</P>
<P>
 The mega-hit "Doom," for example, devours 15 megabytes of hard disk space, and 
another must-have game, "Strike Commander," logs in at 11 MB. And if you 
purchase a high-capacity hard disk, there is the computer's internal memory to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in time for the holidays comes Stac Electronics with its Multimedia 
Stacker. The program uses the same compression technology in Stac's original 
products to squeeze more than twice as much space out of the hard drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia Cloaking, which was developed by Helix Software, is included free 
with the Stac multimedia product to deal with the internal memory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all of the multimedia add-ons such as sound cards and video boards 
take up a good chunk of the 640K of "lower memory" DOS allots for running 
programs, a multimedia program that needs 600K of that lower memory won't run. 
Essentially, Multimedia Cloaking puts enough of the drivers for the multimedia 
peripherals into extended memory, freeing up the lower memory for the games. 
Multimedia Stacker sells for less than $100 retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat Your Explosives: No one should horse around with explosives. But that's 
what Kimberly Ogden, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at the 
University of Arizona, and researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico are doing -- sort of. They're using bacteria commonly found in horse 
manure to eliminate the explosive residues left over from the manufacture of 
RDX, the military equivalent of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria eat the carbon and nitrates that are the active ingredients in 
RDX, converting them to carbon dioxide and other more stable compounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Because TNT and RDX must be kept wet during their manufacture -- a single 
spark could set them off -- a great deal of dangerous waste water is left over. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, explosives makers use charcoal filters to clean the water, then toss 
the contaminated charcoal. Or they let the water evaporate and burn the 
residue. But if bacteria are allowed to convert the explosives that accumulate 
in the filters, the charcoal can be used to filter more water. 
</P>
<P>
 Gluing Chips With Static Cling: Electrostatic charges are no fun when you get 
zapped by a door handle or find your new skirt glued to your legs. But at the 
Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, these 
same charges are being put to good use. Researchers in NIST's Materials Science 
and Engineering Laboratory have patented a process that makes the charges act 
like a glue to stick the smooth surfaces of silicon oxide and some forms of 
gallium arsenide together.  
</P>
<P>
 The naturally acidic surfaces of these materials readily give up positively 
charged subatomic particles, or protons. By bonding a single molecular layer of 
a basic chemical that wants to take on extra protons to the silicon oxide, a 
proton exchange occurs. When the silicon oxide and the gallium arsenide come 
together, the two surfaces are oppositely charged -- and the electrostatic pull 
"glues" them together. Like sticky Post-it notes, the top layer can be peeled 
off and repositioned. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no commercial applications at the moment, but the electrostatic glue 
could prove useful in creating hybrid chips, especially because the glue layer 
is very thin.

 On the eve of launching a $100-million advertising campaign, Microsoft Corp. 
on Tuesday lured a top executive from consumer products firm Procter & Gamble 
Co. to become chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Herbold, 52, a senior vice president at P&G who has been in the 
forefront of the advertising industry's movement to interactive television, 
will join Microsoft's three-member Office of the President with a mandate to 
help develop corporate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Executive Vice Presidents Mike Maples and Steve Ballmer are the 
other members of the group, which works closely with Chairman and Chief 
Executive Bill Gates to coordinate the software giant's efforts to continue its 
rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbold is essentially taking over the role formerly played by Chief Financial 
Officer Frank Gaudette, who died in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbold will be responsible for worldwide operations, including finance, 
manufacturing, distribution, information technology and human resources. Maples 
oversees products and marketing, and Ballmer oversees sales and support 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Maples said in an interview that it is a coincidence that the new Microsoft 
executive comes from Procter & Gamble, the nation's biggest advertiser, just as 
Microsoft is about to launch a new brand-awareness campaign.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; 9 GROUPS WIN PAGING 
LICENSES AT FCC AUCTION

 The government auction of regional paging licenses ended Tuesday with nine 
groups submitting winning bids for licenses to offer a new generation of paging 
and messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
 PageMart Inc. and PCS Development Corp. -- a consortium that includes Arch 
Communications Corp., A-Plus Communications and USA Mobile Communications Inc. 
-- were the big winners.Each offered to pay more than $90 million for five 
regional licenses, enough to gain nationwide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, American Paging Inc., MobileMedia Corp., AirTouch Communications, 
Benbow PCS Ventures and individual investor Lisa-Gaye Shearing each captured 
several licenses. Ameritech Corp. and Insta-Check Systems Inc. won a single 
license each. 
</P>
<P>
 Total high bids for the auction rose over 10 days to $488.8 million. However, 
groups owned by minorities and women will get 40% discounts from the Federal 
Communications Commission on some of the licenses, so the government's total 
earnings from the auction will be $394.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will use the licenses to offer such things as "pocket answering 
machine services," delivering voice or electronic messages directly to small 
pagers.

PREGNANT RATS IN SPACE FACE BIRTHS ON EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Biologists are pacing back and forth, awaiting the birth of more than 300 rats 
as shuttle Atlantis soars overhead with the first pregnant mammals to fly 
aboard a U.S. spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 pregnant rats -- and 20 others in a NASA laboratory in Florida -- are 
part of an experiment to see how weightlessness affects fetal development. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are kind of walking the floors like expectant fathers," Hubert Burden, 
a professor of anatomy and cell biology at East Carolina University in 
Greenville, N.C., said Tuesday. "We're quite anxious. We don't know what's 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists will have to wait until next week to find out. None of the rats are 
supposed to give birth until after Atlantis returns to Earth on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each rat has at least 10 fetuses. Female rats have two wombs. Burden and other 
researchers will deliver the babies by Cesarean section from one womb of each 
space rat shortly after landing; the mothers should give birth naturally two 
days later from the other womb. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground rats will give birth about the same time, the same way, for 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 All the animals will eventually be killed for dissection. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tanner, one of Atlantis' six astronauts, said Tuesday that during the 
first four days of the 11-day ozone-studying mission, the rats "would huddle 
together and be very quiet, not moving around very much, kind of the way I 
wanted to be for the first couple days." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, day No. 5, "they were moving around and grooming themselves and 
looked to be very happy and very healthy," Tanner said. That's about how long 
it took Tanner, a first-time space flier, to adjust to weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of all astronauts suffer motion sickness during their first few 
days in orbit.

CLINTON MEETS 2 WHO HALTED GUNMAN AT WHITE HOUSE; VIOLENCE: THE PRESIDENT 
OFFERS THE PAIR HIS THANKS AND 'A LITTLE OF HIS FAMOUS SMALL TALK.' ONE HAS A 
GOAL OF JOINING THE SECRET SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two tourists who tackled a gunman at the White House received President 
Clinton's thanks Tuesday, and one said his ultimate goal is to join the Secret 
Service and protect the President full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that would be the ultimate, to help protect the President and the 
country in that way, said Kenneth A. Davis, a Maryland state corrections 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a Beeville, Tex., native living in Hagerstown, Md., and Harry Rakosky 
of San Antonio were strangers to each other when they rushed the gunman on the 
Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk outside the White House on Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton offered his personal thanks to both in a meeting in the Oval Office. 
Davis said Rakosky, 34, didn't want to meet reporters because "he just wants 
some peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President wanted to thank us officially," Davis said. "He gave us a 
handshake and a good time and a little of his famous small talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he and Rakosky did not coordinate their movements when they moved 
in on the gunman. Francisco Martin Duran, 26, an ex-convict from Colorado 
Springs, Colo., has been arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the gunman had fired 10 or 12 shots through the White House fence, 
then backed away, swept the gun barrel toward the tourists surrounding him and 
fired six or seven more shots before stopping to reload. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, he said, he and Rakosky moved independently and jumped the 
gunman before he could fire again. Their feet, he said, "just started going." 
</P>
<P>
 What were his motives? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned with the President, of course, and the schoolchildren who 
were there on the sidewalk and the tourists," he said. "I couldn't have lived 
with myself if I hadn't done anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Once down, the gunman said nothing, Davis recalled. "He just lay there 
passive. He just kicked his feet once. He looked really distant, like he wasn't 
really there." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was asked whether he thought the gunman was trying to hurt Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was a group of people near the White House at the time and it 
appeared to him that Duran was shooting at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel he was shooting at someone," he said. "I can't say what was in his 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked whether he believes that security at the White House is adequate 
and whether Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the executive mansion should be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely do not think Pennsylvania Avenue should be closed," he said. 
"That Saturday was the first time I had ever been at the White House, but I 
think I and others should be able to come up and see it close up. I agree with 
the President wholeheartedly on that."

CUOMO IN TIGHT RACE WITH PATAKI; NEW YORK: INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR 
BENEFITING FROM THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE'S STRONG SHOWING IN NORTHERN PART OF THE 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Befitting their bitter campaign, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican 
opponent, state Sen. George Pataki, were locked in a tight race Tuesday that 
pitted voters in New York City against northern regions of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit polls showed the governor running well with constituencies he diligently 
courted. Cuomo was receiving 90% of the black vote and scoring better among men 
than polls taken before the election had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent candidate B. Thomas Golisano was cutting into Pataki's vote, 
particularly upstate, where election officials said the turnout was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, election officials said the turnout was "moderate to heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 A defining event of the bitterly contested election was the endorsement of 
Cuomo by New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, prompting 
Pataki to lash out that the mayor was a "back-stabber." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pataki pledged he would work with Giuliani in an effort to 
blunt fears among city voters of a feud that could harm the city's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 After Giuliani's backing, which also earned the wrath of Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato, the contest tightened in polls. "He (Giuliani) certainly gave him a 
big shove," said a key Cuomo adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also appeared with Cuomo and called him a "national 
treasure." A parade of Cabinet members visited the state to reinforce that 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo's advisers hoped for a heavy turnout in New York City and that 
Golisano's candidacy would hold down Pataki's upstate margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hopes received a boost last weekend when the 52-year-old Rochester, 
N.Y., businessman, who sought the governorship as the candidate of the 
Independence Fusion Party and who vowed to spend $10 million of his own funds 
on the contest, received the backing of Ross Perot, an independent presidential 
candidate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot praised Golisano's campaign as "electroshock therapy to the political 
system" and said Golisano's third party would be a "tangible signal to Albany 
and Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides hoping Golisano would shock Pataki upstate, Cuomo and Giuliani mounted 
a large get-out-the-vote drive, especially in minority New York City 
neighborhoods. To win, the governor needed a strong turnout among blacks and 
Jews and other members of the city's traditional Democratic coalition.  
</P>
<P>
 Election Day was a civic holiday, and state and city employees were enlisted 
on their own time in the vote-getting effort. New York City's largest municipal 
union sent a letter to its 130,000 members urging them to reelect Cuomo. The 
union fielded 3,400 volunteers to help voters get to the polls. Volunteers 
manning phone banks made about 4 million calls on behalf of the governor in the 
closing days of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was a brawl from the beginning. Cuomo's commercials pictured 
Pataki as the untrustworthy captive of D'Amato, who engineered the GOP 
candidate's nomination, helped him raise money and supplied key members of 
Pataki's staff. The governor promised a high-tech future for New York State and 
pledged to "build a new New York where a productive job is available for 
everyone who wants to work." 
</P>
<P>
 To the argument that he was in office too long, Cuomo quipped that he has been 
married to his wife, Matilda, for 40 years, and "if she starts thinking that 
way, I'm in big trouble . . . unless she had somebody better -- if she had a 
bright young guy with a lot of money who could do the mambo." 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki's well-scripted campaign hammered home several themes in addition to 
the argument that a dozen years was enough and a vote for the Republican 
candidate was a vote for change and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 With New Jersey's Gov. Christine Todd Whitman at his side, the Republican 
candidate pledged he would cut state taxes by 25%. He also pressed his support 
for the death penalty, a mandatory cap on state spending, no parole for violent 
felons and term limits for elected officials.

HOMELESS WOMAN'S HELPERS LOSE BEQUEST

 A state lawmaker and an aide who inherited about $200,000 apiece from a 
homeless woman they had helped were stripped of the money Tuesday by a judge 
who ruled that they took advantage of a mentally ill woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Mary Guzelian, had rewritten her will in 1981 to benefit Rep. Kevin 
Fitzgerald, his aide Patricia McDermott and a third person who acted as 
executor of the will, after McDermott helped Guzelian fight eviction.

SECURITY GUARD STABBED IN S.F. NEWSPAPER STRIKE; LABOR: TENSION RISES AS 
COMPANY DEADLINE TO REPLACE STRIKERS APPROACHES. TALKS CONTINUE IN MAYOR'S 
OFFICE WITH THE HELP OF A FEDERAL MEDIATOR.

<P>
 A security guard was stabbed at a distribution center Tuesday as the San 
Francisco newspaper strike ended its first week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, negotiations between the Conference of Newspaper Unions and the two 
dailies, the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner, continued with 
the help of a federal mediator in Mayor Frank Jordan's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension has increased as a Wednesday 5 p.m. deadline set by the newspapers 
approached. The Chronicle and Examiner have threatened to replace any of the 
2,600 strikers who do not return to work by that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few feet from the labor talks, other city officials were increasingly 
critical of the high cost of policing the strike, which Supervisor Kevin 
Shelley estimated at $100,000 a day in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Carole Migden suggested that the newspapers should share some of 
that cost, generating an angry reaction from James Hale, president of the San 
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which handles the business end of both papers under 
a joint operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The working employees at our facilities deserve protection just like anyone 
else," said Hale. "We, as citizens of this city, are being subjected on a daily 
basis to violence, intimidation and threats." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence broke out early Tuesday at a Hayward distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guard Joseph Legg, 55, was stabbed and guard David Donnelly, 56, was 
sprayed with a Mace-like chemical when their van was attacked by four masked 
men outside the site just after midnight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 30 people were picketing at the time, said Hayward Police Lt. Charley 
Heitz, and authorities believe that the attack was strike-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating this very seriously," Heitz said. "There was a stabbing there. 
It could very easily have been a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Legg remained hospitalized Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper management said that a few hours after the Hayward incident someone 
fired shots into a San Francisco distribution shed, but police said they found 
no bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Union spokesman Steve Chin said there was no evidence that strikers were 
involved and noted that all the witnesses cited were newspaper security 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute delivery drivers were resorting to strong-arm tactics of their own, 
Chin said, sending burly security guards to drop off papers at stores refusing 
to accept them during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Circulation of the two papers continued to improve Tuesday, management said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few papers have been distributed within San Francisco since the strike began 
Nov. 1, but on Tuesday papers were selling briskly at the Powell Street cable 
car turntable at Market Street, said Steve Falk of the agency's distribution 
department. The agency said more than 400,000 Chronicles were delivered 
throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials say the newspapers are inflating distribution figures by 
including bundles that are shipped out on trucks but end up sitting on 
sidewalks or in warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout began after negotiators failed to reach an agreement on the about 
150 delivery driver jobs, a pay raise and other issues. The contracts for 
reporters, ad salespeople, printers and delivery drivers expired Nov. 1, 1993.

POLICE WILL USE QUAKE SENSORS TO PINPOINT GUNFIRE LOCATIONS; LAW: COMPUTERS

 Technology that pinpoints earthquake epicenters will be used to develop a 
computer system giving police the location of gunfire seconds after shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, unanimously approved by the City Council, is seen by residents 
and community leaders as a way for police to crack down on increasingly random 
gunfire in parts of Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't understand what it's like until you've experienced diving (for 
safety) with a child in hand," said Maria Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 East Redwood City residents had wanted the council to spend more than $250,000 
on an elaborate system to track gunfire. But because the council wanted to hire 
more police officers, it agreed Monday to spend $25,000 to develop a pilot 
gunfire tracking system to see if it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have found that gunfire shows up on police dispatch computer 
screens within four seconds of an initial shot. Tests conducted in the desert 
were accurate within 10 feet of a shot and occasionally within one yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The system probably will be tested in a one-square-mile area of Redwood City 
and unincorporated San Mateo County. Light posts and buildings will be equipped 
with sound sensors and electronic lines tuned to listen for gunfire 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists developed the project using the same seismic technology that 
measures the strength and epicenter of earthquakes. When three or more sensors 
pick up the sound of a shot, a computer uses millisecond differences to 
calculate where the sound originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of the shot is displayed to police dispatchers on a detailed 
computerized map. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some kinks in the technology. Work is being done so the computer can 
differentiate among the sounds of gunshots, firecrackers and cars backfiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which received a $5.5-million federal grant, also is implementing 
a citywide system to track the location of gunfire.

2 PRISONERS WHO ESCAPED KEPT HEAVILY GUARDED; COURTS: THE MARSHAL'S SERVICE 
SEEKS TO KEEP THEM SHACKLED DURING TRIAL IN LAS VEGAS, WHERE THEY WERE CAPTURED 
AFTER BREAKING OUT OF LOMPOC PENITENTIARY LAST YEAR.

 The U.S. Marshal's Service says two escaped California prisoners are such a 
danger that 11 deputies have been assigned to guard them when their trial 
begins in U.S. District Court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated threats of physical harm and escape by Rick Lee Archer and Gene 
Michael Diulio have prompted the Marshal's Service to declare them "the highest 
level of threat" to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which at first attempted to have the trial conducted via 
closed-circuit television from the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., is now 
asking a judge to order that the men be shackled during trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Howard Zlotnick, in recent court pleadings, spelled out 
detailed developments that he said indicate the two were willing to escape at 
any cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlotnick said authorities found a 60-foot-long homemade rope and vacuum parts 
in Archer's cell when he was being housed at the Clark County Detention Center. 
Archer had broken a window in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Diulio had torn a mirror off the wall in his cell in order to be moved to a 
unit closer to Archer, according to Zlotnick. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, prison officials at Marion had an X-ray taken of Archer and found 
two handcuff keys and two shivs hidden in his rectum. 
</P>
<P>
 The men also have threatened to take a physician's aide hostage and kill 
certain corrections officers at the detention center, Zlotnick said. He said 
letters from Archer, signed "Josey Wales," detail the route from the jail to 
the federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "All participants in the trial are at risk," Zlotnick said, asking U.S. 
District Judge Lloyd George to place a cover over the defense table to conceal 
the shackles from the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Diulio defense attorney Dan Albregts said Monday that he was concerned about 
his client's right to communicate with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the way they communicate is in writing," he said. "I don't know what 
proposal they have in mind, whether their arms are going to be free to write." 
</P>
<P>
 Archer, 38, and Diulio, 31, were captured in Las Vegas last year after a bank 
robbery, double carjacking and escape from a federal penitentiary in Lompoc, 
Calif. Both have extensive prison and escape records. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has asserted that the two have connections outside prison that 
could help in an escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshal's Service Deputy John Shoemaker said the two represent the greatest 
risk he has seen in his 8 1/2 years at the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker said that after their Aug. 27 escape from Lompoc, the pair became 
suspects in a Santa Barbara homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are serving lengthy prison terms for other escape and 
kidnaping-related crimes that will keep them in prison until well after 2000.

 Three young men convicted of murdering California scholar Amy Biehl have begun 
a hunger strike to demand political amnesty, a South African prison official 
said.The students were sentenced Oct. 26 to 18 years in prison. SABC radio said 
the three men -- members of the militant Pan Africanist Student Organization -- 
were refusing to eat and demanding that their crime be seen as political. If 
the men can demonstrate that it was politically motivated and admit their 
guilt, they could qualify for amnesty under a bill now before Parliament.

REPUBLICANS' RISING TIDE SPILLS OVER INTO STATEHOUSES; POLITICS: GOP LOOKS 
VIRTUALLY CERTAIN TO CONTROL MAJORITY OF GOVERNORSHIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
1970. DEMOCRATS LOSE TENNESSEE, OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democrats' Debacle '94 extended to statehouses across the nation Tuesday 
as Republicans appeared virtually certain to control a majority of 
governorships for the first time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans seized Democratic-held governorships in Tennessee, Oklahoma, 
Kansas and Wyoming and were in position to seize statehouses in Texas and 
Pennsylvania. The GOP seemed certain to hold the electoral-vote-rich states of 
California, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The gains, coupled with the expected reelections of many of their sitting 
governors, is likely to give the Republicans an opportunity to advance their 
tax-slashing, welfare-cutting, crime-throttling agenda in state capitols in the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the looming prospect of sclerosis in Washington, the states will become 
increasingly important as laboratories of social and fiscal policy, as popular 
Republican incumbents and energetic newcomers try to make good on conservative 
campaign pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas, GOP Secretary of State Bill Graves defeated Rep. Jim Slattery; in 
Oklahoma, former U.S. Atty. Frank Keating defeated Democratic Lt. Gov. Jack 
Mildren; in Tennessee, Rep. Don Sundquist defeated Nashville Mayor Phil 
Bredesen and, in Wyoming, GOP state Sen. Jim Geringer defeated Democratic 
Secretary of State Kathy Karpan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, Ann Richards appeared to be headed for defeat at the hands of 
businessman George W. Bush, son of the former President, despite her personal 
popularity and her matchless campaign style. Anti-incumbent fever, paired with 
deep disenchantment with President Clinton and Democratic Party policies, 
appeared to be too much for her to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards also suffered from a huge gender gap in the voting: Women supported 
Richards by 53% to 47%, while male voters backed Bush by 57% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Senate contests across the nation, Republican gubernatorial candidates 
tarred their Democratic opponents as allies of the President who espoused 
outdated Clinton-style liberal policies. While crime rates are declining 
nationally, anti-crime rhetoric was off the charts in virtually every 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's statehouse gains promise to play a role in presidential politics in 
1996, giving Republicans an organizational and fund-raising advantage in 
critical regions, while burnishing the presidential or vice-presidential 
prospects of Pete Wilson of California, William F. Weld of Massachusetts, 
George V. Voinovich of Ohio, John Engler of Michigan and some newer faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' brightest spot appeared to be Florida, where 64-year-old 
incumbent Lawton Chiles was fighting back against a furious challenge by real 
estate developer Jeb Bush, another son of the former President. The race, like 
many others across the nation, turned on the question of who was toughest on 
crime, with Bush accusing Chiles of being insufficiently energetic in his 
advocacy of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia was the scene of another closely watched race. Democratic incumbent 
Zell Miller was identified by his opponent, businessman Guy Millner, as a 
virtual clone of the President, who is deeply unpopular in Georgia and 
throughout the South. Miller, who gave a nominating speech for Clinton at the 
Democrats' 1992 convention, moved as far to the right as he could, all but 
repudiating his support for Clinton and sounding every inch a Republican as he 
fought to save his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic officials acknowledged that they had been swamped by a Republican 
and anti-incumbent tide but attributed some of their losses to population 
shifts in the South and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the Southern races there's been a demographic trend over 10 to 20 
years, a changing nature of the electorate as retirees from the Midwest move 
down. The region has become much more competitive than it ever was. It's not 
like the old days when Democrats had a lock," said Doug Richardson, chairman of 
the Democratic Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the deep animosity toward career politicians in the close races 
in New York, New Mexico and Iowa. Twelve-year Democratic incumbents Mario M. 
Cuomo in New York and Bruce King in New Mexico, and Republican Terry Branstad 
in Iowa were in the fights of their political lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long-term incumbents face a more difficult test with each subsequent 
election," Richardson said. "The bar keeps getting raised before the voters let 
you go on. It's a natural phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Tom Ridge was in position to upset Democratic 
Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, using crime as a cudgel. Singel struggled after the 
revelation that as head of the state Board of Pardons he recommended parole for 
a prisoner who is now charged with rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional concerns drove many of the races, with Republican incumbents in the 
Midwest benefiting from strong economies and Democratic officeholders in the 
West suffering from the unpopularity of Clinton's land-use policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The big winners were Republican incumbents in the Midwest: Ohio's Voinovich, 
Engler of Michigan, Jim Edgar of Illinois, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and 
Arne Carlson of Minnesota. All ran on pledges of fiscal conservatism and 
toughness on crime and are likely to play a role in GOP presidential politics 
in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few Republican incumbent governors who faced a tough challenge was 
Fife Symington of Arizona, who faced charges of involvement in a failed savings 
and loan. His opponent, grocery chain owner Eddie Basha, saw a large lead 
evaporate, and the race went down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Symington, 49, a conservative developer who wants to repeal the state's 
personal income tax and create prison chain gangs, attributed his recent surge 
in the polls to a strong showing in public debates and TV attack ads that 
portrayed Basha as a "tax-and-spend liberal" who is soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Mexico, a third-party candidate could spoil the reelection hopes of 
King, a 70-year-old Democrat and rancher who was facing a photo finish against 
Republican newcomer and contractor Gary Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Gov. Roy Romer appeared headed for easy victory over his Republican 
rival, millionaire oilman Bruce Benson. A largely civil campaign dissolved when 
revelations about Benson's drunk-driving arrests and acrimonious divorce put 
him on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado's meanest and most costly political race ever, Benson, 56, who has 
invested $3.5 million of his own money into his effort, ran a campaign largely 
based on such national GOP issues as tax cuts, welfare reform and crime. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Milton Petrie, who earned a fortune as a women's clothing merchandiser and 
fame for giving money away, has died at 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrie Stores officials announced the death on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Russian immigrant, Petrie built the chain to about 1,600 stores 
across the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 He retained operating control until earlier this year, when declining health 
forced him to appoint a new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 His wealth has been estimated at more than $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrie gained renown for his acts of philanthropy, often to people whose woes 
he read about in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to the assistance of New Jersey's Kienast family in 1984, when the 
father of the quintuplets killed himself. Petrie paid their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 He also came to the aid of model Marla Hanson after a New York City landlord's 
razor attack left her scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 And he helped the families of several New York policemen injured or killed in 
the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrie is survived by his wife, Carol, a son, two daughters and two 
grandchildren.

SHORTY ROGERS, 70; JAZZ TRUMPETER AND COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorty Rogers, a trumpeter, composer and arranger who was one of the leading 
figures in the West Coast jazz scene of the early 1950s, died on Monday in Los 
Angeles. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Milton M. Rajonsky in Great Barrington, Mass., Rogers performed with the 
Woody Herman band in the late 1940s, and in 1950-51 he composed several 
important works for the Stan Kenton band. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling on the West Coast he led his own small ensembles and big bands 
before becoming active in film music, supervising the scoring for "The Wild 
One" (1953) and "The Man With the Golden Arm" (1955). 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was a pioneer in the jazz exploration of such contemporary music 
techniques as bitonality, modal improvisation and 12-tone composition, and one 
of the first trumpeters to regularly use the fluegelhorn. He worked primarily 
in film and television studios after the early 1960s.

9 CUBANS FOILED IN ATTEMPT TO FLEE REFUGEE TENT CAMP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven Cuban refugees tried to flee a tent camp at the U.S. navy base at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday, but only two reached Cuban territory, a U.S. 
military official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the escapees were returned to confinement at the base, Army Maj. Rick 
Thomas, a spokesman for the military task force running the refugee camps, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second mass break-out in three days of refugees seeking to return 
to their Communist-ruled homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a group of 85 refugees made it outside the camps, but 46 were 
recaptured by U.S. military personnel. It was unknown how many of the other 39 
made it safely to Cuban territory. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military officials say the escapes are a sign of growing anger among 
hundreds of refugees who want to go home, but are being held up by a variety of 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees escaped from a camp where about 1,000 Cubans are being held apart 
from other rafters because they have volunteered to return to Cuba.

PROTEIN FOUND THAT MAY ACTIVATE AIDS VIRUS; MEDICINE: SCIENTISTS SAY THE 
DISCOVERY COULD SPAWN TREATMENTS THAT WOULD PREVENT HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE FROM 
CONTRACTING THE FATAL DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists say they have discovered a protein that may activate the AIDS virus 
in the body and cause it to develop into AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery by University of Pennsylvania scientists could lead to 
treatments that might enable infected people to put the human immunodeficiency 
virus on hold indefinitely. They still would carry the virus but might not 
contract the fatal disease itself. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV-infected people can be healthy and live for years before the virus attacks 
the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 A protein isolated from a gene in HIV carriers appears to tell infected cells 
when to start reproducing the virus, the researchers said in an article 
published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand a new pathway the virus uses," study chief David Weiner, an 
assistant professor of pathology and medicine at the university, said in a 
telephone interview. "We now have an opportunity to design drugs to inhibit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nava Sarver, one of the chief scientists in the AIDS division of the 
National Institutes of Health, said the study is interesting but very 
preliminary. Usually, studies such as Weiner's that are conducted in the 
laboratory do not hold up when tested in bodies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many other questions need to be asked to confirm these findings," Sarver 
said. "I feel it is not right to give hope to patients who are desperate for 
any type of therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alfred Saah, an associate professor in the School of Public Health at 
Johns Hopkins University, said of the findings, "It's a hopeful sign and I 
think it's worthy of pursuit, and if it pans out it will be quite an advance." 
</P>
<P>
 The study centered on one of nine known HIV genes, "vpr." The gene produces a 
protein, known by the capitalized abbreviation "Vpr," that appears to be 
necessary before infected cells can produce new, infected viral particles that 
in turn infect other cells, Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists must know how the virus multiplies before they can design drugs to 
inhibit it, Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner's research team found in laboratory tests that the stage of infected 
people's disease corresponds with the level of "Vpr" protein in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the early stages of infection had low levels of the protein; those 
with fully developed AIDS had high levels. 
</P>
<P>
 When scientists exposed cells to the protein in the laboratory, they could 
turn latent infection to active infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner's team also found that it could block the production of new virus by 
exposing the cells to "Vpr" antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is trying to develop a vaccine that would create "Vpr" antibodies. 
The research is being conducted on small animals.

WILSON AND PROP. 187 WIN; SENATE RACE CLOSE; GOP CONTROLS CONGRESS; GOVERNOR: 
TRAILING A YEAR AGO, INCUMBENT RIDES A TIDE OF VOTER FRUSTRATION TO A DRAMATIC 
COMEBACK. THE VICTORY THRUSTS HIM INTO THE RANKS OF CONTENDERS FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE.

<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson rolled to a landslide victory over Democratic 
challenger Kathleen Brown on Tuesday to complete one of the most dramatic 
comebacks in California political history, one that thrust him firmly into the 
ranks of possible Republican contenders for the White House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 61, rode to a second four-year term on a tide of voter frustration, 
coupled with anger over crime and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined in victory by a surprising number of GOP candidates, for as 
returns came in, Republicans realized their hopes for their biggest victory 
since the Ronald Reagan-led housecleaning of 1966. Republican candidates 
apparently won at least four state wide offices -- double the number they took 
in 1990 -- and were strongly challenging in two others. The party was 
threatening to take working control of the Assembly for the first time since 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sweeping to victory Tuesday was Proposition 187, the emotion-sparking 
ballot initiative that cuts off free social benefits and education to illegal 
immigrants. Wilson and other Republicans had made Proposition 187 the 
centerpiece of their campaigns down the final stretch in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats still had hopes of holding on to the seat of U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, who was struggling against the national Republican tide and the 
nearly $30 million in personal fortune thrown at her by first-term Republican 
Rep. Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting victory, Wilson said to supporters at the Doubletree Hotel at Los 
Angeles International Airport: "What you have won today is a victory -- a 
victory for working Californians, those who work hard, play by the rules, pay 
their taxes, raise their children to obey the law, and respect themselves and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the 49-year-old incumbent state treasurer, conceded at 10:12 p.m., 
barely two hours after the polls closed. Surrounded by friends, political 
allies and her family, Brown told a subdued Democratic crowd at the Biltmore 
Hotel: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the voters of California have determined that Gov. Wilson, not I, 
should be for the next four years what Adlai Stevenson once called the 
instrument of their will." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving what observers said was one of her best speeches, Brown added: "As the 
instrument of that will, I hope and pray that having won the battle of tactics, 
he will now use his victory to help rebuild California." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who will leave office the first week in January, pledged to do what she 
could to help Wilson "chart California through this difficult passage in our 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson did not mention Brown in his public speech, aides said the two 
chatted on the telephone for five minutes before her concession. Although they 
had argued bitterly during the campaign, the phone conversation was described 
as civil. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor went on television a few minutes after Brown finished her speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson seemed to make a particular effort in his speech to calm tensions 
spilling over from the emotional campaign over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people need to understand is that this issue was never about race or 
racism," he said. "To the contrary, Californians of every race and color and 
creed voted not just to send a message, but they voted for fairness and for the 
rule of law. . . . This nation-state is a state of legal immigrants, and proud 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Just one year ago, Wilson labored along as one of the most unpopular governors 
in modern California history, hobbled by recession and a massive tax increase, 
and forced to read in the media about his impending political doom. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Brown was a well-financed media darling, heiress of a Brown 
family dynasty -- her father and brother both had been governor -- and was 
anointed the Democrats' most promising future star. She held a commanding 
15-point lead over Wilson in the polls a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, however, reversed the poll standings with an unrelenting campaign -- 
one of his trademark seamless, mistake-free efforts -- and became the sixth 
consecutive California governor to seek and win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has insisted that he is not interested in national office. But 
Washington Beltway pundits looked on Wilson's political self-resuscitation with 
awe and said he must be considered a powerful potential contender for the 
Republican presidential nomination in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's career began in the banner GOP year of 1966 when he won a seat in the 
state Assembly and Reagan defeated Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr.'s bid for a 
third term. Wilson now has beaten two out of the three Brown politicians. He 
defeated former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., Kathleen Brown's brother, for 
the U.S. Senate in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kathleen Brown linked her campaign closely to opposition to 
Proposition 187 in hopes that the controversy over the ballot measure designed 
to cut off state-paid aid to illegal immigrants would energize Democratic 
voters and get them to the polls to vote against 187 and for Brown. She also 
counted on help from President Clinton, who addressed major rallies on her 
behalf in Los Angeles and Oakland the final weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A campaign-end fuss over Brown's decision to pull scheduled television 
commercials was typical of almost the entire campaign. As often as not, Brown 
was the issue when she needed to make Wilson the focus. 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign began in 1993, Brown was a darling of the national media, a 
star at raising campaign funds and the leader in the opinion polls by as much 
as 23% over Wilson. The incumbent's job rating had sunk to record lows in the 
face of the recession and defense cutbacks that devastated the California 
economy almost from the day he took office in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After a successful 1993 legislative session, and with signs of the economy 
flickering back to life, Wilson's stock began rising slowly and steadily. At 
the same time, critics began to question the direction of Brown's campaign. It 
was, they said, long on glitz and talk about a Brown political dynasty but thin 
on substance. Even some friends and supporters said Brown had failed to 
enunciate just why she wanted to be governor, other than the fact that both her 
father and her brother had held the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had not defined herself and articulated a program that would give voters 
a reason to replace Wilson as governor, as unpopular as he had been, the 
critics said. Brown launched a series of policy speeches that contained scores 
of detailed programs, but again failed to give the campaign a central thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1994, Brown suddenly replaced her campaign team with a new 
one headed by Clint Reilly, a San Francisco consultant who ran Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan's successful campaign in 1993. But Reilly had never won a 
major statewide contest. The campaign experimented with a variety of themes 
before settling on an economic plan to rebuild California that became 
incorporated into a 62-page booklet Brown called "the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 1.5 million copies mailed to California voters and handed out 
at rallies, the plan finally gave the Brown campaign some focus by early 
October. But by then, most campaign analysts agreed, it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign was a textbook effort -- a text written by Wilson and his 
longtime team of political advisers over eight successful general election 
campaigns. They selected three major themes and stuck with them throughout the 
long election season -- crime, illegal immigration and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, Wilson rode the "three strikes" prison sentencing issue 
through the first half of 1994 and then focused on his support of Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown spent an estimated $2 million on television commercials during the 
summer trying to checkmate Wilson on crime, and in particular the question he 
constantly raised about how she could enforce California's death penalty law 
when she was personally opposed to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 By November, the opinion polls indicated that a majority of Californians 
preferred Wilson's positions on crime, the economy and immigration -- just as 
they had all along. While Brown tried to paint him as a failed governor, the 
polls indicated she had not convinced voters that she was an attractive enough 
alternative to warrant a change during uncertain times. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of negotiations, the two candidates finally agreed on one 
statewide television debate, broadcast from Sacramento in mid-October. Brown 
did well, and Wilson was uncharacteristically unsure of himself and repetitive, 
but experts said Brown did not score the sort of breakthrough she needed to 
turn the campaign around. Even more important, Wilson made no major mistake, 
even if he was not at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-debate analysis and news coverage focused on Brown's surprise disclosure 
that one of her daughters had been raped and a son had been mugged. Brown made 
the revelations while arguing that Wilson -- as tough as he sounded on crime 
issues -- could not have the personal empathy she had with crime victims. The 
attention focused on the rape matter overshadowed any other advantage Brown may 
have had from the debate.

BITTERLY FOUGHT SENATE RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 California's bruising and costly U.S. Senate contest between Democratic 
incumbent Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington was coming 
down to the wire early today as results indicated that the race was still too 
close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who was outspent more than 2 to 1 in the most expensive 
congressional race in U.S. history, appeared shortly after midnight at her 
election party in San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. She told supporters that the 
final results would probably not be known until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 She indicated she had planned to talk about her future plans, but decided to 
wait. "I'm not going to do this tonight because obviously we need to know what 
these election results are," she said as the audience chanted, "Dianne! 
Dianne!" 
</P>
<P>
 "But I want you to be encouraged," she said. "Because I have worked hard for 
the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Hadley Roff, chief of Feinstein's staff in California, said early today that 
it is possible that the race could hang in the balance for days while absentee 
ballots turned in at the polls Tuesday are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Daniels-Meade, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office, said 
there may be 500,000 to 700,000 uncounted ballots, most of them absentee 
ballots. "There are a number of races at this point in time that appear to be 
too close to call." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington appeared with his supporters at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel 
in Orange County about 11:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come down because I didn't want all of you to go home," he told a 
cheering crowd that waved Huffington placards. "We'll be back down again later 
tonight. . . . It is clear, watching what is happening across the country, that 
the Republicans are having an unbelievable victory. And what we want to do in 
California tonight is to add to that victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, when Huffington spoke briefly with reporters, he was asked if the 
bumpy campaign was worth it. "It's been very worth it," the candidate answered. 
"All of us are on this planet to do good for somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's wife, Arianna, an internationally known author, also smiled and 
said of the campaign: "Maybe there's a book in it. I'm keeping notes." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who rode a Democratic momentum into office in 1992, the so-called 
"Year of the Woman," found herself two years later paddling against a powerful 
political current. Feinstein ran a campaign about the benefits of government 
that contrasted with the hostile mood responsible for the historic gains in 
Congress for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, political observers said Feinstein suffered from the poor showing 
by Democratic colleague Kathleen Brown in the governor's race, and she was hurt 
by her opposition to Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, spent so much of the campaign attacking Feinstein that 
polls indicated he never made a strong connection with voters. In addition, his 
campaign was rocked by press stories critical of his business background, his 
wife's unconventional religious history and, most recently, his admission that 
he employed an illegal immigrant in violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Senate candidates combined to spend more than $41 million on the race, 
shattering a 10-year record of $26 million set by North Carolina Sen. Jesse A. 
Helms and his opponent. Huffington, whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of 
his family's Texas oil and gas company, accounted for almost $30 million, 
nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his money, Huffington turned the California race into a high-stakes 
cliffhanger after it had been considered by most Washington insiders to be one 
of the surest Democratic bets in the country. Feinstein was an early favorite 
because she was a veteran of two consecutive statewide campaigns and, in polls, 
she was rated the most popular politician in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Huffington spent nearly $6 million on television advertising during 
the spring, most of it attacking Feinstein's record in the Senate, the 
incumbent's lead shrank from 30% in a Times Poll in March to single digits by 
the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments set off alarms at the White House because Huffington's 
primary criticism of Feinstein last spring was her vote for President Clinton's 
1993 economic package. By late May, Feinstein had also quietly dropped her name 
from a list of senators backing the President's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Feinstein maintained a cautious alliance with the President throughout 
her campaign. Clinton appeared four times with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, just days after the polls found the race tightening, Feinstein 
responded with her first television commercials. But after a summer-long 
exchange of high-priced attack ads, the polls did not budge. As a result, both 
campaigns entered the crucial fall period still locked in a close race and 
having little hope of straying from their attack strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The predictable result was that voters grew to dislike both candidates. 
Feinstein's favorable rating fell below that for Gov. Pete Wilson and Kathleen 
Brown. And in a Times Poll just more than a week ago, barely a quarter of 
respondents said they liked Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The last week of the campaign became one of the most acrimonious, with 
disclosures that Huffington employed an illegal immigrant nanny for more than 
four years and that the work visa for Feinstein's former Guatemalan housekeeper 
expired while the woman was still employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal immigrant debate dominated the final days of the race as both 
candidates broadcast commercials about the other's case. Circumstances in the 
two cases were different, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington acknowledged that he violated federal law by employing the nanny up 
until last year. His problem was made more embarrassing because he strongly 
supported Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would cut most health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. Feinstein opposed the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Feinstein's case, immigration officials confirmed Friday that a housekeeper 
she employed a decade ago had a visa to be in the country legally only if she 
worked at the Guatemalan Consulate -- not in a private home. Even that 
permission expired a year after the woman began working for Feinstein in 1980, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein maintained, however, that she did not violate federal law because 
there was no rule against employing an illegal immigrant until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the race, name-calling and accusations dominated the contest on 
television. On the campaign trail, however, the stump speeches revealed a 
striking philosophical choice between two very different candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein championed the performance of government, highlighting everything 
from farm subsidies to disaster relief, crime control and small business 
incentives. Huffington was almost the opposite, boasting to audiences that he 
votes against most appropriations bills and many government regulations and 
opposed any new taxes.

PROP. 187 BACKERS ELATED -- CHALLENGES IMMINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 California voters approved the most sweeping and controversial attack on 
illegal immigration in the nation Tuesday by passing Proposition 187, a measure 
that spawned passionate demonstrations, became the dominant issue of the 
election and promises to continue polarizing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly half of the votes counted, the get-tough measure led by a 
substantial margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a showing of a public attitude, that we as a public are not 
going to tolerate illegal immigration," said the measure's co-author, Alan C. 
Nelson, from his home in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, co-chairman of the pro-187 campaign committee, said the measure's 
success would blossom into similar movements in Arizona, Texas and other states 
with a substantial illegal immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected officials "have to start doing their jobs," said Prince at a 
Republican Party rally in Orange County, where the initiative had its roots. 
"We are letting them know with 187 that when they don't, we will solve the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Most portions of the initiative, which would deny government funded 
non-emergency services to illegal immigrants, technically are scheduled to take 
effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers representing organizations including the California Medical 
Assn., Los Angeles Unified School District and ACLU of Southern California 
announced late Tuesday that they planned to file a flurry of lawsuits this 
morning seeking to halt implementation of the measure until state and federal 
courts can review its legality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could defeat this with the election and if we don't do it that 
way, we'll move into a different forum," said Antonia Hernandez, president of 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the public education ban, which even sponsors of the measure say 
would require long-term litigation prior to implementation, is not scheduled to 
take effect until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials late Tuesday urged students to show up to school 
as usual this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect them in school," said school board President Mark Slavkin. "They 
can come to school assured that their immigration status will not be questioned 
in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 As law enforcement officers remained on tactical alert to guard against 
potential trouble, workers from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of 
Los Angeles passed out leaflets in the Central City, urging immigrants to 
remain calm and continue their normal routines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't panic. Regardless of your immigration status, you have rights. You have 
support and we will keep you informed," the flyer read. 
</P>
<P>
 Capturing the seething mood of many Californians toward illegal immigration, 
Proposition 187 caught fire as the hottest issue in the state, one with bitter, 
divisive overtones bound to resonate far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 To proponents, the ballot measure was a means to save billions of dollars in 
state tax dollars and send a message to Washington about the economic and 
social problems posed by the estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argued that Proposition 187 was a mean-spirited proposal that did 
nothing to strengthen border enforcement or prevent employers from hiring 
illegal immigrants. The measure, detractors said, would foster a police state 
mentality, in which legal residents are questioned simply because of their 
accents or skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Championed by Gov. Pete Wilson, and eventually by Republican U.S. Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington, Proposition 187 held a wide lead in pre-election 
polls as late as mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gap appeared to narrow considerably under a barrage of anti-187 
statements from mainstream civic, educational, medical, labor and religious 
organizations. Also weighing in on the "no" side were leading political 
figures, ranging from President Clinton to former Republican Cabinet 
secretaries Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 In early October, the measure boasted an overwhelming 59%-33% lead among 
likely voters in a Times poll. But as voters increasingly concentrated on 
election issues, the margin slipped to 51% to 41% two weeks before Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the proposition, one of the most controversial in state 
history, illegal immigrants will be barred from public schools and colleges. It 
also prohibits undocumented residents from receiving any of the limited 
publicly funded non-emergency health care and social service benefits that they 
have until now qualified for -- including immunizations, prenatal and postnatal 
care for women, and foster services for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 also mandates that educational, social service, public health 
and law enforcement officials verify the residency status of students, patients 
and prisoners. Administrators would be required to turn in the names of those 
"suspected" of illegal status to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The contentious debate about Proposition 187 unfolded against a backdrop of 
considerable voter discontent about the broad demographic changes -- largely 
fueled by immigration -- that have drastically altered California's makeup 
since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Oft-voiced fears that California was under "invasion" spawned a loose network 
of community-based groups that banded together as the California Coalition for 
Immigration Reform. The Huntington Beach-based coalition became a co-sponsor 
and key organizing vehicle for the initiative the sponsors dubbed "save our 
state." It was co-authored by Nelson and Harold W. Ezell, a pair of former 
high-ranking INS officials, and Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia). 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents disparaged the effort as ill-conceived and underfunded, and the 
press largely ignored its aggressive signature-gathering efforts. But the 
Republican Party and GOP legislators helped out considerably, pumping more than 
$100,000 into initial efforts. That enabled backers to hire a professional 
signature-gathering firm and put the initiative over the top with almost 
600,000 signatures, securing a spot on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized efforts to fight the measure were slow in forming. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a coalition of statewide health, education, law enforcement and labor 
organizations hired a veteran Bay Area political consulting firm, Woodward & 
McDowell, to run the campaign. The group, Taxpayers Against 187, did not hold 
its first news conference until mid-August and did not go over the $1-million 
mark in campaign fund raising until a month before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-187 campaign strategy, aimed primarily at white voters who make up 
the bulk of the state's electorate, was the essence of pragmatism -- 
acknowledging that illegal immigration was a major problem but maintaining that 
Proposition 187 would make a bad situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative sponsors employed the political equivalent of football's prevent 
defense: Let the "no" side chip away with its barrage of media events, radio 
ads and slew of anti-187 endorsements. But do not make any major gaffes and 
hope that the clock runs out -- and the ballots are counted -- before the lead 
changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the pro-187 campaign made relatively few public appearances. 
Rather, backers relied largely on the get-out-the-vote efforts and TV ads of 
Wilson and the state Republican Party, the proposition's leading advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 For politicians, Proposition 187 became the defining issue of state elections. 
Republican Senate hopeful Huffington joined Wilson on the "yes" side and 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and gubernatorial challenger Kathleen 
Brown urged a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny Sunday in mid-October, an estimated 70,000 peaceful demonstrators 
marched from the Eastside to Downtown Los Angeles to condemn the initiative and 
Wilson. The protest was the largest Los Angeles has seen in decades, surpassing 
Vietnam War-era demonstrations. But in terms of the November vote, the march 
was seen as a mixed blessing -- with proponents of Proposition 187 pouncing on 
the sea of Mexican flags waved by the crowd as evidence of un-Americanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wild card was an escalating series of mainly peaceful walkouts by high 
school and college students opposed to the initiative. Defying calls by 
campaign leaders and educators to stay in class, more than 10,000 youngsters 
left their campuses in Los Angeles and surrounding communities on the largest 
day of protest, less than a week before the election.

CHILD ABUSE, SUICIDES RISING IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports of child abuse and deaths rose in nearly every category in 1993, led 
by a grim toll of youthful suicides that have child welfare experts perplexed 
and worried about the well-being of children in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four young people killed themselves last year, the most such suicides 
recorded in any of the six years such statistics have been kept. The youngest 
victim was 11. In nearly three-quarters of the cases, the method of choice was 
a firearm, usually a family gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleak numbers are included in a report to be released today by the Los 
Angeles County Inter-Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect (ICAN), which 
also found that the overall number of child abuse cases jumped nearly 24% in 
1993. The council was established in 1978 to review child deaths and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a child in Los Angeles County is probably more difficult now than it 
has ever been," said ICAN Executive Director Deanne Tilton. "They are living in 
a place where violence abounds and where stresses due to the economy, isolation 
and lack of services contribute to fear and insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 The report lands at a time when public attention has been galvanized by the 
tragic deaths of two young South Carolina boys allegedly killed by their 
mother. Their deaths have sparked a renewed concern over the exploitation and 
abuse of children and how such cases can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one of the few downturns locally, child abuse homicides in Los Angeles 
County actually dropped, with 41 reported in 1993 compared to 46 in 1992. It 
was the second year of decline in that category, following a record 61 victims 
in 1991. The report notes that the rate of child homicides by parents or 
caretakers has dipped from 1 in 10,000 children in 1989 to 1 in 13,225 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, over the past five years, not a month has passed in Los Angeles County 
without the death of a child under age 2 at the hands of a supposed protector. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers, the largest category of perpetrators, were involved in 25 of the 
slayings. Seventy percent of the child abuse homicides were caused by direct 
assault -- head bashing, punches to the stomach, strangulation, suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 1993 victims, a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old, were shot by their 
parents or caretaker. One father fed his 3-month-old daughter a fatal 
concoction of 20 to 30 iron tablets, which he ground up in her formula. The 
majority of victims -- 69% -- were under age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the public attention given to child abuse homicides and the tragic 
nature of such cases as the one in South Carolina, the difference between an 
abused child and one abused to death is only a matter of degree, child welfare 
experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every child who dies, at least 10 kids are hospitalized for abuse," said 
Michael Durfee, a child psychiatrist with the county Department of Health 
Services and an expert on child abuse prevention. "Most assaults on kids 
involve an explosion, and whether one explosion kills a kid or results in 
injury is just luck. If we want to prevent these deaths, we have to prevent 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics were gathered by social service providers, county agencies, 
schools, hospitals and law enforcement officials who documented cases ranging 
from the murder of a newborn girl found at Los Angeles International Airport 
with tape covering her mouth and nose to the death of a 16-year-old boy who, 
despondent over not making his high school football team, hanged himself in his 
bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, educators and law enforcement officials have attributed rising 
child abuse rates to increased public awareness and better reporting methods. 
But there is mounting evidence that, in Los Angeles County at least, the 
numbers reflect real increases, spurred in part by a protracted recession that 
has strained the psyches of the region's children as well as its adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Children suffered more physical and sexual abuse, severe neglect, 
exploitation, emotional abuse and lack of adequate food, shelter and clothing 
than ever before, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 And they suffered accidental deaths at an alarming rate as well. One hundred 
and four accidental deaths were reported in 1993, including 40 drownings, the 
most water-related deaths in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a definite parallel in the rise of abuse and neglect and the rise in 
the last several years of welfare recipients, unemployment and economic 
strains," Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, chairman of the council, 
said in an interview. "Certainly the depressed economy has created a highly 
tense atmosphere in many families, where a child . . . suddenly becomes a 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistic most perplexing to child welfare experts is the explosion of 
childhood suicides, the 44 deaths representing a 69% increase over 1992 
figures. Child psychiatrist Durfee called the suicides of an 11-year-old and a 
12-year-old last year "an incredible comment" on the state of the condition of 
children in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1993 victims, 84% were male. And although 17-year-olds have committed 
more suicides over the past six years than any other age group, the average age 
of victims is decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among cases examined was that of a 14-year-old boy who left a suicide note 
saying he was despondent over how his father had disciplined him. He went to 
his parents' bedroom and shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case cited by the report, a 16-year-old boy, still grieving over 
the loss of his parents 10 years earlier, told his brother he wanted to be with 
them and hanged himself in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking steps to reduce childhood suicides, homicides and abuse, the county 
will soon establish a centralized computer system, known as the Family and 
Children's Index, to monitor abuse and domestic violence and link agencies that 
interact with troubled families. Grim Findings 
</P>
<P>
 The number of adolescent suicides rose sharply in Los Angeles County last 
year. In nearly three-quarters of the cases, the method used was a firearm. The 
report also found that the overall number of child abuse cases increased in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescent suicides (17 years and younger) 1993: 44 *

CRIME, IMMIGRATION ISSUES HELPED WILSON, POLL FINDS; ELECTION: PROPOSITION 187 
WINS AMONG WHITES, BUT LOSES AMONG ALL OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS, EXIT SURVEY SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California voters concerned about illegal immigration and crime reelected 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson over Democrat Kathleen Brown on Tuesday despite an 
overwhelming belief among the electorate that under Wilson's leadership the 
state is on the wrong track, the Los Angeles Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, locked in a tight battle with 
Republican Rep. Mike Huffington, was holding on to her Democratic base, winning 
a good number of GOP votes and besting the wealthy former Texas oilman among 
independent voters, according to the results of a survey of voters as they left 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative, polarized the 
electorate along racial lines, winning big among white voters while losing in 
every other ethnic group. The measure's opponents apparently failed to 
significantly increase the turnout of Latinos -- or other minorities -- beyond 
the number who voted in the last gubernatorial election four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-seven percent of those who voted for the measure said they wanted to 
send a protest message, and half who supported it said they hoped to force the 
federal government to respond to the problem of illegal immigration. Of those 
who opposed Proposition 187, 58% said it was poorly written and 41% described 
it as racist. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial measure also split Californians according to age, 
educational level and religious affiliation, and played a role in both of the 
top races for statewide office. Nearly one in five of those who voted Tuesday 
said Proposition 187 had a major influence on their choice for governor, and 
most of those people voted for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor clearly was a vulnerable incumbent, with barely half of those who 
voted Tuesday saying they approved of his performance and nearly two-thirds -- 
63% -- saying they believed the state has gone astray. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown simply was not an acceptable alternative for most voters. Even among 
those who said that the state is heading in the wrong direction and that their 
own personal finances are worse today than they were four years ago, as many 
voted for Wilson as for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign team accomplished its goal of making the race a contest 
about illegal immigration, crime and taxes. Those three issues ranked highest 
among voters' concerns as they went to the polls Tuesday, and the voters, by a 
big margin, said they trusted Wilson more than Brown on each of those matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, directed by John Brennan, interviewed 5,336 voters at 85 
precincts representing a cross-section of California. The margin of sampling 
error was 3 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the poll found, defeated Brown by winning the votes of more than nine 
out of 10 Republicans and beating Brown among independents while also making 
deep inroads into what should have been Democratic strongholds for the one-term 
state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson won 91% of Republican votes, 54% of independents and 18% of Democrats, 
according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration, the top issue on the minds of voters Tuesday, was cited by 38% as 
an important concern. Of these voters, 63% chose Wilson while 34% sided with 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, despite Brown's summerlong effort to "neutralize" it as an issue, was 
cited by 32% of voters as an important concern, compared to just 3% in a Times 
exit poll two years ago. These voters went overwhelmingly for Wilson -- 65% to 
33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes were a top issue to 27% of the voters, and Wilson -- even though he 
signed a record $7-billion tax increase his first year in office -- still won 
this group by a margin of 67% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top four issues, only education helped Brown. About one-fourth of 
voters cited the schools as an important issue, and Brown won this group, 61% 
to 36%, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a gender gap in the governor's race, and it broke Wilson's way: He 
split the female vote with Brown but won the men by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown beat Wilson among younger voters, poorer voters and those who were less 
educated. She also won among blacks and Latinos and split the Asian American 
vote. But Wilson easily erased that deficit by winning big among groups that 
dominated the voting: older people, whites, the more affluent and the well 
educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did worse among Latinos Tuesday than he did four years ago, presumably 
because of his outspoken stand against illegal immigration. But Latinos voted 
in such small numbers that he was not hurt by the erosion. Just 8% of the 
electorate was Latino, virtually the same as in 1990, while 80% of those who 
voted Tuesday were white. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson won the white vote 58% to 38%. Brown won the Latino vote, 74% to 22%. 
Four years ago, about 35% of Latinos sided with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's family ties also hurt her. Of those who said the Brown legacy was a 
major influence on their vote for governor, 67% went with Wilson while just 32% 
voted for Brown, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate race was markedly different, and it seemed clear that voters 
perceived Feinstein as more of a centrist Democrat than Brown. More than 20% of 
those who voted for Wilson skipped across party lines to vote for Feinstein 
over Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking difference between the race for governor and the one for the 
Senate was among independent women. Brown lost this group to Wilson, 53% to 
41%. But Feinstein won among these voters by a margin of 55% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Huffington were even among whites, but she had an advantage 
among all other ethnic groups, according to the poll. She won 85% of the 
Democratic vote, while Huffington won 80% of the Republican vote. Independents 
went with Feinstein by a margin of 48% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issues on which Republicans held an advantage -- immigration, crime and 
taxes -- Huffington's lead over Feinstein was smaller than Wilson's over Brown. 
Feinstein held a big edge on almost all the lesser issues -- education, ethics, 
health care and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those voting in the Senate race, 29% cited Feinstein's record as the most 
important factor influencing their decision, and among those people, the 
senator won, 75% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 The next largest group -- 20% -- cited Feinstein's ties to Clinton as an 
important factor. Feinstein suffered modestly because of the voters' attitudes 
about the president -- narrowly losing this group to Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of voters said their concern about Huffington trying to "buy the 
election" was a major factor in their decision. Feinstein was the choice of 94% 
of these voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger did best among voters who saw Feinstein as a "tax and spend 
liberal," but only 15% of the electorate said the senator's spending record was 
a major influence on their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign over Proposition 187, which will deny most public services to 
illegal immigrants, divided the state's ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats voted 2-to-1 against 187, but Republicans voted greater than 3-to-1 
in favor of it, and independents also approved the ballot measure, by a nearly 
3-to-2 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 won among whites by 59% to 41%. It failed 78% to 22% among 
Latinos, 54% to 46% among Asian Americans and 56% to 44% among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was winning handily in Southern California, the Central Valley and 
in rural Northern California. It was losing only in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also played a role in the races for governor and the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen percent of those who voted Tuesday said Proposition 187 had a major 
influence over whom they chose for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 73% voted for Wilson and 26% voted for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, among those who cited Proposition 187 as a major 
influence, 38% voted for Feinstein and 57% for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 In both races, the negative campaigning that marked the 1994 election seemed 
to take its toll. Half of Wilson's voters said they chose him not because they 
liked him but because he was the lesser of two evils. Thirty-eight percent of 
Feinstein's voters said the same thing. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,336 voters as they exited 85 polling places 
across the state. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past 
primary elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The margin of 
sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or minus 3 
percentage points. For some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. 
Because the survey does not include absentee voters or those who declined to 
participate when approached, actual returns and demographic estimates by the 
interviewers were used to slightly adjust the sample. Assisting The Times in 
this poll was Davis Market Research Services Inc. of Calabasas. THE TIMES POLL:

SYBERT EDGES AHEAD OF BEILENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, held a 
slender lead over Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), a fixture on 
the Southern California political scene for 30 years, in the hotly contested 
24th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Beilenson, 62, seeking his 10th term in office, had been heavily 
besieged by the 42-year-old Sybert, a policy wonk and tenacious competitor who 
spent more than $1 million on his race to unseat the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beilenson-Sybert race has been one of the most closely watched 
congressional contests in the nation ever since Sybert, the former director of 
Wilson's Office of Planning and Research, moved into the district in October, 
1993, and promptly sank a considerable amount of his own wealth into his 
campaign to unseat one of the House of Representatives' top leaders. Beilenson 
is a senior member of the powerful Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The race produced big-ticket spending. When all the bills are counted, the 
combined tab will be $1.2 million or better, with Sybert spending about 
two-thirds of this amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney and businessman, loaned more than $400,000 of his own 
money to his campaign, and he got numerous GOP heavyweights such as U.S. Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kansas) and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) to raise money for him 
at events held throughout the district, from a tony Studio City restaurant to a 
Lake Sherwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Beilenson, who has served continuously as a lawmaker in 
one capacity or another since 1963, tried to portray Sybert as "just another 
typical politician" who accepts "dirty" political action committee 
contributions. Sybert painted the incumbent as a liberal, career politician. "I 
have never run for office before in my life, and my opponent has done nothing 
else," Sybert was fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the campaign did reveal some sharp policy differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert supported Proposition 187, the measure to deny public benefits to 
illegal immigrants, and Beilenson did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would create a litigation nightmare and prove to be 
unconstitutional in the end, Beilenson maintained, while Sybert said the 
controversial measure offered Californians their best chance yet for 
challenging overly liberal government policies and court decisions that extend 
benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalating the immigration debate, Sybert also called for reducing the number 
of legal immigrants allowed annually into the United States and having U.S. 
soldiers double as border patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson touted his support for a measure to double the size of the nation's 
border patrol and his authorship of another measure -- also winning 
congressional approval -- to require the federal government to partially 
reimburse California for the cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 During a half-dozen debates, Beilenson emerged as an almost unequivocal 
supporter of the Clinton Adminstration. His pose defied the conventional wisdom 
that Democratic incumbents should distance themselves from a President whose 
political fortunes have been on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of Reagan-Bush inertia on key domestic policy concerns, Clinton 
and the Democrat-controlled Congress have made tremendous progress by passing a 
crime bill, a national gun-control law, a family leave plan and a meaningful 
deficit-reduction program, Beilenson boasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the difference between night and day," Beilenson told an audience 
in the final days of the campaign as he described the burst of domestic policy 
initiatives approved by Congress since Clinton entered the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Sybert, the Clinton initiatives spelled bad news. The crime bill is 
loaded with expensive and failed social programs while the deficit-reduction 
plan amounts to a huge tax hike that has hit Californians very hard, Sybert 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson fired some of his nastiest and biggest salvos when he 
repeatedly accused Sybert of compromising his integrity by accepting more than 
$60,000 in campaign contributions from special-interest groups, all the while 
reminding voters of his own pledge never to take such money. 
</P>
<P>
 This same Beilenson tactic was widely credited with helping the incumbent 
defeat his 1992 Republican challenger, Tom McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert also failed the character test, Beilenson argued, when he ran a 
lucrative private legal practice on the side while he worked at his 
$98,000-a-year job as a director of the governor's Office of Planning and 
Research. In one year, Sybert earned $140,000 in legal fees by moonlighting, 
Beilenson noted, citing financial disclosure records. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Beilenson maintained, California taxpayers deserved to have 
Sybert giving his state job his undivided attention. But his mailers also 
suggested -- without foundation -- that Sybert's moonlighting had involved a 
"conflict of interest" between his duties as a top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and 
his work for his private legal clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert retorted by producing a letter from Wilson praising Sybert's work ethic 
and an opinion from the state's top ethics officer -- sought by Sybert before 
he began moonlighting -- reiterating that outside work was not illegal per se. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mudslinging battle, Sybert had his own ammunition, including remarks 
Beilenson had once made in 1989 on his indifference to California's problems 
and statements he had made about his strong allegiance to the House speaker, 
and his preference that the budget be balanced by raising taxes, not by cutting 
federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert contended that such remarks betrayed the fact that Beilenson -- after 
18 years in Congress -- has lost touch with his constituents and the world 
outside the Beltway.

PARTISANSHIP COULD SOUR GOP TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capitalizing on popular disappointment with President Clinton and anger with 
Congress that had dropped public confidence in government to a nadir not seen 
since the Great Depression, Republicans rode to victory Tuesday on a 
conservative tidal wave greater than the one that battered the Democrats in 
1978 and then carried Ronald Reagan to power two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 They did so behind a sharply defined message of rolling back government, 
toughening requirements on welfare recipients, stiffening penalties for 
criminals, and cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an historic vote," exulted Republican National Committee Chairman 
Haley Barbour. "It is unlike any in two generations." 
</P>
<P>
 But sweet as it was for Republicans, it guaranteed an escalation of the bitter 
partisan warfare that has virtually derailed the Clinton Adminstration and that 
could ultimately threaten the GOP. In its sweeping victory, the GOP may have 
set in motion forces it will find almost impossible to tame or control. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, over the next two years, it will be extraordinarily difficult for 
either the Republicans or President Clinton to win approval of the kind of 
agenda that might appease the forces of alienation that dominated the 1994 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With both Houses closely divided between the parties -- and Congress still 
sharing political power with the President -- neither side may be able to 
advance its ideas, especially if congressional Democrats block GOP initiatives 
with the same fierce tactics that Republicans used to frustrate Clinton during 
his first two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for gridlock is 10 times greater, public frustration will 
increase, and cynicism will increase," said Republican pollster Steve Lombardo. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the equation is the likelihood that the election results will 
further polarize Congress itself, with moderate Democrats suffering a 
disproportionate share of Tuesday's losses and conservative Republicans the big 
winners. The underlying dynamic makes it possible, if not likely, that by 1996 
the public could be sour on both Clinton and the Republican leadership. That 
could raise the possibility of another third-party challenge for the 
presidency, and even more unpredictable and unprecedented changes than the 
country has seen in the tumultuous campaigns of 1992 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine a third party doing at least as well as it did in 1992," said 
Gary C. Jacobson, chairman of the political science department at the UC San 
Diego. "It is hard to imagine a scenario coming out of this election where you 
would have a more effective government that would make Americans feel better 
about the people who are governing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Republicans agreed that the powerful urge for change that elected 
Clinton in 1992 and then pulverized Democrats this year could turn against the 
GOP -- or both parties -- two years from now, if Americans remain convinced 
that Washington does not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans this year are being given a window of opportunity . . ," Fred 
Thompson, a Republican who won a Senate seat in Tennessee, said in an interview 
just before the vote. "It's a lot, but that's all it is. . . . If we don't do 
the job, the public is going to go back in the other direction, toward the 
Democrats, or in a third direction." 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats, the possibility of further twists down the road offered scant 
consolation for Tuesday's debacle. Especially across the South and border 
states, the election reflected not only dissatisfaction with Clinton and anger 
with Congress, but embodied near impenetrable skepticism about the fundamental 
capacity of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everywhere, Republicans -- from gubernatorial candidates Jeb Bush in 
Florida and George W. Bush in Texas to Senate candidates James M. Inhofe in 
Oklahoma and Thompson in Tennessee -- reached back beyond the "kinder, gentler" 
message of George Bush to the militant faith that Reagan expressed in his first 
inaugural address: "Government is not the solution to our problem; government 
is the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful Republican candidates for Congress typically fused that 
Reaganite anti-government message with a hard line on social issues such as 
crime and welfare and a Ross Perot-like demand for congressional and political 
reform, especially term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Political novice Bill Frist, a 42-year-old surgeon who handily defeated 
three-term Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser in Tennessee, reduced the winning message 
of 1994 to its essence in a television ad when he endorsed "term limits for 
career politicians and the death penalty for career criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Amplifying that GOP message was a grassroots conservative movement that 
rejuvenated itself in opposition to the Clinton Administration. While liberal 
constituencies and organizations managed only tepid efforts behind the 
Democrats, conservative organization such as televangelist Pat Robertson's 
Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Assn. and groups backing tax curbs and 
term limits all pulsed with energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to go back to the 1890s to find so many different groups that have 
sprung up that are anti-Washington," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster 
and adviser to Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Translating this campaign agenda into a governing agenda, though, may be more 
problematic for the GOP. During the last two years, the Democrats were unable 
to pass several of their top priorities -- especially health care -- though 
they held more seats than Republicans will control in either House, even after 
their impressive gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many analysts believe, Republicans will have to overcome the same 
combination of internal divisions and resistance from the opposition. House 
Republican moderates have already signaled resistance to some priorities in the 
GOP's "contract with America" -- such as entirely cutting off benefits for 
welfare recipients after five years on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leaders will now face the unenviable choice of either 
disappointing ardent supporters like the NRA or alienating party moderates and 
independent voters by pushing hard-line ideas such as repeal of the assault 
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Democrats hold the GOP to the same standard that Dole applied during 
the last two years -- repeatedly using the filibuster to require virtually all 
controversial ideas to attract 60 votes for passage -- the Republicans may not 
have much more success than Clinton at moving their agenda through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Republicans advance a thorough, serious agenda, I will treat it 
exactly that way," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a leading 
liberal. "If it is a cynical agenda on the other hand -- and frankly the 
'contract with America' comes to mind -- then I think the Democrats will feel 
bound to prevent the country from returning to the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the congressional hurdles, Republicans will have to cope with an 
additional constraint beyond those that frustrated the Democrats: the 
possibility of presidential vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first shock of the tumultuous result, both the Administration and the 
newly ascendant GOP leadership promised cooperation in the months ahead. On a 
handful of individual issues, such as welfare reform and a tax credit for 
middle-class families with children, it may be possible for Clinton to reach 
agreement with the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But most forces in the new political alignment are expected to push toward the 
apocalyptic legislative warfare that characterized the last several months of 
this year's congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
 At the most basic level, there is an enormous gulf between the tax-cutting, 
anti-goverment agenda of the newly elected Republicans and the priorities of 
Clinton -- who, for all his attraction to reinventing government still sees it 
as an indispensable element in solving national problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The results also appear likely to leave Congress itself, especially the House, 
more polarized: many Democratic moderates, who could have provided the core of 
a bipartisan centrist coalition, were defeated by conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 That will leave the House Democratic caucus more liberal at the same time 
conservative voices symbolized by the new leadership team of Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) and Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) grow more dominant in the GOP conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, predicted Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, "is that the ability 
of each party to coalesce a majority will be virtually nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Sunday, President Clinton appeared resigned both to the 
possibility of major reversals in this election and a bruising two years of 
battle with a Republican Congress. But he insisted that if the GOP focuses its 
new strength solely on confrontation, neither party may be satisfied with the 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they break the system down they won't be the ultimate beneficiary," 
Clinton said. "In the end, this is a country for builders, whether it is 
third-party builders, Democratic builders or Republican builders. In the end, 
usually the builders win. Once in a great while the blamers win. Once in a 
great while the negative forces win. But a great democracy does not prevail 
except by builders." 
</P>
<P>
 After the electoral hurricane that swept over the Democratic Party Tuesday, 
Clinton will now have to rebuild from a political foundation shaken to its 
core.

ON CALIFORNIA: THEY KEPT COMING 
</P>

<P>
 Javier Rodriguez came to the polling place straight from work, still wearing 
the uniform of a school custodian. He came, as he put it, "to vote thumbs down 
on Proposition 187. Mostly it's because of the kids. Students shouldn't have to 
suffer because their parents brought them here. They have it hard enough as it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Annabella Ramirez brought her baby. The 20-year-old mother bounced the child 
on her hip as she voted for the first time in her life. There had been, she 
said, "a lot of clashing" over Proposition 187, in her neighborhood, among her 
friends and even her family, and in this election she wanted to make her 
opinion count for something more than talk. "I wanted to be part of the 
voting," she said. She voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor De La Riva, a 35-year-old forklift operator, came with a co-worker -- 
and a sense of personal history. "My parents were from Mexico," he said, "and 
at first they were illegal. Should I have not gotten my education because of 
that? It makes no sense. I mean, this is supposed to be the Land of Opportunity 
and all that, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Ricarte Jr. came with his birth certificate in his hip pocket. "I 
carry it with me everywhere I go," he said. Once a boss had demanded to see his 
green card, and Ricarte had been obliged to explain that, no, he had been born 
in the U.S.A. He understood that Proposition 187 will institutionalize these 
little inquisitions. He also understood the politics behind it. "I know what 
Pete Wilson is doing," Ricarte said. And he said he would remember it, too, 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 All day Tuesday, they kept coming. They kept coming to St. Bartholomew's 
Church, polling place for Precinct 32A. People waited outside in the rain 
before the church hall doors opened at 7 a.m., and the traffic never let up. 
They came on their lunch break. They came as families. They pushed strollers, 
dragged along novices, double-parked, waited 10 deep in line. "We have never 
seen anything like this," said a precinct election worker, estimating a turnout 
of 50% or better. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to St. Bartholomew's with something in their eyes that looked a bit 
like excitement and a bit more like anger. The 821 registered voters in 
precinct 32A are predominantly brown of skin and blue of collar, which is to 
say they belong to the future middle class of California. Many came, more than 
anything, to vote against Proposition 187, which they saw as either wrongheaded 
or racist or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "What 187 did," said a young woman, who gave her name only as Carmen, "was 
make me call and beg everyone to vote against it. This is going to affect 
everybody who is Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who came to vote spoke of spouses and parents who had crossed the 
borders, of aunts and uncles who fear Proposition 187 in a real way. 
"Personally," said Barbara Velasquez, "I know too many people who are illegal. 
They are good people. Hard workers. They want to educate their kids. I know one 
mom who has five kids and all of them are straight-A students. What will happen 
to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez had brought her daughter along. The young woman, who is deaf, had 
never voted before. "She will again," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they came and voted in a losing cause. Not only did Proposition 
187 pass, it also worked its magic for Gov. Pete Wilson. He could have assured 
the measure's defeat. Instead, he chose to ignore his own history of moderate 
realism on the issue and play to anger. For this, he has been rewarded with an 
easy reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson no doubt is pleased. He might be a bit less pleased, though, had he 
stood outside St. Bartholomew's and watched the voters come. Latinos were 
voting 3 to 1 against both Prop. 187 and Wilson -- a not insignificant parallel 
-- and at St. Bartholomew's the split seemed to be running about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos already represented the state's fastest-growing voter segment. Judging 
by pre-election registration, Proposition 187 kicked that process into a higher 
gear, and at the same time turned countless Latinos away from Republicans. 
Thus, Wilson's victory might well have been borrowed against his future and 
that of his party. This was the ignored wisdom of Jack Kemp and William 
Bennett, who had warned that "the Republican Party helped to create a 
Democratic base in many of America's cities with its hostile stand toward the 
last generation of immigrants from Italy, Ireland and Central Europe. Can 
anyone calculate the political cost this time of turning away Asians and 
Hispanics?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at St. Bartholomew's, the calculation was not so difficult. They 
came on their lunch break. They came as families. They pushed strollers, 
dragged along novices, double-parked, waited 10 deep in line . . .

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / STATE OFFICES; LUNGREN, FONG BUOYED BY GOP 'TIDAL WAVE'; 
REPUBLICANS LEAD IN ALL BUT ONE PARTISAN CONTEST, IN WHICH CONTROLLER GRAY 
DAVIS CLAIMS VICTORY IN RACE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. QUACKENBUSH, JONES, 
MCCLINTOCK SLIGHTLY AHEAD.

<P>
 A Republican tidal wave sweeping across the nation spared at least one 
Democrat in partisan statewide races in California, although others were locked 
in contests too close to call late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Democrat able to claim victory based on partial returns was state 
Controller Gray Davis in his race for lieutenant governor against state Sen. 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 However, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat, was just points 
behind Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones in his race to retain that office. 
Democratic businesswoman Kathleen Connell was closing in on former GOP 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, the early leader in the race for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren easily succeeded in his bid for reelection 
over his Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Republicans riding the tide were Matt Fong, who held a firm lead 
over former state Democratic Party chairman Phil Angelides in incomplete 
results for treasurer, and Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush of Cupertino, who 
was leading state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles in the race for insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lone nonpartisan race, Democrat Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin of Fremont 
held a commanding lead over Maureen DiMarco, a Democrat working as Republican 
Pete Wilson's secretary of child development and education and who had the 
backing of her boss. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's race was a particularly vitriolic contest between 
Lungren, the conservative crown prince of California Republican politics, and 
Umberg, a champion of the new Democrats out to prove he could be even tougher 
on crime than the GOP incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg did not immediately concede defeat but acknowledged that there "is a 
tidal wave out there against the Democrats and the wave is crashing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren attributed his victory in part to voters' revulsion over a television 
commercial in which his opponent attempted to link the murder of Polly Klaas to 
the attorney general's failure to adopt a computerized system for tracking 
parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to supporters in Los Angeles, the attorney general called the 
Klaas commercial "the single worst campaign ad this season and some say of any 
season . . . I wanted to rely on the intelligence of the people of California 
to reject it. And they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren went into the race with a decided edge in crime-fighting machismo. He 
was the attorney general who had frantically beaten back last-minute appeals 
intended to stop the execution of murderer Robert Alton Harris -- the first 
person killed in the San Quentin gas chamber in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the underdog, Umberg, a former prosecutor, gambled on the television ad 
that attempted to do what might have seemed impossible before the race -- to 
tag his opponent as soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren denounced the commercial as flat-out wrong, even before it began 
running. Later, he criticized Umberg for taking more than $800,000 in campaign 
contributions from Indian tribes that were battling the attorney general over 
reservation gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other statewide races, seasoned campaigner and fund-raiser Davis clashed 
for lieutenant governor with little-known and poorly funded Wright. In sharp 
contrast to Wright, Davis is a known quantity to the state's voters. He was 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.'s chief of staff and an assemblyman before 
being twice elected controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of his fellow Democrats, Davis said: "We have to look in the mirror 
and understand the need for public safety" and a good business climate in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In her campaign, Wright tried to raise ethical questions, issuing a booklet 
titled "Gray's Anatomy" that resurrected charges that Davis had used state 
resources to help in a political campaign. But with a commanding lead in public 
opinion polls, Davis generally took the high road, emphasizing his role, for 
example, in persuading Taco Bell Corp. to stay in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Staunch conservative Wright was elected to the state Senate two years ago 
after a 12-year career in the Assembly. She is a former mayor of Simi Valley 
and was making her first bid for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 How the candidates raised campaign money became a major issue in the race for 
insurance commissioner. Quackenbush took most of his campaign cash from the 
insurance industry -- sparking Torres' charges that he would be beholden to the 
companies that he would regulate as commissioner. But Quackenbush countered 
with ads that attacked Torres for taking contributions from industry-tainted 
sources, even though the Democrat had refused contributions from the companies 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates differed over implementing Proposition 103, the 1988 
initiative that promised to hold the line on insurance rates. Torres promised 
to keep in place regulations written by incumbent Commissioner John Garamendi 
to limit rate increases. Quackenbush argued that less regulation would improve 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-fought race for superintendent of public instruction, the only 
nonpartisan statewide post on the ballot, voters had a choice between two 
members of the state's education Establishment. DiMarco vied with Eastin, 
chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, to become the first woman to 
hold the office since its creation in 1849. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin and DiMarco agreed on many issues. They based their campaigns largely 
on touting their backgrounds and qualifications to lead the state's 
$29-billion, 5.2-million-student public education system. DiMarco cited her 23 
years of varied experience, from volunteer in her children's classrooms to 
local board member and consultant to the state superintendent before accepting 
Wilson's job offer in 1991. Eastin cited her community college teaching 
experience, private-industry management job and experience in the Legislature 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high-spending race for treasurer, Angelides, a Sacramento land 
developer, faced off against Republican Fong, the son of former Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu and a member of the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, a lawyer, campaigned on a plan for slashing state government spending 
$2.2 million, which includes many of the reductions called for by Wilson. On 
the equalization board, he negotiated a money-saving court settlement and 
consolidated Los Angeles County offices to cut costs. But his leasing of office 
space from developers who provided him free campaign headquarters provided 
ammunition for Angelides' aggressive attack-style campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides, who got his start in politics working for then-Gov. Jerry Brown, 
promised to turn down requests from the governor and Legislature if they seek 
the treasurer's permission for more state debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his effort to become secretary of state and California's top elections 
officer, Jones ran as one of the principal authors of "three strikes," the 
lock-'em-up measure that increased penalties for repeat criminals. The veteran 
lawmaker faced Miller, who had served as legal counsel and chief deputy to the 
previous occupant of the office, Eu. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, in his first run for elected office, portrayed himself as a 
non-politician. But Jones pummeled Miller for his policy role under Eu -- 
forgiving fines for late reporting of political and lobbying expenditures. 
Although the two disagreed over the extent of voter fraud, both endorsed a 
variety of measures to purge non-voters from registration rolls and for putting 
limits on campaign contributions.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; 1 DEMOCRAT LOSES, 2 OTHERS HEADED TOWARD 
DEFEAT; GOP WAVE SWAMPS INCUMBENT SCHENK, THREATENS HAMBURG AND LEHMAN, AND 
CARRIES EX-TV STAR SONNY BONO INTO OPEN SEAT.

<P>
 One Democratic congressional incumbent was defeated, two others appeared 
headed for defeat Tuesday and three others -- including longtime veteran Vic 
Fazio -- were in close races as California Republicans were riding the same 
political wave that sent dozens of other GOP candidates to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio of West Sacramento, an eight-term member and head of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee, was facing a strong challenge by Republican 
Tim LeFever, an attorney and former aide to former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually all the vote counted, Democrat Lynn Schenk of San Diego lost to 
Republican Brian Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor. And Democratic 
incumbents Richard Lehman of the San Joaquin Valley and Dan Hamburg of Ukiah 
were trailing substantially, with much of the vote counted in their races. 
Schenk and Hamburg are first-termers; Lehman was seeking his seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic incumbents in tight races were veteran George Brown of Colton 
and first-termer Jane Harman of Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the early returns, no Republican incumbent appeared in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainer-turned-GOP candidate Sonny Bono, of Palm Springs, won a race for 
an open seat, and Ken Calvert, a first-term Republican who had struggled to 
overcome a scandal caused when he was caught with a prostitute, was ahead of 
his Democratic challenger, whom Calvert had accused of refusing to acknowledge 
that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono, in a television interview Tuesday night, said, "First on my political 
plate is to have a romantic dinner with my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race to succeed Michael Huffington of Santa Barbara, a Republican who 
left Congress after one term to run for the U.S. Senate, Democratic candidate 
Walter Capps, a writer and religion professor, was in a close race with 
Republican Assemblywoman Andrea Seastrand of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats had a 30-22 advantage in the California delegation. Republicans 
would gain control if they win five seats now held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, Republicans had sought to turn congressional campaigns into 
referendums on President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk and Harman were attacked by their Republican opponents for voting for 
Clinton's 1993 budget, which raised taxes for the affluent. Both of the 
Democrats sought to distance themselves from Clinton by stressing their 
independence during their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's race against Republican Susan Brooks, a Rancho Palos Verdes City 
Council member, illustrated the GOP effort to score points by linking 
incumbents with the President. Brooks' campaign reprinted a photo that showed 
Harman beaming at Clinton during a White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 As she did in 1992, Harman aired television commercials throughout the Los 
Angeles market, the only House candidate to do so this year. "My party 
leadership isn't always happy with me," she said in one. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Clinton came to Los Alamitos to announce that McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. would be allowed to sell commercial jetliners to China, Harman was at his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, abortion became the hot issue in the final days of the race between 
Schenk and Bilbray. Schenk, backed by the National Organization for Women, 
attacked Bilbray's description of himself as pro-choice, noting that he 
endorses a number of restrictions on access to abortion and opposes public 
funding of abortions for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg faced a rematch with Republican Frank Riggs, whom he beat in 1992. The 
race featured sharp ideological splits on almost all facets of foreign and 
domestic policy, as well as such local issues as how to save the redwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans had also expressed hope of beating one or more of four longtime 
Democrats from California: Anthony Beilenson of Woodland Hills, Brown, Fazio 
and Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, branded 
Beilenson as a liberal and career politician who is out of step with the 
district. With a $1-million campaign war chest and help from national GOP 
leaders, Sybert outspent the 11-term incumbent by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman was viewed as vulnerable because reapportionment two years ago left him 
with a district where registration is split nearly evenly, but voters have 
conservative tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to survive, Lehman and other Democrats counterattacked by blasting 
their opponents for signing the GOP's Contract With America, asserting that it 
blindly promises budget cuts regardless of how much havoc they could cause in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP unleashed three anti-Clinton television commercials in much of the 
state recently that urged voters to "send Clinton's Congress home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's southernmost district on the border between San Diego and 
Mexico, the Republican challenger, Mary Alice Acevedo, even invoked Hillary 
Rodham Clinton against the first-term incumbent, Democrat Bob Filner. Her 
television commercials featured a picture of the First Lady and a quote from 
her calling Filner "a treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign between Calvert of Riverside and Democrat Mark Takano may have 
been the seamiest in the nation. Calvert was caught in December by police with 
a prostitute, an incident that did not result in an arrest. Last-minute 
campaign flyers showed a photo of a woman being offered money and the teaser, 
"It's midnight. Do you know where your congressman is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert's campaign responded with countercharges that Takano, a community 
college trustee, is gay and refuses to admit it to the public. Takano's 
campaign manager called this approach "sexual McCarthyism, a brand-new low in 
American politics." 
</P>
<P>
 A more lighthearted tone was evident in another Riverside County district 
where Bono, former mayor of Palm Springs and former husband of singer Cher, 
fought Democrat Steve Clute of Moreno Valley, an ex-assemblyman, for the seat 
vacated by the retirement of Republican Al McCandless. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Bono frequently made joking references to how he turned 
to politics when his show business career declined. "When your career wanes, 
you become a guest star," he said. "I hold the record for most 'Fantasy Island' 
guest appearances."

CLOSE RACES LEAVE MAKEUP OF LOWER HOUSE IN DOUBT. REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE 
CAPTURED AT LEAST FIVE MORE SEATS AND ARE CHALLENGING FOR FIVE OTHERS.

 Control of the Assembly hung on the outcome of a handful of close races as 
Republicans threatened to topple the Democrats from power for the first time in 
decades and deny Speaker Willie Brown a final leadership term, but the 
Democrats appeared likely to retain their control of the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact makeup of the Assembly was in doubt early today, but the Republicans 
appear to have picked up at least five seats that had been held by Democrats 
and were challenging for five others. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats managed to grab one district that was previously Republican, and two 
other GOP seats remained up for grabs by either party, leaving the Assembly 
lineup unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown needs 41 votes in the Assembly to retain the leadership post he has held 
longer than anyone. Going into Tuesday's election the Democrats held a 47-33 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican spokesman estimated that the GOP would pick up at least five 
seats in the Assembly, but he said early Wednesday that the situation remained 
"volatile and changing by the hour." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two first-term Democrats, Assembly members Julie Bornstein of Palm 
Desert and Tom Connolly of Lemon Grove, were trailing. 
</P>
<P>
 All 80 Assembly seats and 21 of the 40 state Senate seats were up for grabs in 
Tuesday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who can stretch his record-setting tenure another two years if the 
Democrats hold their majority in the Assembly, is blocked by term limits from 
running for reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday, the Senate the lineup was 22 Democrats, 15 Republicans, two 
independents and one vacancy resulting from the corruption conviction and 
resignation of former Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier). Tuesday's matchups were the 
first general election test for new Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward). 
</P>
<P>
 Fired-up Republicans, backed by the religious right, saw this election as 
their best chance in years to break the grip Democrats have held on both houses 
of the Legislature for more than two decades. One reason for their optimism was 
the voter-imposed term limit that caused 27 incumbents to retire or run for 
different offices, creating election opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newcomers expected to win Assembly contests are Democrats Shelia 
James Kuehl, a Santa Monica lawyer and former actress who would become the 
first openly gay member of the Legislature, and Kevin Murray, a Los Angeles 
attorney seeking to join his father, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. of 
Paramount, as the first father-son team to serve simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Democrat Hilda Solis, a first-term assemblywoman from La Puente, is 
expected to capture a heavily Democratic San Gabriel Valley seat in the state 
Senate and become the first Latina elected to that body. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), 84, sought a new four-year term in a 
coastal district carved out in the 1992 redistricting of legislative 
boundaries. First elected to the Assembly in 1938, Dills faced his toughest 
challenge in years, even though he heavily outspent Republican rival David 
Barrett Cohen, a Redondo Beach attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer's financial help was vital to Dills as well as to Democrat Kay 
Ceniceros, a Riverside County supervisor who was losing n a nasty campaign 
against Assemblyman Ray Haynes (R-Murrieta) in a district in which registered 
Republicans outnumber Democrats 50% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Haynes is central to GOP hopes of making major gains in the 
Senate. In the campaign's homestretch, Haynes received $150,000 from a company 
owned by Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), who is closely aligned with the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third Senate district, where Democrats narrowly outnumber Republicans, 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) clashed with Republican Steve 
MacElvaine, a former member of the California Coastal Commission. The district 
stretches into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hard-fought Assembly contest, freshman Assemblyman Bill Hoge 
(R-Pasadena), who has received more than $140,000 in contributions from 
gambling interests since 1992, faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Bruce 
Philpott. In last-minute allegations, Hoge's ex-wife said he suffered from a 
"serious gambling addiction" that helped destroy their marriage. Hoge deplored 
a Philpott-backed mailer as a "Nixonian dirty trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Republican freshman, Assemblyman James E. Rogan of Glendale, faced a 
scrappy challenge from Adam Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, in what 
has been a GOP stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP strategists saw opportunities to pick up Los Angeles-area seats held by 
first-term Assemblywoman Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) and veteran Assemblyman 
Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), both of whom won close contests two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They also consider two other Democratic newcomers, Bornstein and Connolly , 
vulnerable. Connolly, perhaps the weakest Democratic incumbent, admitted having 
been a cocaine addict, a failed husband, a child-support deadbeat, a tax 
delinquent and a failed businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the most bitter Assembly clash was between Democratic 
businessman Mike Metzler and his GOP opponent, small-business owner Jim 
Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
 Both major parties were also battling down to the wire in several Senate races 
in the Central Valley. One slugfest featured freshman Sen. Phil Wyman 
(R-Tehachapi), who last year beat Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford) in a 
special election. Wyman is now seeking a full four-year term against Costa in a 
more heavily Democratic farm belt district redrawn in reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election approached, Republicans mounted a last-minute challenge to 
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto) in a farm district that is becoming a bedroom 
community for the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther north, in a district that stretches from the edge of San Francisco Bay 
to the Oregon border, Lockyer-backed Michael H. McGowan was trailing freshman 
Sen. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), who was strongly backed by Senate 
Republicans.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITIONS; VOTERS APPROVE 'THREE STRIKES' LAW, REJECT 
SMOKING MEASURE; PROPOSAL FOR GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, GASOLINE TAX 
TO FUND RAIL PROJECTS ARE ALSO DEFEATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Californians overwhelmingly approved Proposition 184, the tough "three 
strikes" sentencing law Tuesday, and solidly rejected the tobacco 
industry-financed initiative to roll back the state's strict smoking 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also slapped down a sweeping, labor-backed Proposition 186 to impose a 
tax-funded, government-run health care system, and an initiative that would 
have added a 4% sales tax on gasoline to fund rail projects. Voters did agree 
to overhaul the system of disciplining judges, approving Proposition 190. 
</P>
<P>
 By a surprisingly large margin, voters showed their skepticism that cigarette 
makers had their best health interests at heart, soundly defeating the tobacco 
industry's failed $18-million effort to win passage of Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylord Walker, co-chairman of the campaign against 188, hailed the results, 
saying the outcome proved that "when you tie tobacco companies to an initiative 
. . . the voters easily see through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Election night proved to be a poignant time for Mike Reynolds, the wedding 
photographer who set out to change criminal law in June, 1992, after his 
18-year-old daughter, Kimber, was shot to death in a robbery outside a popular 
restaurant in her hometown of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds gathered with a few friends and political supporters at his home, 
where several judges, prosecutors and lawyers hatched the concept 30 months ago 
that came to be known as the "three strikes and you're out" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This started with a promise to my daughter and I think this is a promise 
kept," said a somber Reynolds, who watched election returns at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 184 restates word for word the "three strikes" sentencing statute 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "three strikes" is already the law, Reynolds pressed ahead with the 
initiative. He wants legislators to realize it would be political suicide to 
water down the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most sweeping overhauls of sentencing law ever, the measure limits 
plea bargaining and the right of judges to grant probation. It will double and 
triple sentences for thousands of felons annually, and ensure that they spend 
at least 80% of their sentences in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for the "three strikes" measure raised more than $1.6 million, 
compared to the paltry $28,000 raised by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 With only five citizen-generated initiatives on the ballot, 1994 was a light 
year for initiatives. But their costs were large. Donors pumped more than $35 
million into this year's initiative crop. As much as that is, however, it pales 
in comparison to the 1988 initiative wars, when a single insurance 
industry-backed initiative cost $37.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The year did bring one initiative record. Philip Morris, the nation's largest 
cigarette manufacturer, spent $12.6 million to win passage of Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 California Common Cause says that is the largest sum ever spent by a 
corporation on a California initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 For the tobacco industry, Proposition 188 appeared to be an act of 
desperation. The tobacco industry is being pilloried by hard-hitting ads aired 
by the state Department of Health Services. Local officials from Los Angeles to 
Redding have passed indoor smoking bans. The Legislature approved and Wilson 
signed one of the nation's toughest anti-smoking laws this year, banning 
smoking in restaurants and most indoor workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris urged retailers in a letter to pass out pro-188 literature, 
saying passage of the measure was "vital to the continued profitability of the 
cigarette category." Philip Morris Inc. told shareholders in another letter 
that passage of 188 is "of paramount importance to our consumers, our employees 
and you, our stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
 With a campaign that played on Californians' desire to reduce smoking, the 
tobacco industry led in polls that came out in September. That shocked many 
foes, and the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Assn. and the American 
Heart Assn. responded by donating more than $600,000 combined. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the no-on-188 campaign raised about $1 million, using most of it to 
broadcast commercials in which former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop 
called the initiative a tobacco industry lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents received a boost from an unusual $4-million campaign funded by two 
health foundations. Designed to educate voters about Proposition 188, the 
campaign helped the opponents by simply informing voters through ads that the 
tobacco industry was behind Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186, the health care initiative, was the next most expensive. 
Opponents, led by the insurance and health care industries, spent more than $9 
million in an effort to kill the measure, designed to create a Canadian-style 
state-run health insurance system on a scale unprecedented for a state. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which sought to provide health insurance for all legal state 
residents, called for new personal, business and cigarette taxes that would 
have raised $40 billion to $50 billion annually. The system would have been run 
by an elected health commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday that 
the proposed $100-billion benefits program, accompanied by historic tax 
increases that would be needed to finance it, was more than voters could 
swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple fact is that voters aren't interested in turning over a tenth of 
the economy to the state government," he said. Opponents aired radio spots 
focusing on the proposed tax increases and played on voters' distrust of a 
health system run by an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186's backers included unions, consumer activists and senior 
citizens groups. They aired television ads playing up their grass-roots support 
and attacking insurance companies, who had the most to lose from 186. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when new taxes were less popular than incumbent politicians, the 
environmentalist Planning and Conservation League pushed Proposition 185, which 
would impose an additional 4% sales tax on gasoline to be used primarily for 
rebuilding the state's urban and intercity rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election grew closer, its support evaporated when its two primary 
backers -- the Southern Pacific Railroad and Morrison-Knudsen, which builds 
passenger rail cars -- withdrew their financial support. Both stood to benefit 
from the measure's passage.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROP. 187, HEATED RACES BOOST VOTER TURNOUT IN STATE; 
TOTAL IS EXPECTED TO REACH PROJECTED 60.2% OF THOSE REGISTERED. IN L.A. COUNTY, 
53.46% TURNED OUT, COMPARED TO 52.87% IN 1990.

 Rising above the nasty weather and the even nastier campaign season, 
Californians flocked to the polls Tuesday -- inspired by Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration ballot measure, the heated governor's race and an 
abiding anger at politics and campaign spending gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, like everyone, am upset that the campaigns this year were terribly 
negative and totally glazed over the real issues," said Rich Foster, 30, of 
Thousand Oaks. "I had to avoid TV and force myself to read up on the candidates 
to have any idea where they really stood." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller predicted before the election that 60.2% 
of registered voters would go to the polls Tuesday, a day marked by 
intermittent rainfall and continuing nonviolent protests of Proposition 187, 
this year's electoral lightning rod. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time polls closed at 8 p.m., 53.46% of voters in Los Angeles County had 
cast ballots, compared to the 52.87% who voted in 1990. Statewide turnout 
should hit the predicted 60.2%, said Caren Daniels-Meade, spokeswoman for the 
secretary of state's office. "We expect to beat both 1990 and 1986," 
Daniels-Meade said, and far exceed the June primary turnout of 37% -- a 
historic low. 
</P>
<P>
 Near a polling place at Van Nuys High School, a small group of students 
opposing Proposition 187 walked through the neighborhood without incident. As 
voters streamed into Oxnard's All Saints Episcopal Church, an anti-Proposition 
187 march began at Oxnard High School a few blocks away. About 50 students from 
San Fernando High School gathered near voting booths at Paxton Park in Pacoima 
before walking back to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Few voters said the student protests affected their decision on the 
controversial measure, which would bar illegal immigrants from public schools 
and non-emergency medical care. But after a barrage of television ads that 
often distorted issues and candidates, some indicated a measure of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pereira, 67, of Pacoima said he voted against Proposition 187 because he 
was upset at the students who left their schools to protest. When told that the 
students were opposed to the measure, he looked perplexed, shrugged his 
shoulders and said, "I guess I messed up." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 32% of the voters interviewed by The Times exit poll at 85 precincts 
statewide said the tight race on Proposition 187 was the main event at the 
voting booth -- no matter how they voted. 
</P>
<P>
 From Boyle Heights to Temple-Beaudry, home to some of the city's largest 
immigrant neighborhoods, scores of voters cast their ballots Tuesday morning as 
precinct workers reported above-average turnouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters included recently naturalized citizens, those who had not cast 
ballots in years and others whose skepticism of politics had long since soured 
them on the electoral process. And some called the initiative mean-spirited, 
racist and divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "187 is the main reason I am here," Yolanda Garcia said in Spanish as she 
walked into Jovanna's Beauty Shop in Boyle Heights shortly after the polls 
opened at 7 a.m. Suffering from asthma, she braved the rain to walk five blocks 
and cast her vote against the measure and its chief proponent, Gov. Pete 
Wilson. "This is a special day. I am sick, but I came to vote against racism," 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sentiments ran just as high Tuesday in the pro-Proposition 187 camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are getting too many illegals and the taxpayers can't take care of 
them," said 80-year-old Vera Bedell of San Clemente. In Lake Forest, Ray 
Chaplain and his wife, Nannette, echoed a similar belief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a protest vote," 51-year-old Ray Chaplain said of his "yes" vote for the 
initiative. "I feel like I have to send a message to somebody that enough is 
enough. Normally, I wouldn't vote because I'm so disgusted by these idiots 
(candidates)." 
</P>
<P>
 In Leimert Park, part of the Crenshaw district, Museum In Black owner Brian 
Breye said he had a high turnout in his African art shop turned polling place, 
despite the morning rain. John Walker, casting his vote at the museum, said 
Proposition 187 brought him to the polls. "I think it's not fair that others 
come into California and get benefits," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout was up from 1990 and 1986 -- the last two governor's races and 
midterm congressional elections because of Proposition 187 and increased voter 
registration efforts by Democrats and Republicans alike, said Bruce Cain, 
professor of political science at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state was home to at least one novel experiment -- weekend 
voting in a few selected counties. Absentee ballots are at an all-time high, 
with the secretary of state's office saying that absentee voters could account 
for a record 25% of the electorate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brennan, director of The Times Poll, said preliminary exit polls showed 
Proposition 187, the governor's race and the race for U.S. Senate to be at the 
forefront of voters' minds this Election Day. About 34% of those asked said 
their main reason for voting was to cast a ballot for Gov. Pete Wilson or 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown in their bids for governor; 20% were interested in the 
Senate race between Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Miller, 60, voted for Wilson, saying the governor had earned back her 
support after taking a tough stance on illegal immigration and backing 
Proposition 187. "I sent him a small donation about a month ago and told him 
that it was about time he started working on our illegal alien problem," said 
the self-described "staunch Republican" from Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in sweat pants and a Dallas Cowboys cap, Roy Sanchez, 30, said he voted 
for Brown and Huffington because they were a little better than the other 
candidates. "It's just which of the two evils do you support," said Sanchez, 
who voted at the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer in Oxnard. "I went with 
Huffington because I hated Feinstein a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking toward his polling place at Oxnard's All Saints Episcopal Church, Joe 
Gray, 59, said he had still not made up his mind. Huffington or Feinstein? It 
was such a difficult choice, he said. He did not care much for either 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, did not have Gray's problem. Retirees Ralph and Bonnie Rampton 
went to the polls in Thousand Oaks to kick the bums out. They said Tuesday that 
they wanted to voice their dissatisfaction with the present slate of elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally we disagree with one another, and our votes cancel each other out," 
Bonnie Rampton said. "But this year we're both fed up with the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We refused to vote like sheep," she said. "We wanted to get the rascals out."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOP'S ROGAN TAKES EARLY LEAD OVER SCHIFF; ASSEMBLY: THE 
REPUBLICAN ENJOYS THE PARTY'S STRONG NATIONAL SHOWING IN BID TO KEEP THE SEAT 
HE WON IN MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In early returns, Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) took an early lead 
Tuesday night over Democratic foe Adam Schiff after one of the region's most 
hotly contested legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered with other local Republican candidates at a raucous party in 
Glendale, Rogan was enjoying the GOP's strong national showing while waiting 
for final word on whether he would return to Sacramento for a full two-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens to me, it looks like a great day for Republicans," 
Rogan said as a crowd of supporters pressed forward to shake his hand. "Adam 
fought a long, hard campaign and I think it's going to be a long night for both 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away in Burbank, Schiff continued hammering away at his opponent -- 
even after the polls closed. He spent Election Day calling potential 
supporters, making his last call minutes before the end of voting at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," Schiff said early in the evening at the Smoke House 
restaurant. "We've run a really strong, community-based campaign. We've worked 
our hardest and made very few mistakes. . . . I'm confident with winning 
tonight, but if I don't win, I'm proud of the campaign we've run." 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of Rogan supporters gathered at the Verdugo Club were already 
gloating at Rogan's early lead. They joined supporters of Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Municipal Court judge hopeful James Simpson, both of 
whom had strong leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats are going to need a lot of crying towels," Glendale businessman 
Ken Bennett predicted. "I consider this a night of revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Rogan to be vulnerable, the state Democratic leadership poured 
last-minute contributions into Schiff's campaign, turning the Glendale-Burbank 
legislative race into a fierce battle between rival state party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rogan was the incumbent, he had not been in office long. He won a May 
special election to fill a vacancy created when veteran Republican Assemblyman 
Pat Nolan resigned in February after pleading guilty to a charge of political 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43rd District, long a Republican stronghold, was also considered ripe for 
a Democratic upset because of the strong showings there of President Clinton 
and U. S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. The district, reapportioned 
in 1992, includes Glendale and Burbank as well as Los Feliz, Silver Lake and 
parts of Hollywood. Its registration is 45% Democratic and 41% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, 34, mounted an aggressive campaign against the freshman Republican, 
painting him as a former liberal Democrat who underwent a dramatic 
transformation into a right-wing Christian who would introduce creationism into 
public schools and outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to campaign contributions to Rogan from conservative Christian 
organizations, Schiff accused his opponent of being the captive of the GOP's 
radical Christian right wing. "Stop the radical right!" one mailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the blunt-spoken Rogan, 37, accused Schiff of trying to obscure the real 
issues in the district with talk of religion. Acknowledging that his political 
views have evolved, Rogan drew a very different portrait of himself in campaign 
literature -- as a hard-working young boy from a broken home who overcame the 
odds to become a hotshot prosecutor and one of California's youngest Municipal 
Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan rose from the bottom of society, one mailer said, and forged his 
political identity "in the crucible of hard work, grit and a belief that the 
American dream is open to anyone who is willing to stand on their own two 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Family values also became an issue when Schiff attacked Rogan's decision to 
accept a $20,000-a-year pay increase that was recommended for all state 
legislators by a citizens panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, who is married and has two children, struck back by portraying himself 
as a good family provider, while contrasting that image with that of bachelor 
Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before criticizing me for exercising my family responsibilities, perhaps you 
ought to get one," Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, a former assistant U. S. attorney, sought to blunt that charge by 
actively campaigning with his girlfriend and revealing in campaign literature 
-- underneath a picture of the pair holding hands -- that they will marry early 
next year.

<P>
 Also running was Libertarian Willard Michlin, a real estate broker from 
Hollywood.

RUSSIA SIGNALS IRAQ IS SET TO RECOGNIZE KUWAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a month of diplomatic pressure on Iraq, Russia indicated Tuesday that 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is ready to accept a United Nations demand that 
Baghdad give formal and legal recognition to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the possible breakthrough came after a two-hour meeting here, arranged 
at Iraq's request, between Tarik Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed by Baghdad, the step could lead to a lifting of U.N. trade 
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and would ease the tensions 
caused by sudden Iraqi troop movements toward Kuwait last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A cautiously worded statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry said Aziz came 
here with a letter from Hussein to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin "on 
Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and borders under U.N. Security 
Council Resolution 833." 
</P>
<P>
 That resolution was adopted after Kozyrev's premature announcement Oct. 13 
that Hussein would drop Iraq's claims to Kuwaiti territory. The Security 
Council demanded that Hussein's decision be ratified into law by his 
Parliament, and the Iraqis balked. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting Tuesday with Aziz, Kozyrev rushed to the Kremlin to brief 
Yeltsin, who then ordered him to Baghdad today "to take part in completing the 
appropriate constitutional procedures" demanded by the Security Council, the 
Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some skepticism in Russia's foreign policy Establishment that a deal 
is done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for Kozyrev to urgently fly to Iraq unless there are 
reservations and conditions put forth by Iraq," said Vyacheslav A. Nikonov, 
chairman of the Russian Parliament's international security subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if Iraq finally recognizes Kuwait, the United States has threatened 
to veto any easing of sanctions unless Hussein's regime meets U.N. restrictions 
on its weaponry and keeps its troops away from the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Border recognition would meet only one of a number of requirements with which 
Iraq has not complied," State Department spokesman David Johnson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Russia are often at odds over Hussein, with Washington 
taking a hard line and Moscow urging an end to sanctions. Russia's bullish 
diplomacy is more than an attempt to recover superpower influence in the 
Persian Gulf; Iraq owes Moscow $7 billion, mostly for weapons bought before the 
1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our chances to get these dollars back will arise only when Iraq can sell oil, 
which means lifting the sanctions," Kozyrev said in a Russian TV interview 
aired Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also drew a parallel between Hussein and Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasser Arafat. "Two, three years ago we told our Western 
colleagues: Recognize Arafat, we need to show him the way out," Kozyrev said. 
"And see, they did move. And now he is not only not a terrorist but a Nobel 
Peace Prize winner."

95 ARRESTED IN FRENCH RAIDS ON ISLAMISTS; TERRORISM: SUSPECTS ARE ACCUSED OF 
RUNNING A SUPPORT NETWORK FOR ALGERIAN GUERRILLAS. POLICE SEIZE WEAPONS, 
EXPLOSIVES. 
</P>

<P>
 Elite French police units raided homes and buildings near Paris and other 
cities Tuesday, uncovering a large cache of arms and explosives and arresting 
95 people suspected of operating a support network for Islamic guerrillas in 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 The police sweeps, the largest since authorities began cracking down on 
Islamic fundamentalists here a year ago, gave credence to repeated government 
warnings that French soil is being used to give logistic support to guerrilla 
groups in the former French colony. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was sure to fuel anti-Islamic feelings in France, home to 5 million 
Muslims, and increase scrutiny of foreigners and French citizens from North 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows clearly that there are fundamentalists strongly determined to 
develop terrorist actions and clandestine activities from our territory and 
from other European countries," said French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. 
</P>
<P>
 It also showed, he told reporters, "that they have the means, including false 
identities, to move around in Europe. And it implicates French citizens of 
Algerian origin in these activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The raids, involving more than 300 police officers, were ordered by France's 
top terrorist prosecutor, Jean-Louis Bruguiere. The authorities focused their 
attention on immigrant areas around Paris and other major cities. An array of 
weapons, from automatic pistols and assault rifles to hand grenades, was 
uncovered at several sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua said investigators also found evidence of links between the French 
network and supporters in Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested was Mourad Adou, 24, described by authorities as a key 
leader of the Armed Islamic Group, which is believed to be responsible for 
sabotage attacks and assassinations of foreigners, journalists and 
intellectuals in Algeria. In the past year, 23 French citizens have been killed 
in Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armed Islamic Group has thus far refused to join talks between the 
military government in Algeria and more moderate Islamic fundamentalists. An 
estimated 11,000 people have died in Algeria since Islamic radicals took up 
arms after the January, 1992, elections, which were canceled by the government 
when the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front appeared to be winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, French police arrested more than 20 North Africans, eventually 
deporting them to Burkina Faso in West Africa. The conservative French 
government also has expelled some Islamic clergymen.

WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL SEEKS BOSNIAN SERB INDICTED IN GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first international war crimes tribunal since World War II asked Germany 
on Tuesday to surrender a Bosnian Serb accused of murder and torture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a courtroom rented at an insurance company headquarters, three judges ruled 
that Dusan Tadic should be tried by the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal, 
established a year ago by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadic, 38, has been held in Germany since a Bosnian Muslim identified him in 
February at a German refugee camp. German authorities indicted him Monday on 
genocide and murder charges, but have expressed willingness to turn his case 
over to the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadic is suspected of murder, torture, forced deportations and gang rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tadic trial would probably begin next spring, officials said, adding that 
the maximum sentence would be life imprisonment. Unlike the Nuremberg and Tokyo 
tribunals after World War II, the Yugoslav war crimes court cannot hand down 
the death penalty or try defendants in absentia.

4 KILLED, 7 INJURED BY SHRAPNEL AND SNIPERS IN SARAJEVO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sniping and shrapnel killed four people and wounded seven in Sarajevo on 
Tuesday as increasing violence on battlefields around the country spread to the 
besieged capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead included three children, hospital officials said.Five children were 
wounded in the fighting, the heaviest in central Sarajevo in nearly six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too early to say who was responsible, but Bosnian Serbs have threatened 
to avenge battlefield losses by tightening their grip on Muslim-held Sarajevo. 
The Bosnian government army said it will retaliate for Tuesday's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pools of blood stained the pavement in front of Sarajevo's main Kosevo 
hospital as staff rushed to attend the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't anybody help us?" said Sandra Kubura, a neighbor of 11-year-old Nermina 
Omerovic, who was killed by a Serbian sniper in central Sarajevo. "They've been 
shooting constantly for the last two days." 
</P>
<P>
 The front lines had been stable as the two sides wrangled over details of a 
peace plan. But in recent weeks, negotiations have taken a back seat to 
fighting.

SCIENCE; GREENHOUSE GIVES BOTANISTS FRESH VIEW OF PLANT LIFE; SMITHSONIAN 
INSTITUTION'S NEW $1-MILLION BOTANICAL LABORATORY WILL ALLOW SCIENTISTS TO 
STUDY RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Somewhere hidden among the shelves of greenery, lingering in one of the five 
climate-controlled rooms, may be a plant containing secrets for fighting human 
disease. Threads of species once feared extinct now bloom under the clear roof. 
Botanists who for years studied only dried specimens now examine live plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History are 
rejoicing over a new $1-million greenhouse in Suitland, Md., that will enable 
them not only to study live plants from all over the world, but also play a 
part in conserving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a planet where resources are constantly shrinking and population is 
growing, understanding our resources becomes more crucial," Warren Wagner, a 
Smithsonian botanist, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenhouse at the Smithsonian's second campus, a half an hour's drive from 
the main campus on the National Mall, closes a void that Museum of Natural 
History botanists have been pining to fill since the museum began housing live 
specimens in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 6,000-square-foot facility opened, scientists were forced to make do 
with a relatively tiny makeshift greenhouse in the attic of the Mall's museum 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Smithsonian botanist John Kress said the greenhouse, a high-tech child of the 
Computer Age, allows the government to bring plants -- some rare and endangered 
-- to a controlled setting to identify and experiment with them, and ensure 
those threatened species a chance for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we just collected, dried and stored them for study," said Kress, an 
expert in Heliconia plants -- which are known for their fluorescent, stiff 
flowers. "Now, we can grow for conservation, which will benefit science, 
commercial industries and medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation is especially critical for some plants in Hawaii and South 
America, among other places. Wagner said some species have been brought to the 
brink of extinction by fires, logging, road construction and the choking growth 
of plants brought in from other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the goal of Smithsonian botanists is to travel the world looking for 
exotic indigenous plants to bring back to poke, probe and read DNA from in 
hopes of finding the right conditions for plants to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't carry on experiments in the pouring rain in Madagascar or Brazil," 
Wagner explained amid the artificial mist of the "tall room," where larger 
tropical plants can climb higher than a giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kress held a small, ordinary-looking tropical plant in one hand, giving 
special admiration to its shock of not-yet-flowered greenery. He liberated the 
plant in 1992 from an oil pipeline area trampled by guerrillas in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no other collections of this plant in the world," Kress said of the 
Heliconia estherae , a plant with yellow or red fluorescent banana-like flowers 
that hang down. 
</P>
<P>
 Heliconia is a flowering plant with some varieties that can be found in 
Southern California. One variety is the bird of paradise, well-known for its 
colorful, bird-like appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, whose specialty is Hawaiian plants, recently worked with a 
husband-and-wife team of UC Irvine botanists, Ann Sakai and Stephen Weller, to 
study Schiedea , a genus of shrubs and vines that are in the carnation family . 
The genus has an unusual trait -- it contains both bisexual and asexual plants. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the 25 species of Schiedea are on the federal endangered 
species list. Smithsonian botanists are hoping they will be able to save those 
species by determining the best growing conditions for the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiedea adamantis , one of the specimens grown in the greenhouse, is only 
found on Diamond Head Crater, within the city limits of Honolulu. It's so rare 
that it doesn't even have a common name. Sakai wrote a recovery plan in 
February for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to save the threatened plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding endangered species of plants can be hard work. Sakai and Weller said 
that because of grazing on the Hawaiian Islands, goats and pigs tend to eat 
many species of plants that might otherwise survive. So, to find Schiedea 
attenuata , a small shrub, two plant collectors from the National Tropical 
Botanical Garden had to use ropes to swing down the side of a cliff to find the 
untouched specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian greenhouse will not be open to the public. However, scientists 
all over the country will likely receive specimens from the new facility, and 
some of them will appear in public greenhouses, Kress said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian greenhouse is equipped with temperature-control devices 
designed to counteract Washington's especially hot summers and cold winters. In 
one room, a dry climate houses plants from such areas as Costa Rica and Peru. 
Another room across the center hallway emits a thick mist in a much cooler 
setting, playing host to day flowers from Africa and South America.

TOURISM; SAFE HOVER LIMITS IMPOSED ON HAWAII 'FLIGHT-SEEING' COPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESSOYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert and Cindy Thompson took their two teen-age daughters on a helicopter 
ride this summer along the Na Pali coast of Kauai, where majestic cliffs meet 
the ocean. Halfway through the tour, the engine quit. 
</P>
<P>
 As the helicopter sank beneath the waves, the San Diego girls managed to swim 
to the rocky shore. Their father, another passenger and the pilot drowned. 
Their mother was found treading water, cradling her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the tragedy and others like it, the Federal Aviation 
Administration has issued emergency rules for Hawaii's burgeoning 
"flight-seeing" industry. Late last month, tour aircraft were ordered to fly at 
least 1,500 feet away from the ground, ocean or any land formation. Over water, 
helicopters must be equipped with floats or passengers must wear life vests. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum altitude is a drastic change for the $100-million-a-year 
helicopter business, which thrives on close encounters with Hawaii's unique 
environment -- from hidden valleys and mist-shrouded waterfalls to molten lava. 
Until now, pilots could fly at any altitude that would allow "an emergency 
landing without undue hazard." Over populated areas, there was a 300-foot 
minimum altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour operators fear the new rule may increase risks by bunching helicopters 
together at 1,500 feet, and could wipe out many of the views that make touring 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a foot away, but certainly closer than 1,500 feet," said 
Bob DeCamp, president of the Hawaii Helicopter Operators Assn. "We are in favor 
of regulations if they do improve safety. We have questions about whether this 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike airplanes, helicopters can hover close to scenic spots, offering a 
breathtaking experience to passengers. "Fly into the heart and heat of an 
active volcano," tempts one brochure. "Close enough to waterfalls to feel the 
cooling mist," boasts another. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators note, however, that Hawaii's unusual landscape offers few 
suitable landing sites, and winds are unpredictable. The 1,500-foot minimum 
altitude will give pilots more time to react in an emergency, prepare their 
passengers and maneuver to a safe landing, the FAA says. 
</P>
<P>
 "While passengers are often attracted to the thrill associated with low-flying 
air tours, they are generally not aware of the risks involved," the FAA said in 
its report on the new rules. The agency points to an "escalation of air tour 
accidents" to justify the emergency rules. Twenty-four people died in such 
accidents in Hawaii in the past three years, the FAA said. In the previous nine 
years, another 24 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been chaos in the skies out here," said Denise Antolini, attorney for 
the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, which joined a dozen other groups in 
petitioning the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeCamp says it's unfair to single out the Hawaii helicopter business. The 
industry has grown from 35 helicopters in 1982 to 90 today, he said, so 
naturally the number of accidents has risen. What's more relevant, he notes, is 
the rate of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCamp said his calculations show that Hawaii tour helicopters had 1.1 
accidents per 100,000 hours of flight time last year, compared to 6.2 for 
copters nationally and 7.1 for general aviation nationwide. In 1992, the rate 
was 3.9 accidents for Hawaii tour helicopters, 7.0 for copters nationally and 
7.2 for general aviation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules "will have a tremendous impact on our business," said Bill Payne, 
general manager of Papillon Hawaiian Helicopters, the state's largest operator. 
"The altitude restriction virtually eliminates the middle of the islands, and 
that is what people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Shepherd, a dentist vacationing from San Luis Obispo, agrees. Stepping 
off a helicopter with his three young children after a tour of the east Maui 
rain forest, he raved about coming within 100 feet of a waterfall. Staying 
1,500 feet away, the length of five football fields, would "wreck the fun of 
the ride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA is accepting comments on the Hawaii rules until Dec. 27.

ISRAEL SPEEDS HAND-OVER IN BID TO BOOST ARAFAT; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS WILL SOON 
GET AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK. PLO LEADER'S POPULARITY HAS BEEN DECLINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with evidence that Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat's political base is rapidly eroding, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin promised Tuesday to speed up the hand-over of authority in the West Bank 
and accelerate negotiations on Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from two hours of talks near Erez, the crossing point between Israel 
and the Gaza Strip, Arafat and Rabin said they had made progress on some of the 
many issues bedeviling Israeli-Palestinian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin announced that Israel will transfer authority in the West Bank to the 
Palestinians for tourism, welfare, health and taxation by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Israel transferred authority for education to the Palestinians. 
But the Israelis refused to relinquish the administration of the other services 
until they were assured that donor countries would supply enough money to fund 
them. Rabin said Tuesday that adequate funding will be available by the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin also accepted a Palestinian suggestion for speeding up talks on holding 
elections in Gaza and the West Bank. The two sides disagree on the nature of 
the elections, on the extent and timing of an Israeli troop redeployment out of 
Palestinian population centers before the elections are held, and on security 
arrangements in the West Bank. Rabin said that negotiating teams from the two 
sides will meet Nov. 21 to discuss all those issues. Previously, he had 
insisted that the issues be discussed and finalized one at a time, a policy 
Palestinian officials said was intolerably slowing negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In another gesture to Arafat, Rabin announced that he had agreed to authorize 
the return of 10,000 more workers to their jobs in Israel. Last month, after a 
bomber killed 22 people -- and himself -- in an attack on a Tel Aviv bus, Rabin 
banned both Palestinian goods and more than 60,000 Palestinian workers from 
entering Israel. Israel began to lift that ban a week ago, allowing 8,000 
workers to re-enter, but Palestinians have been pushing for a full lifting of 
the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin also said Tuesday that Gazan merchants will be allowed to sell their 
goods freely in Israel. It was unclear how that declaration would affect an 
earlier decision by the Ministry of Agriculture to ban all Gazan fruits and 
vegetables because of a reported outbreak of cholera in Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Israel will soon make good on an earlier commitment to build 
facilities at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip for 
transporting goods across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all good news for Arafat, who dubbed the meeting "positive and 
fruitful," although Palestinian officials had hoped that Rabin also would 
announce the release of more Palestinian prisoners. Arafat suffered public 
humiliation Friday when he was booed out of a mosque in Gaza where a militant 
Islamic activist -- killed in a car bombing -- was being mourned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am desperate," Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told the Israeli 
newspaper Yediot Aharanot, in an interview published Tuesday before the summit. 
". . . We cannot handle the closure and Rabin's loathing of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said that the closure of the Gaza Strip had ruined the Palestinian 
Authority's efforts to attract investors there and was driving Palestinians 
into the ranks of the opposition. He said Palestinians were also infuriated by 
Israel's plans for economic cooperation with Jordan, with whom Israel has 
signed a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I follow all you are planning to do with the Jordanians and I am exploding 
with despair and anger," Shaath said. "Rabin is deliberately slow with us and 
very fast with the Jordanians." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were taking credit Tuesday for Rabin's 
decision to try to ease tensions with Arafat and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin has finally recovered from the joy of the perfect enemy," said one 
aide, referring to Rabin's intense personal involvement in negotiating the 
treaty with Jordan. "He understands that he still has the Palestinian chapter 
on his hand, and that we won't gain anything from the feeling of rejection that 
the Palestinians have had during the festivities surrounding the peace treaty 
with Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rabin was alarmed by 
Arafat's declining popularity among Palestinians. Opposition to Arafat cuts 
across political boundaries, with members of Fatah, the guerrilla group Arafat 
founded, complaining just as bitterly as Islamic militants about his 
authoritarian style of governing and his failure to win concessions from 
Israel.

CANADIAN DOCTOR WHO PERFORMS ABORTIONS IS SHOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Vancouver doctor who performs abortions was in serious condition after being 
shot in the leg Tuesday by an assailant who fired through a window in his home 
in what police called a planned attack, possibly with an assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver police said gynecologist Garson Romalis suffered a wound to the 
upper leg.His wife and daughter, also home at the time, were unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romalis house has been picketed by anti-abortion groups in the past, 
police and neighbors said. Police said they did not have a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was by far the most violent anti-abortion incident in Canada, a 
country where crimes of violence involving firearms are rare. The only other 
serious abortion-related crime was the destruction by firebomb of an abortion 
clinic in Toronto in 1992. No one was arrested in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion has been legal in Canada since 1988, and more than 100,000 abortions 
are performed in Canada each year. Several Canadian provinces have tried to 
stop doctors from setting up abortion clinics within their borders, but they 
generally have been defeated in court.

SRI LANKA'S 'WAR OF WIDOWS' GOES TO POLLS; ASIA: TWO WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE 
ASSASSINATED HAVE WAGED A BITTER CAMPAIGN FOR TOP JOB. KEY ISSUE IS HOW TO DEAL 
WITH TAMIL REBELS. 
</P>

<P>
 Like Americans, voters on this verdant Indian Ocean isle have just been though 
a wearying, divisive and often negative campaign. But they've also seen one top 
candidate perish in a bomb blast and the other blamed for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sri Lankans will choose an executive president -- likely the first 
woman to assume the powerful office. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter electoral contest, dubbed the "war of the widows" because both 
front-runners survived the assassinations of their politician husbands, has 
turned into a referendum on the key issue of the day: the government's proper 
stance toward the 11-year-old rebellion by Tamil insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was elected to the post of prime minister 
in August after pledging to open peace negotiations with the rebels, whose 
struggle has led to the deaths of 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 24, the day the second set of talks was supposed to begin, 
Kumaratunga's top opponent in the race for the presidency, Gamini Dissanayake, 
died when a bomb exploded at a late-night campaign rally here. 
</P>
<P>
 The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who control enclaves in the 
island's north and east, were widely blamed for what police say was a suicide 
bombing in which 53 others died. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissanayake's 51-year-old widow, Srima, was nominated by the main opposition 
United National Party to take his place on the ballot. A lawyer who ran for the 
first time in an election only last year, she has demanded that the Liberation 
Tigers lay down their arms before talks can resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissanayake's death embittered an already feverish campaign in this country, 
where murder and thuggery have frequently been part and parcel of politics. 
Although his widow has never said it, campaign posters and UNP orators have 
accused Kumaratunga and her People's Alliance of being in cahoots with the 
Liberation Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga, 49, broke off talks with the rebels after the bombing and 
launched an investigation to determine whether the Liberation Tigers were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kumaratunga wins today's six-way race handily, as she is widely expected 
to, many observers expect her to restart the negotiations sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ethnic issue is extra important," said Neelan Tiruchelvam, a lawyer and 
human rights activist. "Her ability to address all other issues depends on 
success here." 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga's father and mother both served as Sri Lankan prime minister. Her 
father, Solomon Bandaranaike, was assassinated in 1959 by chauvinists from the 
island's majority Sinhalese community. In 1988, her film star-turned-politician 
husband, Vijaya Kumaratunga, was gunned down by Sinhalese leftists. 
</P>
<P>
 In her bid for the highest office in this island republic of 18 million, 
Kumaratunga has garnered the support of many leaders of its Muslim and Tamil 
minorities. She has pledged, if elected, to amend the constitution to eliminate 
the executive presidency by July, and restore the British-style parliamentary 
system that Sri Lanka had until 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Sri Lanka's navy said it killed at least seven Tamil rebels in a 
sea battle after intercepting three rebel boats as they were about to attack a 
naval landing craft in the Bay of Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, as the campaign came to a close, four deaths were reported 
in clashes between followers of rival parties. Bracing for more violence, the 
government mobilized more than 40,000 police officers for election day duty. On 
the Jaffna peninsula, the rebels' enclave in the north, the Liberation Tigers 
said they will not allow voting.

1ST-CLASS STAMP LIKELY TO COST 32 CENTS IN RATE INCREASE; MAIL: THE BOOST IS 
PART OF AN OVERALL 10.3% HIKE. THE HIGHER FEES WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Postal rates will rise in January, with the standard first-class stamp jumping 
to 32 cents from 29 cents, the chairman of the Postal Service warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers should plan accordingly," Sam Winters, the chairman, said 
during a meeting of the Postal Service Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service already has applied for a 10.3% rate increase for all 
classes of mail. The independent Postal Rate Commission is expected to announce 
within a few weeks its ruling on the rate request. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval is widely expected, and postal officials, along with most big 
mailers, have been assuming that the higher rates would take effect on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But Winters made it virtually official Tuesday, promising that the new rate 
structure will begin with the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the higher rates, many big advertisers, mail-order merchandisers 
and mass mailers will send out tons of extra mailings late this year to take 
advantage of the current rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For any people who might have been hoping that the rate hike would take effect 
sometime after Jan. 1, Winters' remarks are likely to serve as a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware of our customers' interest in a probable implementation date for 
the new rates," Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rate commission announces its decisions, he said, the board of 
governors will act "in a most timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase would be the first since 1991, when the price of a 
first-class stamp rose to 29 cents from 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal rates have tended to follow a three-year cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service typically makes a profit during the first year after a rate 
increase, then breaks even during the second, and suffers an operating loss at 
the end of the third year. 
</P>
<P>
 Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr., who took office in 1992, has extended 
the traditional cycle into a fourth year, delaying the request for a rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed rate increases usually are contentious, with competing groups of 
mailers trying to negotiate lower rates for themselves by shifting more of the 
burden to other classes of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the big mailers, including magazines, newspapers, catalogue 
publishers and direct marketers, supported an across-the-board rate hike of 
10.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the Postal Service promised to conduct a major study to re-examine 
the classification and pricing system that has remained largely unchanged since 
the Postal Service became independent in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10.3% increase "is below inflation and will provide just enough revenue on 
which to operate the Postal Service," Winters said. "For that reason, the 
governors hope to implement the rates as early as practical in January, 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials expect a favorable decision from the Rate Commission by the 
end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service Board of Governors and many members of Congress will be 
watching the system's performance closely during the busy holiday mailing 
season, which began in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon has come under intensive criticism for problems with mail delivery in 
many metropolitan areas, including Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service has established a target of 95% "on-time" delivery for 
first-class mail, but actual performance has fallen far short in many 
localities. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-time standards require overnight delivery of mail within a single 
metropolitan area, and no more than three days for coast-to-coast mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime hours have risen sharply, and the Postal Service is hiring new 
employees in an effort to improve service. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong national economy will cause mail volume to increase by an estimated 
6% yearly, straining a system that distributes about 170 billion pieces of mail 
to more than 120 million addresses annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The added burden of holiday catalogues, cards and advertising, plus growing 
business mail will combine to offer a major management challenge to Runyon and 
his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to expanding its work force, the Postal Service is renting 
millions of square feet of storage space and hiring a fleet of aircraft to help 
with the huge volume of mail for this season.

ACCUSED CHILD KILLER'S FAMILY APOLOGIZES TO BLACKS; RACE RELATIONS: SUSAN 
SMITH'S BROTHER SAYS THAT HIS SISTER'S FALSE CLAIM THAT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN 
KIDNAPED HER SONS WAS A 'TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of accused child killer Susan Smith apologized Tuesday to African 
Americans for her false claim that a black man kidnaped her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's brother, Scott Vaughn, called the racial implication of her allegation 
a "terrible misfortune" and said the family found it disturbing that "anyone 
would think that this was ever a racial issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith confessed last week to drowning her children while in a state of 
depression that nearly caused her to take her own life. A number of black men 
were picked up for questioning during the nine days that Smith carried out her 
deception. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, in his comments, thanked his black friends who he said have stood by 
him during the ordeal and added, "Had there been a white man, a purple man, a 
blue man on that corner that night, that would have been the description that 
Susan used." 
</P>
<P>
 Many African Americans were upset that her allegations had smeared black men, 
and some townspeople criticized law enforcement officials for taking the claim 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, after Smith family members finished their apology and other comments 
in an afternoon press conference at the Union County Courthouse, Sheriff Howard 
Wells told reporters: "I have no apology to make in any decision or any action 
I took." 
</P>
<P>
 "The community at large has never seen this as a racial issue," he said later, 
away from the cameras. "There have been some individuals, but they were not 
representative of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while some African Americans have described the questioning of black 
suspects as harassment and said Wells should apologize, many others have 
praised him for the way in which he handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander Smith were 
reported missing, Wells said, law enforcement officials focused their efforts 
on finding them. Arresting the alleged kidnaper was not a priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells called the family's apology "heartfelt," and said it would "go a long 
way toward easing the tension and helping us get back to a state of normal 
function in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's husband, David, was scheduled to speak Tuesday about the murders and 
his wife's arrest, but was unable to appear because he is still in too much 
pain, said his father, Charles David Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Before breaking down in tears and being led away by a relative, the elder 
Smith said, "David's recovering from this tragedy in a very painful way. It's 
going to haunt him for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 He thanked the public for its overwhelming support expressed by cards, letters 
and flowers sent from around the nation and from some foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn also expressed his appreciation and said, "I know that many of the 
people out there feel betrayed, just as my family and David's family feel 
betrayed. But I want you all to know that me and my family and David's family, 
we really needed all that you've done. We needed your prayers, and we still 
need your prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, one African American resident of Union said no apology was 
necessary from the family. "It makes me feel good that they apologized, but for 
me personally it wasn't needed," said Hester Booker. "It's something that 
happened. Now it's time to try to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue and white ribbons in memory of the boys still dot the town. A sign in 
front of the elementary school that sits at the intersection where Smith had 
claimed the black gunman commandeered the car says: "God Bless Michael and 
Alex."

KENNEDY PULLS OUT VICTORY TO EARN SEVENTH SENATE TERM; MASSACHUSETTS: VETERAN 
DEMOCRAT ESPOUSES SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT AFTER BITTER RACE ENDS WITH VOTERS 
MAINTAINING DYNASTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was touch and go for much of this long, bitter campaign. But Massachusetts 
once again sent a Kennedy to the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by a sea of relatives, Edward M. Kennedy called his election "a 
victory for those who believe we have a voice and a vote and a fighter in the 
U.S. Senate, who is going to fight for the interests of the middle class. 
Working families will know for the next six years that they have a spokesman. I 
will never leave their side. They will always have my vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy made a point of voicing his support for President and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, who had been blamed by Republicans for the country's ills. "I am proud 
to stand with Bill Clinton," he said to cheers Tuesday night, "and I am proud 
to stand with Hillary Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 In his concession speech, Kennedy's challenger, Mitt Romney said: "Our 
campaign for change has not ended. We're going to continue to fight for 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 With 69% of the votes counted, Kennedy had 58% of the vote and Romney 41%. A 
third-party candidate, Lauraleigh Dozier, had 1% 
</P>
<P>
 It took a fair amount of forgiving for many voters to give Kennedy a seventh 
term on Capitol Hill. But even to voters who professed to loathe the last 
surviving brother of his generation of Kennedys, the prospect of losing their 
link to this country's best-known political dynasty was perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that affection is the word that describes how we feel about 
Kennedy here," reflected novelist James Carroll, who lives on Boston's Beacon 
Hill. "I think it's a connection, a deep emotional bond, for better or for 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 But the extent of that attachment was severely tested in Kennedy's race 
against venture capitalist Romney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kennedy pulled out all the stops on this one," said Republican state Sen. 
Lucille Hicks, who represents the town of Wayland, west of Boston. "He was 
hanging on by his toenails." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the contrast between the two candidates more pronounced than in 
their physical appearance. At 62, the white-haired Kennedy has grown so heavy 
that he inspired a Letterman joke: "Vote for me, the big, red-faced guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Romney, 47, is impossibly square-jawed and lean. His hair is dark and 
lustrous. When he smiles, spectators are wise to don sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Their political philosophies are equally at odds. Kennedy all but personifies 
traditional liberal Democratic politics. He believes in government as a vehicle 
for social reform, and in recent years has proved to be a champion of causes 
pertaining to women and families. Romney is an inveterate capitalist who 
espoused a "hands-off" attitude on most questions of government intervention. 
He particularly faulted Democrats for poor economic policies and vowed to 
reverse tax hikes introduced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Romney campaigned on what was a recurring theme around the country: 
the need for change, the need to oust tired old incumbents in favor of fresh 
new political blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many contests across the nation, the Kennedy-Romney race was marked as 
much by record spending by both candidates as by the churlish, attack-dog tone 
the two contenders embraced. In what proved to be the most expensive campaign 
in Massachusetts history, Kennedy spent $8.5 million to defend his seat. 
Romney's campaign cost $7 million, at least $3 million of that coming from his 
own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Snippish television and radio ads, in particular, featured the two men -- each 
a multimillionaire in his own right -- accusing each other of having improperly 
benefited from suspicious real estate or business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates worked hard to package themselves. Romney presented himself as 
young and vital -- a jogger, a faithful husband to his beautiful blonde wife 
and the father of five wholesome, handsome sons. A venture capitalist, he 
hammered away at the correlation between his success as a self-made businessman 
and the skills he might need in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Romney's strategy and tenacity were rewarded. A month ago, polls 
showed the race in a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent days, surveys showed the votes tipping in Kennedy's favor. Many 
observers credited the shift to Kennedy's impressive showing in a pair of 
televised debates. The first encounter, at Boston's historic Faneuil Hall, 
featured a concession on the part of Romney forces that allowed Kennedy 
staffers to bring in triple-sized lecterns designed to conceal the senator's 
girth. At the next meeting, at Holyoke College in the western part of the 
state, Romney banned lecterns, insisting that the candidates stand next to one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's pre-debate campaign performance had been so sluggish that Romney -- 
as well as many veteran political observers -- probably underestimated the 
senator's comeback power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kennedy campaign was asleep," said longtime Democratic strategist Paul 
Nace. "They probably underestimated the vulnerability of the senator in 
Massachusetts, and they overestimated the knowledgeability of people. You know, 
Ted is very easy to take for granted. He's always been there." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the debates, Nace and others said, Kennedy surprised his opponent by 
surging back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expectations of his performance were very, very low," Nace said. "You had 
the right-wing radio freaks trashing him as this bumbling idiot. Well, anyone 
who debates on the floor of the U.S. Senate five days a week knows how to 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
 But it took more than a win in the debates to accomplish a Kennedy turnaround. 
John Gorman, president of Opinion Dynamics in Cambridge, pointed out that a 
full three years after the family's most recent scandal -- when his nephew 
William Kennedy Smith was charged with rape at the family's compound in Palm 
Beach, Fla., and Sen. Kennedy was described as carousing with his nephew and 
running around the mansion in his underwear -- "Kennedy had a 2-to-1 negative 
rating in this state." Only 35% of voters, Gorman said, gave Kennedy a positive 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 But through "a combination of work, remarriage and penance," Kennedy managed 
to get back in the race, Gorman said. Two days before the election, Gorman gave 
Kennedy a 5-to-4 favorable/unfavorable rating. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe Kennedy's eleventh-hour strength came back to what novelist Carroll 
called the storybook quality of the Kennedy dynasty, and the "grandeur" of its 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was so depressing was the prospect of his being humiliated," Carroll 
said.

TERM LIMITS, ANTI-CRIME LAWS GET OK; INITIATIVES: VOTERS IN SEVERAL STATES

 Voters unleashed their famously foul mood Tuesday, cracking down on crime and 
long-term politicians and sticking to their guns in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Maine, Nebraska, Nevada and the District of Columbia approved 
congressional term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-to-1 landslide, Georgia voters approved the nation's toughest 
sentencing law, mandating life in prison for a second violent felony. 
California voters gave firm approval to a law already on the books, ordering 25 
years-to-life for three-time serious felons. Passage makes it virtually 
impossible for lawmakers to alter the law without another ballot referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures to limit gay rights were failing by narrow margins in Idaho and 
Oregon in early returns, but voters in a Florida county passed a measure to 
undo gay-rights protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Floridians turned down a proposal to allow up to 47 casinos. Voters rejected 
the measure by an almost 2-to-1 margin despite a $16.7-million campaign by 
casino proponents, the most expensive campaign in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island voters said no to proposals to permit casinos in four cities and 
towns, including the state capital, Providence, and appeared close to rejecting 
a proposal for a fifth in West Greenwich, which the Narragansett Indians hoped 
to build. The Narragansetts may still build a casino without voter approval, 
but it would have to be on their own land in Charlestown, 25 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rhode Island and Florida, questions asking voters to allow 
casinos appeared on ballots in Massachusetts, Colorado and the Navajo 
Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gambling measures included proposals to allow slot machines in Colorado 
airports and on Missouri riverboats and to allow assorted games of chance in 
any Wyoming counties that approve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of South Carolina's popular video poker games may continue pouring out 
cash. Voters in all but nine of the state's 46 counties appeared ready to keep 
the status quo, rejecting a ballot proposal to stop the payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a common-sense vote," said John Reyelt, the owner of the Gold Rush 
Saloon in Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits, the preferred remedy for the '90s voter sick of long-time 
incumbents, were on ballots in Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, the District of Columbia and several cities and 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraskans' enthusiasm for term limits matched their ardor for Republican Rep. 
Doug Bereuter. He won a ninth term despite the ballot measure's limit of three 
consecutive terms for future members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraskans had to tackle the issue for a second time because the required 
number of petition signatures was miscalculated when term limits were approved 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, D.C., voters approved term limits for the mayor, city council and 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime was addressed around the country in measures intended largely to mete 
out more punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee and Kenosha voters rejected proposed handgun bans. But nearby 
Shorewood, Wis., approved such a ban in the form of a non-binding referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures to allow crime victims to have a greater role in prosecuting 
offenders appeared headed for passage in Ohio and Maryland in early voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two anti-gay-rights measures -- Oregon's Measure 13 and Idaho's Proposition 1 
-- would bar state and local governments from enacting laws that shield gays 
from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 They also would outlaw programs in public institutions, such as schools, that 
suggest homosexuality is acceptable. And they would require libraries to keep 
books on homosexuality away from minors. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few returns tallied in each state, the Idaho measure was opposed 
by 52% of voters, the Oregon measure by 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida measure -- on the ballot in Alachua County, home of the University 
of Florida at Gainesville -- repeals existing gay-rights protection. It was 
favored by 57% of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ballot measure with wide interest was Oregon's proposal to allow 
doctors to prescribe lethal medication for the terminally ill. Unlike assisted 
suicide, this alternative proposed to give dying patients full responsibility 
for taking their lives.

GINGRICH TAMES RHETORIC, SAVORS 'SPEAKER'; GEORGIA: IT IS EXPECTED THAT HIS 
TRIUMPH WILL TURN WASHINGTON UPSIDE DOWN, PORTENDING THE RISE OF A NEW KIND OF 
IDEOLOGICAL POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 However the night ended, he knew he would be the victor. He could taste it. He 
had planned it, for 20 years, like plotting lessons for one of the college 
classes he once taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speaker! Speaker! Speaker!" they chanted when he came to drink in their 
cheers of triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich, principal architect of attack politics, commander in chief of a 
loyal army of "new Republicans" created largely in his image, a man who has 
called Democrats "the enemy of normal Americans" and talks openly about 
remaking the nation into a conservative utopia by late Tuesday was virtually 
assured of becoming Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of the revolution!" Georgia radio talk-show host Sean 
Hannity declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "There he is, there he is," a woman screamed as Gingrich, with his Phil 
Donahue haircut and his doughboy frame, entered the Cobb Galleria Centre 
ballroom, festooned in "Newt Blue," the special color ordered by the man who is 
making a science of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican electoral sweep that swept his party toward a majority in the 
House is likely to make Gingrich the first GOP Speaker of the House since 1954. 
And he will be second in line of succession to the White House after Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 In victory he was magnanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is about the American people," he said. "Not a Republican 
victory. Not a Democratic victory. It is the American people making a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to change my behavior," he told a reporter later. "When you are 
Speaker you get to set the agenda, you get to decide what hearings are held, 
you get to decide what legislation is up. I think you don't have to be nearly 
as combative." 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake Gingrich and the Republican's triumph will turn Washington 
upside down, marking the rise of a new kind of ideological politics. And it is 
all part of a remarkable journey for a man who, during 16 years of service in 
the House has never authored a piece of legislation that became law. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days ago, however, it seemed that the biggest potential obstacle to 
Gingrich's ascension was annoyingly provincial. His own reelection race had 
become so close that Gingrich had to cancel plans to campaign for Republicans 
around the country so he could court voters in his suburban Atlanta district. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the polls closed in Georgia, returns showed that he had a comfortable 
lead over Democratic challenger Ben Jones, a former congressman who portrayed 
the character Cooter on the TV program "Dukes of Hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Gingrich's penchant for seeing virtually everything through the 
prism of his self-declared ideological war got him into trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the killing of two children in South Carolina by their 
mother was somehow the result of Democratic policies. "How a mother can kill 
her two children, 14 months and 3 years, in hopes that her boyfriend would like 
her, is just a sign of how sick the system is and I think people want to 
change," he declared. "The only way you can change is to vote Republican. 
That's the message for the last three days." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than making his mark by passing legislation, providing constituent 
services or mastering the art of compromise and consensus building, Gingrich 
has risen to the top of his party by redefining the role of congressman. He 
tried to tear down the institution he served to remake it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after his arrival in Washington, his antics inspired the late House 
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. to describe Gingrich's flagrant break with 
House traditions as the "worst thing I have seen in 32 years." As a young House 
back-bencher, he openly attacked fellow congressmen personally, kept files on 
colleagues and waged campaigns designed to damage O'Neill's successor, Speaker 
Jim Wright (D-Tex.), among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt is a revolutionary," said pollster Frank Luntz, who works closely with 
the Georgia congressman. "And he is unique in that he has really thought 
through how to make that revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has vowed that if Republicans gain control of the House and elect him 
Speaker, he will schedule hearings early next year on his "first-wave reforms." 
That agenda includes passage of a balanced budget amendment, congressional term 
limits, litigation reform and welfare reform. Later, he would push a set of 
"second-wave" reforms, including legalizing school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an obligation -- it's the Speaker of the House, not the speaker of 
the party," Gingrich said, "and I think I will have an obligation to reach out 
to the President and to reach out to the Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 But many Democrats and a few surviving GOP moderates wonder if he sincerely 
wants to accomplish anything while Clinton remains in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The adopted son of a military officer, Gingrich was raised in Europe and went 
to military high school in Germany. He studied European history at Emory 
University and earned a doctorate in European history from Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, this background provides important clues to the potential future 
direction of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich describes himself as a "Europeanist." In many European nations, the 
head of the majority party in the legislature effectively runs the government 
and sets policy. Margaret Thatcher did so in England, using her numerical 
advantage to ram bills down the throat of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern United States Congress, by contrast, politics has come to be 
known as the science of the possible. And leaders of Congress traditionally 
have accepted the fact that they could not dictate party discipline in the same 
way as their continental counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 But that could change now. 
</P>
<P>
 After a surprising election to the GOP leadership post of minority whip in 
1989, Gingrich has followed a carefully scripted game plan, which he studies 
hours a day, to gradually incubate a culture of congressional party control 
that is largely unknown in the modern Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One method was the creation of his own political action committee, known as 
GOPAC, to recruit, train and finance hundreds of Republican candidates now 
working their way up the ladder toward Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tactic involves a taped instructional course, taught by him, on how to 
run for office. Young Republicans around the country receive the tapes and 
listen to Gingrich's distilled political wisdom as they drive through their 
districts campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent strategy for developing party discipline is Gingrich's "contract 
for America," unveiled with much fanfare last month on the steps of the 
Capitol. In exchange in many cases for about $50,000 apiece in campaign 
contributions from the GOP, 355 Republican congressional candidates signed the 
pact, promising to support a Gingrich-designed legislative package that his 
pollster had calculated would help them win their elections. 
</P>
<P>
 He also helped elect many of these new Republicans by doling out more than $1 
million in additional campaign funds, and raising another $2 million for 
individual candidates through his campaign appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new Republicans in Congress intellectually and financially owe 
their seats to him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, even before the confetti and balloons had settled to the ballroom 
floor, the question was begging to be addressed: Could the man who rose through 
tearing down the institution in which he served actually govern? 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt has always been an attack general," said Georgia pollster and political 
analyst Claiborne Darden Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "And through history, attack generals don't survive after they have conquered 
the enemy."

GERGEN TAKES PARTING SHOT, BLASTS GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Resigning from his post as a top Clinton Administration adviser, Republican 
David Gergen says "acrimony and anger have reached new lows in Washington" 
because of unrelenting GOP opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In his resignation letter to President Clinton released Tuesday, Gergen said 
that when he joined the Democratic Administration in May, 1993, he was 
convinced it was essential "that we move beyond the scorching partisanship of 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 "The very fact that you asked someone who had proudly served in three 
Republican White Houses to join you in a Democratic White House was, I believe, 
an important signal that you also valued bipartisanship," Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Duke University announced that Gergen has formally accepted a 
visiting professorship at the Durham, N.C., school. He will teach an 
undergraduate course during the spring 1995 semester called "Governing in 
Today's America" at Duke's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, 52, is a native of Durham. His father taught mathematics at Duke from 
1936 to 1967, and his son graduated from the university in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen began his service in the Clinton White House as a presidential 
counselor to help mold Clinton's public image and later moved to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, he said there were "moments when bipartisanship flourished" 
over the last 17 months. He cited cooperation between the parties in Congress 
to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and the National Service Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there have been many, many other times when the acrimony and anger have 
reached new lows in Washington; I know how those times have pained you," Gergen 
told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen's intention to resign effective at the end of the year had been made 
known last week.

FROM HIGH TO ANXIETY, WHITE HOUSE LOSES '92 EUPHORIA; POLITICS: AFTER THE 
PROMISE OF CLINTON'S ELECTION, THE MOOD TURNS QUIET AS A MORE-GOP FUTURE DAWNS 
ON THE MIDTERM ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the last big election night, members of President Clinton's inner circle 
cheered, stomped their feet, kissed each other and delivered impassioned 
speeches about their plans to show Washington and the country how government 
could work. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't do any of that Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House weathered Election Day '94 with weary stoicism mingled 
with dread about a future that appeared likely to contain Senate Majority 
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The script called for everyone 
to pretend it was business as usual, but it became harder as the night wore on 
and the Democrats were losing both the House and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of aides emerged to try to salvage what they could from the dismal 
events. Voters were not totally rejecting their Administration, they insisted, 
just sending another message demanding change in Washington -- a message that 
the White House received, loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton himself stayed publicly silent as he paced around on the 
second floor of the residential quarters, watching the returns with First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. The President took comfort where he could find it -- as 
in the victory of Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had gone out on a limb to campaign for Robb, and the victory over 
Republican Oliver L. North "might have been the race that he cared most about 
anywhere," ventured one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 But between the brave statements, other sentiments were clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but take it personally," one aide said with a sigh. "You come 
to Washington with all these fantastic dreams of the things you're going to do. 
And you soon find out what the other side can do to close you out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had prepared for the election verdict in a customary 
fashion: It set up a war room. Extra phones and television sets were brought to 
a basement office. Political aides milled around through the night, gathering 
information, coordinating their explanations and keeping the boss briefed. 
</P>
<P>
 The President seemed outwardly cheerful as he worked through a schedule of 
economic and foreign policy meetings, last-minute election interviews and 
meetings with White House volunteers and supporters. But nothing could conceal 
his own preoccupation with the election results that would say so much about 
the future of his legislative agenda and his own prospects for reelection in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 All day, Clinton took and made phone calls to gather political information and 
eagerly perused papers showing early exit polls on the races. "Nothing got 
done," said one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seemed even a bit plaintive when he entreated White House volunteers 
in a midafternoon meeting on the South Lawn to go to the polls, as if an extra 
few hundred votes could turn the tide. "I hope all of you will go to the polls 
today," he asked them. And in a radio interview, he entreated: "It's important 
for us not to go to the polls in a negative frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House seemed to be the only place in Washington that did not set up 
an election pool -- maybe because the subject hit just a bit too close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week's trip to the Mideast, Clinton has done little to erase his 
sleep deficit -- but no one expected him to do much about it on election night. 
Some people at the White House were already thinking ahead to the coming 
session of Congress, in which the Administration's agenda is not likely to go 
far. And some White House staffers were rethinking their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are planning on leaving already. They're burned out already," said an 
aide. But the Republican sweep probably will push that trend even further, this 
official added, except for the core of Clinton loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Down to the election's final moments, the adversaries were laying the blame at 
the door of the White House. California Gov. Pete Wilson blasted away with 
charges that Clinton had "demeaned his office," not told the truth and 
"succumbed to the worst demons in his own nature." 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House was rejecting any claims that they were the central reason 
for the voters' judgment. Was this the Clinton White House's first report card? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," insisted White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. "This is about a lot 
of local issues and congressional candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ride was rough, the President did not entirely forget his manners. 
After thanking the volunteers on the South Lawn, he presided at a reception for 
several hundred Democrats who had helped with the election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And he met privately with the two passersby who two weeks ago tackled a gunman 
outside the White House as he fired an assault rifle at the building. "It's 
only too bad those guys can't help him with this one," said one aide.

EX-DETROIT MAYOR YOUNG HOSPITALIZED FOR HEART PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Mayor Coleman Young was hospitalized Tuesday after a routine visit to 
the doctor detected an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not any sort of emergency," said Young's spokesman, Bob Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I talked to him, he certainly was in good spirits, except for how the 
elections seemed to be going," Berg said of the Democrat who presided over 
Detroit for an unprecedented five terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was elected mayor in 1973. He decided not to run for reelection in 1993 
because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said Young, 76, would be hospitalized for a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was hospitalized at least twice in 1991 and 1992 for heart and 
respiratory problems.

ELECTIONS '94; ROBB DEFEATS NORTH IN VIRGINIA'S SCANDAL-SCARRED SENATE 
COMPETITION; POLITICS: INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT SURVIVES CLOSE RACE WHERE VOTERS 
DISLIKED BOTH CANDIDATES. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE WAS THE KEY TO VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Virginians, faced with what many voters regarded as a choice between bad and 
worse, said no to Republican Oliver L. North on Tuesday and allowed Democrat 
Charles S. Robb to keep his Senate seat despite a lackluster first term and 
sullied personal reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 With 99% of the vote counted, the incumbent led North 46% to 43%. Republican 
J. Marshall Coleman, running as an independent, had 11% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when many Democrats nationally went down to defeat, the outcome in 
Virginia was both an important victory for Robb's party and an ironic anomaly 
for a candidate with such vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hold your nose and vote for the one who you dislike less," said John 
McGlennon, a political scientist at the College of William and Mary. "Stick 
that clothespin on and pull the lever." 
</P>
<P>
 The race was neck and neck until the last days of the campaign, when former 
First Lady Nancy Reagan denounced North as a liar and the candidate blundered 
by attacking Social Security during an appearance at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to Robb's success was the turnout of African American voters, whose 
support of Robb soared after his longtime Democratic nemesis, former Gov. L. 
Douglas Wilder, stopped attacking him and started campaigning for him during 
the last weeks of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug Wilder has finally delivered for him," said political scientist Mark 
Rozell of Virginia's Mary Washington College. "But a Robb victory does not 
change his scandalous past. More than anything else, I see the results as a 
rejection of Oliver North. Robb could not have won reelection without opposing 
a controversial, scandal-tainted nominee like Mr. North." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Virginians were unenthusiastic -- or worse -- about both the candidates 
put forward by the major political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 North, this year's most controversial symbol of the anti-Establishment 
politician, had sought a niche in history as the first person to be elected to 
Congress in spite of a conviction for lying to it. 
</P>
<P>
 As an aide to President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, North ran the illegal 
Iran-Contra operation and was convicted of shredding classified documents, 
accepting illegal gratuities and lying to congressional investigating 
committees. Those convictions were later overturned on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, once a highly regarded governor, tarnished his reputation through 
admitted extramarital dalliances and other morally questionable behavior. After 
Virginians gave him 71% of the vote last time around, their affection for the 
son-in-law of former President Lyndon B. Johnson dwindled steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the two most unpopular party nominees in this state's history," 
said Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia. "It's 
an embarrassment. Virginia is very sensitive about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters expressed precisely the same sentiments. "Robb's the lesser of two 
evils," said Monika Talwar, 24, an information specialist for the U.S. Agency 
for International Development. "I think Robb's a sleaze. The stories about his 
character concerned me. But I'm more concerned in seeing North defeated. 
Basically, I'm strongly anti-North, and I thought this was one election where 
my vote could make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the choice," said Larry Pulliam, who wore his Air Force uniform 
to his northern Virginia polling place. "One guy was convicted for Iran-Contra, 
the other was seen at drug parties when he was governor. "If there were a 
none-of-the-above, I'd probably vote for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozell called the result a rejection of North rather than an endorsement of 
Robb. "Robb was the devil they knew," Rozell said, "but Oliver North was just 
too dangerous for most Virginia voters." 
</P>
<P>
 An elated Robb greeted his supporters at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in this 
Washington suburb Tuesday night with a throaty: "How sweet it is!" 
</P>
<P>
 After thanking abortion-rights groups, gay and lesbian organizations and 
African American groups for their support, Robb said: "This election was a very 
important message to the nation. Virginia will continue to be inclusive. 
Virginia will continue to be tolerant rather than intolerant." 
</P>
<P>
 While candidates across the nation -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- tried 
to distance themselves from President Clinton during the campaign, Robb sought 
his help -- and thanked him in his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to stand with our President," Robb said to the crowd, which roared 
loudly enough to drown out the rest of his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 North, appearing in a Richmond convention hall to concede defeat, pointedly 
offered no congratulations to Robb. Acknowledging that he felt "hurt" by the 
results, he told his supporters: "My loss is not your defeat if you will 
persevere." 
</P>
<P>
 North had been forced to campaign in the teeth of opposition from some 
prominent Republicans. Ronald Reagan expressed his indignation at North's 
campaign in a letter published early in the election season. And just 10 days 
before the election, Nancy Reagan denounced the man who had once worked for her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Ollie North has a great deal of trouble separating fact from fantasy," 
she said. "And he lied to my husband and lied about my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack from Nancy Reagan really did hurt him, mostly among Republicans 
and especially Republican women," Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the state, John W. Warner, Virginia's senior senator and 
longest-serving GOP officeholder, led the Republican opposition to North. He 
argued that even though North's 1989 conviction in the Iran-Contra scandal was 
overturned, it made him "unfit" for public service. 
</P>
<P>
 The denunciations by the Reagans and Warner helped doom North, even though he 
was endorsed by former Vice President Dan Quayle and Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.), arguably the most influential Republican of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 While North received widespread kudos for an aggressive, effective campaign, 
he sabotaged himself, according to Virginia political analysts, by suggesting 
at a senior citizens home near Roanoke that, in the future, workers should be 
able to opt out of paying Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 The North campaign's greatest success was raising more money -- $17.6 million 
-- than any other Senate campaign this year, most of it from out of state. Only 
multimillionaire Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) spent more -- $28 
million -- but nearly all of that was his own money. Robb, by contrast, raised 
$4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 North drew much of his support from the Christian Coalition and other 
conservative groups, which turned the state into a battleground for the clash 
of liberal and conservative visions of the future and the race into a 
referendum on Clinton's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Christian Coalition was extremely influential in this race," Sabato said. 
"North could not have been nominated . . . or elected without them. They were 
his bedrock base." 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable chunk of Robb's treasury came from a fund-raiser where the guest of 
honor was the President. Clinton was conspicuously absent from all other major 
campaigns in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton did not threaten Robb's chances the way he did other Democrats 
because "the President's approval rating is higher than North's or Robb's," 
McGlennon said. Polls consistently showed both men with negative ratings of 
greater than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's rising popularity helped Robb keep in the race. If the 
President's approval rating were lower than this, Robb would have been out of 
it," McGlennon added.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The major races in the Midwest: Senate races: 8 House races: 105 Governor: 9 
</P>
<P>
 Governor -- Incumbent Republican Jim Edgar quashed challenges from Democrat 
Dawn Clark Netsch, the state comptroller, and David Kelley. Edgar had held a 
huge lead in both money and poll numbers during the race. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Democrats lost two of the state's 20 seats, leaving the two parties 
with 10 seats apiece. In the most closely watched race, Republican Michael 
Flanagan, a 31-year-old Chicago lawyer, defeated 18-term veteran Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski, 66. Rostenkowski had to give up his powerful chairmanship of the 
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in June because of a 17-count 
federal indictment charging him with allegedly misusing government and campaign 
funds. INDIANA 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- GOP incumbent Richard G. Lugar won handily, defeating Democrat 
James Jontz and two other candidates. Lugar's victory placed him in line to be 
Agriculture chairman in a Republican Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Democrats had held seven of the state's 10 seats. They retained 
only four, leaving Republicans with six. IOWA 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Three-term GOP incumbent Terry E. Branstad beat state Attorney 
General Bonnie J. Campbell after squeaking past a tough primary challenge from 
Rep. Fred Grandy, "Gopher" of TV's "Love Boat," who refused to endorse Branstad 
and whose wife endorsed Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Republicans captured all five of the state's seats, adding one more 
representative than they had in the 103rd Congress. KANSAS 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Republican Bill Graves defeated Rep. Jim Slattery for the office 
of Democratic Gov. Joan Finney, who did not seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- The state's four seats had been evenly split between Democrats and 
the GOP. But on Tuesday, Republicans captured all four. MICHIGAN 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Republican incumbent John Engler -- after cutting property 
taxes, balancing the budget, revamping school financing and basking in the 
benefits of a buoyant auto industry -- won a second term over former Democratic 
Rep. Howard Wolpe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Spencer Abraham, a deputy chief of staff for former Vice President 
Dan Quayle, defeated nine-term Rep. Bob Carr to claim the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle for the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Of the state's 16 seats, 10 had been held by Democrats. In 
Tuesday's voting, only seven had gone to Democrats at press time. Six were in 
the hands of the GOP, and the remaining three had yet had to be decided. 
MINNESOTA 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Republican incumbent Arne Carlson, a fiscal conservative who 
supports legal abortion and gay rights, won a second term over Democratic state 
Sen. John Marty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Republican Rod Grams defeated Democrat Ann Wynia, a former state 
legislative leader, to capture the seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Dave 
Durenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Of eight seats in the state, six were held by Democrats. At press 
time Tuesday, five had gone Democratic and two Republican, with one still 
undecided. MISSOURI 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Two-term Gov. John Ashcroft, who campaigned on congressional 
reform and his commitment to the death penalty, kept the seat of retiring Sen. 
John Danforth in Republican hands. Democratic Rep. Alan Wheat had hoped to 
become the state's first black senator. Wheat had 86 overdrafts at the House 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- The state's nine representatives remain as they were: six 
Democratic and three Republican. Former Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt was 
reelected. NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Incumbent Democrat Ben Nelson won against Gene Spence. Nelson 
was so far ahead of Spence a week before the election that the Republican 
virtually conceded, putting his chances of winning at 100 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Retired phone company executive Jan Stoney was unable to use 
President Clinton's unpopularity in her long-shot bid to oust first-term 
Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey. Kerrey, well liked in Nebraska, is seen as a thorn 
in Clinton's side, despite his vote for the President's 1993 budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Republicans, who had held two of the state's three seats, won all 
three on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other -- Voters decided term limits for members of Congress and state 
offices. NORTH DAKOTA 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- First-term Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad defeated Ben Clayburgh, a 
Republican orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- In a state where no House member has lost a reelection bid since 
1966, freshman Democratic Rep. Earl Pomeroy fought off an aggressive challenge

while the Democrat lashed back at him for signing the GOP's "Contract with 
America" in Washington. OHIO 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- GOP incumbent George V. Voinovich coasted to an overwhelming 
victory over Democrat Robert Burch Jr. and Billy Inmon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Republican Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine won the state's open seat, dashing 
the hopes of legal clinic founder Joel Hyatt to inherit the seat of his 
father-in-law, Democrat Howard Metzenbaum. DeWine, 47, is a former prosecutor, 
state senator and congressman. The father of eight considered dropping out of 
the race after one of his daughters was killed in a car accident last year. He 
is the first Republican senator from Ohio since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Democrats lost four of the 10 seats they had held, leaving them 
with six of the state's 19 and Republicans with the remaining 13. SOUTH DAKOTA 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Former GOP Gov. William J. Janklow won his comeback bid against 
Democrat Jim Beddow, the former president of Dakota Wesleyan University. As 
governor from 1979 to 1987, Janklow gained a reputation as an abrasive and 
sometimes dictatorial administrator who nonetheless got things done. State law 
prevented him from seeking a third consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Incumbent Democrat Tim Johnson defeated Republican Jan Berkhout and 
Ronald Wieczorek for the state's only seat. WISCONSIN 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- The GOP's Tommy Thompson turned back Democrat Chuck Chvala and 
three others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Milwaukee Bucks team owner Herb Kohl, the Democratic incumbent, 
slam-dunked GOP state Sen. Robert Welch. Kohl, a retailing tycoon with cash to 
burn, won while taking no political action committee money and making that an 
advertising theme. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- At press time, six of the state's nine seats were Republican and 
two were Democratic, with the remaining seat still undecided. Previously, five 
were Republican and four were Democratic.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The major races in the East: Senate races: 11 House races: 100 Governor: 11 
</P>
<P>
 Governor -- Republican John G. Rowland narrowly defeated Democrat William E. 
Curry Jr. despite losing support because of his efforts to keep confidential a 
police report of a nonviolent dispute with his ex-wife. Rowland will succeed 
retiring Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Incumbent Democrat Joseph I. Lieberman handily defeated Republican 
opponent Jerry Labriola for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Six seats, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. GOP 
Rep. Gary Franks won despite charges by his opponent, Democrat James Maloney, 
that he is out of touch with his constituents. Franks is the only black 
Republican in Congress and his district is 90% white. Incumbent Democratic Rep. 
Sam Gejdenson claimed victory with 80% of the votes counted, but both he and 
his opponent, Republican Edward Munster, agreed that a recount was likely. 
DELAWARE 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Republican William Roth Jr., already the longest-serving statewide 
officeholder in Delaware history, won his fifth term with a victory over 
Attorney General Charles M. Oberly III.

Democrat Carol DeSantis and two others for the state's only seat. DISTRICT OF

Andrews in the battle to succeed retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- The state's two seats, held by Snowe and Andrews, were close. 
Democrat John Baldacci edged out Republican Richard Bennett. The race between 
Democrat Dennis Dutremble and Republican James Longley too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other -- Voters approved a ballot measure to restrict the terms of 
congressional officials. The state's voters had previously approved term limits 
for state lawmakers. MARYLAND 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Democrat Parris Glendening and Republican Ellen Sauerbrey were 
battling in an extremely tight race that was too close to call. Despite a 2-1 
party registration advantage for Glendening, Sauerbrey waged a surprisingly 
strong campaign. Each candidate garnered close to half the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Incumbent Democrat Paul S. Sarbanes easily won reelection over the 
GOP's William Brock, a former senator from Tennessee who was labeled a 
carpetbagger.

Democrat Mark Roosevelt, a state legislator who is the great-grandson of 
Theodore Roosevelt.

Democrat Edward M. Kennedy was reelected to his seventh term after a 
hard-fought campaign against Republican businessman Mitt Romney.

 * House -- 10 seats. Democrats kept their stranglehold on the delegation by 
retaining eight seats. Two Republican incumbents, Peter Blute and Peter 
Torkildsen, held their districts. Democrats Barney Frank and Joseph Kennedy 
were uncontested, while Democrats Edward J. Markey and Gerry E. Studds easily 
won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other -- Voters passed a ballot measure to restrict the terms of elected 
officials. NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- GOP incumbent Steve Merrill won a second term, defeating 
Democrat state Sen. Wayne King. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Two seats. Incumbent Republican William H. Zeliff Jr. retained his 
seat, and Republican Charles Bass captured the seat held by Democrat Dick 
Swett, who campaigned in a bullet-proof vest after receiving several threats 
over his vote to ban assault weapons. NEW JERSEY 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Incumbent Democrat Frank R. Lautenberg fought off a stiff 
challenge from Republican state Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian to 
win a third term. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Of the state's 13 seats, eight were won by Republicans and five by 
Democrats, who had a net loss of two seats. Longtime Democratic Rep. Robert 
Torricelli retained his seat. NEW YORK 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Republican challenger George Pataki, in a stunning upset, 
narrowly defeated 12-year incumbent Democrat Mario M. Cuomo in one of the 
nation's most closely watched gubernatorial races. Cuomo surged ahead of 
Pataki, a state legislator, after receiving the endorsement of New York City 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, but was unable to retain his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan was reelection, 
defeating GOP challenger Bernadette Castro and four others. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- 31 seats. Democrats had a net loss of at least two seat, dropping 
to 15, with Republicans capturing 15, up from 13, and one race was yet 
undecided. Incumbent Democrat Charles E. Schumer easily defeated Republican 
James McCall, while Democrat Hamilton Fish Jr. lost to Republican Sue Kelly in 
a district once held by his Republican father and grandfather. PENNSYLVANIA 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Republican Rep. Tom Ridge defeated Democrat Mark Singel, the 
state's lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Republican Rick Santorum ousted incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford 
in one of the nation's most closely watched Senate races. The election was one 
of the few that offered a clear choice, between Santorum, a young Reagan 
conservative, and Wofford, a liberal former aide to President John F. Kennedy. 
Wofford had defeated former Republican Gov. Dick Thornburgh in a special 1991 
election, after Sen. John Heinz was killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Of the state's 21 seats, 11 went to Democrats and 10 to 
Republicans, with each party gaining one seat. First-term Democratic incumbent

she was defeated by Republican Jon Fox. RHODE ISLAND

two-term state Sen. Myrth York, who had ousted Gov. Bruce Sundlun in the 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- GOP incumbent John H. Chafee coasted to a fourth term, defeating 
Democratic challenger Linda Kushner. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Two seats. Democrat Patrick Kennedy, son of U.S. Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), easily won against Republican Kevin Vigilante, gaining a 
seat for the Democrats. Incumbent Democrat John F. Reed defeated GOP challenger 
A. John Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other -- Voters approved, by a 2-1 margin, a ballot measure to allow casino 
gambling in the state. VERMONT 
</P>
<P>
 * Governor -- Incumbent Democrat Howard Dean, considered the nation's most 
popular governor, won reelection in a race that was never seriously in doubt. 
He defeated the GOP's David Kelley and six other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Republican Sen. James Jeffords won a second term, defeating state 
Sen. Jan Backus, who campaigned as an ordinary mom hoping to return the Senate 
to ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- One seat. Independent incumbent Bernie Sanders was in a tight race 
with Republican John Carroll and the winner was too close to call. WEST 
VIRGINIA 
</P>
<P>
 * Senate -- Incumbent Democrat Robert C. Byrd overwhelmingly won reelection, 
defeating Republican Stan Klos. 
</P>
<P>
 * House -- Three seats, all held by Democrats, were retained by the

upstart challenger Ted Dang, a real estate developer, while in San Diego, Paul 
Pfingst appeared headed for victory over Larry Stirling in a bid to become the 
first new district attorney in 24 years, results in prominent local California 
elections showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 San Franciscans, meanwhile, were approving two companion initiatives designed 
to remove the homeless from their downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland mayoral race divided a city beset by daunting troubles and 
wondering whether drastic change is needed at the highest level -- even if it 
means ending an 18-year reign of African American leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is still reeling from the 1989 earthquake and the 1991 fire, as well 
as chronic crime and economic woes. But political leaders in the city's African 
American community had warned that if Dang was elected, it would erode hard-won 
political gains at a time when the city is on the brink of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris 47, a former three-term assemblyman, is seen as a savvy, energetic 
mayor. But he has offended some constituents with what they feel is an 
impatient and condescending air. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang, 43, the son of Chinese immigrants, burst onto the political scene in the 
June primary, casting himself as a businessman who would trim city government, 
work with business and add police. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that an African American could be toppled by an Asian American 
in the state's largest city with an African American plurality has been viewed 
as a sign of just how multicultural the city has become. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Proposition M -- yet another attempt by the city to clear 
its sidewalks of homeless people -- calls for a ban on people lying or sitting 
on commercial district sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion measure, Proposition N, would require recipients of general 
assistance to spend a major part of their grants on housing -- for which the 
funds already are intended. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, the race for district attorney pitted Pfingst, 43, who 
won popularity as one of the city's highest-profile prosecutors before going 
into private practice, against Stirling, 52, a municipal judge who previously 
served as a San Diego city councilman, assemblyman and state senator. Edwin L. 
Miller Jr. lost his reelection bid in June after serving 24 years as San 
Diego's district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In other local races around California: 
</P>
<P>
 * Berkeley voters were choosing from 19 City Council candidates; Thomas 
Burcham, an attorney and co-owner of a delicatessen, was trailing in the race 
after flaunting himself as the first candidate in 25 years to run for the 
nonpartisan seat as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 * In San Bernardino County, a mud-slinging race for district attorney found 
Dennis Stout, a deputy prosecutor and the mayor of Rancho Cucamonga, ahead of 
San Bernardino City Atty. James Penman. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Bay Area city of Albany, the City Council was winning voter support 
to approve a card room beneath the grandstands of Golden Gate Fields racetrack 
because gambling revenue is needed by the city to help offset a $600,000 
municipal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Fresno -- where the population has nearly tripled since the last new high 
school opened in 1962 -- a $215-million school construction bond issue appeared 
short of winning a two-thirds majority approval. Previous efforts to approve 
new school construction funds have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Sacramento, Robbie Waters was leading in his bid for a seat on the City 
Council, banking on a colorful and mostly illustrious 28-year career as a local 
lawman, including a stint as county sheriff. His tenure, however, was marred by 
an arrest for drunk driving in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Alpine County, where there was a tie in the June county sheriff's 
election, two candidates were hoping that electoral lightning would not strike 
twice. Incumbent Sheriff Henry (Skip) Veatch and challenger Villa (Lew) Roper, 
a California Highway Patrol officer, each got 276 votes in that first election. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Santa Cruz, voters rebuked a 24-year-old City Council candidate known 
simply as Rodent who campaigned as "the other white meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Rodent's campaign promises: to change the color of police uniforms to 
orange and purple and to introduce restrictions on people who wear Spandex.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; CRIME KEY ISSUE IN SANTA MONICA; THREE CANDIDATES 
ENDORSED BY THE POLICE UNION LEAD IN EARLY RETURNS. IN OTHER LOCAL RACES, 
INGLEWOOD CHOOSES AMONG THREE CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Early returns from Santa Monica showed three City Council candidates endorsed 
by the police union leading in a race in which public safety was the central 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead in the early returns were incumbent Robert T. Holbrook, his slate mate, 
Deputy City Atty. Ruth Ebner and urban planner Pam O'Connor. O'Connor ran on a 
competing slate but, like Holbrook and Ebner, was backed by the police union. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with much of the vote yet to be counted, the election was too close 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's was one of a handful of local elections in Los Angeles County 
on Tuesday. Voters there chose between dueling visions of how their town should 
handle crime and homeless problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of seven City Council seats were up for grabs in the beach community. 
Elsewhere, three candidates vied for the mayor's office in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica race featured two three-person slates and five independent 
candidates. At issue was control of the city's political landscape, long 
dominated by a liberal, rent-control political organization, Santa Monicans for 
Renters Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was viewed as vulnerable this fall, in large part because of public 
anger about crime and the city's past policies toward the homeless. Many 
citizens -- and some candidates -- linked those issues, complaining that a 
lenient official policy toward the homeless had attracted a transient 
population that has not only overtaxed Santa Monica's resources but also 
spurred lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last year, the city has enacted a series of get-tough policies 
concerning the homeless, such as closing parks overnight. Running on a platform 
that would continue that trend was a three-member slate headed by Holbrook and 
backed by a residents' group, Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and his slate-mates, Ebner and labor lawyer Matthew Kanny, promised a 
get-tough approach on crime and safety in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 The competing slate, backed by the renters rights group, also proclaimed 
itself the city's crime-fighting team. The leader of the slate, City Councilman 
Tony Vazquez, has stressed attention to underlying social problems that could 
lead to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on his slate were O'Connor and artist Bruria Finkel. Chiming in with its 
opinion, the local police officers union targeted Vazquez as being anti-public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vazquez slate was hoping that a last-minute surge of opposition to 
Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration measure, would energize its 
liberal voter constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are hoping that a Santa Monica school bond measure will not be a 
casualty of voter discontent in a city that has never rejected such measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the anti-politician fervor that has dominated much of this year's 
campaign rhetoric, Inglewood voters were picking from among three candidates 
for mayor -- incumbent Edward Vincent and City Council members Judith Dunlap 
and Garland Hardeman.

MCDONALD'S IN MEXICO CITY VANDALIZED BY PROP. 187 FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of masked men attacked a McDonald's restaurant in Mexico City on 
Tuesday in protest of Proposition 187, the California initiative to cut public 
benefits for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 30 and 40 men broke windows, threw cash registers to the floor, 
overturned wastebaskets and scrawled anti-U.S. graffiti inside the restaurant 
in the fashionable Zona Rosa area of the capital, McDonald's marketing manager 
Manuel Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yankee Go Home," "Solidarity With the Immigrants" and "No to 187" were among 
the messages scrawled on restaurant windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said some of the assailants had punk-style dyed hair and had held a 
protest earlier against Proposition 187 on the street outside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the franchise bears a U.S. trademark, Juarez said, it is owned and 
staffed by Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has sparked a bitter response from virtually all sectors of 
Mexican society. Nearly all mainstream Mexican newspapers condemned the measure 
as a racist proposal.

2 BORDER AGENTS HURT AS SUSPECT FLEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Border Patrol agents remained hospitalized Tuesday in serious but stable 
condition after suffering severe head injuries when a suspected drug smuggler 
crashed his pickup truck across the border into Mexico on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged smuggler first rammed a Border Patrol vehicle, injuring the agent 
inside.He then crashed his pickup through a border gate, which swung wildly and 
struck a second agent standing nearby, said Border Patrol spokeswoman Ann 
Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents, whose names were not released, were in intensive care Tuesday at 
Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent in the four-wheel-drive vehicle suffered head and neck injuries, and 
the other agent suffered a concussion, a fractured neck and a gash on his head 
that required 70 stitches, Summers said.

U.N. SETS UP WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN RWANDA KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Security Council voted Tuesday to set up an international tribunal for 
genocide in Rwanda, despite objections from the new Rwandan government that the 
court won't be able to sentence to death those found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he would propose 
sending troops to restore order in refugee camps on the Zaire border and try to 
persuade the more than 1 million Rwandans living there to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwandan government voted against the tribunal because the resolution set 
life imprisonment as the maximum sentence, reflecting the Security Council's 
discomfort with capital punishment. Rwanda's ambassador to the Security 
Council, Manzi Bakuramutsa, said the lack of a death penalty meant the tribunal 
"would only appease the conscience of the international community, rather than 
respond to the expectations of the Rwandan people." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Rwanda's cooperation, U.N. officials said, it would be difficult to 
convict those responsible for the ethnic and political slaughter that left 
about half a million dead in the Central African nation.

BARRY ELECTED MAYOR OF NATION'S CAPITAL; WASHINGTON: HIS VICTORY OVER STRONG 
GOP CHALLENGER COMPLETES HIS COMEBACK FROM A FEDERAL DRUG CONVICTION FOR 
COCAINE POSSESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Mayor Marion S. Barry, in a stunning comeback from a 1990 federal drug 
conviction, regained his role as chief executive of the nation's capital city, 
defeating an unexpectedly strong showing by Republican challenger Carol 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by supporters at the Washington Convention Center late Tuesday, he 
invited all segments of the city's diverse population to "join me in rebuilding 
Washington together." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the time to forget about yesterday," he said, referring both to his 
own troubled past and to the deep political divisions that have developed in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to the City Council two years ago after being released from prison in 
1992, he built on his base by reaching out to the young, the poor and other 
groups that had never before voted in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Having handily defeated his successor, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, in the 
Democratic primary in September, Barry had been considered a shoo-in in 
Tuesday's general election over Schwartz, a white accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwartz apparently drew stronger support than expected from Republican 
and independent voters, as well as from crossover Democrats, some of whom said 
Barry's election would be an embarrassment to the nation's capital. The 
capital, however, has never had a white mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his victory in the Democratic primary, Barry told white voters to 
"get over" any negative feelings they had due to the six-month prison term he 
served for cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit hard at the theme of "redemption" in his campaign, once telling a group 
of former drug offenders that their votes could help him change the district's 
corrections and parole system. Barry said he had overcome his addiction to 
cocaine and promised to resign from office if he regressed. But he said he 
would not pledge to take periodic drug tests, calling them meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz matched Barry in the vigor of her own campaign. Her theme was that 
Barry had caused many of the fiscal and social problems that he was offering to 
solve, and that his failures had hurt many of the same people whom he was 
asking for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic incident that gained national attention, Barry had been 
photographed in an FBI sting operation smoking crack in a Washington hotel room 
with a former girlfriend who was cooperating with authorities. That videotape, 
played for jurors at his subsequent trial and shown to television viewers 
nationwide, alienated many jurors in the belief that the then-Republican 
federal Establishment had sought to discredit one of the nation's most 
prominent black politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was considered a defeat for U.S. prosecutors, a jury convicted Barry 
of only one of 14 drug-related charges, a misdemeanor drug possession. It 
cleared him of a second drug charge but failed to reach a verdict on 12 other 
counts, including three felony charges of lying to a grand jury.

GOP 'DAVID' KNOCKS OFF 'GOLIATH' ROSTENKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As his machine sputtered out and his foot soldiers stood by helplessly, 
embattled Democratic Rep. Dan Rostenkowski suffered a veteran ward heeler's 
ultimate indignity Tuesday, turned out of office by a novice Republican 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a federal trial on misuse of government funds and forced to give up his 
coveted post as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee after he was 
indicted in May, the 18-term congressman had depended, as always, on his 
vaunted north Chicago political organization to deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a rain-swept night in a northwest storefront, Rostenkowski's precinct 
captains and ward walkers came back empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 With 99% of the 5th District's vote counted late Tuesday, Michael Patrick 
Flanagan defeated Rostenkowski 55% to 45%. Four hours after the polls closed, 
Rostenkowski conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go back to Washington and clean out my desk," Rostenkowski, 66, 
told a roomful of stunned campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled grimly as he entered and tugged at his ear as he spoke. "I've stood 
for election in primaries and November elections almost 45 times. This is the 
first time I've had to concede defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, a 31-year-old contract lawyer almost unknown in Republican circles, 
had waged a lonely campaign for months, knocking on doors in Rostenkowski's 
strongholds and in suburban bedroom communities more friendly to his quixotic 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's political surrogates -- the aldermen and precinct captains who 
had served him well for decades -- boasted that they would carry the ball for 
him as they had always done. But "our boys and girls," as 36th Ward Alderman 
William (Billy) Banks called his troops, could not stem the voters' 
disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 34 years, he did so much for the city," said Thomas McDarrah, one of the 
congressman's inner circle. "These voters are stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan said Tuesday night that voters' concerns over taxes and weariness 
with pork-barrel politics were the most decisive factors in his victory. He did 
not mention Rostenkowski's legal troubles. Within weeks of winning the 
Democratic primary in April, Rostenkowski was indicted on 17 counts of 
embezzlement, fraud and witness-tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan's campaign had seemed to generate little enthusiasm until recent 
weeks, when an internal poll by the Republican National Committee indicated 
Rostenkowski was in trouble. The RNC infused Flanagan's cash-poor campaign with 
a $55,000 donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Rostenkowski, who had not campaigned and whose headquarters did 
not even answer its telephone, rushed back to Chicago to announce a last-minute 
federal grant to stem erosion at the Chicago lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was that very ability to dispense the goods that seemed to prove 
Rostenkowski's undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pork has not served this district well," Flanagan said recently, motioning to 
a campaign sign that showed a photograph of Rostenkowski over a caption that 
read: "1994 Term Limits Poster Child."

IN NEW YORK, CUOMO LOSES TO ONCE-OBSCURE CHALLENGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a national symbol of liberalism, failed Tuesday in his 
bid for a fourth term in office, falling to Republican state Sen. George E. 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 With 93% of the vote counted, Pataki had 1,833,234, or 48%, to 1,735,574, or 
46%, for Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I congratulate George Pataki," Cuomo said in his concession speech. "It was 
indeed a long and a tough struggle. George Pataki is the next governor of the 
state of New York. We will all work with him and respect him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had great plans for this state in the coming years, and I have great hopes 
for her still," Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki told his supporters that "we are going to begin a new positive era for 
the people of this state. Be happy! Tonight we won a victory for all New York. 
Tonight, the people of this state spoke loudly and clearly. They want change, 
and let me tell you something, as your governor you are going to get that 
change . . . We are going to cut the taxes. We are going to change the criminal 
justice system of this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki said that his patron, Republican U.S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, "had 
suffered unfair attacks" during the campaign. The governor-elect happily quoted 
one of Cuomo's commercials that sought to tie him with D'Amato. "You can call 
me Al," he told cheering supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki, who started the campaign as an obscure 49-year-old legislator from 
Peekskill, built a winning platform of support with a pledge to restore the 
death penalty, to slash government spending and to cut state taxes by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 How obscure was he? When the Republicans selected Pataki at their state 
convention in May, one New York City tabloid ran the headline, "What is a 
Pataki?" Pataki, the son of a mailman who attended Yale University and Columbia 
Law School on scholarships, was handpicked by D'Amato, who jubilantly declared 
that the voters sent a resounding message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they said, clearly, enough is enough. They're sick and tired of being 
taken for granted and being overtaxed and being underrepresented and having a 
criminal justice system that failed them," D'Amato said. "They don't feel safe 
in their neighborhoods. They want workfare, not welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki toppled a a towering figure in the Democratic Party, whose keynote 
address electrified the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco in 
1984. That speech propelled him into the front ranks of potential presidential 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, the governor flirted with running for the White 
House but never entered the fray. He also turned down a chance to become a U.S. 
Supreme Court justice, declaring that he preferred to remain leader of the 
Empire State. 
</P>
<P>
 The election was marked by a pitched battle between voters in New York City, 
who strongly supported Cuomo, and upstate residents, who cast their ballots for 
Pataki. By a 2-to-1 margin, voters told exit pollsters that Cuomo was in office 
too long. Blacks overwhelmingly backed the governor, as did Jewish voters. But 
other white voters favored Pataki, who ran particularly well among white 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of voters said they wanted the death penalty restored, and by 2 
to 1 they voted for Pataki. Cuomo is an opponent of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo strategists had hoped that conservative businessman B. Thomas Golisano, 
who was running as an independent, would cut into Pataki's upstate margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hopes received a boost last weekend when the 52-year-old Rochester 
businessman, who sought the governorship as the candidate of the Independence 
Fusion Party and who vowed to spend $10 million of his own funds on the 
contest, received the backing of Ross Perot, an independent presidential 
candidate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot praised Golisano's campaign as "electroshock therapy to the political 
system" and said Golisano's third party would be a "tangible signal to Albany 
and Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pataki dominated the key upstate precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 A key event in the bitterly contested election was the endorsement of Cuomo by 
New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, prompting Pataki to lash 
out that the mayor was a "back-stabber." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pataki pledged he would work with Giuliani in an effort to 
blunt fears among city voters of a feud that could harm the city's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 After Giuliani's backing, which also earned the wrath of D'Amato, the contest 
tightened in polls. President Clinton also appeared with Cuomo and called him a 
"national treasure." A parade of Cabinet members visited the state to reinforce 
that message. 
</P>
<P>
 To no avail, Cuomo and Giuliani mounted a large get-out-the-vote drive, 
especially in New York City. Election Day was a civic holiday, and state and 
city employees were enlisted on their own time in the vote-getting effort. New 
York City's largest municipal union sent a letter to its 130,000 members urging 
them to reelect Cuomo. The union fielded 3,400 volunteers to help voters get to 
the polls. Volunteers staffing phone banks made about 4 million calls on behalf 
of the governor in the closing days of the race.

GOP'S RISING TIDE SPILLS OVER TO STATEHOUSES; POLITICS: PARTY TAKES CONTROL OF 
MAJORITY OF GOVERNORSHIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1970. DEMOCRATS LOSE NEW 
YORK, TEXAS AND PENNSYLVANIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democrats' Debacle '94 extended to statehouses across the nation Tuesday 
as Republicans stormed to a majority of governorships for the first time since 
1970, ousting liberal icon Mario M. Cuomo in New York and capturing control in 
every other major state but Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans seized Democratic-held governorships in New York, Texas, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and Wyoming 
-- and retained the electoral-vote-rich states of California, Illinois, 
Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major states, only Florida remained in Democratic hands, although by a 
razor-thin margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland race was too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 The gubernatorial balance of power at the beginning of the day Tuesday was 
Democrats 29, Republicans 19 and independents 2. As the polls closed, it 
appeared that Republicans would be in power in at least 30 states, a dramatic 
turnaround that surpassed even optimistic GOP projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP gains, coupled with the expected reelections of most of their sitting 
governors, give the GOP an opportunity to advance its tax-slashing, 
welfare-cutting, crime-throttling agenda in places where policy is likely to be 
made in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the looming prospect of sclerosis in Washington, the states will become 
increasingly important as hothouses of social and fiscal policy as popular 
Republican incumbents and energetic newcomers try to make good on their 
conservative campaign pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, Democratic Gov. Ann Richards was beaten by businessman and Texas 
Rangers managing partner George W. Bush, son of former President George Bush, 
despite her undiminished personal appeal and matchless campaign style. 
Anti-incumbent fever, paired with deep disenchantment with President Clinton 
and Democratic Party policies, were too much for her to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, 61, also suffered from a huge gender gap in the voting: Women 
supported Richards by 53% to 47%, while male voters backed Bush 57% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Texans can dream, Texans can do," said Bush, 48, looking like his father 
as he celebrated his victory. "Texas is ready for a new generation of 
leadership and I will provide it." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the end of the world," Richards said. "It is the end of a 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Tom Ridge upset Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark S. 
Singel, using crime as a cudgel. Singel's campaign struggled after the 
revelation that, as head of the state Board of Pardons, he had recommended 
parole for a prisoner who is now charged with rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP seized six other statehouses from the Democrats, according to partial 
results. In Oklahoma, former U.S. Atty. Frank Keating defeated Democratic Lt. 
Gov. Jack Mildren; in Tennessee, Rep. Don Sundquist defeated Nashville Mayor 
Phil Bredesen; in New Mexico, Republican businessman Gary Johnson knocked off 
Democratic Gov. Bruce King; in Wyoming, GOP state Sen. Jim Geringer defeated 
Democratic Secretary of State Kathy Karpan; in Rhode Island, former federal 
prosecutor Lincoln Almond beat Democratic state Sen. Myrth York and, in Kansas, 
GOP Secretary of State Bill Graves defeated Rep. Jim Slattery. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP statehouse gains promise to play a role in presidential politics in 
1996, giving Republicans an organizational and fund-raising advantage in 
critical regions, while burnishing the presidential or vice presidential 
prospects of California's Pete Wilson, William F. Weld of Massachusetts, George 
V. Voinovich of Ohio, John Engler of Michigan and some newer faces. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few bright spots for Democrats was Florida, where 64-year-old 
Lawton Chiles fought off a furious challenge by real estate developer Jeb Bush, 
another son of the former President. The race, like many others across the 
nation, turned on the question of who was toughest on crime, with Bush, 41, 
accusing Chiles of being insufficiently energetic in his advocacy of the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Democrats held their seats in Georgia, Colorado, Nevada, Arkansas, 
Nebraska and Vermont. The party also retained the open Statehouse in Oregon 
when John Kitzhaber defeated Republican Denny Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia incumbent Zell Miller, who was identified by his opponent, businessman 
Guy Millner, as a virtual clone of the President, won a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who gave a nominating speech for Clinton at the Democrats' 1992 
convention, moved as far to the right as he could, all but repudiating his 
support for Clinton and sounding every inch a Republican as he sought to save 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Gov. Roy Romer won easily over his Republican challenger, millionaire 
oilman Bruce Benson. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic officials acknowledged that they had been swamped by a Republican 
and anti-incumbent tide but attributed some of their losses to population 
shifts in the South and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the Southern races there's been a demographic trend over 10 to 20 
years, a changing nature of the electorate as retirees from the Midwest move 
down. The region has become much more competitive than it ever was. It's not 
like the old days when Democrats had a lock," said Doug Richardson, chairman of 
the Democratic Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the deep animosity toward career politicians in the close races 
in New York and New Mexico, where 12-year Democratic incumbents Cuomo and King 
were crushed. In Iowa, Republican Terry E. Branstad won reelection after a 
rough primary and a stiff challenge from state Atty. Gen. Bonnie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional concerns drove many of the races, with Republican incumbents in the 
Midwest benefiting from strong economies and Democratic officeholders in the 
West suffering from the unpopularity of Clinton's land-use policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican incumbents in the Midwest were easy winners: Ohio's Voinovich, 
Engler of Michigan, Jim Edgar of Illinois, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and 
Arne Carlson of Minnesota. All are likely to play some role in GOP presidential 
politics in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few Republican incumbent governors who faced a tough challenge was 
Fife Symington of Arizona, who faced charges of involvement in a failed savings 
and loan. He overcame a large early lead in the campaign by grocery chain owner 
Eddie Basha and retained the governorship on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Mexico, a third-party candidate helped spoil the reelection hopes of 
King, a 70-year-old Democrat and rancher who lost to Johnson, a 41-year-old 
rancher and Republican newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico Green Party candidate Roberto Mondragon, 54, who once served as 
lieutenant governor under King, siphoned off about 10% of the vote -- much of 
that coming from the largely Latino northern sections of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Louis Sahagun in Denver, researcher Lianne Hart in Austin, 
Tex., and special correspondent Mike Clary in Miami contributed to this story.

HOUSE SPEAKER FOLEY TRAILS GOP OPPONENT IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY and DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in eastern Washington appeared poised to hand Republicans a prize 
trophy late Tuesday by toppling Democratic House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and 
electing his Republican challenger, 50-year-old George Nethercutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's apparent defeat marked the first time since 1862, when Pennsylvanians 
voted out Galusha Grow, that a House Speaker has been ousted from the job by 
voters in his own district. 
</P>
<P>
 With 67% of the vote counted and returns from some of the 5th Congressional 
District's Republican-leaning rural areas still to come, Nethercutt was leading 
by 51% to Foley's 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington voters had returned Foley, 65, to the nation's capital 15 times 
since 1964. In 1989, the reserved and cerebral Democrat who has consistently 
shied from partisan wrangling became Speaker and second in line to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, it became apparent that even if he won reelection, voters 
outside Foley's district would deny him his job as Speaker. Republican 
candidates on Tuesday won victory in such numbers that Democrats were losing 
their control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 While not conceding the election, a somber Foley emerged shortly after 9 p.m. 
Tuesday to offer his reaction to the Republicans' apparent success in regaining 
control of both houses of Congress. "It will be, I think, unfortunate if the 
result of this election is more a sense of frustration, more a sense of 
gridlock and indecision that is still at the heart of public dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before, a relaxed and buoyant Nethercutt had told an exultant crowd of 
supporters: "This is an historic moment. Republicans are taking the lead all 
across this country, and we're not going to stop at the borders of Washington 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Offering something short of a victory speech, Nethercutt added: "We're poised 
and ready to go forward, to make it better, to have a new direction in the 
government, a new direction in Congress. I hope to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Foley will likely turn his gavel over to Georgia Republican Newt 
Gingrich, a fiery partisan who helped lead his party toward House control for 
the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, who had been criticized in the House for his unwillingness to engage in 
fierce battles with Republicans, remained courtly to the end. At a rally on the 
eve of the election, the jowly, white-haired Speaker told The Times: "I'm sick 
and tired of the negativism and the pessimism." 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters emerging from the polls acknowledged that they stand to lose 
considerable clout in Congress with the departure of Foley. But in a political 
year of incendiary voter anger, eastern Washington residents said they were 
intent on sending a new and untested politician to represent them on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast between Nethercutt and Foley could not have been greater. 
Nethercutt is a Spokane attorney and former county Republican Party chairman 
who has never held public office. He has vowed to voters that he would not 
serve in the House more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Speaker of the House of Representatives, Foley became the most visible 
exemplar of a party and an institution under attack nationally for its 
entrenched power. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Foley filed suit against the state of Washington to annul a law 
that would have limited House members' service to six years and Senate members' 
service to 12 years. The measure won 52% of the popular vote, but Foley 
contended it was unconstitutional. In February, Foley won the suit, delivering 
a significant defeat to proponents of term limits. But the Speaker's legal 
crusade appeared to mark him as the ultimate career politician, arrogant and 
aloof from voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Such perceptions had put Foley as far as 18 points behind Nethercutt during 
the campaign. Foley returned to his district as an underdog, and played the 
part to the hilt.

DANA PARSONS: THE $300,000 QUESTION: DID YOU LIKE HITTING THE JACKPOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish I had a gumdrop for every time someone walked up to me and said, 
"Zounds, man, why so glum?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the answers given over the years, never have I said, "If you must know, 
I recently came into a large sum of money. It has me quite upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, I have never come into a large sum of money, but even if I had, I 
promise you it would not have bummed me out. Until now, the only thought I've 
given to the subject is that should I ever hit it big, I wouldn't tell any 
friends or relatives. Let them figure out for themselves why I suddenly became 
more petty and hateful. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that reaction to be nearly universal, imagine my surprise to read 
that four university researchers, including one each from Cal State Fullerton 
and UC Irvine, got federal grants to study what happens to people who hit a 
lottery jackpot. Talk about hitting the jackpot, the researchers got $300,000 
from the National Science Foundation to finance a project until 1997, during 
which the research team will interview about 200 people who won at least 
$100,000 and another 200 who won smaller prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 (Initial reports are that the researchers were very happy to receive the 
$300,000.) Just wondering: Could this be a preview of Chapter 1 of their 
findings? 
</P>
<P>
 The study hopes to delve into the largely unexplored questions of how sudden 
wealth affects a person's attitude, health, happiness and spending habits. I 
have no insider information, but put me down for $2 on the line that says all 
of those things will be improved by winning $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the researchers' curiosity about how spending habits change, they 
plan to look at winners' dining-out habits. "We'll ask people how often they 
went out to eat before they won, and then how much they went out to eat 
afterward," Cal State Fullerton psychology professor Michael Birnbaum was 
quoted as saying. The context for that will be to see if revised spending 
habits lead to lifestyle changes that could bring on stress. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also will ask the jackpot winners if, for example, they intend 
to quit their jobs or take big vacations. Then, the study will keep track of 
them to see if they follow through on their stated plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the public will have the patience to wait for those results is unknown 
at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't stop there, however. The study also will examine how the big bucks 
affect the way the nouveau riche make decisions, according to Birnbaum. There's 
a whole theory surrounding that, too, but believe me, you wouldn't be 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 If your response so far is that this is a practical joke, it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum explained the project by saying that everybody talks about what 
happens to people who hit it big, but that there isn't much research available. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be a wet blanket, but there is a fairly obvious reason for that. 
Birnbaum may not like the answer, but it lies in the essential difference 
between academe and virtually everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 While Birnbaum is correct in saying everybody talks about lottery winners, he 
fails to ponder whether everybody is so curious that they'd want the government 
to spend $300,000 on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To simplify it, picture a ballot proposal yesterday: "Should the federal 
government (or anyone in their right mind) spend $300,000 for a four-year study 
on the effects of hitting the lottery?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the political consultants might say, that's a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the government must be more flush than previously 
thought. Either that, or the people at the National Science Foundation have one 
hell of an insatiable curiosity about things. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how the folks over at the soup kitchen or the homeless shelter 
reacted when they see how easily 300K can be had. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm skeptical of the survey already. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters: If the new millionaires tell the researchers that their wealth 
has made them unhappy, I presume the follow-up question will be, "Then, why not 
give it back?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's simple enough. If you don't like your car, you trade it in. If a spouse 
makes you miserable, same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those deeds would be more difficult than returning all or part of $1 
million. In fact, studies have shown that you can unload a million bucks quite 
easily these days and thereby restore yourself to a state of peace and 
serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 At this early stage, my guess is that the final report will closely paraphrase 
whoever it was who said, "I've been rich and I've been poor, and I like rich 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, I'm thinking of submitting my own research-grant application. 
</P>
<P>
 Subject: The effects on the psyche of the American public when they hear that 
$300,000 is being spent on such things.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; OBEY OR PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By deciding that Orange County could issue warrants to more than 100,000 
traffic scofflaws, an appellate court has bolstered the idea of respecting the 
rules of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling last month, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana 
indicated it was aware of the law's impact.To rule that the warrants had been 
issued wrongly would be to "exalt dry formalism," the judges said. The legal 
system "cannot afford such niceties." 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem a surprising comment from that particular court. For years it 
has done a fine job protecting the rights of the accused in criminal cases, 
where the stakes can be very high, sometimes based on what opponents claimed 
were mere technicalities. But this case dealt with traffic penalties that ought 
to be respected and paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff was a Laguna Niguel resident who had paid nearly $2,000 in fines 
for traffic violations and not appearing in court. He argued that letting court 
clerks issue warrants against those failing to appear was unconstitutional 
because it gave the clerks powers that were reserved for prosecutors. 
Prosecutors are an arm of the executive branch, the courts are part of the 
judiciary, and the Constitution mandates separating their powers, went the 
argument. A lower court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appellate court said courts and court clerks are different, with the 
clerks able to perform executive duties. The reversal spared counties the loss 
of millions of dollars in fines and let Orange County reissue more than 100,000 
warrants. It also sent a clear warning to motorists: Obey the law or pay the 
fine.

TOBACCO'S DEATH TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people have questioned the number of deaths due to tobacco use. Who could 
believe that (nearly) half a million Americans (435,000, according to 
authorities) die each year as a direct result of using tobacco? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet 435,000, give or take a few loved ones, is just the number of people that 
have died in the United States. Do Mexicans count? There are 1 billion Chinese 
people, roughly four times the population of the United States. Do Chinese 
smoke? Do Chinese die from tobacco use as well as Americans? If the answer is 
yes, then we are talking more than 2 million American and Chinese people being 
killed each year as a direct result of using tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the other 4 billion people living in the rest of the world, do 
they count?

MIKE PENNER: LANSFORD TIRED OF RAM FANS GETTING KICKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week in Anaheim/St. Louis Ram history, our hometown-through-Christmas-Eve 
heroes finally sell out a home game, thereby engendering goodwill throughout 
thousands of Southern California households now deprived of Dallas-San 
Francisco, and approach their Battle of Los Angeles against the Raiders with 
John Shaw telephoning fans in St. Louis to whisper sweet nothings into their 
earpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of timing. Some people are born with it, some people develop it and 
some people send Jerome Bettis into the middle of the line three times in a row 
with the ball on the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who grew up rooting for the Rams, grew rich kicking for them and has 
lately grown mortified over Shaw's attempts to move them east, Mike Lansford 
has seen it all, so he is no longer surprised by any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for, maybe, that part about Shaw picking up the phone and making small 
talk with Joe and Jim Fan in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even imagine that," Lansford said, chatting with a few sportswriters 
after a Tuesday afternoon luncheon at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys have met John Shaw. Can you imagine him getting on the phone and 
talking to fans? The man does not like people, period." 
</P>
<P>
 The John Shaw Lansford knows is "(most) comfortable just going to the 
racetrack and hanging out" -- far from the madding crowd. Or, sequestered 
behind closed doors, figuring out how to put the squeeze on some NFL-deprived 
city, or a barefooted kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope John hasn't made a decision yet," Lansford said. "It kind of 
scares me a little bit. I've dealt with him, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is," Lansford added, lowering his voice for emphasis, "a shrewd 
businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 Those contractual wars of yore are small potatoes when compared to yanking a 
50-year-old L.A. institution out by the roots and transplanting it in another 
time zone. Lansford, a card-carrying member of the Save The Rams coalition, 
said he is "sick" about the franchise's present predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have selfish reasons for wanting the team to stay here," he said. "I'm a 
businessman in the area, I'm the team's all-time leading scorer, I had a great 
career here. I grew up as a Ram fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "But besides those reasons, we're losing one of the now-30 NFL franchises -- 
and, chances are, we won't get a team to replace it. I think everybody 
responsible for the team leaving should really look at it strongly before it 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be sick if the Rams left, honestly. I personally believe the NFL is 
the best attraction out there, and not just because I was a player. From a 
fan-interest standpoint, it's one of the best. For the fans here to lose a 
franchise, it would be catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
 But those fans can't support an NFL franchise. Shaw has informed them, 
repeatedly, of this. Shaw waves turnstile counts of 34,000 in their faces and 
sneers, "See, you don't deserve a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansford shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the attendance figures were when they first came in Orange 
County in '80," he said, "but from what I remember, the stadium was full. The 
1980 product wasn't very good. The 1981 product wasn't very good. My first year 
here, 1982, we were horrible -- and it was a strike year -- and the stadium was 
still full. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I think the fans did a great job supporting the team. I just think that 
over a period of time, the fans felt that maybe they weren't appreciated and 
started staying away. It takes a long time for that to happen, but I think 
that's what we've experienced here the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not appreciated? 
</P>
<P>
 You mean trading the team's most popular player, Eric Dickerson, at the height 
of his career during a spat over -- what else -- a few dollars? 
</P>
<P>
 You mean hanging on to a fading quarterback, Jim Everett, two years too long 
despite overwhelming public sentiment for a change? 
</P>
<P>
 You mean promising new, improved and exciting football and then handing the 
ball to Bettis 35 times a game while Troy Drayton hops up and down and lights 
flares 20 yards downfield? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Lansford means "the little things." 
</P>
<P>
 "Take what the Raiders do," he said. "The 'Commitment To Excellence.' Even 
though we're all kind of sick of it, it's out there on every park bench and bus 
stop and what have you. It's just a constant subliminal reminder that the team 
is there." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lansford hears about Shaw dialing up a couple of fans in the Midwest, he 
wishes Shaw would have made half the effort in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can pinpoint one area where the Rams have been deficient, it's 
marketing," Lansford said. "I think that's something John Shaw would agree to. 
I don't think he's extended himself to the community and the end result is low 
fan support at a time the team's not winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansford mentioned the lack of a Rams' speakers bureau, both current players 
and past. "Those are two specific areas," he said, "and that's nothing. That's 
just reaching out to the fans and saying, 'We appreciate you supporting the 
team.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Georgia Frontiere, in Lansford's estimation, "has been marketed wrong, 
too. She could have been presented more positively as having a hand in our 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some great teams in the '80s. It was very fashionable to go to the 
games and be associated with the Ram franchise. She maybe could have been given 
more credit for that. And again, that's the Rams. Because as soon as they 
started sliding, she's taken the blame. To the point where she's too 
embarrassed to come to the games any more." 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds like a blatant attempt to butter up Georgia, coaxing her into 
staying put, well, Lansford won't apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope there are some emotional attachments to this area for Georgia 
that may carry some weight in the decision," Lansford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansford knows he has a few. 
</P>
<P>
 As he put it, "Being the all-time leading scorer for the 'St. Louis 
Roundhorns' doesn't please me too much."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; LAST-PLACE FULLERTON TIES NO. 1 CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fullerton, the Orange Empire Conference's last-place women's soccer team, tied 
Cypress, the top-ranked team in the state, 1-1, Tuesday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive tie for Cypress (17-0-2, 11-0-2), which had a 
35-game conference winning streak stopped Friday in a 1-1 tie with Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress outshot Fullerton, 18-2, and took a 1-0 lead in the fifth minute when 
Wendy Pollanzak scored after a corner kick. 
</P>

DUNLAP NAMED ASSISTANT COACH FOR TITAN MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Dunlap, an assistant coach for the past three years at Quincy University 
in Illinois, has been named an assistant basketball coach on Bob Hawking's 
staff at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, 31, was a three-year letterman in basketball at UCLA and a member of 
the 1985 NIT championship team coached by Walt Hazzard. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap began his coaching career in 1986 with the junior varsity at North 
Hollywood High, his alma mater. He moved to College of the Canyons in 1988 as 
an assistant with the men's program coached by Lee Smelser. He was head coach 
of the women's program there for three years. Those teams compiled a 44-20 
record.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; WILL HOOP FEVER CHILL TITAN FANS 
AGAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton wasn't exactly a basketball hotbed last season. The men's 
team (8-19) had the worst record since 1981, when the Titans were 4-23. The 
women were 5-22. And both teams were eighth in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the kinds of performances that would create excitement about this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both coaches are encouraged by preseason practices and are eager to 
see what their teams will do against other teams. The start of the regular 
season, however, still is more than two weeks away for both teams, although the 
men's team will play an exhibition game Nov. 17 against Blue and Gold Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hawking, who moved up from an assistant's spot to the head coaching 
position on a one-year interim basis when Brad Holland switched to the 
University of San Diego, says he's been putting a heavy emphasis on 
conditioning and is pleased by the players' response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of running," Hawking said. "We expect to play with a little 
quicker tempo this season, and so that's important. We never want to fail 
because the other team has out-conditioned us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he's been especially pleased with the practice performances of 
senior guard James French and senior center Winston Peterson, two of the three 
returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "French has been playing extremely well," Hawking said. "His maturity, 
intelligence on the court and all-around athletic ability are very important to 
us. He's a solid Big West-level player." 
</P>
<P>
 French is set to go to the off-guard position full time after sharing time at 
the point position last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking says Peterson has been consistent on offense, and has shown continued 
improvement on defense. Peterson, who is 6 feet 6 and 235 pounds, was the 
team's leading scorer last year with an average of 15.3 points. "What he gives 
up in height, he makes up for in bulk," Hawking said. "He's hard to guard." 
</P>
<P>
 David Frigout, a 6-9 junior, is the other returning regular. "He's been 
remarkably improved," Hawking said. "Everything was new for him last year when 
he came here from France. He's one year advanced now, and we expect him to be a 
force for us. He's learning a lot every day, and he knows now the game is a lot 
more physical than it was in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Fred Amos, among others, is in contention for one of the inside 
starting spots, but Hawking is toying more and more with the idea of a 
three-guard offense. French would be at one of those spots, and the other two 
guards would come from a group that includes community college-transfers Chuck 
Overton and Ali Nayab along with redshirt freshman Chris Dade, who was out last 
season with an injury, and sophomore Chris St. Clair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Ayres, in her third year as coach of the women's team, would have had 
all five starters back from last season if Shefonda Colbert had not been 
declared academically ineligible. Regardless, Ayres definitely expects the 
Titans to be improved this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the progress we've made this fall," she said. "We feel the 
loss of Colbert, and we're still missing the 6-2 to 6-5 woman in the middle. 
But I think we'll be in better condition that we've been in the past, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres shifted Shayla Bradshaw from the point to off-guard. "We're going to 
need her to score more," Ayres said. "And we feel she will be able to get the 
ball to our inside players better from there. We need to get more scoring from 
inside, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Cram also has moved from guard to forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Autumn Hollyfield also is back after leading the nation with a 
.381 three-point shooting percentage. She led the team in scoring last year 
with an average of 17.9 points. Bradshaw averaged 16.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Tara Nowling and Koko Lahanas again are expected to share time at 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton finished 23rd in the nation in wrestling last season, but Coach 
Ardeshir Asgari faces a major rebuilding effort this season after five athletes 
who had qualified for the NCAA championships in the past completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses include four-time NCAA qualifiers Laszlo Molnar at 167 pounds and 
Jeff Maes at 126. Molnar was second in the NCAAs last year. Dwayne Buth and 
Kenny Workman, who also were NCAA qualifiers last year, are gone, as is 
Christian Holiday, who qualified in 1993 but failed to do so last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Asgari, however, is confident his team can bounce back after a strong 
recruiting year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had a good year from that standpoint, and that should help us a 
lot," Asgari said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming freshmen include Darryl Christian, a California state champion at 
Canyon High, and two-time Colorado state champion, Kent Argenbright. The 
freshman class also includes George Mercado, Thomas Montoya and Dan Lewis. All 
three were state runners-up in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a while for them to get going, but by the end of the 
season they should be fine," Asgari said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans open their season Saturday at home with matches against UC Davis 
and Embry-Riddle. Fullerton also will be the host for the All California Open 
tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Elders said he expects Heather Killeen to run in Saturday's NCAA 
Region 8 cross-country championships at Tucson, despite her recent bout with 
bronchitis at the Big West meet. "She's still not back to full strength because 
of the bronchitis, but she's determined to give it her best effort," Elders 
said. Killeen was fourth in the conference meet despite the illness. . . . The 
Fullerton women's volleyball team has a chance for its first victory of the 
season when the Titans play at Utah State on Friday and Saturday. Fullerton is 
0-25 and 0-14 in the conference. Utah State is 1-26 and 0-16 in conference 
play. . . . The Fullerton men's soccer team moved up to No. 14 this week in 
Soccer America's rankings. Indiana, which was upset by Fullerton in the UCLA 
tournament 10 days ago, has regained its No. 1 position. The Titans close their 
regular season today at Loyola Marymount and will learn Monday if they will be 
get an at-large berth to the NCAA playoffs.

PREP ROUNDUP; CAPISTRANO VALLEY RALLIES TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Capistrano Valley lost the first two games of its playoff match against 
Esperanza, only one thought raced through the mind of Cougar Coach John Gipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team never does anything easy," Gipe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cougars lost 12 consecutive points to lose Game 2, Capistrano 
Valley rebounded to post a five-game victory, 3-15, 12-15, 15-13, 15-9, 15-13, 
in a Southern Section Division I wild-card match Tuesday over host Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (8-7) advanced to Thursday's first round to play at top-seeded 
Newport Harbor, the No. 1-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Wilson, Christine Thuerbach and Nikole Modhorst stepped up to make the 
big plays for Capistrano Valley in the decisive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had six kills and three blocks in Game 5, and her 14th kill of the 
match gave the Cougars a 14-13 lead. Then, Esperanza's Kristy Kierulff, who had 
a match-high 20 kills, hit a spike wide to end the match. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson providing the offense, Thuerbach and Modhorst made the big 
defensive plays in Game 5. Modhorst had five digs in the game and Thuerbach, 
who also had 12 kills, had six digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thuerbach started in place of Suzanne Shaw, who played sparingly because of an 
ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christine played phenomenal tonight," Gipe said. "We knew Esperanza could 
come out hot, so we just had to ride it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Amy Nihipali had 10 kills and nine blocks for Esperanza (7-8), which 
was within two points of winning the match when it was tied, 13-13, in Game 3. 
But a kill from Thuerbach and another from Keri Gallup gave the Cougars a 15-13 
victory in Game 3 and the rally was under way. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

LOCAL NOTES: LOS ALAMITOS INVESTIGATING TRANSFER OF STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, on Tuesday asked Los Alamitos 
High School Principal Carol Hart to investigate an allegation that a Griffin 
football player, who transferred from Cypress High, never moved into Los 
Alamitos' attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section adopted a rule this year that allowed a student a 
one-time transfer, within the first 15 days of the school year, without losing 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the rule does not apply in this case as the transfer must take place 
between schools in the same district. Cypress is part of the Anaheim Union High 
School District and Los Alamitos is in the Los Alamitos Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only comment I have is as far as we know, the kid is legal," said John 
Barnes, Los Alamitos football coach and athletic director. "We are in the 
process of checking. We have checked this transfer before and everything was in 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said he received information from another Sunset League school that 
led him to request the school look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Alamitos, because it's a high-profile program, does a good job of 
checking athletes out," Crowley said. "The school is cooperating." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County, has a 44-game unbeaten 
streak. BOB ROHWER

 Orange boys' basketball Coach Richard Bossenmeyer has resigned to be an 
assistant coach with the Rapid City (S.D.) Thrillers of the Continental 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He is replacing Mark McNamara, a former NBA player who wants to resume that 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over for Bossenmeyer, who will leave the school Thursday, is Mark 
Holman, a 1986 graduate of Orange and former Century League athlete of year. 
Holman, who will be an interim coach, has been a basketball coach as well as an 
assistant on the track team the past four years at Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossenmeyer, who won three Century League titles in four seasons at Orange, 
compiled a 61-41 overall record. He said Thrillers Coach Eric Musselman offered 
him the job Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had met with Eric's father (and former college, CBA, ABA and NBA coach) 
Bill Musselman at a camp this summer," Bossenmeyer said. "We got to talking and 
he said he was sorry Eric had not met me because he had hired a guy already. 
But (Monday) at noon I got a message from Eric that I should give him a call. I 
did, we talked, and he asked me to come aboard. It's the experience of 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Musselman agreed. "Both my dad and (former NBA scout) Herb Livsey, who runs 
the summer camp where Rich worked, highly recommended him. So when the opening 
came, I felt we had to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bossenmeyer: "I feel deep in my heart I am a high school coach. But I 
don't want to look back later and say 'what if.' I'll take the year as a 
learning experience and see if I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Zirkle, Orange athletic director, said Bossenmeyer was granted a leave of 
absence. If the job is not to his liking, Bossenmeyer can return as the Orange 
coach next season. MIKE TERRY

BITTERLY FOUGHT SENATE RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's bruising and costly U.S. Senate contest between Democratic 
incumbent Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington was coming 
down to the wire late Tuesday as results indicated the race was still too close 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who was outspent by more than 2 to 1 overall and as much as 3 to 1 
on television, watched the returns from her home in San Francisco. The former 
mayor, who was scheduled to appear later in the night at the Fairmont Hotel, 
was described as "optimistic" about the outcome and "relieved this race is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident we are going to win . . . but this is a very close race that 
is going to be decided late into the night," said Feinstein campaign manager 
Kam Kuwata. "Dianne is going to win by a narrow margin." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, also remained out of sight at an Orange County hotel 
where his campaign had planned to share an election night party with the 
sponsors of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidate spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived at the 
hotel shortly after the polls closed. "My wife and I are very relaxed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has it been worth it?" one reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very worth it," the candidate answered. "All of us are on this 
planet to do good for somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, whose fortune came from the 1990 sale of his family's Texas oil 
and gas company, also seemed to reflect on polls taken shortly before the 
election that indicated most California voters do not know or do not like the 
Republican nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want (voters) to get to know me," he said. "You can't do it in a 30-second 
spot. It's going to take six years for them to get to really know me and my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's wife, Arianna, an internationally known author, also said of the 
acrimonious and cliffhanging campaign: "Maybe there's a book in it. I'm keeping 
notes." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who rode a Democratic momentum into office in 1992, the so-called 
"Year of the Woman," found herself two years later paddling against a powerful 
political current. Feinstein ran a campaign about the benefits of government 
that contrasted with the hostile mood responsible for the historic gains in 
Congress for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, political observers said Feinstein suffered from the poor showing 
by Democratic colleague Kathleen Brown in the governor's race, and she was hurt 
by her opposition to Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, spent so much of the campaign attacking Feinstein that 
polls indicated he never made a strong connection with voters. In addition, his 
campaign was rocked by press stories critical of his business background, his 
wife's unconventional religious history and, most recently, his admission that 
he employed an illegal immigrant in violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Senate candidates combined to spend more than $41 million on the race, 
shattering a 10-year record of $26 million set by North Carolina Sen. Jesse A. 
Helms and his opponent. Huffington, whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of 
his family's Texas oil and gas company, accounted for almost $30 million, 
nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his money, Huffington turned the California race into a high-stakes 
cliffhanger after it had been considered by most Washington insiders to be one 
of the surest Democratic bets in the country. Feinstein was an early favorite 
because she was a veteran of two consecutive statewide campaigns and, in polls, 
she was rated the most popular politician in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Huffington spent nearly $6 million on television advertising during 
the spring, most of it attacking Feinstein's record in the Senate, the 
incumbent's lead shrank from 30% in a Times Poll in March to single digits by 
the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments set off alarms at the White House because Huffington's 
primary criticism of Feinstein last spring was her vote for President Clinton's 
1993 economic package. By late May, Feinstein had also quietly dropped her name 
from a list of senators backing the President's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Feinstein maintained a cautious alliance with the President throughout 
her campaign. Clinton appeared four times with Feinstein, including two early 
fund-raisers and two events in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, just days after the polls found the race tightening, Feinstein 
responded with her first television commercials. But after a summer-long 
exchange of high-priced attack ads, the polls did not budge. As a result, both 
campaigns entered the crucial fall period still locked in a close race and 
having little hope of straying from their attack strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The predictable result was that voters grew to dislike both candidates. 
Feinstein's favorable rating fell below that for Gov. Pete Wilson and Kathleen 
Brown. And in a Times Poll just more than a week ago, barely a quarter of 
respondents said they liked Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The last week of the campaign became one of the most acrimonious, with 
disclosures that Huffington employed an illegal immigrant nanny for more than 
four years and that the work visa for Feinstein's former Guatemalan housekeeper 
expired while the woman was still employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal immigrant debate dominated the final days of the race as both 
candidates broadcast commercials about the other's case. Circumstances in the 
two cases were different, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington acknowledged that he violated federal law by employing the nanny up 
until last year. His problem was made more embarrassing because he strongly 
supported Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would cut most health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. Feinstein opposed the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Feinstein's case, immigration officials confirmed Friday that a housekeeper 
she employed a decade ago had a visa to be in the country legally only if she 
worked at the Guatemalan Consulate -- not in a private home. Even that 
permission expired a year after the woman began working for Feinstein in 1980, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein maintained, however, that she did not violate federal law because 
there was no rule against employing an illegal immigrant until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the race, name-calling and accusations dominated the contest on 
television. On the campaign trail, however, the stump speeches revealed a 
striking philosophical choice between two very different candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein championed the performance of government, highlighting everything 
from farm subsidies to disaster relief, crime control and small business 
incentives. Huffington was almost the opposite, boasting to audiences that he 
votes against most appropriations bills and many government regulations and 
opposed any new taxes.

CRASH ON LAGUNA CANYON ROAD KILLS MAN, INJURES FOUR OTHERS; ACCIDENT: POLICE 
SAY ONE DRIVER WAS CHASING ANOTHER ON RAIN-SLICK HIGHWAY AFTER A DISPUTE. 
PURSUING MOTORIST'S SON IS CRITICALLY HURT. 
</P>

<P>
 A South Gate man died Tuesday when a motorist chasing another car on Laguna 
Canyon Road at speeds of up to 80 m.p.h. plowed head-on into the victim's 
pickup truck, police investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Greg Bartz said Michael Henshall of Laguna Beach, who has a record 
for speeding and driving on a suspended license, allegedly was chasing another 
motorist on the wrong side of the road when his car collided with the truck 
driven by Eli Donis, killing the 25-year-old man instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other people were injured, including two children identified as 
Henshall's sons, Officer Robert Van Gorder said. One of the boys was listed in 
critical condition late Tuesday, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked many accidents out here on the Laguna Canyon," Van Gorder said. 
"And it's always bad, every time somebody dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gorder said the accident occurred in the southbound lanes of the 
rain-slick highway about 6:40 a.m. about two miles north of El Toro Road. He 
said Henshall was traveling north in the south lane, chasing the driver of 
another car after the two apparently had a confrontation for unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver being chased saw Donis' truck and swerved out of the way, Bartz 
said. Henshall, however, collided into Donis' pickup, he said. The driver of 
the other car fled. Investigators are seeking that driver for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was raining, but rain wasn't a big factor," Van Gorder said. "The big 
factor was that the drivers were speeding down the wrong side of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The collision set off a chain-reaction involving two other cars. One car 
traveling north car hit a guardrail and overturned as the unidentified driver 
tried to skirt the accident. He was not injured, Van Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being hit by Henshall's car, Donis' pickup truck slid into a car driven 
by Michael O'Leary, 33, of Laguna Beach. He was treated for injuries to the 
lower back, neck and right shoulder at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henshall was trapped in his car for about an hour as firefighters, using a 
hydraulic apparatus, cut through the top of his vehicle to free him, Van Gorder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The front end of his car collapsed and compressed into the driver," Van 
Gorder said. "His legs were stuck and his chest was pushed against the steering 
wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 Henshall suffered a fractured shoulder, dislocated hip and abrasions. He was 
listed in fair condition after surgery at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center. He was not cited by police, pending completion of an investigation, Van 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was wearing a seat belt and the air bag was activated," Van Gorder said. 
"I'm convinced that's what saved him." 
</P>
<P>
 Henshall's 6-year-old son, Jonah, suffered severe head injuries and was listed 
in critical condition at Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center. Henshall's other child, Sean, 8, was treated and released at 
the same hospital. Sean was wearing a seat belt while Jonah was not, Van Gorder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who identified herself only as Henshall's mother said in a telephone 
interview: "They were all going away to Vegas for a vacation -- there's a new 
family thing for children there." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she and her family had suffered through the Laguna Beach fire 
last year and did not want to talk about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Donis' family could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, Henshall has been cited three 
times for speeding since March, 1993. In September, 1992, he was convicted of 
driving with a suspended license, according to records from Municipal Court in 
Laguna Niguel. Henshall received a suspended sentence, according to a court 
spokeswoman. The reason for his license suspension was not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Donis' death marks the second fatal accident on Laguna Canyon Road this year 
and the 25th in the past 10 years, according to statistics from the California 
Department of Transportation. Last September, a 33-year-old man from Orange 
died when his car veered off Laguna Canyon Road about two miles from the site 
of Tuesday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of injuries and fatalities on Laguna Canyon Road is about twice the 
average rate on other state highways, according to statistics from the county's 
Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the number of accidents, the Board of Supervisors decided last 
month to widen 4.8 miles of the highway, from El Toro Road to the San Diego 
Freeway. If the plan is approved by Caltrans, the scenic roadway will be 
realigned and expanded to four lanes.

JUDGE TO WEIGH ETHICS OF PEERS' LIMO RIDES; INQUIRY: PRESIDING JURIST WILL 
EXAMINE WHETHER TWO COLLEAGUES' FAILURE TO REPORT TRIPS VIOLATES JUDICIAL 
CANON. SANTA ANA ATTORNEY WHO HOLDS COUNTY CONTRACT TO REPRESENT THE INDIGENT 
PROVIDED THE VEHICLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said Tuesday that he will 
conduct an inquiry to determine whether two fellow judges breached ethics codes 
by accepting limousine rides from a local attorney and failing to report the 
travel as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I wish this hadn't 
happened," Smith said. "I feel badly about it. I wish I didn't have to do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said it was his duty as presiding judge to decide whether the actions of 
Superior Court Judges Myron S. Brown and Luis A. Cardenas violated the Judicial 
Canon of Ethics when they took advantage of a limousine service provided by 
Santa Ana attorney William W. Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years, Stewart's law firm has held the largest county contract 
to provide legal defense of poor people accused of crimes. During that time, 
both Brown and Cardenas have presided in cases involving Stewart's firm, and 
were in a position to influence the renewal or cancellation of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, Brown served as chairman of the county's Alternate Defense 
Committee, which makes recommendations on indigent defense policy for the 
county. The judge said he accepted use of Stewart's Las Vegas hotel suite at 
the end of his tenure on the committee and did not report that as a gift as 
required by the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county officials who used the car have included Orange County Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez. The five-member board has routinely ratified extensions of 
Stewart's contract and district attorney's investigator Rusty Hodges' contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the judges and other officials said they have done nothing wrong by 
using the car to attend private dinners, charity functions or sporting events 
throughout Southern California, Smith said his inquiry will attempt to 
determine whether the judges were required to report those trips on their 
annual financial disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state FPPC, judges and other elected officials are required 
to report gifts valued at $50 or more, including limousine rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The car cost $25 per hour to operate, and the limousine driver has said events 
typically ran more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a whole lot to do," Smith said. "They have indicated they used 
the car. The question is whether this is a reportable expense. I'll be looking 
at that over the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge decides his colleagues' actions were violations of judicial 
ethics, Smith said he could refer the matter to state Judicial Performance 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the one who is going to have to make a decision on what to do," Smith 
said. "I can tell you, it's not a good place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said he might have used the limousine more than once, but remembered 
only one occasion when he attended a charity event in Orange County. Brown said 
he was a passenger in the car at least three times in the past three years when 
he accompanied Stewart to football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Both judges, close friends of the attorney, said they did not pay for the 
limousine's use nor did they think the car service constituted a gift to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship between an attorney and a judge is always a sensitive 
interface," Smith said. "I think you've just got to call it what it is. The 
downside is that if you don't, you've got the problem we're dealing with now." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has contended that his limousine service was never intended to be used 
as a tool to curry favor with judges or other elected officials. Stewart said 
his office maintained an "open policy" in providing the car to judges, 
attorneys and clients of the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you would find the times judges or other officials used the car were 
very few," Stewart said. "That's not why we had the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent disclosures regarding some of the same officials who 
oversaw contract operations, Superior Court Executive Officer Alan Slater 
expressed continued confidence in Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been supervising the contract for a number of years," Slater said, 
"and I never felt any influence from any source that resembled influence 
peddling. I always felt the contract worked very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials, however, have criticized Stewart's operation in the past 
year, charging that the attorney has funneled much, if not all, of his caseload 
to attorneys outside his office, while continuing to keep a large portion of 
the fees for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials have also confirmed that Stewart occasionally communicated 
with them by telephone or fax from South America, where he pursued other 
unrelated business interests.

 DON'T BANK ON IT: "Your ballot stub is worth money!" That was the flyer 
message left on car windshields of many northern Orange County voters Tuesday. 
They were encouraged to collect $5 at several California banking institutions 
just for voting -- and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was listed as the 
sponsor. . . . It may have been a great way to get you to the polls. Problem 
was: It was a hoax. Says Andrew Porterfield of the FDIC Irvine office: "We do 
not condone this in any way. We have no idea who would have done this."

 DOWN IN THE DUMPS: When a suspect slips the murder weapon in a trash can, it's 
almost impossible to find it once the trash is hauled away to a dump site. 
Unless, of course, you've got a German shepherd like Bork, who works with 
Huntington Beach Police Officer Dennis Plymale. . . . It took Bork just 30 
minutes to find a gun used in a recent homicide at a city trash yard. Says 
Plymale: "I was impressed. Not even once did he stop to eat anything. He just 
went out and did his job."

 ROARING FUN: Curt Lyon is throwing a party tonight to celebrate the 20th 
anniversary of his Lyon Studios in Newport Beach. But he's got a bonus for his 
guests: At 8, ABC's "The World's Funniest Commercials" is featuring some of his 
works -- 11 of them. . . . Lyon, who specializes in commercials, knows 
something about how to make them funny: First, you get Leslie Nielsen ("Naked 
Gun," "Airplane!") to star in them for you. Nielsen also happens to be host of 
the ABC special.

 MORE BREAD: Four local school districts have found a way to save taxpayers' 
dough. They've formed a cooperative to jointly buy their cafeteria bakery goods 
and paper products, such as plates and cups. . . . Huntington Beach Union High 
School District is joined by Newport-Mesa Unified, Huntington Beach City and La 
Habra City districts. . . . Says one spokeswoman: "We've saved thousands of

BOARD'S CLERK RESIGNS AMID TAX APPEALS PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from the Board of Supervisors, Clerk of the Board Phyllis A. 
Henderson resigned from her position Tuesday amid a county investigation into 
her office's handling of more than 200 property assessment appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief letter to the board, Henderson said her resignation would be 
effective Nov. 30. She thanked supervisors for their support since her 
appointment in 1992 and said she would "provide every assistance possible 
during the transition period between now and my departure." 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, who accepted Henderson's 
resignation, said she "did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said Henderson will be reassigned to her former job as a staff 
analyst with the county's General Services Agency. Her base pay of $62,000 will 
remain the same, but she will lose about $10,700 in executive benefits, such as 
a county car. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson did not return repeated telephone calls to her office Friday. She 
become embroiled in controversy last month when county officials discovered 
that more than 200 property assessments appeals had expired before they were 
set for hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the county is forced to accept the owners' estimated value of 
their property instead of the county assessor's. The mistake could cost cities, 
schools, the county and other governmental agencies as much as $10.7 million in 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors were outraged over the foul-up and have demanded to know 
who was responsible. Henderson, who is responsible for scheduling appeal 
hearings, and county Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs, who initially receives and 
processes the appeals, have blamed each other for the blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members, however, said they thought Henderson was more responsible 
for the bureaucratic snafu. Nonetheless, some board members are pushing for an 
independent management audit into Jacobs' office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the supervisors held a closed, executive hearing on Henderson's 
job performance. Some supervisors had said privately that they would fire 
Henderson if she didn't resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said Henderson's resignation was "to be 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said, "the responsibility has to be shared by more than just 
Phyllis from my perspective. I hope the grand jury and CAO study of the process 
will fix accountability and give a clearer picture of what went wrong. I think 
there are still some unanswered questions."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HIKE IN BOOKING FEES TO FUND NEW JAILS, 
MAINTENANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to increase booking fees by $18 
and place the revenue in a fund for jail construction and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-2 vote was hailed by plan supporters such as Supervisor William G. 
Steiner, who said the action underscores the county's commitment to ease jail 
overcrowding and fund new detention facilities.But opponents insisted that the 
fee hike was unnecessary because police departments are already decreasing 
their reliance on the county's five detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Jan. 1, the fee charged to police departments and other agencies 
each time they book an inmate into the county's jails will increase from $158 
to $176. The fee is expected to generate about $2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder joined with Steiner in 
supporting the increase, which was sought by county officials to offset rising 
jail costs. Supervisors Gaddi Vasquez and Roger R. Stanton voted against the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee hike comes as Steiner announced progress in negotiations between the 
county and the city of Orange over the long-sought expansion of the Theo Lacy 
Branch Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to negotiate a compromise; it's another to come up with the 
money to expand the jail and fund construction," Steiner said. "This put your 
money where your mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 The increases have been criticized by some law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the number of bookings into county jails from municipal law 
enforcement agencies has dropped 15% to 20% this year, in large part because 
the departments are taking their business to city jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez opposed the fee hike, saying it was a "tremendous contradiction" to 
raises fees on cities after they helped the county ease its overcrowding by 
opening their own jails and using other agencies to book people. SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; AGAIN, NO VERDICT IN CARJACK KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury deadlocked Tuesday in a case against an 
Anaheim man charged with murder in one of the county's first fatal carjackings, 
the second time a jury has been unable to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rembert, 22, was convicted of kidnaping last spring in connection with 
the June, 1992, slaying of Joseph Andrew Kondrath, but two separate juries have 
been unable to decide on a count of murder and special circumstances that 
mandate a life sentence without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent said a hearing is scheduled for Nov. 18 before 
Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald to determine what will happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fully prepared to try again," Brent said, noting that a majority of the 
jurors told him they wanted to convict Rembert of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rembert's defense attorney could not be reached for comment. The defendant 
faces a life sentence on the kidnaping conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a 23-year-old Rancho Santiago College student, was last seen 
leaving for his job at a supermarket at 4 a.m. on June 10, 1992. Prosecutors 
said he was grabbed from behind the wheel of his car at gunpoint in front of 
his Anaheim home and forced into the trunk. He was robbed of his wallet, which 
contained only about $1, and later shot in the head as he lay crouched in the 
trunk of his car pleading, "Don't hurt me," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Rembert is one of three defendants convicted in connection with the slaying. 
Shaun Burney, 20, of Tustin was sentenced to death in September for his role as 
the triggerman, while Allen Dean Burnett II, 20, of Anaheim, was sentenced to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The three committed the carjacking because they wanted to use the car for a 
drive-by shooting and killed Kondrath to eliminate him as a witness, 
prosecutors have charged. ANNA CEKOLA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CHESS CHAMPION, 12, EYEING U.S. OPEN TITLE

 Your move. 
</P>
<P>
 Check and checkmate, says your opponent, David Rash, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 David, who was world champion for his age group four years ago, wants to 
become the U.S. open champion later this month in Las Vegas and come home with 
the $36,000 prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has a good shot at winning it all. 
</P>
<P>
 David, who has about 200 trophies to prove some of his conquests, has been 
playing since he was 2. He says his father taught him the game, but he has also 
received lessons from chess masters. And he says he has beaten some of his 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chess is a sport. It isn't just for dinky kids with glasses," David said. 
"It's all about strategy, but you have to be tough, physically and mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice also helps, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 David, a student at Orange Coast College, once played 100 people 
simultaneously in Laguna Beach. He lost five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the game, aside from strategy, is concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In chess, you can't talk," he said. "You can only say two words: 'Check' and 
'Checkmate.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But chess is not the only interest in David's life. He is studying to become a 
doctor. In college, he is taking the introduction to college reading and 
marketing -- and enjoying other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love basketball, racquetball, swimming, just about every sport," he 
said.TOM RAGAN

 Gift to Help Fund Children's Center 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast College has received a $100,000 gift from the Weingart Foundation 
for construction of a children's center on campus. About $1.5 million has 
already been raised for the $2-million center. Groundbreaking is planned for 
next fall. The center is expected to open in fall 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building will supplement an existing children's center that opened in 
1971 and provides low-cost child care and services to about 180 children whose 
parents are enrolled at Orange Coast College. The center serves children 
between the ages of 6 months and 5 years during fall and spring semesters. 
During the summer, the center offers programs to children ages 6 to 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A collaborative effort between the county, Brea and the Brea Olinda Unified 
School District has resulted in $150,000 in improvements to recreation 
facilities at Laurel Elementary School and adjacent Lagos de Moreno Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facilities, which were dedicated late last month, are available for 
community use after school and on weekends.Half the funding was provided by the 
Brea Redevelopment Agency and the other half was provided by a grant from the 
county's Third Supervisorial District. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a wonderful job," Laurel Principal Tim Harvey said. "It's nice to 
see the community working together" for the benefit of children, seniors and 
the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements at the school include backstops and dugouts at the softball 
field, new handball courts, an additional volleyball court and a fitness 
station designed by the Project Fit America program to increase upper-body 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The school portion of the project includes an 85-foot outdoor mural that was 
designed and painted by a team of 12 Laurel Elementary students, and 
coordinated by third-grade teacher Dana Radding.  
</P>
<P>
 At the adjacent city park, new playground equipment was installed, and a roof 
and gas barbecues were added to the picnic area.ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RAIN EXPECTED TO CLEAR TODAY, RECUR THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weather forecasters say that Tuesday's rains are likely to return on Thursday, 
following a one-day respite marked by low clouds and some patchy fog this 
morning with fair skies this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm is expected to continue through mid-Friday and to bring moderate 
rain to the coast and possibly heavy rain in mountain areas, said Curtis Brack, 
a meteorologist with Weatherdata Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's rain ranged from .19 inches in El Toro to immeasurable traces in 
Laguna Beach and Dana Point. Other Orange County cities reporting rain were 
Anaheim, .17 inches; Newport Beach, .10 inches, and Santa Ana, .11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's showers, according to Brack, resulted from a low-pressure system 
that began in the Gulf of Alaska over the weekend, traveled south over Northern 
California on Monday and was reported to be continuing inland today. Thursday's 
predicted rains, he said, would result from a new storm system now following 
the same route.

 Mayor Michael Ward and city officials are asking University of California 
President Jack W. Peltason to reconsider the withdrawal of the university from 
a 3-year-old plan to preserve the 580-acre San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of California Natural Reserve System was working in concert 
with the city for several years to develop a plan to preserve the San Joaquin 
Marsh, one of Southern California's largest freshwater marshes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in August, the university pulled out of the San Joaquin Marsh Enhancement 
Plan. Officials questioned how the marsh would be managed under the partnership 
and questioned plans to use treated waste water to replenish marsh areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The UC system doesn't want that part of the program," said Ward, whose Nov. 3 
letter to Peltason urged the university to reconsider. "Their part of the marsh 
will dry up because they're just going to depend upon rain water to keep it 
full." 
</P>
<P>
 A University of California spokesman said Peltason has yet to reviewed Ward's 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership of the marsh is split between the Irvine Co., which controls 290 
acres; the University of California, which owns 202 acres, and the Irvine Ranch 
Water District, with about 88 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district board on Dec. 19 will review a proposed two-year 
demonstration project to determine the feasibility of using treated waste water 
in the San Joaquin Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said he sees a threat to the future of 
the marsh without the participation of the University of California. "We're 
trying to keep a delicate balance there," Brady said. "We want to make sure the 
marsh area is both enhanced and preserved and not lost for years to come." RUSS

 A woman who tried to fight off a carjacker watched in horror Monday night as 
the man sped off in her car with her 4-year-old daughter still strapped in the 
passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharye Kim, 37, of Garden Grove spent an anxious half-hour parted from her 
daughter before the child was located several blocks away in a residential 
area, where the carjacker had released her. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Tuesday were still searching for the carjacker, an Asian man aged 20 
to 23, about 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighing about 150 pounds, who drove off 
in Kim's 1995 black Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim recounted her horror Tuesday while feeding noodles to daughter Sarah. The 
two had just left a gift shop about 8:50 p.m. Monday and Kim had strapped Sarah 
in the seat when the man accosted her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pointing the gun at my head. But I don't think he was trying to kill 
me. He could have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker fired one round into the pavement as a warning, police Lt. John 
Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kim: "He grabbed the keys from my hand and pushed me from the car. I 
think I fell down. I said, 'My baby, my baby,' that's all I could say. I 
couldn't think of anything else. I thought my baby was going to die. When he 
backed up, I saw her looking out the window at me and crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Kim's struggles, the man sped off with Sarah. But he released the girl 
a few blocks away. A resident called police after the child knocked at a door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miracle because he had a gun. What if he had killed my baby?" Kim 
said. "All I need is my baby. I can buy the car again," Kim said. The car was 
two weeks old and still had paper license plates. DEBBIE KONG

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RAIN COULD END EFFORT TO BOLSTER BEACHFRONT 
</P>

<P>
 The sound of big trucks lumbering onto local beaches early Tuesday morning was 
music to the ears of city officials who signed a last-minute deal for the 
delivery of sand to the city's badly eroded beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn-to-dusk delivery of sand will continue through next week while City 
Manager Jerry L. Bankston keeps an eye to the sky.Heavy rainfall could put an 
end to sand removal from the Santa Ana River excavation project near Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much rain would endanger workers in the river's flood control channel, but 
Tuesday's light rain did not cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little rain will actually compact the sand better," Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston won an extension of a Nov. 15 deadline imposed by the Army Corps of 
Engineers for removal of the sand, but only until the first heavy rains come. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile-long section of the beach between the Seal Beach Pier and the Naval 
Weapons Station has lost an average of seven inches of sand a year to erosion. 
The city was seeking up to 100,000 cubic yards of sand, but Bankston expects 
only about 30,000 cubic yards of sand because of time constraints. A 
double-trailer truckload of sand is about 15 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said the city is off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much heavier sand than we would normally put on the surface of the 
beach," Bankston said. "Some of this will go out into the tide and it should 
slow the erosion." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay $3.50 per cubic yard for the sand and $5.30 per cubic yard 
for transportation. The total cost is estimated at $294,000, which includes 
engineering services and grading. No additional sand replenishment is planned 
until the end of the rainy season in March or April. RUSS LOAR

 Council OKs $1,500 for El Toro High Marching Band 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week gave $1,500 to the El Toro High School marching 
band, although some council members feared the decision would set a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school's Royal Blue Regime Marching Band, which has won awards in 
local and state competitions, asked the city for $5,000 to help fund a trip to 
the Hawaii Invitational Band Tournament next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ann Van Haun said the council "couldn't justify spending $5,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be setting a precedent," she said during a meeting last week. "We 
would have all the other groups coming to us for support." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Helen Wilson preferred holding off on the request until city 
staff prepares the next fiscal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to hear a request for funds, it should be during the budget 
process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to give the band the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Band supporters said the national exposure given bands at the Hawaii 
tournament would be good publicity for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people see the Royal Blue Regime than will see all of our athletic teams 
combined," said Jack Hollander, an El Toro High School instructor who organizes 
the marching band. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tim Link said the council should give a hand to local groups like 
the Blue Regime that do good work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at this as a special event for a special group," he said. 
"They're just asking for a little bit of help so they can do the positive 
things they do." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; WALKATHONS HIGHLIGHT PLIGHT OF BOAT PEOPLE

 A Vietnamese American organization will hold simultaneous walks in three 
cities Nov. 19 to raise awareness about the plight of Vietnamese boat people 
still languishing in refugee camps in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the 10-kilometer walkathons in San Jose, Houston and Fountain 
Valley will raise money for the refugees, according to Van T. Tran, spokesman 
for LAVAS, Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said about 45,000 Vietnamese who fled their country by boat are still 
being detained in camps in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the 
Philippines. The United Nations and the host countries are scheduled to close 
the camps by the end of next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees will then be repatriated to Vietnam where they could be 
persecuted by the government there for fleeing the country, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAVAS, a national nonprofit group which operates an office in Little Saigon, 
provides attorneys to help the refugees gain political asylum in the United 
States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 people participated in last year's walkathon in Orange County. The 
event raised more than $100,000, Tran said. About the same number of people are 
expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the money is used for medicine, food and clothing for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkathon will begin at 9 a.m. at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley. A 
concert and a picnic will follow. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MERCHANTS ACCEPT NEW PARKING FEE PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week agreed to a parking-rate plan for the downtown 
parking structure after merchants charged that raising fees would chase 
customers away. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council imposed a parking fee increase that angered the 
business community.However, city officials recently met with merchants and an 
alternate plan was reached to help relieve their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Monday unanimously approved a tiered system of validations 
along with a change in the hours that validations will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen C. Daniel, president of the Downtown Business Assn. and owner of Rocky 
Mountain Chocolate Factory, said that it is a workable plan that will "make 
everybody happy." Community Services Director Ron Haganalso said the new rates 
won't hurt businesses and caters to each of the different types of downtown 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates to park in the Main Promenade Parking Structure will remain $2 on 
weekdays and $3 on weekends with the first 1 1/2 hours free. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards Theater and Powerhouse Gym will continue paying 25 cents for each 
three hours of validations. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants also can buy validations, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fees are expected to raise about $450,000 for 1994-95 to offset the 
parking structure's operation and building costs. DEBRA CANO

 Police from three cities staked out a beauty salon Tuesday and watched a 
robbery, arresting four men suspected of about 40 salon robberies since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from Anaheim, Buena Park and Fullerton were watching the beauty salon 
in the 250 block of East Imperial Highway in Brea when four men robbed it, 
according to Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the salon was injured and the four men were arrested without 
incident, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the men as Miguel Sandoval Diaz, 24; Art Pena, 20; Alejandro 
Vargas, 22; and Fernando Torres, 20, all of Santa Ana. They are being held at 
the Anaheim City Jail on $250,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the four are suspects in approximately 40 armed robberies of 
beauty salons in Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana, Buena Park, Placentia, Fountain 
Valley, Stanton and Los Angeles County. All of these robberies were committed 
using the same method of operation, he said.

Victoria Ingram-Curlee, 45, a Mission Viejo real estate agent who hopes to join 
350 other Americans who have donated a kidney to a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," she said at a news conference at Sharp Memorial Hospital, 
where the surgery is scheduled for mid-afternoon. "Everything before seemed 
like such a haze. There was so much activity, too many things going on. But now 
we're ready for it, body, mind and soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready too," said Randall Curlee, 46, a marketing representative for a 
Costa Mesa audio company, whose diabetes has left him with heart problems, 
vision difficulties and severely impaired kidneys. Curlee needs the transplant 
immediately or he will require dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
 After a nationally televised wedding at the hospital, the newlyweds suffered a 
serious setback Oct. 12, when a physician nicked one of three arteries leading 
to the lower part of Ingram-Curlee's left kidney during a routine preoperative 
procedure called an arteriogram. 
</P>
<P>
 It postponed and even threatened a transplant that had taken on a fairy tale 
quality. The wedding was televised on "Good Morning, America" and the "Today" 
show the day before the first scheduled surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the mishap, and the fact that the vessel nicked during the procedure 
has not completely healed, doctors said Tuesday they believe Ingram-Curlee's 
left kidney is suitable for donation. They intend to transplant it, rather than 
her right one, as originally intended, so that Ingram-Curlee will be left with 
the better of the two organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, chairman of the multi-organ transplant team at Sharp 
Memorial, said that Ingram-Curlee had healed well enough to endure the 
operation -- which is far more extensive than the one Curlee will undergo -- 
and that her left kidney should perform superbly, especially when compared with 
Curlee's failing kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kidney itself is just fine," Mendez said. "It's alive and vigorous and 
receiving a good blood supply. Yes, there has been some compromise to it. But 
we've decided to utilize that kidney and remove the area of compromise by 
repairing it on the bench," a phase of the surgery slated to be completed by 
Dr. Arturo Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no damage to the kidney," Martinez said. "It's only that 
small section of artery that's affected." 
</P>
<P>
 The two doctors said Ingram-Curlee currently receives about 53% of the total 
effectiveness of her kidneys from her right kidney, making the left one more 
suitable for removal. 
</P>
<P>
 There remains an 8% to 10% chance that Curlee will reject the organ during the 
first year after the transplant, but, Mendez said, there was only a 10% chance 
that his wife would be the almost perfect donor she turned out to be. Her 
kidneys were an ideal match to her husband's in the two most important factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Long odds have been only part of the couple's story. Under any circumstances, 
it's been an unusual year for the pair, who said the attention and adulation in 
recent weeks has exceeded their wildest expectations -- which isn't to say it's 
been welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Privacy has come at a premium, they say, with fear an ever-present nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee admitted feeling anxious, even fatalistic at times, about surgery that 
poses greater complications for his wife than for him. Ingram-Curlee's 
operation will involve a 12-inch incision and the removal of a portion of her 
lower rib to take out the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 "His reaction made me angry," Ingram-Curlee said in an interview this weekend, 
"because he had brought up a negative issue. He said, 'Something could happen, 
one of us might not make it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that irritated me, because above all, I'm a positive person. I just 
won't accept that kind of thinking, like I wouldn't accept the doctors saying I 
might not be able to donate after the injury to my kidney." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the mishap cast doubt over Ingram-Curlee being used as a donor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee now says the delay was a "godsend," because the couple had just 
moved into a new house in Mission Viejo and had no place to sleep. But, she 
said, the medical team's "negativity" also made her angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very upset with the doctors then, too. I told them, 'I'm getting sick 
and tired of the negative responses here. To me, that's just not acceptable,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But tests two days later revealed that Ingram-Curlee's left kidney had 
sustained no lasting damage. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife's optimism, Curlee said, "has changed attitudes even in the hospital. 
Before, the doctors were so cautious, trying first to present the negative side 
of things. Now, they're telling her and me both we're right to be optimistic. 
Really, Victoria has won over everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Her hopes for the surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 "A better quality of life," she said. "And after all, he is my very best 
friend. Wouldn't you want to have your best friend in the best health 
possible?"

COUNTY PUTS END TO CLOSING OFFICES ON ALTERNATE FRIDAYS; GOVERNMENT: 
SUPERVISORS SCRAP CONTROVERSIAL WORK PLAN AFTER EXPECTED COST SAVINGS FAIL TO 
MATERIALIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday ended a controversial work plan that 
closes county offices on alternate Fridays in favor of a plan that keeps 
offices open five days a week while still giving employees flexible work 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote capped nearly three weeks of heated debate among 
supervisors on whether to continue the 22-month-old work plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton led the campaign against continuation of the work 
plan, saying it failed to reach cost-saving goals. 
</P>
<P>
 He assailed two county staff reports that supported the plan, contending that 
they overestimated the cost-savings benefits from cuts in utility usage, 
custodial services and sick leave. The first report said the program saved the 
county nearly $1 million, and the revised report recalculated the savings at 
$271,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he figured that the plan, which had an original goal of saving 
$1.1 million a year, ended up costing the county as much as $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan was an experiment where the projected savings did not materialize," 
Stanton told his colleagues Tuesday. "We should have our doors open five days a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing work plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, offering 
such services as welfare assistance, health care, building permits and tax 
collection, are closed every other Friday. The offices are open longer during 
the week to make up for Friday shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the plan is widely supported among the county's 16,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 While board members said they are sensitive to employee morale, they were more 
concerned about providing full public access to county facilities every working 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she found it "hard to justify what we have 
been doing" if the cost savings did not pan out. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined Stanton in proposing a modified work plan that allows flexible work 
schedules for employees provided that offices are open five days a week. Board 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who said he wanted to continue the current work plan, 
reluctantly joined the four other supervisors in supporting the modified plan. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he expects the new plan to 
be in effect by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers just didn't materialize," Schneider said of the current work 
plan. "We'll get ready to implement the new plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Berardino, a spokesman for the Orange County Employees Assn., said his 
members will not object to the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three weeks, Stanton had gathered the support of county 
department heads and lobbied his fellow board members in an effort to sink the 
existing work plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanton's campaign made him the target of attacks regarding his own work 
habits. Riley chided Stanton, contending that the supervisor logged the least 
time in the office of any supervisor. Stanton defended his work ethic and 
called the remarks against him attempts to "divert" the public attention from 
the work-plan issue.

NEW FACES EXPAND DIVERSITY ON CITY COUNCILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Voters in Orange County's municipal elections appeared to rack up a number of 
firsts Tuesday, with early returns indicating Orange would get its first female 
mayor, Santa Ana its first Latino mayor, and Anaheim its first Latino 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a surprise development in Fullerton, one of three councilmen ousted in 
a June recall election was heading for a reelection victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of term limits and the large number of veteran politicians stepping 
down, voters had an opportunity to give local politics a new face. 
</P>
<P>
 Community volunteer Joanne Coontz, who in 1986 became the first woman to win a 
council seat in Orange, seemed poised to become the city's first female mayor. 
She downplayed gender as a factor in the race, saying that "I haven't even 
thought about it. I just want to be a good mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Lou Lopez appeared headed for a seat on the council. If elected, 
he would be the first Latino to win a council seat in a city where 31% of the 
290,000 residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an American of Hispanic descent, and I want to be a positive role model 
for the whole community," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana council race featured the largest field of candidates in city 
history. Among them was Miguel A. Pulido Jr., who was trying to become the 
city's first Latino mayor, and was ahead in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care about the city," Pulido said. "I have my business here, my home here, 
and I'm prepared to do the job we need done. We have a long way to go, but i'm 
ready to work on that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana mayor's seat became vacant when longtime Mayor Daniel H. Young, 
like many of his political peers in Orange County, opted to step away from the 
political limelight. Nine additional candidates jockeyed for three open council 
seats, bringing the field to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, Don Bankhead, one of the three council members ousted in the 
June recall election after voting for a 2% utility tax, was ahead. "The people 
who really care about Fullerton realize that they have been misled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Orange also had a wide choice of candidates -- 13 in all -- for two 
council seats and the post of mayor. Coontz's opponents for mayor included Juan 
Pablo Serrano Nieblas, a self-described shaman, and Fred L. Barrera, a 
five-term council member and co-founder of the Orange National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove, one-term Mayor Frank Kessler decided not to run for 
reelection, citing frustration with council in-fighting. In the race to succeed 
him, Councilman Ho Chung, an insurance agent, appeared to be losing his quest 
to become the county's first directly elected Asian American mayor. Councilman 
Bruce A. Broadwater staked out an early lead in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve other candidates vied for two council seats, including incumbents Mark 
Leyes and Robert F. Dinsen, who appeared headed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly faced a challenge from community activist 
Curtis A. Stricker. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the seven seats on the Newport Beach council were up for grabs, and a 
new face on government was assured by the city's two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
 New blood was also the theme in Huntington Beach, where a near-record 22 
candidates ran for four seats, among them only one incumbent, Ralph Bauer, who 
was leading all vote-getters. Not since 1966, when 27 candidates were on the 
ballot, had so many sought election to the seven-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Habra council race was marred by violence against one of the five 
candidates running for two open seats. Civic activist Dorothy May Rush, known 
for her outspokenness against gangs and crime, had her home firebombed and then 
shot at. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time to just tolerate gangs is over," said Rush, who was leading in early 
returns. "It is now time to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach also underwent change. Incumbent council members Robert F. Gentry 
and Lida Lenney, who helped shape the city's liberal politics during the past 
decade, did not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The only incumbent seeking reelection was Mayor Ann Christoph, who was in 
danger of being ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, Tony Lam, the nation's first Vietnamese American to win an 
elected office, was in a tough fight for a second term on the city council. 
Margie L. Rice, a Garden Grove school board member, and Craig Schweisinger, an 
incumbent councilman, held a slight lead over Lam.

ELECTIONS '94; SCHOOL BOARDS; MOST INCUMBENTS, A FEW CHALLENGERS LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Incumbents were ahead in many Orange County school board races Tuesday night, 
with a handful of conservative challengers holding leads in early election 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than a third of the precincts counted in many districts, 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District candidate Wendy Leece -- who ran 
unsuccessfully four years ago by blasting the district's sex-education program 
-- was leading write-in candidate Oscar Santoyo and longtime incumbent Roderick 
H. MacMillian, whose name remained on the ballot though he recently withdrew 
from the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, where the election of a 
conservative challenger would change the balance of power on a bitterly divided 
school board, moderate incumbents Bobbee Cline and Dore J. Gilbert retained 
strong leads in early election returns, despite strong campaigns waged by 
conservatives Dave Schultz and Pat Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz blamed his likely defeat on rumors about his connections to the 
religious right, saying: "When somebody labels you . . . it's difficult to 
shake that label off." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents were leading in all four community college districts, the Laguna 
Beach, Los Alamitos and Tustin unified school districts and most of the small 
elementary districts in northern and western Orange County. Two of three 
incumbents in the Anaheim Union High School District were also among the top 
three vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove Unified School District, the largest local district with 
seats up for grabs this year, conservatives Terry Cantrell and Bob Harden were 
leading incumbents Dick Hain and Frank E. Noe with one-third of the precincts 
counted. In the Irvine Unified School District, early returns showed Hank Adler 
ahead of incumbent Steve McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove front-runner Cantrell said he would try to raise academic 
standards in his district. "The reason I ran is that I was tired of griping," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, who was running second behind incumbent Margie Wakeham, promised to 
reduce class sizes and said: "Public education has to reinvent itself." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Capistrano Unified School District, absentee voters favored Dorsey 
Brause -- vice president of a local Christian college and head of the South 
County chapter of the right-wing California Republican Assembly -- over 
incumbent Annette B. Gude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time the conservatives have really come together in these 
school board races. The support that we've gotten is phenomenal," said Mark 
Bucher, leader of the Education Alliance, a countywide group formed this year 
to elect conservatives to school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The groundswell has just been incredible," Bucher said. "We're certainly not 
planning on winning all of our races by any stretch of the imagination, but 
this movement is growing in strength everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative and religious groups had targeted Orange County school board 
races during this campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition held an organizational meeting in Orange 
County this fall to help mobilize voters. And the Education Alliance -- a 
political action committee that sprang from last year's failed statewide 
campaign to provide parents with educational vouchers -- helped finance about 
30 candidates in 15 districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for the first time, members of Orange County's largest church, Calvary 
Chapel of Costa Mesa, produced their own voter's guide, which listed local 
candidates' views on issues such as homosexuality, abortion and euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 Leece, Cantrell, Harden and Adler were all backed by the Education Alliance, 
as were Schultz and Soriano. Several of them were also endorsed by the 
California Republican Assembly, which represents the far-right faction of the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very hard race for me," Leece said Tuesday night. "I've been 
attacked and criticized. . . . I hope this vindicates me and what I stand for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Alliance spent about $36,000 in October buying spots on 
conservative slate mailers and helping candidates contact absentee voters.

ELECTIONS '94; LEGISLATURE; REPUBLICANS SAIL IN ALL RACES EXCEPT FOR UMBERG'S 
SEAT

 As expected, the Republican Party coasted to easy victories Tuesday in all but 
one of Orange County's state legislative races -- the bitterly contested 69th 
Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's GOP incumbents -- state Sen. Rob Hurtt, Assemblyman Ross Johnson, 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy and Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen -- led by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
 In South County, which shares districts with north San Diego County, state 
Sen. William A. Craven appeared to be headed for another victory, his fifth in 
the Senate, and Assemblyman Bill Morrow was far ahead in his race for a second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily the hottest legislative race in the county, and one of the most closely 
watched in the state, took place in the 69th Assembly District, a seat being 
vacated by Democrat Tom Umberg, who ran for attorney general. Early returns 
made this race too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Two relatively unknown political newcomers, Democrat Mike Metzler, a longtime 
president of the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, and Republican Jim Morrissey, a 
tool and die maker, slugged it out right up to the final hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see if we can straighten out some of the mess professional politicians 
have created," said Morrissey, who clung to a slim lead. "We're told we have 
the best Assembly campaign in California. . . . When you come across and tell 
them the truth and are honest and above board, they'll back you." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler said: "We are very encouraged by the early results. All indications 
are that there has been a higher number of Democrats turning out this year than 
four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes were high for both parties in this largely Latino, blue-collar 69th 
District, encompassing parts of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats wanted desperately to hold on to this, their only legislative seat 
in the county. In the 34th Senate District race, Buena Park Councilwoman Donna 
L. Chessen was heading to defeat by Hurtt, a wealthy manufacturer and chairman 
of the Senate Elections Committee. Chessen hammered away at Hurtt throughout 
the campaign for his strong stand against abortion rights and his support of 
last year's school-voucher initiative. The working-class district includes 
parts of Garden Grove, Buena Park, Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 68th Assembly District, which spreads out among parts of Garden Grove, 
Westminster, Anaheim and Buena Park, popular Anaheim City Councilman Irv 
Pickler was losing to Pringle (R-Garden Grove), a very tough campaigner who has 
quickly risen to the Assembly's No. 2 GOP post. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, Democrats were given little, if any, chance to win 
long-held Republican seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District, a heavily Republican area including Costa Mesa, 
Newport Beach, Irvine and parts of Laguna Beach, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills and 
Leisure World, Marilyn C. Brewer handily defeated Democrat Jim Toledano. 
</P>
<P>
 In South County's 38th state Senate District, which includes much of north San 
Diego County, Craven (R-Oceanside) was expected to be easily reelected to his 
fifth and final term over Democrat Thomas Berry of Laguna Hills, an educational 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 71st Assembly District, Conroy (R-Orange), despite a reprimand by a 
state committee on sexual harassment charges, enjoys the most Republican 
district in the state. Conroy, who won notoriety for sponsoring a bill that 
would have required the paddling of juvenile graffiti violators, easily 
defeated Democrat Jeanne Costales in a district that includes Tustin, Villa 
Park and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 72nd Assembly District, Johnson (R-Placentia) shrugged off charges that 
he doesn't live in the district and will soon move to Newport Beach to run for 
the state Senate. He won handily over Democrat Allan L. Dollison in a district 
that includes Fullerton, Yorba Linda and Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen (R-Cypress) won her sixth term in the 67th District, which covers 
Huntington Beach and the surrounding cities. Her opponent was Jonathan 
Woolfe-Willis, an attorney and treasurer of the Democratic Foundation of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 A rematch of the 1992 race was held in the South County's 73rd Assembly 
District, where Morrow (R-Oceanside) again defeated Democrat Lee Walker, a 
Saddleback College English and journalism professor.

ELECTIONS '94; CONGRESS; COUNTY'S ALL-REPUBLICAN DELEGATION EASILY SURVIVES

 As Republicans across the nation rolled up big gains in the House of 
Representatives, Orange County's congressional incumbents were coasting to easy 
victories Tuesday, with all six expected to retain their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The returns showed the county's Republican incumbents leading their Democratic 
and third-party challengers by wide margins. That held true even in the closest 
race, in the 46th Congressional District, with Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) comfortably ahead of Democrat Mike Farber, a Santa Ana businessman who 
had waged a relentless campaign against the pugnacious conservative, and 
Libertarian Richard G. Newhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan called the nationwide Republican sweep a "great moment in American 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Farber attributed Dornan's apparent easy victory to a "tremendous media 
blitz," particularly in the final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the county's other congressional districts, the results were even 
more lopsided, with the congressmen outdistancing their rivals by ratios of two 
or even three to one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 45th Congressional District, which takes in northwest Orange County, 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the Republican incumbent, appeared to have defeated his 
Democratic opponent, attorney Brett Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) was savoring his victory and that of his 
fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that there's a wave sweeping across Orange County," he said, 
wading into a crowd of GOP celebrants at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in 
Costa Mesa. "We Republicans in Orange County like to ride the waves. We also 
like to make waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, who waged an aggressive, well-organized campaign, had attacked 
Rohrabacher's support for Proposition 187 and his voting record on such issues 
as crime and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st Congressional District, which includes a sliver of northern Orange 
County as well as sections of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, Rep. Jay 
C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), the one-term incumbent, easily survived a challenge 
from Democrat Ed Tessier, an urban redeveloper. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the first Korean American elected to Congress, ran a low-key campaign and 
never seemed in danger of losing his seat, despite a continuing investigation 
into possible violations of federal election, tax and labor laws related to his 
former engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 39th Congressional District, which straddles northern Orange and 
southern Los Angeles counties, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) was well ahead of 
his opponents, Democrat R.O. (Bob) Davis and Libertarian Jack Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same story in the 47th District in central and coastal Orange 
County, where Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) was headed toward a 
resounding victory over Democrat Gary Kingsbury and Libertarian Victor A. 
Wagner Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 And in the 48th District, which includes parts of southern Orange County and 
sections of Riverside and San Diego counties, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) 
was easily outpacing his Democratic opponent, Andrei Leschick, as well as Peace 
and Freedom candidate Donna White. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the 46th District that drew most of the funding and grabbed most of 
the headlines in the county's congressional races this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan and Farber had waged a heated, highly personal battle for the voters of 
the central Orange County district, which takes in portions of Anaheim, Garden 
Grove and Santa Ana. Together, they papered the district with mailers, although 
Dornan outspent his opponent by a ratio of nearly 10 to one.

WORK BEGINS ON IRVINE 21-SCREEN MOVIE COMPLEX; DEVELOPMENT: THE THEATERS ARE 
PART OF A $30-MILLION ENTERTAINMENT AND RETAIL CENTER. THE FIRST SCREENINGS ARE 
SCHEDULED FOR NEXT FALL. 
</P>

 Construction on what could be the nation's largest cinema complex -- a 
135,000-square-foot theater center with seating for 5,800 moviegoers -- begins 
today just north of the El Toro Y, where the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinema complex, part of a $30-million entertainment and retail center 
designed to resemble a Moroccan village, will have 21 screens. Four of the 
theaters will have screens more than three stories tall and seat 500 moviegoers 
each. One screen will be devoted to art and foreign films, and another -- 
possibly outside the main building -- will only be used for coming-attraction 
trailers and cartoons. Parking for 4,500 vehicles will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a landmark for Orange County," said Keith Eyrich, a vice 
president in the retail division of the Irvine Co., which is building the 
entertainment center in partnership with Edwards Theaters Circuit Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinema complex -- scheduled to open in October -- will be on a 
235,000-square-foot site off Irvine Center Drive in the Irvine Spectrum, the 
developer's 3,600-acre office park. 
</P>
<P>
 The theaters are part of an entertainment center that will include a food 
court called "Oasis" and a plaza designed as a bazaar where kiosks selling 
food, crafts and accessories could be set up. Book and music stores are 
planned, as are four major restaurants. Other courtyard areas will have 
fountains. 
</P>
<P>
 With nighttime activities, the center will likely have some outside lighting 
displays, such as computer-generated laser lighting, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a wonderful theater. It will be a destination," said James Edwards 
Sr., chairman of Newport Beach-based Edwards Theatres Circuit, Orange County's 
largest chain of movie theaters. "We have many neighborhood theaters, but 
things change. We need more modern theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 A miniature locomotive is planned for inside the theater to entertain children 
with rides, Edwards said. The theaters will all have digital sound and one 
screen may be devoted exclusively to Spanish- and other foreign-language films, 
said Edwards. Some of the theaters will have amphitheater-style seating to give 
moviegoers a clearer view. 
</P>
<P>
 At 21 screens, the Edwards complex will surpass the 18-screen Cineplex Odeon 
located next to Universal Studios-Hollywood, now the largest in California. 
Though a theater under construction in Texas is set to have 24 screens, 
developers and entertainment analysts believe the Irvine center will be the 
nation's largest in square footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entertainment center will be the downtown of Orange County," said 
Frederick O. Evans, the Irvine Co.'s retail division president. "We want to 
create a play place and still provide services to the 35,000 daytime residents 
of the Irvine Spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo resident Tamara Anthony, a manager at AST Research Corp. 
headquarters at the Irvine Spectrum, said she is looking forward to seeing 
movies right after work. Though concerned about increased traffic, Anthony said 
"the good outweighs the bad." Real-estate watchers said the entertainment 
complex should fill a need in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different, it's bigger and it's easy to get to. These all combine to 
make a very exciting project," said Greg Mickelson, a vice president in the 
retail division of the Koll Co., a Newport Beach development company. "The size 
of the screens and the arena seating -- I think it intensifies the movie 
experience and makes it more unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the nation's largest theater companies are building megaplexes; AMC 
has begun construction of a 24-screen, 80,000-square-foot complex near Dallas. 
Currently, the nation's largest movie complex is a 20-screen theater in Grand 
Rapids, Mich., according to Jim Kozack, spokesman for the National Assn. of 
Theater Owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Edwards complex will be at one of Southern California's most 
congested freeway interchanges, county planners have said they do not expect 
cinema buffs to have trouble getting there, thinking that most movie fans would 
be arriving in the evening, after the afternoon rush-hour. And $247-million in 
improvements are underway at the El Toro Y interchange to help ease congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum business park, opened in 1974, was always planned to include a 
retail development. As early as 1976, the Irvine Co. unveiled plans for a 
$300-million shopping mall that would have opened by 1980 on land at the 
current site, which was then called "The Golden Triangle." The company's 
ambitious plans included an enclosed mall anchored by Nordstrom and four other 
department stores, more than 100 adjacent shops, a 350-room hotel and an ice 
rink.  
</P>
<P>
 Those plans were never realized, but Irvine Co. officials said that plans for 
a regional mall are back on the drawing board and could be unveiled next year.

CKE, PARENT OF CARL'S JR., ALTERS ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 CKE Restaurants Inc. on Tuesday announced a series of management appointments 
designed to "strengthen the company's two principal operating units." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman William P. Foley II, 48, took on the additional post of chief 
executive, a role he assumed on a temporary basis Oct. 18 when Donald E. Doyle 
resigned as president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel D. (Ron) Lane, 59, a member of a Foley-led investment group that late 
last year took a controlling interest in CKE Restaurants, was appointed vice 
chairman. Lane also was tapped for the newly created post of chief executive 
officer of Boston Pacific Inc., a CKE Restaurants unit that is opening Boston 
Chicken franchise restaurants throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 CKE Restaurants also selected Tom Thompson, 44, for the newly created position 
of president of its Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. unit, which operates 650 
Carl's Jr. restaurants. Thompson, a longtime Carls' Jr. franchisee, was picked 
as chief operating officer of the burger chain in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry W. Coin, 47, chief operating officer of Boston Pacific Inc. was promoted 
to the new position of president of the chicken restaurant unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The management changes are designed to provide "added breadth to our corporate 
and operating unit structures," Foley said. "We now have strong management 
teams in place for both our operating companies, and I am confident that 
together we can build a great future for CKE." 
</P>
<P>
 The management changes announced Tuesday were prompted in part by the 
departure of Doyle, who is now chief operating officer at Hardee's Food Systems 
Inc., based in Raleigh, N.C. Doyle joined CKE Restaurants in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 CKE Restaurants shares closed up 12.5 cents at $8.375 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Tuesday.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: DEVICE FOR COONAN'S HIV TEST KIT GETS FDA APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coonan Clinical Laboratories Inc. said Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has approved its blood sampling device for use in its proposed 
in-home test for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 This approval permits the Costa Mesa company to submit the final application 
for the remainder of the test kit, called HIV-1 Home Check. 
</P>
<P>
 The kit, which would be available over the counter or through the mail if it 
is approved, would allow purchasers to collect a dried blood sample at home. A 
laboratory analysis of the sample would be performed anonymously by mail.

SENTENCING OF FIRST PENSION OWNERS DELAYED UNTIL DEC. 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has delayed until Dec. 7 the sentencing of the owners of First Pension 
Corp., who admitted to operating a Ponzi scheme for more than 10 years through 
the pension management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing for the three Irvine pension firm operators, originally 
scheduled for Thursday, will be at 8:30 a.m. Dec. 7, according to an order 
signed by U.S. District Judge John G. Davies in Los Angeles this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing, which will be open to the public, will be at the Edward R. 
Roybal Federal Building, 255 E. Temple St., in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Cooper of Villa Park, Valerie Jensen of San Juan Capistrano and 
Robert E. Lindley of Laguna Niguel pleaded guilty in August to defrauding 
thousands of investors of $121.5 million in retirement funds. The company 
owners enticed investors to put money in phony mortgage pools.

BANKERS TO STUDY OFFER FOR ROPAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ropak Corp., a major manufacturer of plastic shipping containers, said Tuesday 
that a special directors committee has hired an investment banking firm to 
evaluate a $53-million bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee of three outside directors retained Wertheim Schroder & Co. Inc. 
in New York to review the cash offer of $10.50 a share from Linpac Mouldings 
Ltd. in Birmingham, England, and determine if it is fair to minority 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roper family, which controls 25.4% of the stock, favors the sale of the 
company. Linpac owns 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald W. Cameron, a Ropak executive, said the acquisition price would be 
worth $80 million because Linpac would pay $53 million for the stock it doesn't 
own and assume about $27 million in Ropak debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak shares were up 12.5 cents Tuesday to close at $10.25 in Nasdaq trading.

 Discovision Associates: The company said Tuesday that it has filed a patent 
infringement suit against Technicolor Videocassettes Inc. for three violations 
of U.S. patent law. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovision, an Irvine research firm that developed several technologies used 
in producing optically read discs, said the Camarillo-based subsidiary of 
Technicolor is using its patented technology to create compact discs and has 
repeatedly refused to enter into licensing agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Technicolor denied any wrongdoing. "It is our policy to comply 
with all valid patents," said Dave Eliot. The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. 
District Court in Delaware, seeks damages and an injunction against further 
infringement by TVI.

ANN CONWAY: COMPANY IN THE LABYRINTH; REAGAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT GIVES AUTHOR, WHO 
WILL SPEAK ON ALZHEIMER'S, OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When President Reagan announced he had Alzheimer's disease, Diana Friel 
McGowin felt two emotions: sadness over his condition and joy over the fact 
that he had gone public. 
</P>
<P>
 An early-stage Alzheimer's patient who is the author of "Living in the 
Labyrinth -- A Personal Journey Through the Maze of Alzheimer's," McGowin, 57, 
knows firsthand of the emotional and psychic pain caused by the disease, a 
progressive degenerative disorder that attacks the brain and results in 
impaired memory, thinking and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reagan's announcement has suddenly made the nightmare of Alzheimer's 
easier to bear for the estimated 4 million U.S. patients and their families, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire Alzheimer community has been hoping for a long time that someone 
acclaimed by the world who is still alive and functioning would step up and say 
they have the disease," said McGowin, who will speak on Friday at the 
Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County's annual conference, "Facing the Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "Families of other Alzheimer patients -- Rita Hayworth, Norman Rockwell -- 
announced it after they were gone because of the unwanted embarrassment (of the 
disease). 
</P>
<P>
 "So, while we always regret to hear we have another fellow traveler, at the 
same time, we are so very proud he is also standing up to be counted." 
</P>
<P>
 McGowin decided to go public with her diagnosis because she "couldn't live in 
shame for something for which there should be no shame," she said during a 
telephone interview from her Orlando, Fla., home. "Until Reagan made his 
announcement, I have been the one thrust into the spotlight because I won't 
shut up about it. I am an intense advocate." 
</P>
<P>
 When she discusses the "Patient's Perspective" at the Pan Pacific Hotel in 
Anaheim on Friday morning, McGowin hopes to show Alzheimer's care-givers and 
members of the health-care industry what one Alzheimer's patient can do for 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to understand how much they could do for us if they just put 
their mind to it," she said. "I will share my perspective mostly, but I will 
also share stories from other patients like me." (For seminar information, call 
(714) 283-1111.) 
</P>
<P>
 McGowin is especially proud of the support group she has founded for newly 
diagnosed Alzheimer's patients. "It has spread across the United States and 
Canada," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get together, share stories, hints, tips, research information -- anything 
we can get our hands on. And we give each other moral support, learn to laugh 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County, where there are 
40,000 patients, organized a support group for the newly diagnosed Alzheimer's 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine what it must be like to be diagnosed with a disease that is 
not only going to kill you, but take away the person that you are," says Carole 
Radzins, the association's executive director. "The support group allows 
patients to sit down with each other and talk about the issues that have been 
eating away at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, spouses and care-givers meet to discuss the issues they're 
trying to face." 
</P>
<P>
 The association raises funds for research through its annual spring benefit, 
"Memories in the Making," a gala exhibit of art by people with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 12 years, the association has focused on providing support for 
the care-giver because Alzheimer's patients were usually diagnosed after they 
were into the dementia phase of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we're beginning to focus on the patient," Radzins said, "because 
patients are being diagnosed earlier. With early diagnosis, more support can be 
given to them."

RELATIONSHIPS: TIME SHARES; JOINT PHYSICAL CUSTODY IS INCREASING AS AN OPTION 
IN DIVORCE CASES. WHEN CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT, CHILDREN MAY BENEFIT BY DIVIDING 
THEIR TIME EQUALLY BETWEEN THE HOMES OF PARENTS.

 Dee Wade of Fountain Valley expected to make traditional divorce arrangements, 
so she was shocked by what the divorce mediator suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's 3-year-old daughter, Veronica, should spend alternate weeks 
living with one parent, then the other, the mediator urged. It's called joint 
physical custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mediator gave me information that showed it could be a positive 
experience, but that just fed my intellect," Wade said. "Emotionally, I wanted 
my daughter with me on a full-time basis." 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years, Wade has a different view. Afraid at first that the 
shuttling between households would damage the girl emotionally, Wade instead 
has seen her daughter grow into a happy, well-adjusted 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her father is a good parent, and we have basically the same ideas in terms of 
rules and how to handle situations," Wade said. "Veronica was happy to stay 
with both of us and has developed friends in both neighborhoods. She's been 
going back and forth since she remembers, and to her this is how life is." 
</P>
<P>
 It's how life is for an increasing number of children and their divorced 
parents as California courts, taking advantage of a pioneering 1980 law that 
allowed joint legal custody, are decreeing joint physical custody as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joint Custody Assn. in Los Angeles, which helped lobby for the 1980 
legislation, estimates that joint legal custody is now being awarded in 80% of 
divorce cases involving children. In about 20% of such cases, parents are also 
being assigned roughly equal time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 All-out child custody battles are notorious for being vitriolic, yet, even in 
seemingly amicable divorces, joint physical custody can be inappropriate, said 
Alexandra Rosenberg, a social worker in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids may experience conflicting loyalties if the parents play each household 
off the other and try to be the better family," she said. Problems are 
compounded when each parent imposes different rules for manners and household 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
 But when joint physical custody works, it works very well, Rosenberg said. 
Children grow up with role models of both sexes, which is nearly impossible to 
duplicate with merely occasional visitation, and each parent gets a regular 
respite from the pressures of single-parent child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising two boys can be exhausting when you're all alone with them," said 
Betty Callaway, 43, an Irvine real estate agent. "When they were younger, I was 
so frazzled by the time they went to their dad's that I couldn't wait for them 
to leave. Then, when it was time for them to come home, I couldn't wait to see 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement has allowed her to better balance her business and her 
child-rearing, Callaway said. "When the kids are at their dad's, I will spend a 
lot of time at work. The weeks they're with me, I focus more attention on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And a joint physical custody arrangement can resolve the problem of fathers 
who, given only occasional visitation, become more like visitors than parents. 
</P>
<P>
 David Foust, 40, of Huntington Beach admitted he had been the breadwinning 
father who spent too much time at work and not enough time with his children. 
"Now, when the kids are with me, I can't stay at work, which is nice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some effects of such arrangements are less obvious. Child support, for 
example, can change dramatically, said Nola McGuire, an Irvine attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 California courts set the amount of child support according to a formula that 
takes into account not only the income of both parents but the time children 
spend in each household. Joint physical custody can reduce or reverse the usual 
child-support situation, sometimes requiring that the mother pay support to the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 More involved fathers are also less likely to become deadbeat dads, according 
to statistics. Fathers who share physical custody of their children pay their 
child support more than 90% of the time, according to the 1993 Census, compared 
to 79% for fathers who just have visitation privileges and 44.5% for fathers 
without visitation provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 And children, given regular, live-in access to their fathers, may avoid 
straying from the path, said Michael Pitts, executive director of the 
Children's Rights Council in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies show that over 80% of people in prison come from single-parent homes. 
Gangs are full of fatherless young people," Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 50 years many children have lost their fathers because of the 
court's obsession with sole-custody determination. The very idea of visitation 
connotes going to see a stranger and implies a tenuous relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jonathan Cannon, a family law judge in Orange County, says there is a 
basic contradiction to such joint physical custody arrangements. "In a way, it 
is ludicrous, because these type of situations require a great deal of 
cooperation between two people who have demonstrated that they can't get 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon said he will agree to such joint custody when couples request it, but 
only under the right circumstances. "If both parents are good parents, then 
getting as close to a 50-50 split as possible is in the best interests of the 
children," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But such arrangements are feasible only when parents live close to one another 
and the child is between 2 and 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the age of 2, I feel children are too young for a 50-50 split. And 
when they reach school age, it is best for their educational development to 
have a primary home during the school year. They should sleep in the same bed 
Monday through Thursday night. In such situations, I would grant a 60-40 or 
65-35 split instead," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no trouble finding examples of joint physical custody succeeding, 
said Leslee Newman, a family law attorney in Anaheim Hills. She originally 
thought such arrangements would fall apart within six months, but "I've been 
surprised to find that shared custody arrangements, such as week on, week off, 
are lasting longer. In some cases, such arrangements are lasting eight to 10 
years. People are beginning to find that the best parents are both parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children are the greatest boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to see just my mom or just my dad," said Veronica Wade. "I'd 
miss the other parent too much. I like seeing them both the same amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Callaway, 12, who has alternated weeks living with one of his parents 
since he was 6, said, "I like living with both of my parents. In the beginning 
I got a little confused, but I'm older now, and I'm used to it. I wouldn't be 
happy if I only lived with one parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Carissa Terry, 14, of Huntington Beach, said she wouldn't have it any other 
way, even though she dislikes packing her bags every Monday to move to her 
other parent's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been living with both my parents a week at a time since I was 6, and I'm 
close to them both," she said. "Many of my friends just see their dads every 
other weekend, and most of them don't have close relationships with their 
fathers. I wouldn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would her sister Jill, 16. "If I just saw my dad every other weekend, we 
wouldn't be as close. He'd be more like an uncle." 
</P>
<P>
 Their father, Lee Terry, 45, said his child-custody philosophy is simple. He 
may have divorced his wife, he said, but he didn't divorce his kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly feel that fathers should have a chance to have custody. It's their 
duty to raise their children, and I think many men would like to share custody 
if they could." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Wade, father of Veronica, said men should think carefully before 
choosing joint physical custody. Despite the movement for greater child-rearing 
rights for divorced fathers, "A person must be really certain that he's willing 
to become a single parent for half the time." 
</P>
<P>
 You need an understanding boss, because "at times it's necessary to get time 
off at a moment's notice, because your child is sick and your spouse can't 
leave the office," Wade said. You need flexibility and civility in dealing with 
your ex-spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 And you may wind up, as Wade did, buying an entire second wardrobe for your 
children to reduce the need to pack clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, joint physical custody is steadily becoming more common, said James A. 
Cook, president of the Joint Custody Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will become much more popular. The overwhelming drive for this 
generation is the drive for equality. It has absorbed all of us. It's looked 
upon as fairness. It doesn't decide custody -- the best interests of the child 
decides custody -- but we're finding that equality gets closest to that."

ONE OF 'LAS GIRLFRIENDS' CELEBRATES LATINO CULTURE; AUTHOR: DENISE CHAVEZ ISN'T 
MOVED BY THE FAME SHE HAS RECEIVED FOR HER FIRST BOOK. SHE JUST WANTS TO TELL 
HER TALES, RE-STUCCO HER HOUSE AND HELP HER FATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before embarking on a 7 1/2-year odyssey to complete her first novel, Denise 
Chavez already knew what the last phrase would be: ni modo.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of that whole kind of philosophy that we Latinos have where your roof 
caves in, your sink goes out on you, everything bad, but you got to go on with 
life," Chavez explained in a recent interview. " Ni modo. No matter what 
happens to you, you are a survivor. You endure. You keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what her novel's protagonist, Soveida Dosamantes, does in "Face of an 
Angel" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1994), an earthy, colorful tale of a woman 
seeking the meaning of service, both personally and in her three-decade career 
as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's what Chavez, 46, has been doing since she started a journal at age 8, 
growing up in Las Cruces, N.M., and continuing through today as she prepares 
for her next novel without concern about how her current book sells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fame is not something that interests me," she said. "I would like to have 
enough money to re-stucco my house, and I would like to have enough money to 
help my father (whom she has cared for since he suffered a stroke 10 years 
ago). But I'm still going to be in Las Cruces. I know where my heart is and 
where my strength comes from: the landscape, the mountains, friendship, my 
cultura . 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no expectations of life. My dream was to work at the Dairy Queen. I 
look forward to becoming a viejita (a little old lady) 'cause then I can really 
get into my characters even more." 
</P>
<P>
 But like it or not, fame has reached Chavez because of mostly glowing reviews 
of her debut novel, which was a selection of the Book of the Month Club and the 
Quality Paperback Book Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In its September issue, Vanity Fair named Chavez as one of "Latina 
literature's new doyennes." 
</P>
<P>
 The group of Latina writers, who call themselves "Las Girlfriends" and sing 
one another's praises while providing endless support, include Ana Castillo 
("The Mixquiahuala Letters"), Julia Alvarez ("How the Garcia Girls Lost Their 
Accents") and Sandra Cisneros ("The House on Mango Street"). 
</P>
<P>
 For the dust jacket of "Angel," Cisneros calls Chavez a " chismosa par 
excellence -- a gossip, a giver-away of secrets, a teller of tales our mama 
told us not to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa McKenna, a USC English professor who teaches a class on Chicano/Latino 
literature, said Chavez's work stands out because it has a "performative 
writing quality." 
</P>
<P>
 "Denise has a wonderful mixture of a narrative writer with a good grasp of 
character, and a playwright," McKenna said. "It has to do with the visual 
quality of where you can almost see (her work) staged." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because Chavez -- who received her bachelor's degree in drama from 
New Mexico State and earned master's degrees in drama from Trinity University 
and in creative writing from the University of New Mexico -- is also a 
dramatist whose plays have been produced at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland 
and Joseph Papp's Festival Latino de Nueva York. 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of the theater faculty at the University of Houston who now 
teaches creative writing at New Mexico State, Chavez has toured with her 
one-woman play, "Women in the State of Grace," featuring nine diverse Latino 
characters ages 7 to 78. 
</P>
<P>
 "A synthesis of all my experiences have come together in 'Angel,' " said 
Chavez, previously best known for her collection of short stories, "The Last of 
the Menu Girls." "Drama taught me how to see things and also to listen to 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez also picked up storytelling skills from her mother (who died 11 years 
ago) and extended family, who spent summers in a small town called Redford in 
western Texas, sitting in the shade, eating watermelon and telling embellished 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The untold stories were always the ones that, as kids, we found the most 
interesting," she said. "Like the one about why one of my uncles had only half 
an ear. The story was that he'd been in a terrible accident, but we knew there 
was more to it. Back then people seemed to live life more deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they weren't telling stories, they were reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got so damn hot sometimes all you could do was read," she said. "I 
remember my grandmother loved to read. She found a joy in the language. These 
were people who had a love of literature and language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother, however, might have bristled at some of the language in 
"Angel," which at times is raunchy in chronicling three generations of women 
dealing with the Mexican tradition of serving husbands and God. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez also talks about incest, alcoholism, religion, relationships and 
machismo, issues that many Latino families believe should remain behind closed 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might see this as an indictment and say it has too many (vulgarities), 
it's too sexy, it has too much genitalia," she said. "But that in itself is a 
liberation for a woman to be able to speak the unspeakable. Latinas never talk 
about their sexuality. I've had a miscarriage, and women never talk about 
miscarriages. Women never talk about their aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think I show the good aspects of our culture, too. That we are 
passionate, loyal and long-suffering. We are a people of survivors. These are 
secrets of the human heart. To empower people to become the faces that we are 
without these masks. To be able to speak the truth of our families without 
shame, without whispers." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's McKenna agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women writers want to confront the issues of sexuality in the family, 
especially in their complexity," she said, "as opposed to presenting an image 
of what the family is. That runs the gamut from abuse to personal 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not airing dirty laundry. Latinos are human beings. We no longer need to 
create an image of what we're suppose to be to make ourselves acceptable to 
other people. It's no longer an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 And Chavez does not place all the blame on Latino men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women complain that men never change, but it's not just the men. Women don't 
change either. The mother is always running to take care of her sons and her 
husband. It's the mothers who are responsible for bringing up children who are 
unbalanced." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Angel," "Soveida is making her pilgrimage in search for ways to become 
complete and balanced. She is asking why are we here on this Earth? Are we here 
to serve or to be served? It's a little of both. We can't help other people 
unless we take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations in the book are a mixture of Spanish and English, the way Chavez 
grew up speaking in southern New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I purposefully did not want them to italicize the Spanish words because then 
they become separate," she said of an early fight with her editor, who in one 
of their first discussions asked her what a pinata is. "It's time for readers 
to pick up a little Spanish. It's like a plate of food with salsa, with the 
Spanish words the salsa. It gives it flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said her next novel will be from the point of view of a 70-year-old man 
with a Mexican mother and an Anglo father. The working title is "The King and 
Queen of Comezon." 
</P>
<P>
 " Comezon is an itch," Chavez explains, "but it is also a longing that can 
never be satisfied. When you straddle the world of multiculturalism, you live 
in a world where you are a Mexican but have another world to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot to learn from men and being in the voice and heart of a man. I'm 
really looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't have an ending yet.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOHN ANDERSON: ROUGH 'N' RELIABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Anderson's voice is better than money in the bank, to paraphrase one of 
the hits that contributed to his now long-running comeback story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble on Monday at the Crazy Horse was getting your hands on it. Between 
a sound mix that reduced his singing to the level of the band's instruments and 
Anderson's habit of bobbing his head in and out of microphone range, the voice 
that should have commanded the performance was as elusive as money in a sinking 
S&L. 
</P>
<P>
 That put a slight damper on the continuing celebration of the Florida native's 
notable return to prominence in the country field. A contender for greatness in 
the early '80s, he had all but disappeared by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Eagles-like "Straight Tequila Night" hit No. 1 in 1992, Anderson 
was on a roll. This year he received a career achievement award from the 
Academy of Country Music and, maybe even more rewarding because it recognizes 
his current work, a Country Music Assn. nomination for male vocalist of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback has been warmly received because Anderson embodies class and 
modesty and because it easily is seen as a rare and refreshing case of true 
talent and perseverance finding their reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs that sparked the return are uneven, but there's no doubting that 
rough-hewn voice. Like a fine rocking chair, it's solid, full of grain and 
character, comfortable and embracing. And it swings, in a limited, predictable 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was typically direct Monday, bringing a genuineness to his ballads 
and a wry, knowing playfulness to the driving boogie and honky-tonk tunes -- 
such as the current single "Country 'til I Die," in which he revitalizes the 
standard scenario of a country boy being perplexed by the weird music and fancy 
food at a big-city party. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was solid and professional -- not quite perfunctory, but 
businesslike, with no surprises or revelations. The bearded, flashily jacketed 
singer looked like a billy goat who'd charged through a sequin factory, and his 
main expression of immediacy was his eye-contact interplay with the members of 
his uncommonly sharp band. Missing were moments of all-out release and 
spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The set was a well-planned mix of medium-tempo and upbeat tunes, with a few 
early songs dropped in among the predominantly recent material. It was capped 
by "Seminole Wind," Anderson's sentimental but deeply felt and musically rich 
lament for the destruction of Florida's cultural and natural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 It also included his biggest hit, 1983's "Swingin,' " which he has re-recorded 
on his new album. We know he's environmentally conscious, but this might carry 
recycling a little too far.

THEATER REVIEW; GIVING UP THE GHOST: OVERACTING DAMPENS 'SPIRIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The only fan letter George M. Cohan ever wrote was to Noel Coward; he admired 
Coward's ability to underplay. A contained actor himself, Cohan once directed 
Spencer Tracy to "act less." 
</P>
<P>
 If director Lisa Gary had given that admonishment to her cast in Coward's 
"Blithe Spirit" at the La Habra Depot Theatre, her production might have 
reached its peak comic level. Coward's humor comes from natural and honest 
readings of lines that aren't necessarily funny in themselves; "a good red 
herring" can get a laugh when the dialogue is easy and conversational -- the 
trick in mining Coward's words for their gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary's tempos are bright; the cues are picked up in fine style, and the 
British tone is understood. But everyone in the company overacts beyond the 
limit of Coward's brittle, precise writing. It isn't disastrous. The charming 
story -- of a medium summoning up a man's late wife, much to the chagrin of his 
present wife -- is enough for most audiences. But it deserves more. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of Coward is missing primarily from Stacy Velky's performance as 
the medium, Madame Arcati. Velky has a marvelous low register to her voice, and 
that's where it should remain. Presumably to be more comic, she lets her voice 
drift up into a screech, losing not only many of her words but most of her 
laughs and her character's charm. 
</P>
<P>
 As husband Charles, Darren Boyett is more restrained, but even he is inclined 
to punch too hard and too often. As his suffering wife Ruth, Charlotta Nutley 
begins at a good level, but, with the manifestation of the late Elvira (Andrea 
Stradling), she becomes violently and bitterly angry -- and that's the end of 
her laughs. Stradling's reading as the unwanted ghost is safer, though one 
wishes she would resist the tendency to pose her arms prettily in the air in an 
effort to appear heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore Di Vita is properly relaxed and officious as a friend who shares the 
seance and its aftermath, and Judy Jones is particularly and singularly 
effective -- with admirable restraint -- as the friend's wife. But as maid 
Edith, Christina Dickinson is too busy trying to look and act funny to get any 
laughs.

MUSIC; COMPOSING A CLASSICAL 'MIRACLE'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crossing between two music worlds isn't such a stretch, jazz composer and 
keyboardist Lyle Mays says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not all that different -- jazz and classical music," Mays said in a 
recent phone interview from his home in Wisconsin. "There is a huge difference 
between a jazz player and a classical player, but I don't think there is much 
difference between a jazz player and a composer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good (jazz) player has to come up with compositions on the spot. In 
classical, there are questions of making it more formal -- and there are a ton 
of other differences -- but I think the leap is less in composition than in 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Composition and performance will be on display Thursday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center when Mays' latest classical piece, "Twelve Days in the 
Shadow of a Miracle," gets its premiere by the Debussy Trio, which commissioned 
it. The title stems from the long personal crisis in Mays' life that inspired 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our family was experiencing a lot of difficulties," Mays, 40, said. "My 
partner's father had a crisis with Parkinson's disorder. At one point in the 
middle of this crisis, he had a marvelous recovery with some drug therapy. It 
reminded me very much of what (neurologist-author) Oliver Sacks wrote about in 
'Awakenings.' I was struck how he described these recoveries as miraculous. It 
was one of the few times that he felt the word could be used in modern 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite an event. So I felt this was indeed miraculous. It affected us 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 To try to capture that sense of the miraculous, Mays tried to structure the 
work, he said, "like the way life unfolds. The form is not chaotic. It has a 
kind of organization like our lives have organization. Some things recur, some 
go away and we never see them again. It's a combination of natural forms and 
patterns that emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His own life has followed what he calls "a very natural progression into 
jazz." He was born and raised in northeastern Wisconsin. "Wausaukee was the 
nearest town. It had 500 people. We were 15 miles away from that." His father 
had taught himself to play guitar and to sing. His mother played organ and 
piano for the church. They created an environment that encouraged his fooling 
around on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, jazz was a very natural progression. The more I got into music and 
played, the more it was natural to play and embellish things. The 
embellishments got more elaborate. I was never stopped. I was always 
encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 He began going to summer jazz camps and festivals, eventually meeting 
guitarist Pat Metheny in Wichita in 1975. The two didn't get a chance to play 
together until a year later in a small club in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just clicked from the first tune we played," Mays said. "We vowed to 
do something. Shortly thereafter, he formed a band in Boston. I thought he was 
kind of nuts. We were just kids. I didn't think he could make a go of it. But 
it worked and has been working ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his work with Metheny, which has brought them a number of 
awards, including several Grammy nominations, Mays has toured with jazz singer 
Bobby McFerrin and recorded with singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and others. He 
began composing for PBS television shows and Hollywood films in the early '80s 
and soon began getting serious about writing classical chamber-music pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was toying with the idea all through the early part of the '80s," he said, 
"studying, researching, sketching. Among musicians," he added, "there is this 
thought that there is good music and (there is) other music. The style question 
isn't all that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Debussy Trio commission, however, posed a challenge because of the group's 
uncommon combination of harp, flute and viola. He had never written for harp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I had to take some harp lessons," he said. "It's played so 
differently from a piano; I felt I had to know a lot more about it before I 
could write for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays also started experimenting in playing on a keyboard and recording the 
results directly into his computer. "I can manipulate (my ideas) much faster, 
getting improvisational in the process" that way. 
</P>
<P>
 It also led to some new problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going really fast and furious; I was really happy with the results. 
Then I realized that, other than a few sketches, I had nothing written out, and 
the piece was getting rather large." 
</P>
<P>
 To solve the problem, he contacted a friend who told him about a program that 
was supposed turn music recorded in the computer's memory into a printed score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it turned out a raw mess," Mays said. "Computers are stupid. They 
interpret things literally. If I would play in an arpeggio, the computer would 
print out a (smear). Well, in writing for a harp, there are lots of arpeggios." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he feels that the process was worth it because the result "is a pretty 
true representation of what I was hearing. I didn't change it putting it down 
on paper. It never got simplified inadvertently or made complicated 
inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of translating music ideas to paper and then getting them 
interpreted again is a two-stage process where things can go wrong. Things may 
get improved, but composers can go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, "the piece is not ever finished until the composer and the players 
get together and play it. That's the last stage of editing. I always heard that 
(Claude) Debussy never finished his pieces. There were complaints about that 
back then. So if we don't do all the editing now, it will still be in their 
namesake's tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Debussy Trio will play the premiere of Lyle Mays' "Twelve Days in the 
Shadow of a Miracle" on Thursday at 8 p.m. in Founders Hall, the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The program will 
include works by Debussy, Jan Bach, Ian Krouse and Sofia Gubaidulina. $20, 
general; $8, students. (714) 556-2787.

THEATRE REVIEW; PRETENSE MASQUERADES AS REALITY IN 'SEPARATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us think we'd be able to see through a scam artist, especially one who 
shows up unexpectedly and then offhandedly mentions that he's the son of a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider it: The guy is yammering about this and that and out comes the tidbit 
that dad is none other than, say, Sidney Poitier, the most influential black 
actor of his generation. Does skepticism jump into overdrive as we start 
heading him to the door? 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't in New York City in 1983, when a remarkable young con master and 
petty thief used just such a story to insinuate himself into the lives of 
several upscale families. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright John Guare took the tale, which was detailed in the New York Times 
and featured on "60 Minutes," as the basis for "Six Degrees of Separation," 
currently in an affectingly wry staging at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guare's drama (which wears a light comic overcoat, fitted snugly to this 
production by director Gary Krinke), we first meet Paul Poitier (LaVelle 
Wilson) when he arrives at the chichi home of art dealer Flan Kittredge (Brian 
Kojak) and his striving wife, Ouisa (Arlyn McDonald). 
</P>
<P>
 With a tiny blot of blood staining his conservative dress shirt, Paul explains 
how he was mugged in Central Park. The Kittredges, at first suspicious, offer 
help, especially after Sidney's name comes up. Paul says he's been estranged 
from his illustrious father but is hoping for a reunion now that the elder 
Poitier is in Manhattan preparing a movie adaptation of "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple is thrilled, not only because of Paul's erudition (he gabs 
beautifully on everything, from "Catcher in the Rye" to the precariousness of 
the Communist Bloc) but also at the chance to get bit parts in the flick. They 
chatter gaily about the night as one of the greatest of their lives, and we see 
just how empty and mannered their lives must really be. 
</P>
<P>
 Revealing much more of the plot isn't wise. But it's safe to say that the 
Kittredges start feeling foolish after they catch Paul having sex with a guy he 
picks up and takes to their son's bed. Their skepticism grows as friends reveal 
that Paul has hoodwinked them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Guare slices away at an amazingly small and provincial world in 
the city, where appearances and pretense can pass for reality, and where people 
like the Kittredges and Paul can find comfort by accepting daily masquerades as 
truth. Paul takes on a false, alluring identity to gain entry to a better 
society and class. Flan and Ouisa decide to ignore the superficiality of their 
laughable marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The play isn't about race relations, although Guare does imply that the 
Kittredges' willingness to accept Paul stems from their belief that he's a 
cultured black man, an OK one, really not that different from them. Krinke and 
his able cast have some wicked fun with that, underscoring just how at sea this 
successful but sadly ridiculous twosome actually is. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson needs to project more during his important "Catcher in the 
Rye" speech, his overall performance is apt enough. Guare doesn't adequately 
explain Paul's full motivation for these complicated ruses, and Wilson doesn't 
fill in the gaps. But his portrayal hints at the aberrant psychology, not just 
his yearning for a better identity, that may be at the core of Paul's 
compulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kojak and McDonald have the more vivid roles, and they play them up. Kojak is 
clearly something of a hustler himself, and there's twisted admiration mixed 
with fear in Flan's appraisal of Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 He's complicated, but not close to Ouisa. McDonald (who looks more than a 
little like Stockard Channing, the star of both the original stage version and 
the movie adaptation of "Six Degrees of Separation") reaches beyond the witty, 
overly glib facade of this society princess rapidly turning society matron. 
When she bonds with Paul in ways Flan can't understand, we realize that Ouisa 
is begging for more than the shallowness she has settled for. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Six Degrees of Separation," Fullerton College, 321 E. Chapman Ave., 
Fullerton. Tonight through Friday and Nov. 22 at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. 
Ends Nov. 22. $5 to $8. (714) 871-8101. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes.

 A gala dinner honoring renowned ceramic artist Beatrice Wood and benefiting 
the Archives of American Art will be held Saturday night at the Surf and Sand 
Hotel, 1555 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. Wood, who recently celebrated her 
101st birthday, has lived and worked in Ojai for nearly 50 years.Information: 
(714) 588-2217. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately founded in 1954, the Archives of American Art became a bureau of the 
Smithsonian Institution in 1970. The archives collects, preserves and makes 
available for study more than 12 million documents: the records, original 
papers, photographs, diaries and oral histories of artists, craftsmen, 
collectors, dealers, critics and museums. Federal funding through the 
Smithsonian accounts for 35% of the archives' operating budget; the rest comes 
from individual and corporate gifts.

FULLERTON FAMILY FOUND IN TORCHED CAR; CRIME: VEHICLE CONTAINING THE THREE 
BODIES HAD BEEN COATED WITH FLAMMABLE LIQUID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Fullerton couple were found burned beyond recognition in the back seat of 
their Honda Civic and their 19-year-old son was discovered dead in the trunk of 
the car, which had been set on fire late Monday outside a school, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of Dolores and Edward R. Charles' had called Fullerton police 
Sunday night and reported that a man was screaming for help from inside the 
trunk of a car near her home. But when police arrived, she said, the car was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew (then) someone would turn up dead," said the woman, still shaken 
Tuesday and asking to remain unidentified. "It's very, very weird knowing now 
that they are dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Orange County authorities were investigating the deaths as 
homicides but would reveal few details about the case, including possible 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dental records have been sought to positively identify the parents, however, 
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department late Tuesday released the victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police would only say they received a disturbance call sometime 
after dark Sunday and that there was no car when they arrived in the area. A 
police spokesman said the department had received no missing-persons reports 
about the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the bodies of Dolores Charles, 47, a self-employed typist whose 
clients included attorneys, and Edward Charles, 55, a Fullerton Hughes Aircraft 
engineer, were in the back seat of the car, and their son, Danny Charles, a USC 
voice student and opera singer who has starred in several local theater 
productions, was found in the unburned trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies said they were able to 
positively identify the body of Danny Charles, which was found on a clear 
plastic tarp beside a yellow antifreeze bottle, both undisturbed by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had been coated with a flammable fluid and then set on fire in the 
otherwise vacant parking lot of El Camino Continuing School in La Mirada, a few 
miles from the Sunny Hills neighborhood where the Charleses lived, Deputy Diane 
Hecht said. Residents near the high school saw the flames around 10 p.m. and 
called the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The front left tire of the gray Honda Civic -- shown to the media Tuesday, its 
license plates masked -- had exploded, apparently from the fire's intensity. 
The hood was buckled, the interior had turned into twisted metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have an MO on this crime, we don't have suspects, we don't have a 
motive," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Rich Erickson. "We're asking for 
the public's help." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with any information is asked to call sheriff's detectives at (213) 
980-5500. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the family's spokesman, Wally Negrini, Danny Charles' singing 
teacher, stood on the porch of the family's taupe and glass home and told 
reporters that the family wasn't the type one would expect to have enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan was a teacher's dream," Negrini said through his tears. "He had such 
drive and talent. The whole family were wonderful people. Very supportive 
parents. An all-American, beautiful family. I don't know anything that would 
explain why this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 A surviving son, Eddie Charles Jr., about 21, did not want to be interviewed 
and spent part of Tuesday at the family home with his maternal grandfather and 
four or five others, Negrini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Charles Jr. is a mechanic at a nearby Chevron service station, where a 
co-worker said Tuesday night that officers had questioned some employees, but 
he would not elaborate. "I don't know why they're putting him through this," 
the colleague said. "He's having a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving son did not appear to live at home, but his new black truck had 
recently been outside the home almost daily, a neighbor said. Danny Charles 
lived on campus in a dorm, even acting as a resident adviser for other 
students. But both often visited their parents, friends and neighbors said. The 
Charles sons had both been athletes; Eddie Charles Jr. played soccer, even 
traveling to Europe for some games. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had lived in the neighborhood at least 12 years, when the Charles 
family bought their 1950s-era three-bedroom home atop a slight hill. Homes in 
the Fullerton neighborhood sit on large lots, and curved driveways sport luxury 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The father used to play Dan's opera tapes when he would do yardwork," 
neighbor Jerry Kuhn said. "I heard the tapes one time and asked who it was 
singing, and he proudly said 'That's my son.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Charleses' neighbor who phoned police said she couldn't remember exactly 
when she called 911 Sunday night, but she was walking friends out to their car 
when she heard yells for help coming from the trunk of a car parked a distance 
from her house. 
</P>
<P>
 She could not see anyone inside the car, but only heard the pleas. She said 
she ran inside to call for help and stayed there until the police arrived. By 
then -- "it seemed like 30 minutes," she said -- the car was gone. It was too 
dark, she said, to really see the vehicle's color. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday, she said she had still not spoken with Fullerton police since 
her initial Sunday call. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides confirming Edward Charles was an employee, Hughes Aircraft of 
Fullerton would make no further official comment. But co-workers and other 
company sources said that Edward Charles was a power supply engineer who worked 
at the Hughes division that makes radar display systems for ships. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, the 350-acre Hughes complex near Fullerton Municipal 
Airport was abuzz with the news of the mysterious death of one of its 6,800 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he's the person in the unfortunate accident," said a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word around here is that he hadn't been at work for a few days," said one 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of Edward Charles' death provided more drama to a plant that has been 
on edge for much of this year. In September, Hughes officials announced that 
the facility would be closing at the end of 1995, with 800 to 1,000 workers 
getting laid off and the rest being transferred to other company sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Charles worked from her home, but previously rented office space in a 
tony Irvine building where other tenants remembered her fondly Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One said she was a warmhearted, chain-smoking professional who could always be 
counted on for advice and help. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very sweet. She had a big heart," said Suzie Brierley. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talked about her husband a lot. She seemed very happily married," 
Brierley said. Photos of her sons adorned Dolores Charles' office wall and she 
was often in a hurry to get home to care for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dolores was tremendously involved in the High School of the Arts," said Ralph 
Opacic, executive director of the high school where the youngest Charles son 
graduated in 1992. "She worked with our musical theater department and she did 
all of our publicity, all of our ticket layout and ticket sales. She basically 
was one of our leaders in our booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny was one of the few students who graduated from here who really showed 
tremendous promise and potential to be an actor," Opacic said.  
</P>
<P>
 In his senior year, he said, Danny Charles was named Student of the Year and 
bestowed with half a dozen other awards.

REPUBLICANS NEAR A CLEAN SWEEP IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reaffirming their hold on local politics, Orange County Republicans were steam 
rolling their Democratic rivals at the polls Tuesday, and were on the verge of 
retaking the lone legislative seat now held by a Democrat -- the 69th Assembly 
District in central Orange County, according to returns early today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican bandwagon included the 2nd Supervisorial District race between 
Democrat Linda Moulton Patterson and Republican Jim Silva, who was winning the 
nonpartisan contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat is being vacated by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Republican romp was icing on the cake for GOP stalwarts, who also 
celebrated their party's taking control of both Houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Loping to the stage of the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, Rep. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach) gleefully surveyed the crowd that filled the ballroom and 
spilled out the wide doors as he relayed the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unthinkable, the unimaginable seems to be happening. What's happening 
tonight is truly seismic. It's an earthquake," said Cox, who was the national 
GOP's point man in the campaign to win California House seats. "I knew sometime 
in my lifetime I'd see a Republican Congress. We're going to do exactly the 
opposite of what's been done for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was somber at a Santa Ana union hall, where a live band played before 
a spiritless, small crowd at the Democrats' election night gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing. We worked really hard," said Orange County Democratic 
Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia. "But next week we're going to get together to 
analyze what we did wrong and what we did right." 
</P>
<P>
 The night also proved to be a long one for Orange County politicians in 
statewide races: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) lost in his bid to unseat state 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. Umberg gave up the 69th district seat to run for 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the contest for state superintendent of public instruction, Maureen 
DiMarco, a Democrat from Cypress who serves as Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary of 
child development and education, was losing to Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin 
(D-Fremont). 
</P>
<P>
 As in statewide balloting, the local voting ratio was 2 to 1 in favor of 
Proposition 187 -- the illegal immigration measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won! We won! We won!" said Barbara Kiley, one of the campaign co-chairmen 
for Proposition 187 at a celebration at the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa. "This is what the people wanted. The opposition told all the lies. We 
told the truth. People are sick of illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were fears that high emotions over Proposition 187 might lead 
to disturbances at polling places, officials reported no major problems during 
the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, voting rights activists monitored voting at predominantly 
Latino precincts in central Orange County, fearing Republicans would try to 
intimidate ethnic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, it was a bad Election Day for Democrats, who ran vigorous voter 
registration drives in four central Orange County races in hopes of holding on 
to Umberg's 69th Assembly District seat and perhaps capturing three other seats 
long held by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republicans also were giving Gov. Pete Wilson a huge margin, 
which helped give him victory statewide.  
</P>
<P>
 Republican statewide candidates count on Orange County Republicans to deliver 
2-to-1 vote ratios in order to offset Democratic strongholds in Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Huffington fell short 
of that margin in Orange County throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local Republicans made a strong showing Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the nastiest local race -- the fight for the 46th Congressional District 
-- incumbent Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), was leading his Democratic 
challenger, Mike Farber. Dornan and Farber filed lawsuits against each other 
during the campaign, charging false personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Dornan waged a modest campaign against a low-key Democratic 
opponent, but this year he seemed aggravated by Farber. Dornan dipped into his 
hefty war chest to send a series of campaign mailers that blanketed the 
district in the closing days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the heavily Latino 69th Assembly District, Republican Jim Morrissey was 
leading Democrat Michael Metzler. The 69th district's legislative seat, the 
only one in Orange County held by a Democrat, was vacated by Umberg. Morrissey 
had complained about an election eve "hit" mailer circulated by Democrats, 
which he said falsely accused him of planning to post poll guards at Latino 
voting precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle of Garden Grove was holding back a 
challenge by Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler. Pringle was leading Pickler by a 
2-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republican state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) also was headed toward 
victory in the 34th district race pitting him against Democrat Donna Chessen, a 
Buena Park council member. 
</P>
<P>
 In other local contests, the countywide ballot measure to place a commercial 
airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was the election night 
cliffhanger. Votes in the southernmost portions of Orange County are generally 
among the last to be counted and that could prove significant, because South 
County, near the 4,700-acre Marine base, is a hotbed of Measure A opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. was leading a field of eight 
candidates in the mayor's race. Should a Latino win that seat, it would be the 
first time in modern history that a Latino would be mayor; the city's 
population is 65% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters said that despite being discouraged by the negative tone of the 
election year, they found the tug of voting on Proposition 187 irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those voters was June Frandsen, a Laguna Niguel resident who said she 
emigrated legally from Wales with her parents while a child. "We have a house 
in the desert and we're surrounded by illegal aliens," she said, explaining her 
reason for voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Linares, a college student from Santa Ana, was equally eager to vote -- 
against Proposition 187. "There's a lot of people out there who could not vote, 
so I'm voting for them," she said. "Most of the people who are going to be 
affected can't vote."

EL TORO AIRPORT VOTE APPEARS EVENLY SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters appeared evenly split Tuesday over one of the most divisive land-use 
issues in Orange County history, whether to place a commercial airport at El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other hard-fought campaigns, voters in Dana Point were defeating 
two measures that would allow a $500-million development on the Headlands, 
while voters were approving term limits in Buena Park and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 12 separate ballot measures throughout the Orange County, easily 
the biggest and most divisive was Measure A. Shortly before Election Day, polls 
had shown county voters evenly split on the proposal to build an airport once 
the Marines leave their air station at El Toro in 1999 as part of a federal 
program to reduce the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Grossman, spokesman for anti-Measure A forces, clung to hope that the 
initiative would be defeated on the strength of late-tallied votes from South 
County, where opposition to the airport was running more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are mostly votes from North County precincts, we're delighted. If 
they include South County votes, it's a different story," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the evening, Garden Grove City Councilman Mark Leyes, a Measure A 
supporter, was confident the initiative would pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've made the voters aware of how important a new airport is to the 
county," Leyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the initiative, which was mostly the creation of Newport Beach 
developers George Argyros and Buck Johns, argued that an airport would create 
thousands of jobs and generate millions in revenue for the Orange County 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents attacked the measure as planning through the ballot box because it 
bypasses the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the county agency formed to 
create a development plan for the Marine base. The planning group is studying 
various options for the facility, including a possible airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, Measures C and D would permit development of a 400-room hotel 
and up to 370 homes on 121 acres near Dana Point Harbor, one of the few 
remaining open coastal areas in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The development project was approved by the Dana Point City Council in April, 
but opponents succeeded in gathering enough signatures on a petition to put the 
referendums on the ballot. Backers maintained the development would be 
balanced, scaled down from earlier proposals and generate revenue for the city. 
Foes believe the project would change the area's character and contribute to 
such problems as traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waning weeks of the heated campaign, even the phrase "Save the 
Headlands" became a divisive issue and ended up in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures' foes, who for months had called themselves the "Save the 
Headlands" group, became incensed when proponents used the phrase on campaign 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents won an injunction -- temporarily at least -- preventing the 
pro-development group from using it and similar phrases. The injunction was 
lifted Friday by an appeals court and no final resolution of the matter was 
made by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands property is owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis Securities 
Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., publisher of the 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman with the residents' group that opposes the development was 
encouraged by the returns, particularly since the group had been significantly 
outspent in campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight is a little closer to being over," said Geoffrey Lachner, chairman 
of Save the Headlands. "This is great news." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the project also remained hopeful although the vote was going 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like the trend, but we're still optimistic," said Bill Shepherd, 
co-chairman of the Headlands Fair Plan Committee. "The last election (June city 
election) took several days before we got the final results. We'll be here 
until the last votes are reported." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, an advisory measure that would limit the number of terms served by 
Buena Park City Council members, without specifying the number of terms that 
can be served, was leading in early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin voters were asked to decide on two competing measures to limit the 
number of terms served by council members, as well as a proposal to make city 
contracts for collection and disposal of solid waste and collection of 
recyclable materials subject to competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure H, which limits Tustin council members to two full terms of four years 
each, was winning. The initiative was backed by council members Jim Potts, 
Michael J. Doyle and Tracy Worley. Doyle said the measure was needed to guard 
against "career politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli and Councilman Jeffery M. Thomas offered a 
competing proposal, Measure I, which limits council members to three full 
terms. Voters appeared to be rejecting that initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Councilman Jim Potts, who led the effort to limit council members to 
two consecutive terms, said he was glad voters were not be confused by the 
competing measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we absolutely have to avoid career politicians," he said. "People 
have had it, I've had it. It was a long, hard fight but the people in Tustin 
have finally spoken. And if you can clean up in your back yard, you can do it 
all the way to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the Tustin ballot, Measure J, calling for open bidding for city solid 
waste and recycling contracts, was winning in the returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing the measure, Saltarelli argued that "open bidding will destroy our 
unfettered ability to negotiate for what is best for our residents and will 
increase the cost of trash services." Proponents have said that competitive 
bidding "takes away the schmoozing" between trash haulers and city officials 
and prevents "sweetheart deals" with "shady trash haulers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, voters appeared to be rejecting Measure G, a proposal to 
give the city manager authority to fire or hire the city librarian, currently 
the duty of the city library board. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of voters in recently incorporated Laguna Hills and Lake Forest 
voted for so-called appropriations limits for their cities. State law mandates 
that the measures be placed on the ballot to set a dollar limit for tax 
proceeds the cities can collect. 
</P>
<P>
 The limits, also known as Gann limits, were set years ago for other cities by 
Proposition 4, said David Bass, director of administrative services for Lake 
Forest, which was incorporated in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake Forest, Measure F would set the permanent limit at $12.1 million, Bass 
said. That amount was based on the tax proceeds the city collected in the 
1992-93 fiscal year. In the city's first year of incorporation, it operated 
under a temporary limit set by a county government group -- the Local Agency 
Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure E would set the permanent limit in Laguna Hills, incorporated in 1991, 
at $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap on appropriations for everything except capital expenditures, federal 
mandates and debt service is merely informational, since the formula for 
arriving at the figure is written into state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it passes, it does nothing. If it doesn't pass, it does nothing," Laguna 
Hills Assistant City Manager Don White said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rossmoor, voters were approving Measures K and L, which authorized the 
Rossmoor Community Services District to charge property owners $1.25 per month 
to pay for the upkeep of a 1 1/2-mile red brick wall that surrounds their 
community.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / STATE OFFICES; LUNGREN, FONG BUOYED BY GOP 'TIDAL WAVE'; 
REPUBLICANS LEAD IN ALL BUT ONE PARTISAN CONTEST, IN WHICH CONTROLLER GRAY 
DAVIS CLAIMS VICTORY IN RACE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. QUACKENBUSH, JONES, 
MCCLINTOCK SLIGHTLY AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Republican tidal wave sweeping across the nation spared at least one 
Democrat in partisan statewide races in California, although others were locked 
in contests too close to call late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Democrat able to claim victory based on partial returns was state 
Controller Gray Davis in his race for lieutenant governor against state Sen. 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 However, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat, was just points 
behind Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones in his race to retain that office. 
Democratic businesswoman Kathleen Connell was closing in on former GOP 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, the early leader in the race for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren easily succeeded in his bid for reelection 
over his Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Republicans riding the tide were Matt Fong, who held a firm lead 
over former state Democratic Party chairman Phil Angelides in incomplete 
results for treasurer, and Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush of Cupertino, who 
was leading state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles in the race for insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lone nonpartisan race, Democrat Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin of Fremont 
held a commanding lead over Maureen DiMarco, a Democrat working as Republican 
Pete Wilson's secretary of child development and education and who had the 
backing of her boss. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's race was a particularly vitriolic contest between 
Lungren, the conservative crown prince of California Republican politics, and 
Umberg, a champion of the new Democrats out to prove he could be even tougher 
on crime than the GOP incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg did not immediately concede defeat but acknowledged that there "is a 
tidal wave out there against the Democrats and the wave is crashing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren attributed his victory in part to voters' revulsion over a television 
commercial in which his opponent attempted to link the murder of Polly Klaas to 
the attorney general's failure to adopt a computerized system for tracking 
parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to supporters in Los Angeles, the attorney general called the 
Klaas commercial "the single worst campaign ad this season and some say of any 
season . . . I wanted to rely on the intelligence of the people of California 
to reject it. And they did." 
</P>
<P>
 His bid for statewide office lost, Umberg was assigning his defeat to the 
juggernaut that rolled over Democrats throughout California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wave was out there building against the Democrats, and it came crashing 
down," Umberg said from his election-night headquarters at the Anaheim Hilton 
and Towers hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The former prosecutor, referring to the controversial Klass campaign 
adverstisements attacking the incumbent, said he didn't know whether he should 
have run the race any differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to make a big splash," Umberg said of his unsuccessful media strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren went into the race with a decided edge in crime-fighting machismo. He 
was the attorney general who had frantically beaten back last-minute appeals 
intended to stop the execution of murderer Robert Alton Harris -- the first 
person killed in the San Quentin gas chamber in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the underdog, Umberg, a former prosecutor, gambled on the television ad 
that attempted to do what might have seemed impossible before the race -- tag 
his opponent as soft on crime. Lungren denounced the commercial as flat-out 
wrong, even before it began running. Later, he criticized Umberg for taking 
more than $800,000 in campaign contributions from Indian tribes that were 
battling the attorney general over reservation gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other statewide races, seasoned campaigner and fund-raiser Davis clashed 
for lieutenant governor with little-known and poorly funded Wright. In sharp 
contrast to Wright, Davis is a known quantity to the state's voters. He was 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.'s chief of staff and an assemblyman before 
being twice elected controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of his fellow Democrats, Davis said: "We have to look in the mirror 
and understand the need for public safety" and a good business climate in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In her campaign, Wright tried to raise ethical questions, issuing a booklet 
titled "Gray's Anatomy" that resurrected charges that Davis had used state 
resources to help in a political campaign. But with a commanding lead in public 
opinion polls, Davis generally took the high road, emphasizing his role, for 
example, in persuading Taco Bell Corp. to stay in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Staunch conservative Wright was elected to the state Senate two years ago 
after a 12-year career in the Assembly. She is a former mayor of Simi Valley 
and was making her first bid for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 How the candidates raised campaign money became a major issue in the race for 
insurance commissioner. Quackenbush took most of his campaign cash from the 
insurance industry -- sparking Torres' charges that he would be beholden to the 
companies that he would regulate as commissioner. But Quackenbush countered 
with ads that attacked Torres for taking contributions from industry-tainted 
sources, even though the Democrat had refused contributions from the companies 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates differed over implementing Proposition 103, the 1988 
initiative that promised to hold the line on insurance rates. Torres promised 
to keep in place regulations written by incumbent Commissioner John Garamendi 
to limit rate increases. Quackenbush argued that less regulation would improve 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-fought race for superintendent of public instruction, the only 
nonpartisan statewide post on the ballot, voters had a choice between two 
members of the state's education Establishment. DiMarco vied with Eastin, 
chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, to become the first woman to 
hold the office since its creation in 1849. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin and DiMarco agreed on many issues. They based their campaigns largely 
on touting their backgrounds and qualifications to lead the state's 
$29-billion, 5.2-million-student public education system. DiMarco cited her 23 
years of varied experience, from volunteer in her children's classrooms to 
local board member and consultant to the state superintendent before accepting 
Wilson's job offer in 1991. Eastin cited her community college teaching 
experience, private-industry management job and experience in the Legislature 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high-spending race for treasurer, Angelides, a Sacramento land 
developer, faced off against Republican Fong, the son of former Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu and a member of the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, a lawyer, campaigned on a plan for slashing state government spending 
$2.2 million, which includes many of the reductions called for by Wilson. On 
the equalization board, he negotiated a money-saving court settlement and 
consolidated Los Angeles County offices to cut costs. But his leasing of office 
space from developers who provided him free campaign headquarters provided 
ammunition for Angelides' aggressive attack-style campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides, who got his start in politics working for then-Gov. Jerry Brown, 
promised to turn down requests from the governor and Legislature if they seek 
the treasurer's permission for more state debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his effort to become secretary of state and California's top elections 
officer, Jones ran as one of the principal authors of "three strikes," the 
lock-'em-up measure that increased penalties for repeat criminals. The veteran 
lawmaker faced Miller, who had served as legal counsel and chief deputy to the 
previous occupant of the office, Eu.

AMY BIEHL'S KILLERS GO ON HUNGER STRIKE; PROTEST: THE THREE SOUTH AFRICAN MEN 
CONVICTED OF MURDERING THE NEWPORT BEACH SCHOLAR AND SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS IN 
PRISON ARE DEMANDING POLITICAL AMNESTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The three young men convicted of murdering scholar Amy Biehl of Newport Beach 
have embarked on a hunger strike to demand political amnesty, state radio said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manqina, 22, Mzikhona Nofemela, 19, and Vusumzi Ntamo, 23, were each 
sentenced Oct. 26 to 18 years in prison. Judge Gerald Friedman said they killed 
Biehl simply because she was white. 
</P>
<P>
 SABC radio said Tuesday that the three black men -- all members of the 
militant Pan Africanist Congress, who are being held in prisons near Cape Town 
-- were demanding that their crime be seen as political. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's mother, Linda, said from her Newport Beach home Tuesday that she does 
not support amnesty for her daughter's killers because she does not believe the 
crime was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the three accused, I saw the one particularly that thrust the 
knife up to the hilt in Amy's heart, and he had no remorse. He looked at us 
with pride: 'I did this.' It was not a political crime," Linda Biehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't know Amy as a politician. They didn't even know who she was. In 
Amy's case, it was just, 'Hey, let's get her; she's white.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old Fulbright scholar, Biehl was in South Africa helping to educate 
voters. She was set upon by a mob chanting anti-white slogans on Aug. 25, 1993, 
when she drove black friends home to the impoverished Guguletu township outside 
Cape Town. She was bludgeoned and stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to get attention . . . and working through this," Linda Biehl 
said of her daughter's killers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the three men can demonstrate that their crime was politically motivated, 
admit their guilt and give a full account of their actions, they could qualify 
for amnesty under a bill now before the South African Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's mother said when she visited the townships, residents said they shared 
her belief that her daughter's murder was not politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people we talked to in the townships are not political people; they are 
just normal people who do not view it as a political crime," Linda Biehl said. 
"These people just saw it as a murder. (The attackers) were considered by a lot 
of people as just sort of hooligans. They were not really respected citizens in 
the township. The people in these townships want to see these guys punished. 
They want law and order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they were raised in a system, in a society, where they are termed 
by most sociologists as the lost generation, but there needs to be some kind of 
justice system. They cannot just commit lawless acts under the guise of 
political acts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl said that although she had been aware that the men could seek amnesty, 
the news was another blow to the grieving family. "Isn't it amazing? I thought 
we were almost through with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family traveled to South Africa after their daughter's murder, and Biehl 
said she was given a copy of the amnesty bill during a visit with the country's 
minister of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth defendant, a juvenile, still awaits trial in South Africa.

BEILENSON EDGES PAST GOP'S SYBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), a fixture on the Southern 
California political scene for 30 years, held a small lead over Republican 
Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, in the hotly contested 
24th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Beilenson, 62, seeking his 10th term in office, had been heavily 
besieged by the 42-year-old Sybert, a policy wonk and tenacious competitor who 
spent more than $1 million on his race to unseat the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beilenson-Sybert race has been one of the most closely watched 
congressional contests in the nation ever since Sybert, the former director of 
Wilson's Office of Planning and Research, moved into the district in October, 
1993, and promptly sank a considerable amount of his own wealth into his 
campaign to unseat one of the House of Representatives' top leaders. Beilenson 
is a senior member of the powerful Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The race produced big-ticket spending. When all the bills are counted, the 
combined tab will be $1.2 million or better, with Sybert spending about 
two-thirds of this amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney and businessman, loaned more than $400,000 of his own 
money to his campaign, and he got numerous GOP heavyweights such as U.S. Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kansas) and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) to raise money for him 
at events held throughout the district, from a tony Studio City restaurant to a 
Lake Sherwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Beilenson, who has served continuously as a lawmaker in 
one capacity or another since 1963, tried to portray Sybert as "just another 
typical politician" who accepts "dirty" political action committee 
contributions. Sybert painted the incumbent as a liberal, career politician. "I 
have never run for office before in my life, and my opponent has done nothing 
else," Sybert was fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the campaign did reveal some sharp policy differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert supported Proposition 187, the measure to deny public benefits to 
illegal immigrants, and Beilenson did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would create a litigation nightmare and prove to be 
unconstitutional in the end, Beilenson maintained, while Sybert said the 
controversial measure offered Californians their best chance yet for 
challenging overly liberal government policies and court decisions that extend 
benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalating the immigration debate, Sybert also called for reducing the number 
of legal immigrants allowed annually into the United States and having U.S. 
soldiers double as border patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson touted his support for a measure to double the size of the nation's 
border patrol and his authorship of another measure -- also winning 
congressional approval -- to require the federal government to partially 
reimburse California for the cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 During a half-dozen debates, Beilenson emerged as an almost unequivocal 
supporter of the Clinton Adminstration. His pose defied the conventional wisdom 
that Democratic incumbents should distance themselves from a President whose 
political fortunes have been on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of Reagan-Bush inertia on key domestic policy concerns, Clinton 
and the Democrat-controlled Congress have made tremendous progress by passing a 
crime bill, a national gun-control law, a family leave plan and a meaningful 
deficit-reduction program, Beilenson boasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the difference between night and day," Beilenson told an audience 
in the final days of the campaign as he described the burst of domestic policy 
initiatives approved by Congress since Clinton entered the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Sybert, the Clinton initiatives spelled bad news. The crime bill is 
loaded with expensive and failed social programs while the deficit-reduction 
plan amounts to a huge tax hike that has hit Californians very hard, Sybert 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson fired some of his nastiest and biggest salvos when he 
repeatedly accused Sybert of compromising his integrity by accepting more than 
$60,000 in campaign contributions from special-interest groups, all the while 
reminding voters of his own pledge never to take such money. 
</P>
<P>
 This same Beilenson tactic was widely credited with helping the incumbent 
defeat his 1992 Republican challenger, Tom McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert also failed the character test, Beilenson argued, when he ran a 
lucrative private legal practice on the side while he worked at his 
$98,000-a-year job as a director of the governor's Office of Planning and 
Research. In one year, Sybert earned $140,000 in legal fees by moonlighting, 
Beilenson noted, citing financial disclosure records. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Beilenson maintained, California taxpayers deserved to have 
Sybert giving his state job his undivided attention. But his mailers also 
suggested -- without foundation -- that Sybert's moonlighting had involved a 
"conflict of interest" between his duties as a top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and 
his work for his private legal clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert retorted by producing a letter from Wilson praising Sybert's work ethic 
and an opinion from the state's top ethics officer -- sought by Sybert before 
he began moonlighting -- reiterating that outside work was not illegal per se. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mudslinging battle, Sybert had his own ammunition, including remarks 
Beilenson had once made in 1989 on his indifference to California's problems 
and statements he had made about his strong allegiance to the House speaker, 
and his preference that the budget be balanced by raising taxes, not by cutting 
federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert contended that such remarks betrayed the fact that Beilenson -- after 
18 years in Congress -- has lost touch with his constituents and the world 
outside the Beltway.

 For the record: An item in Tuesday's Daily Report mistakenly said that 
quarterback Rob Johnson's completion percentage, after his 20-for-31 day at 
Washington State last Saturday, had gone up to 67.5%. In fact, his percentage 
actually fell slightly, from 68.2%. EARL GUSTKEY
